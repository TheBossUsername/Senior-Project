        "description": "Runes Way is a deck of 31 hexagonal cards that are designed primarily for playing games in the live action role-playing (LARP) world of Empire which is run by Profound Decisions. Players do not need to know anything about LARP, The Empire or runes to enjoy the games.<br/><br/>Runes Way comes with rules for three quick and simple real-time mini-games designed by The Guild of Good Games called The Way of The Runes, The Runes of The Way and Runic Skein'.  There is a further turn-based solo or cooperative game challenge called Paragon's Path.  The cards can also be combined together into The Runes Way Labyrinth puzzle that forms an elaborate structure with hidden meanings for those who seek its secrets. Finally, the cards may also be used for divination purposes using the Wheel of Meaning method of Rune-Reading.<br/><br/>The Runes Way cards each feature six runes from the world of Empire. One of the runes on each card will match exactly one other rune on any other card - this is a similar feature to that used in the game of Dobble where one symbol on every card matches a symbol on any other card. The Runes Way cards may be placed adjacent to each other to connect matching runes along adjoining edges, enabling cards to be connected into a line - this has similarities to how pieces connect in dominoes.  Since the shapes of many of the runes are very similar, it can be challenging to quickly spot which runes match correctly.<br/><br/>There are 2 similar but slightly different standard editions of the Runes Way deck (the Blood Red Runes Edition and the Empress Lisabetta Memorial Edition).  These may be combined together to increase the number of players who can play the different games, and to add variety and additional challenge to the gameplay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Accurate and easy to play, Glory days College Football brings the big time Saturday afternoon excitement to your table top.  GDCF employs a unique system, Trench Control, to help determine how well each team will perform on any given play.  Just like real life, penalties, turnovers and big plays can add an element of excitement to your game.  Choose from all-time great teams or from season sets.<br/><br/>There are three ways to play the game.  You can play the game entirely in Play-By-Play mode which takes about 90 minutes.  You can play Simulated Drive mode where you simulate the gist of every drive for an abbreviated version which lasts about 30 minutes.  Or you can play a hybrid mode where you can speed through the first half of each drive and grind it in from there.<br/><br/>This game is available in pdf format at this time.  You get the rulebook, charts, and 30 all time great college football teams from which to choose.  All you will need is the ability to print the materials, two d10, 2d6 and a d20.  More team sets will become available in the future so be on the lookout for that.<br/><br/>",

Whilst the rest of Crayne was celebrating the reconnection of the world with the Magic Realm and the subsequent defeat of the Titans, Mindassa came under threat from an an entirely new but ancient enemy. One that had been buried in the sands of the desert and fogotten for over 4000 years.<br/><br/>The Tide of Dust had unsealed their time-worn tombs and released their ancient curses, but without the flow of magic in the world the dead lay dormant. That is until the day Archmage Tymirus completed the Re-weaving and magic was allowed to flow into Crayne once more. Magical energy surged into world and the curse of the Ancients was fueled.<br/><br/>The archaic dead rose from the cracks in their tombs and shambled across the desert in search for the living. As if one invasion wasn't enough another unknown enemy appeared: a swarm of deadly giant citinous insectoids began destroying small villages before any resistance could be mustered.<br/><br/>Were these two new enemies working together? Were The Hive and The Ancients under the guidance of the same mastermind? Was their even a mastermind at all? Or did the sudden world changes awaken both factions, disturbing their rest and rousing their hunger?<br/><br/>Only one thing is certain. The Mindassan lords must muster their forces and fight. Lest they too become just another casualty of history for future scholars to uncover.<br/><br/>Mercenaries of Mindassa expands the Crayne universe by introducing two new factions, both with a unique playstyle, and by adding a new game variant called the Mercenary Market.<br/><br/>The two new factions increases Crayne's replay ability and the Mercenary Market adds a new dimension to the strategy.<br/><br/>There will also be more solo play mission content: Defend the Spires and Expansion of the Hive<br/><br/>The Mercenary Market and both new factions can be played with all variants of Crayne, including solo-play, multiplayer and team play.<br/><br/>",

Every component in the game and every sentence in the rules has been scrutinized. In many ways, version 4 is a totally new game compared to version 3.  <br/>     We have done a lot of streamlining to make the game faster to play, and easier for new players to pick up. This includes removing things that did not work well or were unnecessarily complicated. <br/>     A tremendous amount has been added to the game: an all-new map, revised diplomacy, more balanced units, and enhanced technologies. Everything is now much more integrated. One of the biggest new additions are the &ldquo;in port&rdquo; rules, which will transform the game in many ways.<br/>     In any 3-alliance system, the rules open up possibilities to gaming the system. Although a lot has been done to reduce/eliminate this in version 4, Global War has been designed to be played like gentlemen. As such, it is our hope that players aspire to this, and &ldquo;play the game&rdquo;, instead of &ldquo;playing the rules&rdquo;. The former is a lot more fun!<br/>     Printed on new 13oz vinyl.<br/>     Improved Jungle and Tundra terrain.<br/>     Sea Floor Topography.<br/>     Play aids such as Monroe Doctrine, kamikaze, Objectives, etc printed on the map.<br/>     Sea Zones numbering (Atlantic A1.

When the player feels they are ready for battle (which can happen at any time), they start battling bosses at the henchmen level and work their way up through the agents and finally to the principalities.<br/><br/>To battle a boss, a player uses their deck to play cards adding up strength points, similar to a game of war against a target number.  A player wins a battle if the strength points are equal to or greater than the boss's strength and have not played an auto-loss card that they could not negate.<br/><br/>Players may call upon allies for support and continue to upgrade as they press through battles.  Enemies will grow stronger.  The first player to redeem 3 henchmen, redeem 2 agents, and banish 2 principalities is the winner.<br/><br/>It is a race, so go, fight, win!<br/><br/>-description by Joe of Meek Heroes Gaming'<br/><br/>",

As their hands dwindle, players will also have to play cards that help the other side, timing  it strategically to minimize their own casualties. The teams alternate being the Attacker, mirroring the back-and-forth nature of the Verdun battles, bringing costly decision-making to the table. Every card played has consequences, and every round is a tension-filled challenge.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/><br/>A game of Verdun consists of 1 to 3 Rounds. Before the first Round, each team secretly organizes one of their Assets behind each or their five Fortifications. Then each player receives a hand of 12 cards, which they then play in a series of 12 tricks. In each trick, each team tries to minimize Casualties on their side while protecting their Assets and Fortifications. A team scores points for Overrunning the opponent&rsquo;s fortifications and capturing their Assets and for protecting their own Fortifications and Assets. And each team loses points for their Casualties. After three Rounds, the team with the most points (or whose score is the least negative) wins.<br/><br/>",

In this merciless dice game, you'll have to fight to survive or to feed yourself if by some misfortune you find yourself infected.<br/><br/>Rolling Dead is a game of dice combinations, speed and self-control. At the start of the game, everyone chooses their colour and starts as a human with the associated dice. A virus die is rolled and determines who will be the first infected in the game. If you become infected, you turn into a zombie and swap your dice.<br/><br/>When the first person is infected, the dice combinations determine who attacks and who defends. The attacking zombie or human must quickly touch (or slap) the hand of the target. If a human is hit, they become a zombie. If a zombie is hit, they are eliminated. But there's no room for error; if a player removes their hand for no reason, hit the wrong target or attack when not supposed to, they go from human to zombie and from zombie to permanent death.<br/><br/>The last human standing is declared the winner. Zombies can also win by being the last ones standing, in which case they decide whether they share the victory or go hungry again and become cannibals to the last survivor.<br/><br/>",

Just like in football, based on actions built to get to the shot, Kick Off will allow you to score goals through combination of cards. The mixing of these two mechanisms, choosing the right cards to play with unpredictable reactions makes for a tense and engaging game. The Deluxe edition provides a multitude of new options, cards, and variant, which provide players with new paths to victory.<br/><br/>Match the cards to shoot, score a goal and get the famous Poker, that is, 4 goals. Each player will be able to choose the best cards to get to the shot, trying not to let the action be intercepted by the opponent. The player who starts the action is the Attacker, while the other is the Defender. The playable offensive cards are Action Cards and Special Cards, and each of them increases the opportunity to play the Shot Card and score a goal. Each offensive card corresponds to one or more defense cards which allow the defender to recover the ball and become the new attacker, as if a counterattack were triggered. To get to the Shot, the Attacker must play 3 cards consecutively without being intercepted by the Defender. To avoid the goal, the Defender can play the Block Card and start the action again as the new Attacker. Kick Off also allows you to combine Action Cards and Special Cards to create lethal actions. Each Special Card allows the Attacker to get to the shot more easily and, in some cases, to bypass the opponent&rsquo;s ability to intercept cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shards of Alkemae may be played at three different levels, Novice, Apprentice, and Master. Game play remains essentially the same, but rules change from level to level.  Regardless of level, players take turns laying down tiles to form the game board and move their game pieces about the board, trying to lay claim to regions worth the most points.<br/> The tiles (based on Penrose tiles) are of two types, kites and darts, which fit together to form a quasi-symmetric  tessellation. A gold kite serves as the centerpiece and entryway for game pieces to move onto the playing area. Sixty kites and thirty-six darts are placed into separate bags, from which players draw blindly to begin their turns.  Represented on each tile face is one of the following elements: earth, air, fire, or water.  Additionally, there are twelve &ldquo;wild-card&rdquo; kites, which can serve as any of the four elements.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game by drawing a tile from each bag and setting them in front of the player, one face up, one face down.  On a turn, a player draws a tile from either bag and sets it down adjacent to the tiles already placed. A player may place the tile drawn, either tile in front of that player, or any &ldquo;face-up&rdquo; tile from another player. Judicious tile placement  usually  results in the formation of one of seven geometric patterns, called &ldquo;shards&rdquo;, which are named: ace, deuce, jack, queen, king, star, or sun. Any player completing one of these shards receives a token representing the shard formed. After placing a tile to form a shard, the player then advances one of four playing pieces (in the shapes of chemical glassware) onto the game board.<br/><br/>As players place more tiles, the game board grows, and like-colored regions of each of the elements form.  Players accumulate shards which may be turned in for gold &ldquo;transmuting stones&rdquo;, which are then used by a player to lay claim to a region (any contiguous grouping of like-colored tiles). Players try to move their game pieces into regions and lay claim to one region of each element before the other players.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player claims one region of each element, or all the tiles have been placed on the board. Two key components of a winning strategy are prediction (determining  where wealthy regions will form) and risk/benefit analysis (choosing whether to claim smaller regions early or wait until they grow into more prosperous ones as the board grows).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gnomistic is a competitive game of tactics, strategy, hand management, set collection and other various mechanisms for 1 to 6 players.<br/><br/>SHORT OVERVIEW:<br/>Imagine that you and your friends are on an excursion in a forest in Ireland, when suddenly, someone yells &ldquo;I have seen a gnome!&rdquo;. Now, a magical wave of greed controls your mind and the only thing that matters is getting the gnome's pot of gold at any cost, so you must guide yourself from the correct signs on the way to get it.<br/><br/>Play different signal cards on the correct path when the time is right and if it pairs with another matching card, you get them all. This will cause you to have a lot of cards in your play area (a lot, and it feels strange and satisfying!), but you will need even more to be able to complete the positive sets and avoid the negative ones, and then save those cards in the only safe place where no one can take them away: your chest. But be careful, you should also be aware of the right time to save them, because bad things can happen if you save too soon, if you miss the perfect opportunity or if you accidentally complete negative sets, if you run out of coins or if someone uses magic cards against you ... And if the latter happens, don't worry ... maybe you can get revenge sooner than you think and with twice the strength.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rally Round the Flag &ndash; Division Command is an operational game pitting the Union and Confederate Armies against each other during the three days of the Battle of Gettysburg. Each side is represented by each of the Army, Corps and Division Commanders at the Battle of Gettysburg and the Brigades under their command. Take control of the Confederate Army and use their consolidated command structure to try and wrest control of Gettysburg from the Union.<br/><br/>Or, take control of the Union Army and work to delay the Confederates long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Can the Union survive the confusion of command before Meade can arrive with the Army artillery reserves? Can Lee push forward far enough on the first day to sustain his position for the second and third days? Can you win the Battle of Gettysburg and decide the fate of the American Civil War?<br/><br/>The Division Command level is designed with the ability to take and hold ground. This is represented by controlling the critical road network surrounding the town of Gettysburg. This is accomplished by taking control of specific points along the roads called &ldquo;March Circles,&rdquo; and thus scoring Victory Points.<br/><br/>A standard Division Command level game covering all three days of the Battle of Gettysburg can be played in about 8-12 hours. Victory occurs either when you force your opponent&rsquo;s army to retreat, or you have the majority of the 43 Victory Points by the end of the game. You force your opponent to retreat by having double their amount of Victory Points at the end of a day of battle, thus earning a decisive victory.<br/><br/>Rally Round the Flag &ndash; Division Command can also be played as a Campaign Manager within the Rally Round the Flag &ndash; Brigade Command game. This allows the Division Command game to act as a &ldquo;campaign battle generator,&rdquo; creating tactical battles that can be played in 2 to 3 hours, skipping past unnecessary actions and combats in the Brigade Command system and shaving a 40 to 60 hour long game down to 25 hours or less.<br/><br/>While Rally Round the Flag was painstakingly designed with historical accuracy at its heart, the outcome of the game is not predetermined. The design reflects the tactical, organizational, and operational limits of both Union and Confederate armies and their generals, but how you manage them is up to you. In this battle, your decisions make the difference.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Age of Monarchs is a multiplayer card-driven grand strategy game simulating the three centuries of the Modern Age, from Columbus' discovery of America in 1492 to the fall of the Bastille in 1789. Players represent the highest rungs of European monarchy, assuming the leadership of a major European Power, and struggling to achieve global supremacy over the world in the Age of Absolutism. Being an absolute monarch, each player must manage every kind of question: economic, political, diplomacy, trade, world wide exploration, colonization, religion and warfare.<br/><br/>Age of Monarchs is designed to offer an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by more than 160 strategy cards that simulate the most outstanding historical events and force players to face constantly the toughest challenges that occurred during the three centuries covered by the game timeline.<br/><br/>The game offers a wide set of short scenarios and a Grand Campaign 1492-1789, spanning 20 turns, that put the most powerful European nations into a never-ending struggle for world domination.<br/><br/>The complete list of Scenarios:<br/><br/>&bull; 1492-1559 Age of Exploration<br/>&bull; 1560-1618 Wars of Religion<br/>&bull; 1619-1667 Thirty Years War<br/>&bull; 1668-1730 Age of Absolutism<br/>&bull; 1698-1789 Wars of Supremacy<br/><br/>In Age of Monarchs players take the role of the absolute monarch of a Major Power. Monarchs are represented by Strategy Cards that reproduce historical characters (plus some generic ones), each with special abilities that affect game rules. The game manages also the aging of monarchs, and their replacement by new monarchs, crowned after their predecessor is dead, thus allowing players to handle a line of succession in the monarchy of their Powers.<br/><br/>Strategy Cards are the core of the game. They provide Command Points that allow players to perform all Game Actions, but they also introduce the most outstanding historical events of the Modern Age, such as the Protestant Reformation, the Wars of Religion, the birth of Holland (United Provinces), the Eighty Years war with Spain, the rise and decline of the Portuguese and Spanish colonial empires, the Thirty Years War, the rush of the Russian Empire to Siberia, the Great Northern Wars, the growth of the Ottoman Empire, the wars with Christianity, the Wars of Succession, the birth of the USA, and many more.<br/><br/>Game Actions allow players to perform activities in all spheres. To summarize a few:<br/><br/>Warfare: the game has a light military system. Players can rapidly move or redeploy forces, engage land battles, resolve sieges and naval combats. Supply mechanics are very simple. Leaders play a fundamental role in game-play, either as Generals, Admirals or Conquistadors.<br/>Diplomacy: many Minor Nations are present in the game. All players can influence these Minors to get Alliances and Vassals, benefiting from their military support during conflicts.<br/>Exploration, Colonization and Trade: the game recreates the race of the Powers to build Colonial Empires all over the world. New colonies bring income from the exploitation of exotic resources and gold. The game allows players to affect the prices of exotic goods in order to speculate on price fluctuations as well. Gold can have a strong impact on the European economy due to Inflation!<br/>Economy: players must pay attention to the budget of their Powers. At the end of each turn, players perform some short and rapid calculations to determine the budget balance of their Monarchies, based on revenues (taxes, colonial incomes, trade) and costs (maintenance of forces). The game has also the concept of Prosperity, measuring the richness of each Power, strongly affected by the length and outcome of wars.<br/><br/>Game overview:<br/><br/>&bull; Complexity: 6 / 10<br/>&bull; Game length: 5+ hours<br/>&bull; Number of players: 3-6<br/>&bull; Time scale: about 10 years per turn<br/>&bull; Solitaire suitability: low<br/><br/>",

You've spent the last two years on Alarria, a small terrestrial planet several light-years from Earth. You've been studying the diverse indigenous fauna, and your field research has already yielded some incredible results. However, your days as a simple scientific researcher are about to end.<br/><br/>An asteroid roughly the size of a small country has been picked up on radar hurtling towards Alarria &mdash; a planet killer. If something isn't done soon, the planet itself might cease to exist. Three distinct plans have been set into motion, each with a razor thin chance of succeeding:<br/><br/><br/>    A powerful laser is tracking the asteroid's approach and will fire as soon as it comes within range in hopes of reducing it to a mere pebble.<br/>    An energy shield might be just enough to deflect the approaching asteroid, altering its course and saving Alarria.<br/>    In a final desperate attempt to preserve some of the unique species of the planet, an evacuation plan has been ordered. The nearby forest moon, Fortuna, has been tested and can support life, and thankfully it's out of the blast zone. You just need to move as many of the species as possible before impact.<br/><br/><br/>Your research work has been put on hold as the greatest minds on the planet have been recruited to develop the three plans. Time is running out as each second brings the asteroid closer to Alarria. Where will you focus your efforts? Which plan has the best chance to succeed? There's no time to waste...<br/><br/>How to Save a World is a worker-placement game with hand-building and resource management. Each turn, you assign workers to perform critical tasks or spend action cards to help advance your goals. At the end of each round, the projects will be assessed and the asteroid will move ever closer.

        "description": "La Bataille de Sch&ouml;ngrabern 1805 , which was made famous in Leo Tolstoy&rsquo;s War and Peace,  recreates the fight between French Imperial Prince Joachim Murat&rsquo;s advance guard, having just taken Vienna from the Austrians, and the Russian rear guard led by General Peter Bagration, Bagration was desperately trying to buy enough time for Prince Mikhail Kutuzov to unite two separated parts of his large Russian-Austrian army in the maneuvering before the Battle of Austerlitz.<br/><br/><br/>Murat has dallied for a few days after his capture of Vienna, trying to accomplish victory through diplomacy and trickery rather than force of arms, and the Russians used Murat&rsquo;s vanity to keep the formerly hard-pressing French from catching the spread-out Russian forces in detail.  The result is a small but sharp battle on November 16, 1805 which allowed the Russians enough time to unite their armies.<br/><br/>La Bataille de Sch&ouml;ngrabern 1805 includes more than 100 counters, representing both the French Imperial forces and such leaders as Oudinot and Suchet; and the Russian rearguard represented by counters for Bagration; assorted Russian Cossacks, Austrian Hussars and Russian Jaegers.  There are two 11 X17 maps, with much of the territory taken up by the extensive vineyards.  <br/>The Sch&ouml;ngrabern Special Rules feature a &quot;La Bataille&quot; first combat in the vineyards, which makes this game very different from any other La Bataille game.  There is also a commemorative essay about Marshal Murat&rsquo;s efforts and the battle itself.<br/><br/>",

The disease slowly consumes his body and soul, twisting him into madness. Banes, corrupted monsters of the Rot, roam unchecked. In response, the Great Clans have called on their Heroes to claim the throne. The Heroes will need to undertake Quests across the land to gain Experience, collect Treasures, and recruit Followers if they hope to slay the King. Or, if their exploits can earn them sufficient Prestige in the eyes of the Armellians, they may win the crown outright!<br/><br/>In Armello: The Board Game, players take on the roles of Heroes to quest, battle, and employ a bit of trickery to gain Prestige and become the new ruler of Armello!<br/><br/>Armello is in part a deck builder, meaning each Hero starts with their own deck of cards and adds to it over the course of the game.<br/><br/>It is also an area control game, as Heroes travel across the map to stake their claim on Settlements and complete Quests.<br/><br/>In addition to building a deck and exploring the map, Heroes will take part in battles by rolling dice. Gaining additional dice to roll and card effects that manipulate them will help you overcome your opponents in battle.<br/><br/>Your success in Armello is determined by Prestige. Prestige can be earned by completing Quests and winning battles. There are 2 paths to victory: Regicide Victory (reach 30  Prestige, then enter the Palace and slay the King) and Proclamation Victory (Win immediately when you reach 70 Prestige).<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re already familiar with the Armello video game, that&rsquo;s great!

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>During the brief period between 1906 and 1914, so the story goes, Britain and Germany engaged in a furious naval arms race sparked by the launch of the Royal Navy&rsquo;s revolutionary battleship Dreadnought. This rivalry, egged on in Germany by Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, then helped ignite the First World War.<br/><br/>As usual, reality is a little more complicated than popular history. Tirpitz&rsquo;s enemy lay not across the North Sea but rather in the War Ministry offices just on the other side of the Brandenburger Tor. Army and Navy battled furiously for funding, inventing, respectively, the (possibly mythical) Schlieffen Plan and the Risk Theory (less mythical, but just as detached from reality) to justify ever-higher levels of spending. In the event, neither got what they wanted: the Navy did not build a new class of dreadnoughts every fiscal year, nor did the Army get to muster two dozen new divisions to &ldquo;reinforce the right.&rdquo;<br/><br/>But what if Tirpitz had won his real battle? Germany had the financial and industrial resources to build a fleet to challenge the British. What might this fleet have looked like, and how would it have stood up to the Grand Fleet in battle?<br/><br/>High Seas Fleet is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series that studies this question with background essays, over two dozen new scenarios, and 70 new scorchless, sootless laser-cut playing pieces. It is not playable by itself; you&rsquo;ll need our Jutland game (and only our Jutland game) to play the scenarios. You can, of course, just read the essays and fondle the pieces without owning Jutland. We won&rsquo;t tell.<br/><br/>New pieces include German battleships designed but never built: the 1904 semi-dreadnought, the 1905 dreadnought, the 1912 dreadnought with 13.8-inch main guns, and the repeat Baden class super-dreadnoughts. There are additional cruisers and battleships to fill out the classes of the German program, and the full Bl&uuml;cher class of six armored cruisers.<br/><br/>This is a powerful fleet that can stand toe-to-toe with the British Grand Fleet &ndash; the fleet the propagandists boasted of but Tirpitz feared to actually build. Now you can lead it into battle.<br/><br/>",

This is a game about how elections can be shaped by money.<br/><br/>Players are secretly assigned to one of two teams &mdash; Citizen or Super PAC &mdash; and compete to elect candidates through strategic donations. Super PAC players know each other and can corrupt politicians with their donations, so it&rsquo;s up to Citizens to figure out who the Super PAC players are and work around them to elect honest politicians and keep democracy healthy.<br/><br/>Every round, all players draw 2 money cards from the bank and publicly donate a money card to one of the candidates. All money donated by Super PAC players secretly counts as dark money. When a candidate receives enough money to be funded, players learn whether the candidate was &quot;resisted&quot; (a point for the Citizens) or &quot;corrupted&quot; (i.e. enough dark money was donated to corrupt the candidate - a point for the Super PACs).<br/><br/>Super PACs win if they corrupt half the candidates.

One player commands the Allied (US and Australian) forces and the other the Japanese. Victory is obtained by destroying the opposing fleets, landing invasion forces, or bringing supplies to beleaguered beachheads. <br/> Solomon Sea is a double blind 2-player game, which means each player moves his task forces, air strikes, and search planes on his own map, and tells the other player about the hexes he searches. Combat is resolved by a series of dice rolls. Each hex represents a diameter of 100 nautical miles, with 3 hours per turn. Each counter represents 6 to 10 planes, individual carries, or groups of smaller ships. Four scenarios are included: Coral Sea, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz, and Guadalcanal. <br/> Solomon Sea won the 2000 Charles S. Roberts award for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame.<br/><br/>",

Though the rules are extremely simple (three minutes to learn for most players), the number of possible moves and interactions are comparable to chess.<br/><br/>Kruzno uses standard chess pieces (bishops, knights and rooks) but is more closely related to hexagonal checkers and R.C. Bell's Jungle Game. Like the Jungle Game, capturing is non-transitive: bishops capture knights; knights capture rooks; rooks capture bishops. This split between offense and defense means that most standard strategies of move and capture have to be scrapped or reworked.<br/><br/>Game variants include versions with reduced number of pieces for faster play and expansion sets for three players.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.kruzno.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.kruzno.com/</a><br/><br/>",

However, games may be played on any appropriate surface, although the standard is a 1 metre by 2 metre tabletop decorated with model scenery in scale with the miniatures. Any individual or group of miniatures in the game is called a &quot;Playing Piece&quot;, whether represented by a single model, or group of similar troops.<br/><br/>Three Plains is largely set on the Middle Plain, on the World of 'Many' Names, so called because no race will acknowledge any of the other races titles. Although all have a word for &lsquo;Many&rsquo; and over the years Many has become the bilingual name for their World. The World of Many much resembles an ancient earth long past, with warlords running amuck and empires throwing their weight around and there are some great individuals, who are commonly known as Hero&rsquo;s, Lords and Wizards who face each other on the field of battle usually fighting to the death. This world also has its share of Beasts too, Dragons, Ogres, Wyverns and hundreds more roam and terrorise the lands of Many plaguing the younger races.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki<br/><br/>Not a minion at all, but a suit of armour resurrected at the whim of its master. Izamu is an ancient blood thirsty warlord that lived during the old days of the Katanaka clan that Yan Lo was also a member of. Today, he is called upon by Yan Lo to bring death to all those that oppose him.<br/><br/>Izamu's mobility is pretty unimpressive with a bog standard 4/6 move/charge and only one mobility trick to speak of which is Shove Aside (allows Izamu to nove through ht1 and 2 models). He does have a very respectable 3&quot; melee range though. He also benefits greatly from mobility tricks given by other models, be it the Soul Porter with Empower Ancestor, Toshiro with Tenki no Juden or Molly and Imbue Vigor.<br/><br/>Now we are cooking with gas! Izamus is a melee monster packing Melee Expert, a base + to all his damage flips, a respectable combat of 6 on a range 3 weapon and a very nice damage spread of 3/4/6. That damage spread is his edge compared to the dead rider, Izamu can nuke a most low mid cost models in one severe strike. He also has a cute trigger with his Daodao that lets his weapon be considered magical if you get a tome which is nice since it's a suit ressers don't use much and is always nice to have that possibility when facing spirit heavy crews.<br/><br/>Ironically, Izamu does not even have an armour rating. Instead he is an Object 2, which is actually better. This means he is reducing 2 damage from anything heading his way unless it ignores object and for now, very few things actually do that. His tankiness doesn't end there, he is also immune to influence, so WP strikes do nothing against him. He is able to nullify enemy triggers if he cheats fate on his defense and resist flips, the suit of the card he uses to cheat will not cause any of the triggers the enemy may be packing, so Lady Justice getting you down? cheat with a Ram and yeah, you may be taking the hit, but there is no onslaught or critical strike going in with it.<br/><br/>",

With over 270 million citizens, the BMP is a huge durocrete jungle, teeming with life and motion. Finding the Fury arena is a task in itself. But, once you find it, you&rsquo;ll be amazed! The dome boasts ancient Indian architecture, holographic and genetically engineered flora and fauna, and flaming doom!<br/><br/>Fury&rsquo;s owners not only genetically engineered their team, they also genetically engineered plants to impede everyone in the pit. These neovines are attracted to movement, crawling and writhing to tangle those who run by.<br/><br/>The Jungle is an arena board for Slaughterball.<br/><br/>Special rules:<br/>While in the Fury pit, the following rules apply:<br/><br/>Entangling vines: The first time an athlete tries to leave an entangling space during a Move action, the athlete must make an Agility test. If the athlete does not get 2 or more knives, he trips and falls down in that space. This ends his movement and no points are scored. Entangling spaces are indicated by the green leaf in the center of a space.<br/><br/>Fireblast: Every coach gains this ability while in the Fury pit.<br/><br/>At irregular intervals, the meat grinder and the launchers belch forth great gouts of flame! At any time except during  an action, any coach can sacrifice an Interrupt card call forth such a conflagration from the meat grinder or any one specified launcher.<br/><br/>",

Whomever creates the most magnificent masterpiece will be appointed Royal Tailor!<br/><br/>King&rsquo;s Cloak is a card game for 2-6 players. Each player constructs a cloak from 15 cards over the course of the game. Playing adjacent cards of the same suit gives a multiplicative score bonus. At the end, the player with the highest-scoring cloak wins!<br/><br/>A unique mechanic, the &quot;King's Favor&quot;, allows a player to steal a card from the other tailors.  However, once used, the Favor passes to the player whose card was stolen, to compensate their loss.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplayEach player starts the game with four cards and discards one, in secret, out of the game. On your turn, you both draw a card from the deck and receive a card from the prior player. The first player takes one fewer card on their first turn, but begins the game with the King's Favor, which allows them to steal a card from another player.<br/><br/>Each turn you must choose one card from your hand to sew into your cloak in one of 15 locations, connected to an already-sewn piece of cloth. Strategic placement of cards and careful hand management are the keys to success. Adjacent cards of the same suit multiply their values, whereas adjacent cards of different suits sum their values. You must watch out for the special cuts of cloth with negative values, however. They will boost your score if you place them next to each other, turning the negative values positive, but decrease your score if you don't plan carefully.<br/><br/>After sewing a card into your cloak, you pass a different card than the one you received on to the next player. You'll want to try to keep the best cards for yourself and also avoid passing cards that will help the player after you. Similarly, you'll want to avoid helping the player with the King's Favor, who can steal the card you pass out of turn. But beware, you may not always have the option to avoid helping your opponents.<br/><br/>The game ends when all players have completed their cloaks.  Scoring is conducted by multiplying values of adjacent cards of the same suit and summing the results.  The player with the highest-scoring cloak wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hebrac's Dungeon is an RPG card game for one player designed by Luc Miron. It uses two or more decks of standard playing cards, a pencil, paper, and copy of the rule book for reference. You play as an unnamed adventurer who enters the deadly dungeon of Hebrac the sorcerer to defeat bloodthirsty creatures and recover four legendary treasures.<br/><br/>The game begins by shuffling the deck and laying cards down in piles of two within a 4x4 tableau. Each pair represents a room of the dungeon with a human or creature guardian concealing a treasure beneath. Each card of the deck is assigned unique properties based upon its position as guardian or treasure. Guardians include warriors, magicians, and demons to be fought, other adventurers who can be battled or bartered with, black and white priestesses who can harm or heal, steal from or reward you, merchants, and Hebrac himself. Treasures include magical objects that increase your stats, potions to heal your wounds, and various prisoners that can be released for reward or ruin.<br/><br/>You begin at one of the four corners of the dungeon and play through adjacent cards by turning them over and resolving them one by one by battling creatures using the deck and 15 maximum life points for resolution, bartering with gems collected from treasure cards, or casting spells, also collected from treasure cards.<br/><br/>You may progress to the next dungeon once half of the cards have been cleared. The game ends by dying in battle or successfully finding all four aces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>HMS Leopard saw service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and was active in Europe, East Indies and Egypt. In 1807, a group of British sailors &ndash; some of American birth &ndash; deserted and joined the crew of USS Chesapeake. Captain Humphreys, commanding Leopard, requested permission to search for the deserters. Chesapeake&rsquo;s captain refused, and Leopard opened fire, capturing the American ship. Humphreys took back four deserters and hanged the British&ndash;born ones. This incident was one of several episodes that increased the tension between the British Empire and the United States, finally exploding in the War of 1812.<br/><br/>This ship pack can also be used to represent the British Portland Class &ldquo;HMS Leopard 1790.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

The orbits are further divided into regions of varying economic and strategic value. Additionally, there are 5 transit hubs which facilitate jumping between orbits. The  object of the game is to eliminate the other players through conquest or, alternatively, to successfully monopolize all transit hubs for an economic victory.<br/><br/>Holding regions of space are the source of income in the game. The value of regions can be increased by constructing and upgrading space stations. To protect valuable regions, force fields may be constructed. Isolating regions behind force fields, however, diminishes their economic output. A player must, therefore, strike a careful balance between security and trade.<br/><br/>Players may attack adjacent regions with their fleets of space ships. There are three types of space ships in Sunship. Combat is played out on special cards on which the placement of space ships is significant. Depending on the type of ship, the player may select difficult to hit positions, cloak their attack, or attack from the rear. The combat system is elegant, versatile, and based on basic bit math.<br/><br/>",

The game is a quirky and fun variation of the popular 'shithead'. It has unique cards with a colourful design and the game has new exciting rules.<br/><br/>Played in groups from 2 to 5, the players try to get rid of their cards first to win. Each player is dealt three cards face down and three cards face up on top of them. Another three cards become the player's hand. The players take turns clockwise and play al least one card equal to or higher than the last card on the discard pile. They may play multiple cards of the same rank at once. If a player cannot play a card, he must pick up the discard pile and add it to his hand.<br/><br/>In the first stage of the game players play with the cards in their hand and replenish their hand with cards from the stock pile (to three). Once the stock pile and a player's hand is empty, the player may begin playing his face up cards and thereafter his face down cards one by one. At this point the game starts to become very strategic.<br/><br/>The game contains wildcards that may be played on every card and there are cards that activate a special action such as 'skip a turn' or 'play a card lower' (instead of higher). The &frac12; card is the twist of the game. It can be combined with the cards 3&frac12;, 6&frac12; and 9&frac12; to form a new rank (4, 7 or 10) and activate a corresponding action.<br/><br/>To play an extra fast and exciting game there is a short version of the game for 2 or 3 player in which some cards can be removed.<br/><br/>",

Western sources call it the &ldquo;Second Sino-Japanese War&rdquo;; in China, it is the &ldquo;War of Resistance&rdquo;; and in Japan, it is blandly referred to as &ldquo;the China Incident.&rdquo;<br/><br/>China&rsquo;s War: 1937-1941 examines the first five years of the conflict, when China stood alone against the Japanese Empire. Each player takes the role of a Faction seeking to attack or defend the Republic of China: the aggressive Japanese, the harried Government (represented by the Nationalist party), the rebellious Chinese Communist Party, or the unruly, fractious Warlords who are obedient when convenient but have their eye on gaining state power.<br/><br/>Using military, political, and economic actions and exploiting various events, players build and maneuver forces to influence or control the population, extract resources, or otherwise achieve their Faction&rsquo;s aims. A deck of cards regulates turn order, events, victory checks, and other processes. The rules can run non-player Factions, enabling solitaire, 2-player, or multi-player games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Bagration - The Death of Army Group Center June-July 1944.<br/><br/>From the back of the game:<br/>The Minsk-Moscow Highway, Belorussia, 23 June 1944:<br/>The 16th Guards Rifle Division was one of three heavily reinforced infantry divisions that were to create holes in the German lines and allow tank forces of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps of the 5th Tank Army to make rapid and deep penetrations along the Moscow-Minsk Highway. The zone of the 16th was south of the highway, and along the Smolensk-Minsk Railroad. They were reinforced with the following units: 148th Tank Regiment (PT mineroller tanks), 63rd Guards Heavy Tank Regiment (KVs), 517th Tank Regiment (FT tanks), elements of several Self-Propelled Artillery Regiments, 2nd Guards Assault Engineer-Sapper Brigade, as well as numerous towed artillery units. The Soviet forces trained as a combined arms team prior to the attack, and were well prepared. In most sectors of Army Group Center, the Germans had relatively thin lines, and most armor and heavy artillery was stripped to defend expected areas of attack. The area of the highway had seen much heavy fighting in the winter of 1943-44, and the Germans expected an attack to come in this direction. When German intelligence detected the buildup of artillery and armored forces, as well as the movement of ammunition, their reaction was to ensure forces in this area retained significant combat strength. The 78th Sturm Division, already the most powerful &lsquo;infantry&lsquo; division in Army Group Center, maintained its structure which included the 189th Assault Gun Battalion (StuG), a Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion (PzJgIII/IVs), 5th Nebelwerfer Battalion (120mm Mortars), and Army Antiaircraft Battalion 293 (mix of 88s/20s).

        "description": "サイクル (PSYCLE) is a psychological card game from Japan. Players try to win rounds by playing their higher value cards. But the lower cards are cheaper to get, and give more victory points. Can players out-think their opponents and win rounds at lower cost?<br/><br/>The cards have numbers and stars; high cards have few stars, low cards have more stars. Players each choose a card in secret and then reveal them. Mostly, the highest number will win the round, but some low cards will beat a higher value (so a 1 beats a 0 and a 5). Hence, the round has a rock-scissors-paper resolution.<br/><br/>The winning card gets points by multiplying the card's stars by the number of players beaten. So a high card might win, but not get many points. If a player can win with a low card, they gain a much higher score.<br/><br/>Players can also collect resource tokens (spent by playing some cards), and win bonus tiles from the centre. The game turns on being able to predict what other players will do, and maximise your scoring by winning with a low card, or collecting bonuses when you can't win.<br/><br/>The game comes with JPN/ENG rules.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Resolve: Resolve all effects still in play then check for the win condition.<br/><br/>3. Recover: Recharge Actions, discard any unwanted and cards over the hand limit.<br/><br/>4. Draw: Draw back up to the hand limit.<br/><br/>While Card Bard can be played with the pre-constructed decks, much of the depth comes when players construct original decks. Each deck must contain exactly 31 cards, including their Bard and no more than three copies of any card, by name. Within these guidelines, any combination of song and composition cards can be used. The Bard card is a special card that your deck revolves around. Bards determine what types of cards you can play. All cards in your deck must either match your Bard&rsquo;s instrumental mastery type or be of a neutral type. Bards also have special effects that can be used by paying the costs associated with them, listed on the card.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Story driven missions are designed for 1 to 4 players as individual commanders or teams. You&rsquo;ll encounter asteroids, defense stations, powerful automated enemies, and many other surprises. Choose your faction, crew, ships and modules... then embark!<br/><br/>Through a unique physics based mechanic, players control where their ship will be by manipulating their vector token with a navigation action. Each ship has unique handling characteristics that make this an exciting part of gameplay.<br/><br/>Depending on the mission and mode (solo, co-op, competitive), each player controls a faction with 1 to 3 ships per faction, for a set number of rounds, or until a particular objective is completed. Within a round, each player will take turns activating ships by placing crew members in navigation, module or specialist crew action slots. After crews have been assigned, the player will move their ship on the tactical board the number of hexes and direction indicated by their vector token on the vector board. Before, during or after movement, players trigger crewed actions by spending energy and then exhausting that crew.<br/><br/>Your ships will be well equipped to explore, defend or attack with modules including weapons, defense systems, scanners, support and specialist crews. In the core game, each of the 3 ship classes possess unique strengths of their creator factions and are further customized by the player during mission setup. There are 18 modules and 12 specialist crews available to choose from in the core game. Each ship class can hold a limited number of modules and crew. Module and crew selection depends on the mission, and could include drafting, budget, free-for-all or recommended load-outs.<br/><br/>Whether you enjoy solo, co-op or competitive story driven missions, skirmish or building your own scenarios, Velocity: Vanguard has almost endless replay-ability.<br/><br/>",

As an eligible prince to the throne, how will you win over the emperor&rsquo;s heart? Will you manage political affairs, lead military campaigns, or undermine your opponent with schemes? One thing you know for sure, this war of crown will end with you on the throne, blood shed or not.<br/><br/>Essentially it is a Roundel game where the players move their pawn on the Chang&rsquo;an city in a clockwise manner. The locations let the players (princes) gain gold from the emperor, use the gold to recruit the most basic resources which are the subordinates (followers, military units and spies), then using these &ldquo;resources&rdquo; to creat network with the Character Cards (Ministers, Concubines and Generals), which in turn gives the players Political influences, Military influences and Scheme abilities for which the players will be able to use them to gain Victory Points by completing Emperors Tasks, go on military campaigns and sabotage each other. The player with most VP wins the game.<br/><br/>Alternatively, players could try to coup the other players. It&rsquo;s a risky move that involves drawing random cubes from your own plot bag (that you try to manage throughout the game). If successful, you win the game instantaneously, however if you fail, you lost the game.<br/><br/>",

The collection features 24 old abstract strategy games from all over the world, such as ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Africa, the Far East, North- and Central America, and Europe.<br/><br/>Pierrot, the author, wanted to make his book playable, therefore it was designed to provide large, hard cardboard surfaces, and the pawns and dice were supplied as punch board attachments.

        "description": "Welcome to the World of AMRTAKA (The Battle for Eternal Life).<br/><br/>In this game, you will be a mighty warrior battling for a magical potion known as AMRTAKA. This game is designed for 2-4 players. Each player has their own kingdom with just a few possessions and soldiers. Your goal is to take control of islands in a vast cosmic ocean and fight for your people to grant them immortality. This will enable you to rule over those islands forever as an immortal leader.<br/><br/>Game Explanation<br/><br/>Hello there!<br/><br/>In this thrilling narrative, a formidable deity possesses the ability to bestow eternal life. This divine being concocts a distinctive elixir named Amrtaka, which confers everlasting life upon those who partake in it. The deity imparts the coveted recipe to a select group of ten devoted followers, instructing them in the art of crafting this extraordinary potion. Numerous kingdoms undertake epic quests to gain control of the islands where these ten loyal followers produce Amrtaka. Their objective? To achieve immortality for themselves as well!<br/><br/>Let's start by looking at the game board. It has ten special places, each connected to one of god followers. They're the ones who make and share a magical potion. Every time it's your turn, one of these special followers moves a bit on their path.<br/><br/>But, something interesting happens on the 11th turn. The followers move again, and this time, they reveal their amazing powers. This is when the game gets really exciting! Four nearby kingdoms try really hard to take control of these special places.<br/><br/>As the game goes on, and we get to the 21st turn, the followers go back to where they started. And finally, the game ends on the 30th turn, and our exciting adventure is over.<br/><br/>Now, you will have access to four kingdoms, each with two types of armies &ndash; one with a power rating of 2 and the other with a power rating of 1. Additionally, you'll find four melee weapons, four ranged weapons, flags symbolizing your ownership of a land, and two portals.<br/><br/>Portals are your key to maneuvering across the occupied lands. You can use them to transport armies between your lands, making them immortal, or to launch attacks on your opponent's territories. You have the flexibility to place or remove a portal during your turn. However, a portal can only transport you to another land if that land has its own portal, or you can carry it with you to a different land.<br/><br/>In total, there are 48 cards in the game. Each player receives six cards and selects one ability from these cards on their turn. These abilities often involve moving according to the weapon's specifications and adding the move value in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction. To increase this value, players can use up to three army tokens, enabling them to move strategically around the board.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to reach a total of 60 points. The first player to achieve this goal wins. To accumulate these points, you begin with 15 points and a 5-point token. To earn the 15-point token, you must make your land immortal, while securing the 5-point token requires successful attacks on your opponent's lands.<br/><br/>Now that you understand the game's premise and mechanics, it's time to embark on your journey through the world of &quot;Amrtaka,.&quot; Enjoy the adventure, and may the most skilled strategist emerge victorious!<br/><br/>",

If the piece in front of a musketeer piece is captured before it entered the game, the musketeer piece is also removed from the board.<br/><br/>The extra pieces create a more dense and cluttered board, but their odd method of entry creates early game information about where your opponent is likely to develop.<br/><br/>Computer based analyses have been run on the musketeer chess pieces providing estimates of their valuation.

        "description": "The Last Hundred Yards Vol. IV: The Russian Front is the fourth game in The Last Hundred Yards series.  It covers major campaigns and missions from the second half of the war in the east, introducing the Russian army to the series for the first time. A series of missions simulates actions from the October 1943 fighting in the Ukraine near Krivoi Rog, while others feature fights during the Russian 1944 summer offensive, Operation Bagration. All major Russian armor from late 1942 onward is covered, plus some additional late war German armored vehicles.<br/><br/>The unique feature of this module is how Russian army behavior is modeled at the tactical level, particularly in its lack of local command-and-control flexibility and general indifference to casualties when fulfilling its missions. Make no mistake, playing the Russians will require a different mindset. The challenge will be in understanding the Russian behavior modeled in LHY and transitioning that into solid tactical applications. The Russians need numbers to make up for their lower tactical flexibility, but &quot;quantity has a quality all its own,&rdquo; and they generally do get those numbers.  While the period of the war covered by the module was one of overall Russian initiative, it still featured numerous German counterattacks, and module missions feature plenty of German attacks against Russian defenses as well as the reverse. Another set of new tactical challenges in the module stem from the frequently more open terrain found in the western Ukraine.<br/><br/>The Last Hundred Yards (Base Game) and Volume II (Airborne Over Europe) are core volumes for the rest of the European LHY series. Thus, players must own both Volumes I and II to play the Russian Module, Mission Pack 1, and future modules in the series.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lion Rampant is a &ldquo;big skirmish&rdquo; tabletop miniature wargame for the Dark Ages and Medieval periods in which each player controls a Warband of 4-10 units, with each unit consisting of 6 or 12 models. The game is scale-agnostic, allowing players to use suitable models from their collections in a stylized and abstracted game (rather than one that attempts to simulate the period).<br/><br/>The second edition of the game is available as a 208-page hardback rulebook (increased from the 64-page paperback first edition) with significantly improved formatting and presentation. Rules have not changed significantly from the first edition of the game and all retinues created under the first edition rules remain playable as warbands in the second edition. Points values of the original troop types haven&rsquo;t changed, but the troop types have been renamed to cover the broader period of history covered. Restrictions on units in warbands have been removed to give players more flexibility in creating their warbands. Minor errors have been corrected; clarifications/modifications of rules have been provided; and additional rules have been included as a result of community feedback.<br/><br/>New rules include additional unit upgrades, extra scenarios, expanded sample Warbands, more detail on laying out tabletop terrain, and a number of optional rules.<br/><br/>",

Manufactured in France, the HD.1 was supplied to the Belgian and the Italian air forces, and it proved highly successful. It was flown by a number of the famous aces, such as Belgian Willy Coppens and Italians Mario Fucini and Silvio Scaroni.<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In June of 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army seized the island of Attu in the Aleutian Islands of the United States&rsquo; Alaskan Territory. The United States, fearing the Japanese would use this strategic location as a base to control the northern Pacific Ocean&rsquo;s sea lanes, launched an assault in May of 1943. The 2,500 Japanese soldiers, mostly of the 301st Independent Infantry Battalion, were dug-in in the high mountains to defend against the Americans of the 7th and 32nd Infantry Regiments of the 7th Division. An arduous, nearly three-week campaign fought in brutal arctic conditions over bleak, rugged mountainous terrain ensued, climaxing in one of the largest Banzai charges of the war.<br/><br/>Hell Frozen Over is an expansion module for Heroes of the Pacific. Play nine scenarios on a unique 22&rdquo;x34&rdquo; Map that accurately depicts Attu&rsquo;s harsh terrain. The terrain varies over eight levels in height and features boot-sticking Muskeg, rock-strewn Rough, precipitous Cliffs and jagged Razorbacks crossing the high peaks of the unforgiving, mountainous landscape. Through fog and unexpected high winds, known to the Aleuts as &ldquo;Williwaws&rdquo;, both sides struggle to hold and take ground. Clevesy Pass, Cold Mountain, Point Able, Engineer Hill, the Sarana Valley and Prendergast Ridge are all fought over. The fighting is hex by hex, yard by yard, bullet by bullet, hand to hand; and it won&rsquo;t end until the last Japanese soldier is vanquished.<br/><br/>",

Known as Coffin Breakers, these skeletal fiends scratch and claw their way out of the rocky ground to bring death and destruction to the world of the living! Armed with rusty graveyard tools as weapons and the splintered remains of their wooden coffins as shields, these deadly foes were once bandits and horse thieves in life, condemned to the grave for their crimes. Now they have risen back from the dead, driven by the cold, unrelenting desire for revenge!<br/><br/>This Enemy Pack contains everything you need to battle the ghastly Undead Coffin Breakers. Included are 6 Coffin Breaker models, the large Enemy Record Sheet for them, and all of the Threat Cards needed to add them to your games of Shadows of Brimstone.<br/><br/>",

In order to break the years long deadlock and secure control of the city, each faction must uncover their adversary&rsquo;s secret plans hidden inside their top secret, code-protected briefcase.<br/><br/>Your job, if you are to accept it, is to protect your secret code by cleverly deploying card abilities, by seeking help from the Guards, Assassins, and Sentinels at the local tech-noir guilds, and by encrypting information when you can. But espionage is a two-way street. While trying to deny your opponent information about your secret code, you must try to crack theirs.<br/><br/>Classified Information is a fast-playing (10-minutes or less), 2-player &quot;iterative&quot; deduction microgame that is fully contained within just 18 cards. Each turn a player plays a card from their hand in one of three ways (for its ability, for its guild affiliation or by discarding it out of the game). Once the draw deck is depleted players reveal their secret code and the single card left in their hand, if their card matches a number in their opponent's code they may win the game, but things may not be so easy if their opponent also matches and has more guards, or has cleverly guarded their briefcase!<br/><br/>Will you be able to access your opponent&rsquo;s Classified Information?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this comic book-themed game, the world&rsquo;s most nefarious and diabolical super-villain has been captured and imprisoned by meddling heroes. As fellow villains bad guys, it's up to you to orchestrate an escape!<br/><br/>This is a (mostly) cooperative board/card game for 1-4 players, in which you acquire super powers, battle heroes, and overcome obstacles to break the super-villain out of a maximum-security prison.  The game includes four (4) different prisons, with their own set-up rules, victory conditions, and defeat conditions.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish their goals, players draw a hand of 5 cards from the communal &quot;Villain&quot; deck.  These cards include Attack cards, Defense cards, and Power Surge cards.  Attack cards are played on heroes, guards, and obstacles in order to defeat them.  Defense cards are played to overcome certain obstacles, as well as protect players' hands from the hero &amp; guard abilities that otherwise make them discard cards and reduce players' effectiveness on their turns.  Power Surge cards are used to overcome certain obstacles, but more importantly are used to purchase super-powers.<br/><br/>Players can acquire different combinations of abilities, choosing from among 22 unique super powers.  These powers run the range of classic powers, including Super Strength, Time Control, Energy Blasts, and others.  Powers allow players to break or augment the normal rules of play, making their hand of cards go further and hit harder.<br/><br/>As the players defeat heroes and guards, they acquire victory points.  If the players succeed in defeating the scenario, the player with the most Villain Points gets bragging rights as the &quot;winner&quot;, claiming the title of villain and relegating the other players to mere henchmen!  If the game wins, then all the players lose regardless of points, so teamwork is essential.<br/><br/>",

Nicknamed &ldquo;Frank&rdquo; by the Allies, the Ki-84 had excellent performance and high maneuverability, and was considered to be the best Japanese fighter to see large scale operations during World War II.<br/><br/>It was able to match any Allied fighter, and to intercept the high-flying B-29 Superfortresses, and its powerful armament increased its lethality. Great pilots that gloriously piloted this aircraft included Kenji Fujimoto and Takeshi Imoto.<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product.<br/><br/>In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. Larger maneuver cards (63 x 88 mm) are included with this model, to handle the fast movement of this airplane.<br/><br/>",

Unlike in the base game, the heroes no longer begin each level with a pre-determined number of Items, nor do they start with any Triforce Shards.  Instead, they must work for every advantage they can get before proceeding into the various dungeons by exploring the land of Hyrule and encountering its many denizens.  Shops will allow you to spend your hard-earned rupees to buy Items; challenges may allow the hero to upgrade his Skill cards to higher levels; and Lore, Quest and Forage encounters may endow the hero with a variety of benefits.<br/><br/>The concept of the Cogs introduced in the base game is continued above ground, with the landscape of Hyrule shifting and changing between turns.  Many paths exist to allow the hero move from one location to another, but they won't always connect on the ways the hero might want them to.  Players can play their Skill cards to move around Hyrule, as well as allowing them to shift the Location tiles around, permitting them to reach previously unattainable locations.  The treasures that the heroes have gained may also provide shortcuts or otherwise give the players an advantage during encounters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 2037. Your organization is competing to put the first human being on Mars, but the competition is fierce. In Race to Mars, each player will build their own custom rocket and carefully plan their own crew deck that will take them to the red planet. But who will get there first? The race is on!<br/><br/>Race to Mars is a fast-paced racing game for two to four players, where you build your deck from scratch and every decision matters. Will you add another module to your rocket? Should you enhance your crew deck to prepare for the journey ahead? Even what you leave behind is a rich decision as leftover cards will build the game board with the trajectories from Earth to Mars.<br/><br/>And when should you launch your rocket? As fast as possible and try to stay ahead the entire way or do you stay cool and keep building up, hoping that you will overtake your competitors one by one? No two games of Race to Mars are the same, as each game will pose new challenges and opportunities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Anyone who says that size doesn't matter has never had to deal with a giant or two. As part of the Free Folk army, they are walking siege engines, battering entire enemy ranks with a single swing of their massive clubs.<br/><br/>The Savage Giants unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Free Folk commanders two huge figures to add to their forces. The Savage Giant is both resilient and deadly. Their Mighty Swing doesn't allow for Defensive Saves as it can bash through multiple troops with a single swing. The Giant is resilient, too, having five Wounds and only taking a wound for each two Hits it takes. Hurting the Giant just makes it mad, with its Mighty Swing doing more and more damage for each Wound the Giant has.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You will progress through a legacy system with a unique and hand drawn deck of cards. If you complete it, you will unlock its fortune telling magic! This being a fortune telling book that is sealed in a bag until the legacy's criteria are fulfilled.<br/><br/>Each round begins by dealing out an arrangement of 24 cards. The object of the game is to discard every card according to the game's rules. This is called &quot;clearing&quot; the deck.<br/><br/>The strategies embedded in these rules make for a high level of planning, but simple decisions at any given moment. This provides an experience that is easy to pick up during your free time. It is meant to inspire curiosity and meditation with a statistically interesting puzzle.<br/><br/>The backbone of the legacy system is a story that is grouped into three &quot;Acts&quot;. Act One is a tutorial that helps with the strategies, but is not too obvious. Acts two and three are challenge based. The player will have to clear in all of 8 ways, then all of 24 ways. This transforms your deck by replacing cards depending on the win-state and gradually increasing the impact on the players strategic choices.<br/><br/>After these challenges are complete, your deck is fully transformed, and the fortune telling book is &quot;unlocked&quot;, the player is considered a &quot;Seer&quot; and will forever be presented with a fortune after every successful clear. There are 72 unique and poetic fortunes, and the result is influenced by the path that the player takes to clear the deck.

All bids are then placed to the side to be added to the bag for the next bidding round, and the highest bidder takes all of the current yen in the bag.

Their job is to assemble, deploy and control teams of specialist digital programs into the world&rsquo;s electronic networks. <br/>Their aim is to access a set of key assets protected by their opponent, while simultaneously defending their own assets from enemy attack.<br/><br/>Players choose and control a set of programs, each of which is represented by a dice. The value of any program is called its state.<br/>A program&rsquo;s state is reduced as it takes damage; if it ever lowers below 1, that program is immediately eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>After setting up the board and assembling their teams, players take turns to run all of their programs. Programs come in two forms, Agents and Crypts. <br/>Agents are active, movable pieces. Crypts on the other-hand are immobile; sat atop assets like protective turrets. Crypts are arguably more limited than agents, though unlike their mobile cousins, they also serve as an advanced asset deployment platform.<br/><br/>Every agent may take a number of standard actions including moving, supporting (recharging their teammates) and attacking. In addition to these standard actions, each agent has a single specialised action, chosen by its owner before the start of the game. Players use these specialised actions to create advantages and opportunities to successfully win the game.<br/><br/>A player wins the game by either eliminating three out of four of their opponents Crypts (granting them access to the assets on which they sit) or by completely destroying their opponents team of agents.<br/><br/>Components include:<br/><br/>     35 dice per player in a variety of types (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 and D20)<br/>     A batch crafted set of a board and tokens. <br/>     A range of 15 special action cards per player, each of which may be applied to any dice type per player.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the pulbisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Max Eisenhardt, the man who would become Magneto, faced unimaginable discrimination and evil during the Third Reich&rsquo;s rise to power in World War II. He survived, thanks in part to the manifestation of his mutant power to control magnetic fields. Following the war, he resolved that such a fate would never befall mutant kind. An uncompromising freedom fighter for his fellow mutants, his extreme beliefs for mutant superiority drove a wedge between Magneto and his close friend, Professor Xavier. Magneto&rsquo;s vision for mutant kind caused him to form the Brotherhood of Mutants, who fight for mutant supremacy.<br/><br/>Mortimer Toynbee, known as Toad, is a genetically flawed mutant. Visibly mutated since birth, he was abandoned by his parents to an orphanage where he was ostracized for his appearance. When Magneto discovered and recruited him, Toad embraced the mission to conquer the human race who had rejected and degraded him. Toad serves Magneto as an unquestioning lackey using his mutant abilities of enhanced jumping and prehensile tongue.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Crusader, The Winter Battles for Tobruk, 1941 is played on a map of Libya and Egypt immediately south and east of Tobruk, where the battle was fought. It uses playing pieces that represent the actual military units that participated in this campaign. Each player represents the commander of the Axis or Allied forces. The individual ground units represent battalions of approximately 700 soldiers (50-60 tanks in an armored battalion, 12-24 guns in an artillery battalion), or companies of about 200 soldiers (15-20 tanks or armored cars in an armored company, 4-12 guns in an artillery battery). Each hex represents 2 kilometers or 1.25 miles. Each turn is a third of a day.<br/><br/>Operation Crusader is a two-player game, with team play possible for the full campaign game. <br/>One player assumes the role of the Axis and the other player assumes the role of the Allies. <br/>Each player moves his units and executes attacks on enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the game&rsquo;s Victory Conditions. <br/>To move from one space to another, each unit expends a portion of its Movement Allowance. <br/>Combat is resolved through Battles by &quot;firing&quot; at opposing units and then determining the outcome of any hits scored. A die is used to resolve combat.<br/><br/>The classic monster game returns with a newly-streamlined game system throughout (no more pre-plotting movement!). This new edition emphasizes playability while capturing the flavor of the original game. The game adds smaller scenarios (6 total), each covering a shorter and smaller part of the historic battle, and a full campaign game which allows players to experience the full sweep of Operation Crusader. Two shorter versions of the entire campaign (the most exciting parts) are also included for those wanting less game play time.<br/><br/>Featured scenarios include:<br/>    &bull; Scenario 1: Gabr Saleh (5 turns, 1 map), AM 19 Nov - PM 20 Nov<br/>    &bull; Scenario 2: Bir El-Gobi (5 turns, 1 map), AM 19 Nov - PM 20 Nov<br/>    &bull; Scenario 3: Sidi Rezegh (8 turns, 1 map), AM 21 Nov - PM 23 Nov<br/>    &bull; Scenario 4: Storming the Frontier (8 turns, 1 map), AM 21 Nov - PM 23 Nov<br/>    &bull; Scenario 5: Rommel's Dash (11 turns, 1 map), AM 24 Nov - PM 27 Nov<br/>    &bull; Scenario 6: The Cauldron (8 turns, 2 maps), AM 24 Nov - PM 26 Nov<br/>    &bull; &quot;Short&quot; Campaign Game (14 turns, all 4 maps), AM 19 Nov - PM 23 Nov<br/>    &bull; &quot;Long&quot; Campaign Game (31 turns, all 4 maps), AM 19 Nov - PM 28 Nov<br/>    &bull; &quot;Extended&quot; Campaign Game (50 turns, all 4 maps), AM 19 Nov - PM 5 Dec<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

A Player who completes an Event Card places it in his Victory Display. When all the Event Cards have been played, the Players total their respective Victory Points. The Player with the most Victory Points wins the game!<br/><br/>Playing the Game<br/>After setting up and choosing colors (usually, the color that is closest to each respective Player), randomly determine who will go first. Each Player takes her Turn by following, in strict order, the following four Phases of the Turn.<br/><br/>1) Draw Event Card: The first thing a Player does each Turn is draw the top card of the Event Deck.<br/><br/>2) Use Optional Card Text (&quot;may&quot;): Each Character possesses Card Text that allows him to function during the game in a special way.<br/><br/>3) Complete Location Events: A Player now checks to see if he has met the Requirements for any Location Events currently in play.<br/><br/>4) Two Card Actions: The Player now performs two of the following Card Actions.  <br/>Draw a Card:  <br/>Play a Card:  <br/>Move 1 or 2 Cards:  <br/>If a Player possesses a Character with a Title (such as King of Somerset), that Player can take a third Card Action during her turn.<br/><br/>After a Player completes all four Phases of his Turn, play passes to the Player on his left. The game continues until the Event Deck is empty and all Location Events &amp; Bidding Events have been resolved. At this time, each Player totals the number of Victory Points in his Victory Display (as well as on any Artifacts he still possesses). The Player with the most Victory Points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

TSOD games all feature hand-built rules, hex grid regulated movement, a unique actions system, and versatile unit design rules.<br/><br/>Voidstriker is one of the games in the series.  It is a fleet-oriented game of starship combat. Ships and fighters battle in deep space and in the gravity wells of important worlds. The rules feature unique, playable vector movement with gravity effects around planets, versatile ship design rules, quick and detailed combat resolution, and easy adaptation to use of miniatures or starship models.<br/><br/>Ground Zero is another game in the series.  It is a tactical ground combat game, best suited to running company-level combats. Rules are based strongly on Voidstriker, so if you know one, you'll have a pretty good handle on the other.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grand Piquet 2nd Edition - Many changes were made for this new edition of Grand Piquet.  The Army commander now plays a more pivotal role in the command and control of a Corps.  These formations no longer move whenever or wherever they wish.    A D12 is now the basis for all initiative rolls, which effectively eliminates the need for phases, as well as mitigates the wild swings in initiative.    The Sequence decks have been radically altered. Now there are Action cards, by type of unit [e.g. Infantry Action card], whereby there is much greater flexibility in actions taken by units.  Also, the basic Sequence deck is now made up of 20 cards, instead of 28.  The combat system is based primarily on Target type, so there are fewer modifiers to calculate. The basic concept of &ldquo;chipping&rdquo; within the morale system is intact, yet there is no need to keep track of morale chips. Unit / sub unit designations are determined by numbers of men and not by regiment.  Players determine the size and make up of a unit, thereby effectively tailoring each Command Group to a particular situation or task.  These are but a few of the changes that have been made. <br/>It is hoped that this new edition will keep the flavor and excitement of the original, while improving the mechanics, which will give a more fluid, less static feel to the game.  One final comment that deserves remembering:  Piquet is an innovative system designed to give players the opportunity to make command decisions based upon finite resources.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Space Goblins&quot; is a unique wargame of Man-to-Goblin combat aboard Spaceships. The premise behind the game is that goblins are real, humans drove them away from Earth a long time ago, and now that humans are space-faring, they discover that the goblins have the same technology and are out for revenge!<br/><br/>The game map depicts a human Federation Star Explorer spaceship which has been rammed and boarded by a goblin War Cruiser, part of which is also depicted on the mapsheet. The ships are divided into corridors and compartments. The counters represent individual combatants. There is no grid, movement is simply conducted room to room. The rules incorporate miniatures-style concepts for units to obstruct movement and line-of-sight. Given the bloodthirsty nature of goblins on the edge of going berzerk, the two forces fight until one side is eliminated.<br/><br/>While the game system is fairly straightforward, there are a number of interesting elements (for example, there is no stacking of counters -- instead, the rules allow for as many counters as can fit into a room on the map without overlapping). There are also a number of special unit types, such as Witch Doctors for the goblins (who can bring the dead back to life), Robots for the humans, and Technicians for both sides. The latter have various skills, including creating and removing barriers, unjamming weapons, etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Le Combat de l&rsquo;Aigle (The Eagle's fight) is a tactical game system meant to simulate Napoleonic battles at the battalion scale. Large size battles are playable in one day. The game mechanism is close to miniatures, but the armies are included in the box as are several scenarios on the beginning of the 1809 campaign. Other volumes will follow.<br/><br/>Several rules are very innovative; a focus on unit cohesion (visualized by file closers set behind the unit), the chain of command, a cavalry combat using waves of squadrons close to reality. Other elements, (e.g. the brigade move) can accelerate the game. The combat system is based on drawing cards and comparing them (a simpler system based on a single die roll is also included).<br/><br/>Le Combat de l&rsquo;Aigle can be played three different ways :<br/><br/>* As a tactical system to simulate real or imaginary battles..<br/>    * As a miniature game system (Kip Trexel is the author of the campaign rules for Empire III). Basing and the use of miniatures, with single miniatures as file closers, are easy to adapt to any scale. Designed at first to be played with 6mm miniatures and doubling all distances included here, it can be converted to any scale with great ease..<br/>    * As a tactical extension of the Vol de l’Aigle campaign system, to solve every important battle. The players can decide to switch to a more tactical system when a large battle occurs.<br/><br/>The game includes 5 scenarios on the opening moves of the 1809 campaign.<br/>Content (under ziplock):<br/><br/>* 1 rule book (32 pages).<br/>    * 18 hard paper counter sheets including the French and Austrian armies at the beginning of the 1809 campaign in Bavaria.<br/>    * 4 sheets of colorful player aid.<br/><br/>The players must provide numerical markers from 1 to 6 (we use 5mm dice).<br/><br/>",

There are two sides: a blue team of good guys, and a red team of bad guys, each lead by a robot king.  The blue king is King El Smasho and the red king is King Slugnut.  The cards themselves are called Power Cards and contain bar codes for interaction with Rumble Robots toys.  Each card has a &quot;power level&quot; from 1-5 which corresponds to both its rarity and relative usefulness in the game.  In addition, there are &quot;platinum&quot; cards, more powerful than level 5 cards.  One expansion set was released, &quot;Rumble Robots: Invasion&quot;, which focused on the two king characters as well as adding a further rarity level called &quot;superpower&quot; cards.<br/><br/>",

The nature of the war at that time was very fluid and hadn't settled into the static trench warfare that characterized the war in modern memory.<br/><br/>The basic units of the game are the infantry company, cavalry squadron, and half-battery. These basic units are combined into larger units such as battalions, regiments, brigades, and batteries. There are no set scales for distance or time.<br/><br/>Great War uses increment cards that determine how many actions a player can make in their turn. Cards number from one to three. The composition of a card deck varies by nationality, but is always eight cards. Countries rated to have better command control will have more &quot;3s&quot; in their deck and a higher total of increments. The cards are drawn each turn and reshuffled after the deck has been gone through.<br/><br/>Command control is simulated by a commander having to allocate command factors to every unit he wishes to move or fire in the turn. When the game starts, the commander has one command factor available per unit. However, as units lose or win melees, capture key positions, or rout, the command factors will rise and fall so that a commander may be unable to move all his units in a turn. The commander MUST allocate command factors to attempt to unpin any units that have become pinned due to enemy fire.<br/><br/>Firing uses an incremental percentage. A unit has a base percentage value for their fire, which is multiplied by the number of figures firing and then by the number of increments. For example, a rifle company of six figures firing at long range (15&quot;) for two increments has a base factor of 10%, which is multiplied times the figures to get 60%, and then multiplied by the number of increments for a result of 120% or one casualty inflicted and a 20% chance for a second. Cover modifiers may also reduce a unit's fire. For example, if the target of the rifle company's fire had been entrenched, the fire would be reduced to 1/4 for a result of a 30% chance for a single casualty.<br/><br/>Small arms fire is from unit to unit, but artillery fire uses templates that cover a larger area and may embrace multiple target units, all of which are affected by the fire. Casualties can mount rapidly, especially when artillery fire comes into play.<br/><br/>Infantry, cavalry, artillery--and machine guns--are the dominant arms in Great War, but early armored vehicles, such as armored cars, were on hand and are included in the game.<br/><br/>Great War includes organization charts for all the countries of 1914 along with guidelines for basing figures and models.<br/><br/>The game plays quickly even with a large number of units per side. There is enough &quot;flavor&quot; to make the rules engaging without so much detail that one feels bogged down in minutiae.<br/><br/>",

The book provides two campaigns in one cover: the first 11 scenarios show the evolution of the US 15th Air Force&rsquo;s strategic bombing campaign over Hungary during 1944; the next 12 scenarios recreate the intense combat between Hungarian and Soviet air forces as the Red Army overran Hungary in late 1944/1945. As well as covering events typical of the campaign (ground attack, reconnaissance, dogfights) the book also includes WWII&rsquo;s top ace Erich Hartmann, Stuka-ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel&rsquo;s Schlachtgeschwader 2, a rare 'balloon-busting' action, and unique prototype aircraft.<br/><br/>Historical Research: This book includes several introduction sections that contain campaign historical background, a campaign map plus a bibliography for further reading. Very little reliable information about the operations of the Hungarian air force in WWII is available in English. Professional Hungarian military aviation historian Csaba Becze fills this gap with sections covering the background to the campaign, the relative capabilities of the air forces involved and their weapons and tactics, the course of operations, and fascinating accurate details of each of the battles represented in the scenarios.<br/><br/>Aircraft Statistics: this book contains statistics for 27 aircraft featured in the campaign in aircraft statistics for Check Your 6!! .<br/><br/>Table of Contents<br/><br/><br/>     Campaign Introduction<br/>     Hungary Campaign Map<br/>     References and Recommended Reading<br/>     Hungarian Aces<br/>     The Protagonists - Hungary, Germany, USA, USSR<br/>     Axis and Allied Aircraft Statistics for Check Your 6!<br/>     Campaign Rules<br/>     Campaign Paragraphs<br/>     Scenarios (23)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tavreli (Russian Chess) is a two-player abstract strategy board game in the same family as Western chess, Shatranj, Japanese Shogi or Chinese Xiangqi.  There was an ancient Russian Chess-like game called Tavreli but its rules have been lost over time. Today's Tavreli is a modern game that was recreated in the latest 1990s as a combination of standard Chess and Bashni (Russian Stacking Draughts).<br/><br/>There are three main differences between Tavreli and standard Chess:<br/><br/>- When a player captures an opponent's piece, the captured piece is not taken off the board. Instead of this the player puts his piece on top of the captured piece forming a stack.<br/><br/>- A player can move his piece to a square occupied by another player's piece. In this case the player puts the moved piece on top of the &quot;captured&quot; one the same way as it happens with opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>- A stack belongs to whoever owns its topmost piece, and moves as that piece does. However, a player is not obliged to move a stack as a whole: it is allowed to move just the top part of it leaving the bottom part on its place.<br/><br/>The more detailed rules in English: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/tavreli.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/tavreli.html</a><br/><br/>",

So out into the barnyard you go, looking for tasty spiders, worms, beetles, and bits of corn. All you need to do is grab it and bring it back to your henhouse. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other chickens in the yard that are trying to grab the same food! Will you be able to successfully maneuver your chickens to collect the most food and feed your flock?<br/><br/>In Chicken Feed Stampede!, players control a pair of chickens trying to collect food as they run around the barnyard. While doing so, they have to avoid other chickens and the fox, which chases the chickens to the edge of the barnyard, forcing them to the edge to start over.<br/><br/>Each player uses a set of eight action cards to determine how their chickens are moved each turn.<br/><br/>There are four different kinds of food available, and each gives the player who collects it a different ability or score. Player order is managed by placing their turn markers on the &quot;Pecking Order&quot; board. Clever management of your actions to stay at the top of the pecking order is needed to win the game.<br/><br/>The game board is comprised of a grid of various terrain tiles. A chicken's movement ability is based on the terrain of the tile it starts its move from.

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>This is the six-sector version of the classic Federation &amp; Empire Scenario 603 The Hurricane. It originally appeared in three parts in Captain's Log #41, Captain's Log #41 Supplemental File, and Captain's Log #42.<br/><br/>Scenario 603 The Hurricane was one of the scenarios in the Federation &amp; Empire boxed strategic game. It covers the period from the Romulan Invasion of the Federation to the final collapse of the Coalition Offensive at the very gates (well, starbases) of the Federation's capital region. The original scenario was one big thing, but this version (fully updated for all of the expansions) divides the campaign into six sectors (Hydran Front, Kzinti Front, Gorn-Romulan Front, Federation-Romulan front, and two sectors of the Klingon-Federation front. Players can play just one sector for an evening's game, or combine multiple sectors for a weekend of gaming, or spend an entire week on the entire campaign.<br/><br/>",

The map is extended to the east and covers the area where the 36th US Infantry Division had to force its way into the hills surrounding the bridgehead.  The Germans are on the defensive and must hold on and wait for the bulk of the 29th Panzer Grenadier and 26th Panzer Divisions to arrive and allow for the strong counter-attack that almost drove the Allies into the sea.  To counter this threat was a large and active Naval Gunfire effort and the 82nd Airborne Division needed to drop in and help out.<br/><br/>There are 4 games in total for this series and will dwarf existing Salerno games.  Next in the series is the area od the British and the 46th and 56th Infantry Divisions.  The battle for Battipaglia is highlighted next and then the area of Salerno and the defense by German paratroops in the hills to the north of the city.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kabinettskrieg is a Grand Campaign module combining the games Cockpit of Europe, Sport of Kings, and Queens' Gambit in one very large scenario. IMPORTANT. All three base games are required for this module.<br/><br/>Kabinettskrieg is a multi-player operational study, for 2-6, or even more would-be generals; each player controls the forces of one of the major participating nations and its minor allies. Extra players can lead the troops of the same nation in individual theatres of the war. Although the players are divided into two Camps, victory is an individual goal as you try to win more glory than both your allies and your enemies. Do YOU have what it takes to become the greatest captain general of the Eighteenth Century?<br/><br/>Included in the module is a set of the latest basic rules, charts, and tables (version 3.75) for the Lace Wars system. A few key concepts in this system include Operations Points, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. Operations Points are accumulated during periods of inactivity, in order to be spent during the course of active campaigning. If a player is unable or unwilling to spend OPs, his forces suffer attrition instead. The further forces are from their base of operations, the more severe the penalties will be. Whoever has the most OPs also has the initiative.<br/><br/>Map scale is 8.5 miles per hex. The counters are battalions and regiments. Units are rated for Strength (in battalions), Effectiveness (a combination of morale and training), and Movement. Turns are equivalent to months. Each turn is broken down into several phases - supply, operations, admin, etc.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players alternate moving their formations, laying siege to fortresses and engaging in battle with the enemy field forces. The players have a degree of flexibility in what they do with their forces, but they are constrained by the Campaign Plan or plans that they choose. These dictate what objectives (usually fortresses) must be taken. A successfully completed plan will garner Prestige for a player. At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige wins. In addition, bonuses can be won for victory in battle, and these may be used to buy rewards that improve a player's chances, or be used as influence.<br/><br/>Leaders have an important role to play, as befitting an era where personal command was critical. They are rated for skill or effectiveness, personality, and influence (i.e. the chance they have of retaining command despite their incompetence).<br/><br/>In addition to the concepts above, the supply system has been streamlined while keeping to the basic elements of foraging in tandem with the use of pre-positioned depots. River and canal movement has been taken into account and will prove as critical to success as the use of rail lines in more modern games.<br/><br/>The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Death Ride Salerno - 16th Panzer Expansion is the third, of four, title in the Death Ride Salerno game set.  This game expands the beachhead to the east and introduces British forces from the 10th Corps.  The main battle in this part of the bridgehead was for Battipaglia.  The British Guard Brigade managed to get into the outskirts of the town only to be thrown out.  The front in this area was fairly settled for the 6 days of the battle and the Germans did not have the stregnth here to push the British back.  The German counter-attack instead focused on the American forces and ultimately fell short.<br/><br/>Naval gunfire support is present in the British area along with significant air support.  A new Naval Chart is included in this game that helps to organize the naval gunfire ships off shore and even takes into account ships needing to come out of the support line to conduct resupply.<br/><br/>The game system rules are written along the Seven Battlefield Operating Systems of Maneuver, Command and Control, Fire Support, Intelligence, Air Defense, Mobility and Survivability, and Combat Service Support.  Enhancements to those plus an Amphibious Enhancement are planned for future release.  A Fire Support Artillery Enhancement has already been released and provides for artillery mission markers that restrict artillery support to Direct Support (DS), General Support (GS), and Reinforcing (R).<br/><br/>",

Each time you play the game, the board and the distribution of the action tiles will be different.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of four cats numbered from 1 to 4. By turns, they place cats on the board, actions or rooms. First the  number 1 cat of each player, and so on until the last number 4 is placed.<br/>Then they reveal the destination of the owner of the cats.<br/><br/>Now begins the actions phase. First the owner moves one room towards the revealed destination, then the players remove by turns their cat number 1 executing it's action. They follow this way until all four cats of every player are removed.<br/><br/>If the owner is in the same room as a cat, the player gains a reward or a punishment depending if the action is legal or illegal. If two or more players are in the same action tile with the same number, they must fight for the action since only one player can make the action.<br/><br/>Players can run to reach faraway rooms, hunt for treasures, meow to call the owner and perform some skills to break the rules.<br/><br/>The game has 7 rounds (in Spain a cat has 7 lives instead of 9); the player with the most victory points at the end of the seventh round wins the game.<br/><br/>",

With that, has to change majorities without give clues to other players about his own race. First, place new invasors. Then, move them to an adjacent place if you want. And last, perform it's special skill.<br/><br/>Note that there is more different aliens in game than players. So you have to pay attention to other player's movements to guess which is their race. And which race is a non-playing one.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, everybody reveals his race and earn points according the majorities.<br/><br/>This are the aliens:<br/><br/>-Proteus: Giant amoebas. Skill -&gt; An invasor comes to the place from an adjacent one, then kill one on main place.<br/>-Enerllaiser: Energy monsters. Skill -&gt; Teleport an alien from the place he is, to the one you want.<br/>-Fetids: they stink. Skill -&gt; Move a invasor to an adjacent place. From that adjacent place, move a different invasor to an adjacent place far away from the original. If at any moment there is no move possible the invasor dies.<br/>-Space Zombies. Like normal zombies, but from outer space. Skill -&gt; Bites an invasor and changes its race to another different.<br/>-Ulfedar: Explote. Skill -&gt; Kills an invasor and another one from an adjacent place.<br/>-Spores. Copycat. Skill -&gt; Copy the skill of another alien on the same place.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Colossal Clash Core Set: The Ultimate Battle for Cosmic All-Time Power!<br/><br/>A player versus player internal deck-building card game for 2 to 4 players!<br/><br/>With whimsical humor and cartoony fun, Colossal Clash takes you to the outer edges of the singularity that lies at the Center of the Universe. There, you will do battle with alien warlords, galactic despots, and masters of every form of power imaginable. Casting about for Creative, Destructive, and Forbidden energies, you will summon strange beings, mighty heroes, and ancient (and bizarre) relics to throw against your enemies, and you'll fling spells of terrible power and reality-altering emanations to...<br/><br/>... Oh, to heck with it! You're gonna bust some heads and try to wipe everyone else out! After all, this is -<br/><br/>The Ultimate Battle for Cosmic All-Time Power!<br/><br/>This set includes 240 cards, with over a hundred unique cards to make the game different every time you play it. Includes the rules in PDF form (with printable tokens and game mat included).<br/><br/><br/>This game is a crossover between magic the gathering and deckbuilding and it does it very well.<br/><br/>The goal of this deck-building game is to reduce each of your opponent&rsquo;s Player Life to zero.<br/><br/>There are two gameplay modes that change how cards are played: Standard and Limitless Mod.<br/><br/>Each player receives four &quot;Creative Energy&quot; cards, four &quot;Destructive Energy&quot; cards, one &quot;Forbidden Energy&quot; card, and one &quot;Simple Guardian&quot; card. They shuffle these up and this becomes their personal Deck, which will grow as the game progresses.<br/><br/>In a Standard Mode game, each player can Buy one card, Play one Summon, Play one Relic, and Play one Spell (provided that they have the energy to do so). All of his or her Summons can take their Action as well (Buying, Playing, Summons, Summon Actions, Relics, and Spells are explained below in their sections).<br/><br/>If you decide to play Limitless Mode, each player can Buy and Play as many cards as they can afford, along with each Summon taking its action. These games change the strategy up a bit, but be aware that in Limitless Mode, player turns tend to take longer, which will make the game itself takaware take more time.<br/><br/>On the table you will have an ENERGY deck (where you can draw extra energy cards), a GUARDIAN deck (cheap units that add to your defense), a DIMENSIONAL outcast deck (also cheap units that add your attack) and the BUYING deck where all the rest of the cards are added (creatures, spells, instants). You may have up to 5 creatures and 4 relics on the table at any time. Also 5 cards from the BUYING deck are drawn and placed face up on to shape the BUYING POOL.<br/><br/>Each turn you can buy creatures, draw energies and attack the opponent with creatures you already summoned on the previous turn, spells on the table or instant effects.<br/><br/>What is really great is that creatures in this game also count with special abilities that can activate if you decide not to attack with that particular creature adding a lot of strategy and possibilities to this game.<br/><br/>Once a player s life is reduced to zero he/she is out of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme<br/>They finally did it, and we survived it: the greatest nuclear war. In the ruin of humanity, our tools of destruction lie in wait for their next master. As survivors flock to your settlement, they turn their hearts to you to create a future secure from the other savages. Choose your allies carefully and hold your plans close. Maintain dialogue between the other leaders, trade resources, plan coordinated attacks, and promise aid or revenge. It has become clear that only you and your newly formed Security Council can secure this world by suppressing your opponents' ambitions.<br/><br/>A Game for the Nuclear Family<br/>Traditional war games scare away casual gamers. Instead, Security Council presents a diplomacy mechanic that is engaging enough for veteran players &amp; approachable unit mechanics for casuals. Security Council is modular, scalable, quick to setup, intuitive mechanics, self explanatory cards and graphics, and it breeds discussion and post game memories!<br/><br/>Mechanics<br/>Security Council is a tile based modular zone-control, resource management, and diplomacy war board game. Own a war game that makes people laugh, conspire, shout, shake hands, and even flip a table or two. Security Council has reminiscent mechanics to classic war territory control war games but relies heavily on the diplomacy mechanic between players. Trading resources, forging alliances, planning coordinated attacks, and promising aid or sweet revenge is all a massive part of this game.<br/><br/>Command troops in six glorious colors and expand your territory. Build and fire nuclear missiles to rain destruction upon your foes or to buy yourself an insurance policy. You and your friends are the Security Council. As an overview, begin by vying for territory with traditional troop warfare. To some, troop warfare is reminiscent of other war games but is resolved in a different way. Build up your nuke arsenal or nuclear deterrent! Next, fire your nukes or evacuate from your friends nukes! Can you strategically escape the end of days?<br/><br/>Finally, take what is yours in the aftermath of humanity! All that remains are a resemblance of what your armies once were. Will you finally overwhelm your friends? Or will you miscalculate and end on the wrong side of history?<br/><br/>History<br/>Security Council began as an idea where a colleague simply wanted a board game where we could 'nuke' each other. It was sort of a running gag. From the start, I knew I didn't want a game glorified nuclear. The way Security Council plays makes nuking your friends seem utterly devastating as far as a means to progress through the game. Players incorporate a lot of thought into their diplomatic actions around the table and I believe it gives appropriate weight to the issue of nuclear war. Board games are about the people playing it! Truly that is why we play board games, to convene with those around us and Security Council is a medium that creates friends, adversaries, and special moments and memories for you!<br/><br/>That being said, this is not an educational game, per say. Any thoughts formed about nuclear war is all a by product and up to each individual. It is filled with memories of players trying to be friends but enemies too. Many deals are struck and then rescinded when game conditions change. The act of playing with your friends is very fun and after each game new players are always eager to play again.<br/><br/>I began with an existing board from another game.  At the time, I envisioned the game would have it's own unique board.  After some play testing, we saw that a board would create two problems.  First, it would be difficult to balance.  Second, it might limit novelty.<br/><br/>Security Council was successfully funded on Kickstarter.com in December 2015.<br/><br/>Parts List<br/>270 Plastic Color Cubes, 54 Game Cards, 36 Hex Tiles, 30 Factory Tokens, 12 Nuclear Missile Tokens, 1 Six Sided Die<br/><br/>About<br/>Players 3-6, Age 10+, 45-180 minutes, UPC 634041498498<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Razor's Edge is a new fast paced game of man-to-man combat set during WWII in 1944-5. Each player controls a squad of up to 12 soldiers and can play in many different scenarios and combat situations. Each counter represents a single man, each hex 2-3 meters, and each turn 10-30 seconds. Games take from 45 minutes to a couple of hours.<br/><br/>The Razor's Edge is entirely free and open source. Players may use the rules, components, and artwork to create their own scenarios, nationalities, new units, or entirely new games.<br/><br/>Scenarios include patrols, night actions, partisan raids, rescuing downed airmen and many more. In each scenario the actual soldiers used are randomly selected, so whether you end up with outstanding soldiers or the less than first rate soldiers, you will need to marshal your squad and use their abilities to the best you can.<br/><br/>Nationalities included in The Razor's Edge are:<br/><br/>    British, steady under fire, but sometimes hidebound by their training methods<br/>    American GIs, always full of individual initiative, but sometimes not with the best fire discipline. <br/>    The Germans are really a mixed bag by mid-1944, there are some very seasoned soldiers along with many that are very inexperienced.<br/>    The French Resistance, the men and women of the Resistance may not always be the best prepared but they try to always take on the Germans when they have a clear advantage.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player takes control of one of the five factions and every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  Even with a larger number of miniatures on the table the WWX rules have been designed to keep the play fast and dynamic.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool. The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice. Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn. The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Loki was a clever and crafty god and when he played games with some of the other gods in Asgard  he made up rules for his own games.  This made sure that the game was confusing and different every time so he was the only one who could win. The other gods really wanted to be better than Loki so they tried their best to beat him. So it became a tradition to gather around one of Loki&rsquo;s games. This festive tradition got the name Ramasjang.<br/><br/>Gather your friends for a fun fast changing card game! It&rsquo;s fun and easy to shape like Loki the shapeshifter himself.<br/><br/>Now each player is dealt seven cards. The cards have different rules which you generate every hand. The person who sits left to the dealer starts.<br/><br/>The card laid on top of the discard pile has to match the suit or the number unless a rule says otherwise. If you can&rsquo;t lay a card you must pick a card from the deck. After picking up the card you have the possibility to lay it if possible and if you still can&rsquo;t go it&rsquo;s the next players turn.<br/><br/>From here you can add new rules to the cards without any limits.  The idea as Loki changed the rules to win, here each of the player takes it in turn either during play or between hands to add to the rules.<br/><br/>A player wins, in a singled hand game by getting rid of all his cards despite the rule changes.  In a longer point scoring game a player wins when they have the least points when an opponent hits a value agreed at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

Over the past several years, we've had unfinished business with respect to realizing these narratives in game form. The following cards represent the participation and contributions that you, the players, have made in the Storyline events, as well as the subsequent playtesting and feedback. We are grateful to all of you, and we look forward to providing more opportunities for you to help steer the direction of V:TES!<br/> As mentioned previously, we're still waiting for one piece of artwork to be delivered.

These are soldiers capable of accomplishing special missions that regular units cannot. The &lsquo;Killers&rsquo;, the Spetsnaz kill squads, are just that. These men can overcome any situation they are put in, no matter how dangerous or desperate.<br/><br/>When the Spetsnaz Kill Squad is called into action, it&rsquo;s to make sure that there are no survivors left, no building still standing, and no enemy vehicle in one piece - and to leave no evidence of who did it. They are the most ruthless soldiers in the SSU, with the possible exception of the famed Steel Guards, many of whom are former members of a kill squad anyway.<br/><br/>The Killers use regular Sino-Soviet Union weapons and equipment, mixed with a few extras of their own, but it&rsquo;s the way they use them that makes the difference. Their preferred weapon is the Avtomat Kalashnikova 45 (AK-45) assault rifle, the future weapon of all SSU infantry. The Killers back these up with Sulphur Jet flame-throwers, DPM machine-guns, and two RPG-1 anti-tank launchers. Every Killer is also armed with a standard-issue Spetsnaz machete, the signature weapon of these troops for close-in and personal killing.<br/><br/>The Spetsnaz Kill Squad primary&rsquo;s objectives are eliminating enemy infantry and leaders, light and heavy vehicles. They excel at these jobs. As long as it involves spreading mayhem, you can count on these men!<br/><br/>",

It is up to the players (with a limited number of actions) to drop off rations or candy to the people. Candy will be taken at the same time as rations and when enough candy is taken, players get rewarded in the form of postcards.<br/><br/>While players are trying to keep the people alive, winter is slowly creeping in, making the game harder and harder.

AND WHERE DID ALL THE HAMMERS GO?!?.  The game has two primary objectives.  Brawl and fight to the death or control areas for victory points.<br/><br/>There are two primary game mechanisms in Dwarves with Swords.  The first is Group Building, where the player picks from four different dwarf classes and builds groups of nine to use in combat. Each of these different classes has things they are good at and things they are weak at, so it's important to build the groups based on the map objectives and personal play style.<br/><br/>The second is the actual combat, which is determined by rolling dice according to both the actions that are chosen for the groups and the relevant stat value (Armor, Dexterity, Strength, Knowledge, and Wisdom). The comparison of the attacking roll and the defending roll is done in a way that is unique to Dwarves with Swords, and makes use of all of the different die sizes that we love.<br/><br/>Another major component of the combat is Drunkenness. Every point of Drunkenness that the group has increases its combat stats while decreasing its Speed - but if the group reaches a Drunkenness level equal or greater than its Memory, the group Blacks Out and is removed from the board. All good dwarves know how to hold their booze, so being eliminated from the game this way is incredibly embarrassing!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tragedy strikes as your spaceship descends through the planet's atmosphere and crashes on its surface...You have become stranded.<br/><br/>A decision must be made: build a self-sustaining colony or find a way to get a strange alien ship working again.<br/><br/>In Stranded, you score victory points by constructing colony buildings and by investigating the alien ship. But, in addition to competing for access to best building and newly discovered technologies, you must negotiate how you will work together with other players to complete the colony or escape via the alien ship.<br/><br/>Each turn players take a number of actions with their explorers cubes depending on the cards they play. These actions can include: Claiming a part of the colony, which requires a set number of explorers, or claiming an alien technology for which you use your explorer to 'outbid' other players. Colony buildings and ship technologies when claimed are added to your hand of cards, thus increasing your ability to take additional actions in future turns.<br/><br/>Colony building and actions that repair the alien ship can be done collaboratively--and players can negotiate the completion of a specific building or the repair of a part of the ship to their advantage.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the colony is completed or the ship is fully repaired. Since players are awarded extra points for correctly forecasting which outcome ends the game, ad hoc alliances are formed as players seek to steer the game to their chosen conclusion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of triangles. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>Apart from the board, Keil differs from Go in the idea of linking points, which preserves crosscuts and ko by reducing the natural connectivity of the triangular grid.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTwo adjacent points, and any stones on them, are linked if there is another point adjacent to both that is the same type as at least one of them. Two points are the same type if they are either both empty or both occupied by stones of the same color.<br/><br/>A group is a stone along with all other like-colored stones one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked stones of that color.<br/><br/>A liberty of a group is an empty point linked to at least one stone in that group.<br/><br/>Similarly, a territory is an empty point along with all other empty points one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked empty points. You own a territory if all stones linked to points in that territory are of your color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you must pass or place a stone of your color on an empty point. After a placement, remove all enemy stones in groups without liberties. After all removals, the stone you placed must be part of a group with at least one liberty, and the current board position must be different from the board positions at the end of all your previous turns. Otherwise, your placement is illegal.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. A player's score is the number of stones of their color on the board, plus the number of points in their territories, plus komi in the case of White. The button is used to avoid ties.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomi and buttonKomi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as compensation for going second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.<br/><br/>The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button. When checking for repetitions, two identical board positions are still considered different if the button had already been taken in one of them but not in the other.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In this legend, the almighty god creator Wiraqucha gives his children, Ayar Manqu, Mama Uqllu and their siblings, a magical gold staff named the Tupayauri.

The Tupayauri is needed to be able to conquer a wamani (province). Once a wamani is conquered, its hidden &quot;Pacha Card&quot; is revealed. Within one of the 12 peripheral wamanis, the Qusqu (Cusco) card is hidden. Whoever finds Qusqu or defeats all enemy warriors, wins the game.<br/><br/>There are 5 different ayllus (clans), with 5 type of warriors each: A Guide, a Scout, a Fighter, a Hunter, and a Shaman, each with special abilities needed in the game.<br/><br/>The game also showcases llama pieces, which serve to energize attacks and as offerings to the god Wiraqucha.<br/><br/>INKAS: The Legend currently has rulebooks in English and Spanish, and a Quechua version is forthcoming.

The British forces landing near Syracuse had the shortest path, but that way was beset with numerous rivers that ran west to east and were easily defended. British airborne troops were given the task of taking the most heavily defended river position, the Primosole Bridge over the Simeto River in an attack dubbed &quot;Operation Fustian&quot;. Unbeknownst to the Allies the Germans also rushed airborne troops to help secure the position along with the Italian garrison.

        "description": "Thunder in the East, Russia at War 1877 and 1904 is an independent Age of Valor (AOV) expansion chapter or mini-module for Age of Eagles II, also known as Napoleonic Fire &amp; Fury. It covers both the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 and the later Russo-Japanese War. As such AOE II is needed to properly play this game. In most cases all rule changes have been imbedded in the Data Charts as well as the charts and tables on the Quick Reference Sheet. All players need to do is use these new specifications or DRMs with the original rules, then play as normal. Any changes unique to the Russo-Turkish and Russo-Japanese Wars, the subject of this expansion set, are included for both the conflict overall, and the included battles of Plevna, Aladja Dagh for the Russo-Turkish War, Telissu and Liao Yang scenarios for the Russo-Japanese War.<br/><br/>The AOV product line is sold direct thru digital distribution, though hardcopy versions are available from certain retailers. It is 44 pages long.

        "description": "Catfight is a very fast two-player card game in which players compete to have the strongest gang by trying to collect as many different cats as possible. Each turn, they draw two cards then either discard one card or lay down a set of cards. To lay down a set, you need at least two cards if the same gang member hasn't been played or more cards than are already on the table if it has been played. Any cards of the same gang member on the table are discarded. The round ends when one player has five different gang members, OR the draw pile is exhausted. When the draw pile is exhausted, players score for the different gang members they have laid down in front of them.<br/><br/>Just like in a fighting game, Catfight is played as &quot;first-to-2&quot;, or I think it's also known as best of three.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The Camper players try to survive the Psychopath&rsquo;s attacks and hope for rescue using the Actions, Items, Allies and Skills available in their deck of cards. If the Psychopath manages to kill all the Campers, he wins the game! However, if at least one Camper survives or manages to become rescued, the Campers win! Psychopath can also be played as a Campaign, with both sides scoring points over a predetermined number of games.<br/><br/>Psychopath is presented with a campy B-Horror Movie flavor splashed with inane commentary and featuring over-the-top, and sometimes gruesome, imagery!<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Psychopath is played in rounds. At the start of each round all players secretly select a card from their hand to be played as their starting card and place it face down on the table. When all players have done so, cards are then revealed to show the location each players is at: the Lake, the Cabin, the Shed, or the Woods. Campers unlucky enough to be at the same location as the Psychopath enter into a Struggle with him.<br/><br/>During this Struggle, the Psychopath and Campers take turns playing cards from their hand and using Keep in Play cards they have on the table they have previously put into play. Campers can play Allies, Skills, Items and Actions to bolster their defense, attempt to Escape or become Rescued, and to thwart the attacks made by the Psychopath. The Psychopath will play Items and Actions to cause Wounds to the Campers in order to weaken or kill them. After players in a Struggle have played all the cards they wish, Struggles are resolved with Campers losing cards from their hand of cards equal to the number of Wounds they suffered. If a Camper suffers more Wounds than the cards in their hand, they are killed! The Psychopath suffers his Wounds by discarding that number of cards from the top of his deck of cards. If, at the start of the next draw Phase, the Psychopath has no cards remaining in his deck, the surviving Campers escape and the game is over!<br/><br/>After all Struggles are resolved, if there are two or more Campers at the same location and they are not at the Psychopath's location, they may Collaborate by giving each other Items and Allies, and by strategizing (Campers cannot otherwise discuss strategy during the game). A new round then begins with the Campers each drawing a card from the Camper deck of cards and the Psychopath drawing cards from his deck to fill his hand of cards to its starting limit. Hand management is an important aspect of Psychopath; deciding when to play cards and when to save them in your hand for later use can mean the difference between Survival and Death!<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/><br/>126 Thick Game Cards (60 for the Psychopath, 66 for the Campers)<br/>    1 Rulebook<br/>    1 Nice Shiny Box including a 4-Way Plastic Divider for the cards with Extra Space to hold Upcoming  Expansions!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designers<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Become one of the friendly, hard-working Scandinavian tomten, completing tasks in preparation for St. Knut's day. Players will compete to collect task cards for a mix of instant rewards and engine building by working and resting their way through the holiday season.<br/><br/>A game takes place on a calendar-themed board beginning on December 1st, culminating on St. Knut's Day on January 13th. Tasks performed will cause resources to be spent, but resting (and some task rewards) can bring those resources back into the ready position. As players collect task cards, they'll build an engine by adding each card's rewards to their train of completion rewards when working, playing, or partying on holidays.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players will all join together for St. Knut's Day and score final victory bonuses based on the artwork shown on cards they've collected throughout the game. Each card features a unique illustration by Jenny Nystr&ouml;m, a Swedish painter and illustrator famous for her works featuring the jultomte performing tasks throughout the Christmas season.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Classic F1 is a lap by lap reproduction of Formula One auto racing. The game comes with all 33 Formula One champs, as well as all the active drivers from 2019. Every year, car, and constructor for each driver is represented individually and normalized across the history of the sport so you can match, for example, Fangio, Stewart, Senna or Hamilton head-to-head in any car they drove during their careers. <br/>Additional drivers are also available by decade, including a pre-1950s set including such greats as Nuvolari, Rosemeyer and Wimille.<br/><br/>Each driver card has ratings for speed &amp; tactics, qualifying, fastest laps, passing, defending, ability in the rain, accidents and potential mechanical issues, to name but a few. Speedy drivers who excel on fast tracks will do the same here, while tacticians will show their worth on hard to pass tracks like Monaco. Drivers prone to accidents will have more issues than others and cars prone to breaking down with mechanical issues will have difficulty finishing a race.<br/><br/>Each of the tracks from 2019 are represented their own chart which will determine the events during the race based on a die roll. These results may require further checks to the track chart or examining one or more driver ratings for the track action over one or more laps. Tracks that favor a fast driver will do so, while tracks that test a car&rsquo;s endurance will have more mechanical checks. Each track has its own historic weather check. The ability to pass on the various tracks is represented as well; tracks like Hungaroring will have few passing opportunities, while Monza will have more chances. Some tracks also give the driver the option for a one or two stop pit strategy. No two tracks are alike and the Track Set 2 provides an additional 20 classic circuits including Bremgarten, Detroit, Mt. Tremblant and the daunting Nurburgring &quot;Nordschleife.&quot;<br/><br/>Every aspect of F1 is here - driver, car &amp; circuit variety,  qualifying, the chaos of lap one, accidents, safety cars and breakdowns. Qualifying takes about a half hour to run; a race can be run in roughly an hour and a half. There is some basic math involved, as you do not move on a track but rather, calculate the number of &ldquo;spaces moved&rdquo; for each car/driver, based on the results of a die roll, cross-referenced against the specific race track used as well as the driver/car ratings. The positions after each turn represent a certain amount of time behind the leader and after a pre-determined number of laps have been completed the driver in the lead wins the race. The broad range of random and not-so-random results make no two races the same.<br/><br/>There has never been as detailed a representation of the sport&rsquo;s history as this game offers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;WarBonds: Battle For Vitoria&quot; is a strategy war game where players deploy and mobilize a medieval fantasy army in an effort to reign supreme amidst the war torn lands of Vitoria. Players start with a unique warlord that&rsquo;ll serve as the leader of their army, and the first unit deployed onto the Battle Map. Each warlord is vying for control and ideological dominance. All units, warlords included, have an ideological alignment that will be tried by the brutalities of war. Players will make nuanced decisions that will affect the leadership of their warlord, and the loyalty of their units.<br/><br/>One such decision involves influencing the public to incite revolt or enforce order across the land. Inciting a revolt is looked upon favorably by all chaos alignment units, but unfavorable to all law alignment units. Such a decision will cause these units to gain or lose loyalty. Units without loyalty are susceptible to leaving your army; or worse, be persuaded by the leadership of an opponent's warlord to join their army. There is no randomness; players must out-think their opponents to achieve victory.<br/><br/>To achieve victory, a player must satisfy any one of the below conditions:<br/><br/>     Be the last player with a surviving warlord and war camp.<br/>         If your warlord is killed, you lose the game.<br/>         If your war camp is destroyed, you lose the game.<br/>    <br/>     Be the first player to gain a level 3 war camp.<br/>     If the dragon arrives, when it reaches the End of Game event, have the largest army size (IE: victory points).<br/><br/><br/>When a game is fully set up and ready to start, the gameplay runs through a cycle of game rounds until one player achieves victory. A game round consists of a series of ordered turn handling for the deployed and enabled units and war camps; followed by the handling of various ordered events. The next game round starts after all aforementioned game objects have completed their respective turns, and each event has been handled. To assist with tracking and management of a game round an Initiative Table is used to indicate which in-game object&rsquo;s turn must be handled next. Players only take their turn when one of their owned and controlled in-game object is designated to take their respective turn. This cycle of starting and ending game rounds proceeds until a player achieves a victory condition, or the game reaches its final round triggering the End of Game event.<br/><br/>In WarBonds: Battle For Vitoria each player selects a single warlord from a pool of warlords for which to start their war campaign with. Afterwards, in the same order, all players select their starting war camp and warlord location on the battle map. Once war camp and warlord placement is complete, the game can now begin, starting with the player whose warlord has the lowest initiative score indicated on the Initiative Table. As each round progresses, players will select and deploy various units to make up their army.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Cards are dealt and Custom game ping pong balls are set on the playing surface, one less than the total number of players. An orange ball is always set on the table, and the rest are white.<br/><br/>Players start with 5 cards. When &quot;HIKE!&quot; is called, play begins. Each player passes a card to their left. Play continues until someone collects 5 cards of the same position (QB, RB, WR, CB, DL, LB). When this occurs, that player grabs the ORANGE ball in the center of the table and claims 6 points. This starts the FUMBLE! where the remaining players scramble to get one of the WHITE balls (one player is left without).<br/><br/>Once the balls have been claimed, players take their &quot;kicks&quot; by bouncing their ball off the playing surface into the cup. The white balls are worth 3 points (a field goal) and the orange ball is worth for 1 point (an extra point).<br/><br/>Example: In a 4 player game, Player 1 gets 5 cards of a kind first and recovers the orange ball, scoring 6 points. Players 2 and 3 each recover a white ball. Player 4 misses out on the fumble. Player 1 then &quot;kicks&quot; the orange ball for an extra point and players 2 &amp; 3 get a chance to kick a field goal for 3 points.<br/><br/>(In a round a player can earn a max of 7 points)<br/>The first player to get 21 points, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warzone Eternal is a fast-playing skirmish miniatures game in which players collect a force representing one of humanity&rsquo;s five powerful megacorporations&mdash;Bauhaus, Capitol, Cybertronic, Imperial, and Mishima&mdash;or the hordes of necrobionic warriors of Algeroth, the Dark Legion Apostle of War. Through scenario-driven battles, players will engage in the constant covert, or not so covert, fight for supremacy amongst the megacorporations or the never-ending battle against the darkness to preserve humanity&mdash;or destroy it.<br/><br/>Warzone, the classic tabletop miniatures game of skirmishes in the techno-fantasy universe of Mutant Chronicles, returns with Warzone Eternal! A massively popular miniatures game in the 1990s, Warzone captured the imagination of players with its adrenaline-fueled imagery and its quick and engaging ruleset. Res Nova seeks to recapture that spirit with Warzone Eternal and has assembled a crack team to do so.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These two factions (*Crown* and *Pirate*) play their conflict out over a two player asymmetric card game. Each player has a deck, a hand of cards, coins, and a menu of 3 actions to choose from each turn. But what each does varies substantially.<br/><br/>The *Crown* player will work in secret, laying traps and pushing for an economic victory. They score rum by founding it on an island and investing coins into it over time. They protect that investment by placing hazards in front of the island face-down. When the Pirate player tries to raid that island the Crown can decide to spend their coin to raise those hazards against the Pirate, stopping them or making them pay a terrible price. The Crown may alternatively place traps or economic investments on their islands, luring the Pirate to certain doom or increasing the momentum of the Crown's victory. If the Crown manages to hold out and score four points of rum, they win the game.<br/><br/>The *Pirate* player will assemble ships and crew. These will hopefully raid their way to where the rum is with a combination of deduction and perseverance. But regardless they will trigger and combo together unique crew's unique abilities to gain an advantage. If the Pirate finds four bottles of rum (quality doesn't matter), they win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

To do this, he will have the help of subortinated entities and various EVENTS that will occur every in-game &ldquo;hour&rdquo;.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY (overview):<br/><br/>Each round, HUMAN characters play following their specific character order. HUMAN players get two actions each turn, which can use to a) move, b) use Healing or defensive ITEMS (on themselves or on another player, adjacent to them) or c) share ITEMS with another adjacent player. Players can also skip one or both of their actions, and throw away unwanted ITEMS to clear storage space (each player can carry up to 4 ITEMS)<br/><br/>Last is the GHOST PRIEST's turn: each turn, this character plays one card from his/ her GHOST DECK: these cards show different Chess movements, that the GHOST can perform during his/ her turn.<br/><br/>After the GHOST&rsquo;s turn, the game&rsquo;s clock is moved 10 &ldquo;minutes&rdquo; and a new round begins.<br/><br/>When an in-game &ldquo;hour&rdquo; is completed, the GHOST resets his/ her deck, and takes an EVENT card: its instructions are followed by all players.<br/><br/>If a HUMAN looses all HP, get&rsquo;s WOUNDED: its unable to move, use ITEMS and has to let go of all ITEMS. If another player doesn&rsquo;t heal the WOUNDED player during 3 turns, the wounded character DIES, and transforms into another GHOST, hunting down his/ her former allies onwards.<br/><br/>Each game is set around a different story or &ldquo;game mode&rdquo;, that sets different player counts and goals. There are currently 3 different modes:<br/>&ldquo;THIEVES IN THE SHADOWS&rdquo; is a quik heist mission, with one side acting as thieves, and another defending the museum&rsquo;s artifacts (no EVENTS).<br/>&ldquo;NIGHT OF THE RITUAL&rdquo; is a 4-5 player story, involving secret objectives for each player.<br/>THE SKULL SHRINE&rdquo; is a story campaign for 2-3 players.<br/><br/>All campaigns have a time limit.

        "description": "Winter's Victory is a grand tactical, battalion level simulation of the battle of Preussisch-Eylau that occurred on February 7th and 8th in 1807 in West Prussia (modern day Poland and Russia). It pits the Emperor Napoleon's Grande Armee against the Army of Imperial Russia under General Count von Bennigsen. This winter battle was one of the bloodiest battles of the Napoleonic era. The full campaign game covers the entire two day period of this epic struggle. The game also includes smaller scenarios covering Napoleon's approach to Eylau on the afternoon of the 7th, the bloody battle of the 8th on the high ground beyond Eylau, Davout's III Corps attack against the Russian left flank, and the Prussian late day counter attack.<br/><br/>The game system uses an asymmetric sequence of play and alternating fire combat. The basic combat units are Infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. All command units, from brigade leaders to army commanders, are represented by individual counters. At 15 minute per turn and 116 yards a hex the game system allows players to make both grand tactical decisions and apply tactical techniques used by the armies of the Napoleonic period.<br/><br/>Infantry battalions are represented by being in either column formation on the front side of the counter and line formation on the reverse side. Additionally, infantry battalions may use strength points to deploy as skirmish companies represented by separate counters. Artillery units are battery or half battery sized units with separate artillery gun crews designated for each battery. Cavalry units are depicted in cavalry formation on their front sides and may suffer exhausted after a charge, flipping to their back side.<br/><br/>Cavalry SP are not squadrons. The strength of some cav units may coincidentally match their number of squadrons, but most do no not.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The prince charmings, who have not been invited, will try to infiltrate the ball to propose marriage to the girls. As a princess, you have to avoid marriage proposals and remain single and independent after the celebrations.<br/><br/>Rebel Princess takes place over five rounds, representing the five days of a party, and each round has a special rule that makes each game totally different. The general mechanisms are those of trick-taking games, in which each player plays a numbered card into each trick, following one of the four suits in the game. The player with the highest number of the suit that started the trick takes all the cards of that trick &mdash; but that's not necessarily good as players want to avoid taking cards with prince charmings, who each bring one marriage proposal, aside from the enchanted frog who brings five proposals. The player with the fewest marriage proposals after five rounds wins.<br/><br/>Importantly, each player assumes the role of a different fairy tale princess and has a special ability that they can use once per round.<br/><br/>Compared to the original edition, Rebel Princess Deluxe Edition features:<br/><br/>     Two new Princesses and new new Round cards<br/>     Princess cards upgraded to thick punchboard tiles<br/>     Round cards upgraded to Tarot-sized cards with rules text on each card<br/>     Balance tweaks to existing rules, rounds, and princesses<br/>     A new &quot;Rebel of the Ball&quot; mechanism to allow players to catch up if they are falling too far behind<br/><br/><br/>",

Mission #3: Toll Bridge&quot;: produced by &quot;BOA Publishing&quot;, this unofficial expansion of the Ambush! family of wargames requires both Ambush! and a map from Ambush! Purple Heart to play. This stand-alone mission is the third installment of a planned 4 part series.<br/><br/>Toll Bridge is an airborne mission. Your squad has been handpicked for a night drop into a lightly guarded area containing three bridges.&nbsp;You must secure at least one bridge, all three if possible, and hold until dawn when reinforcements supported by tanks will cross. The bridge garrison is small and reported to be staffed by old men and boys. As long as surprise is on your side your men shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem...<br/><br/>You may take your Medic (from Follow Me! - Mission #2) along for the ride. You also receive two Engineers to help with any explosives placed to blow the bridges. You'll even get some heavy weapons to aid you along the way.<br/><br/>In addition to Ambush!, this mission requires half map B from the Ambush! Purple Heart module<br/><br/>This mission includes the following:<br/>- 4 new vehicle summary cards<br/>- 21 new soldier cards printed on hard card stock (these must be cut out)<br/>- 10 pages of new paragraphs<br/>- 2 mission cartridges with 3 conditions<br/>- 6 page mission summary with several special rules<br/>- 1 wooden building overlay counter printed on hard card stock to be placed on the map.<br/><br/>This mission is the most complex of the series to date and it was designed so that it could be enjoyably replayed many times. There are several small events that probably won't occur on every playing and some activations create random placements of enemy forces on the map.

You must cut the maps, character sheets and counters from the book. After reading the rules, you have a short preparation time to start your first shootouts. This concept is eco-friendly (as the book is printed on demand via Amazon KDP publishing) and cheap (compared to a similar boxed game).<br/><br/>The game is designed to play in three games modes: solo, co-op, and competitive. In solo mode, you play alone against an NPC opponent. In co-op mode, you play together against an NPC opponent, and in competitive mode you play with four characters against four.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the opponent starts concealed and is approaching you. You must first try to find out where the enemy is. On your turn, you roll a die to determine how many action points you have to spend during your turn. Each NPC opponent has their own action table and reacts in a unique way. Shooting is resolved by rolling two dice and applying modifiers.<br/><br/>The game contains eight scenarios, each with their own victory conditions, that you can play in a random order. Additionally, you can play the game as a campaign, either as lawmen or as outlaws. By winning several scenarios in succession, you try to become a living legend.<br/><br/>There is also an expansion available with more scenarios and enlarged game maps.<br/><br/>The gamebook is sold, printed and delivered via Amazon.<br/><br/>The pdf-files for the game maps and counters can also be acquired separately via Wargamevault.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lights, Camera, Murder! is a Narrative mystery game inspired by SHCD.<br/><br/>Set in 1940&rsquo;s Los Angeles, you will take on the role of probationary cautionary auxiliary investigator at the Global Detective Agency and assist them on the case. All the files you need will be sent to your door, including a map of your jurisdiction and pertinent evidence. It will be yours to investigate, follow leads, interrogate suspects, study the clues, and solve the murder. Once you think you have the answers, you can write them on the Final Report included in the box, then break the seal to read the resolution and find out if you were successful in your investigation.<br/><br/>The case centers around the murder of movie-star Clara Rose and her estranged husband Joe Fletcher. They were found shot to death on the dusty backlot of Orpheum Pictures. Classic murder-suicide? Hollywood rivalries that became too real? Mob debts unpaid? Or perhaps something far more sinister... As the Global Detective Agency&rsquo;s newest recruit, it is up to you to find the truth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "La Bataille de Leipzig 1813 - La Bataille de D&ouml;litz 1813<br/><br/>The Battle of Leipzig, fought in 1813, is one of the largest conflicts ever and involved many countries / kingdoms fighting against each other. This included a coalition of Russia, Prussia and Austria committed to defeat France and its allies, forging a domination of Europe that would lead to the Nationalism of Germany. While historians have drawn a myriad of contrary opinions about who were the good guys and bad guys, the battle encircles the city of Leipzig with 500,000 man armies facing each other.<br/><br/>La Bataille de D&ouml;litz 1813 occured on October 16h, when forces under G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Division Kaminieki (Polish) and General Lefol (French) defended the line along  the Pleisse River. The river was murky and swollen from previous weeks of rainfall. Men and horses could cross the river only in a few places. These crossings were at Connewitz and D&ouml;litz. Part of the 26e Polish division defended the intact bridge at D&ouml;litz with its manor house guarding the entrance.<br/><br/>This is the area that Schwarzenberg choose to lead an assault to outflank Napoleon&rsquo;s army. Therefore Schwarzenberg committed substantial Austrian troops to this assault.While outnumbering the French and Polish forces, General der Kavallerie Graf Merveldt&rsquo;s 2nd Army Abteilung found forcing either crossing a major problem. Unable to deploy his artillery because of the swampy ground, his infantry fought a battle of attrition with an enemy in built-up areas or on the other side of a major river.<br/><br/>Merveldt has been assigned one thing however that may assist him in getting across. He has the two army pontoon and two pioneer companies. They can be used to throw a bridge across the Pleisse or repair the bridge at Connewitz. The player will note immediately the differences in the different formations and how each must be managed to achieve success.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Coalitian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated, but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate / expedite the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/><br/>This game was initially offered as print and play by Marshal Enterprises; it is now removed and available as part of the commercial La Bataille de Leipzig.<br/><br/>The scale is standard &quot;La Bat&quot;:<br/><br/>     100 meters per hex.<br/>     100 men per infantry strength point/ 50 men per cavalry strength point/ 2 to 4 guns per strength point for artillery.<br/><br/><br/>",

Designed for 2-4 players, this game combines the thrill of competition with the intricacies of managing finances, making it a captivating experience for both casual gamers and those with an interest in the financial markets.<br/><br/>In Market Works, players start with a set amount of money and a goal to be the first to accumulate $50,000 without incurring debt, or to be the last one standing after all other players have either gone bankrupt or been unable to manage their debts. The game is played with a deck of cards divided into three main types: Action, Market, and Expense cards, each playing a crucial role in the game's dynamics.<br/><br/>The gameplay revolves around investing money, handling unexpected expenses, and navigating the volatile market to maximize returns. Players can invest their money during their turn, locking it up until a Market card is played, which will determine the return on their investments based on market conditions represented by the Bull and Bear cards. Bull cards double the investments of all players, while Bear cards halve them, adding a layer of risk and strategy to the investment decisions.<br/><br/>Action cards offer players opportunities to directly influence their own financial standing or interfere with their opponents' strategies. These include the Spy card, allowing a player to view another's hand; the Rob card, which lets a player steal a card from an opponent; and the Loan card, providing a quick cash boost at the risk of incurring debt.<br/><br/>Expense cards introduce an element of unpredictability, simulating real-life financial challenges that require players to pay specified sums to the bank. These expenses must be paid with savings, adding a strategic layer to managing invested and uninvested funds.<br/><br/>Market Works is not just a game of chance; it requires strategic thinking, careful planning, and a bit of cunning to navigate the financial challenges and opportunities that arise. With its mix of competitive gameplay, financial strategy, and a dash of luck, Market Works offers high replay value, ensuring that no two games are ever the same. Players will need to adapt their strategies in response to the dynamic market conditions and the actions of their opponents to emerge victorious.<br/><br/>Whether you're looking for a fun way to spend an evening with friends or family or you're a budding financier eager to test your investment strategies in a risk-free environment, Market Works promises a compelling and enjoyable experience that will keep you coming back for more.<br/><br/>",

Leverage the plans up your sleeve into clever plays: send assistants to rally and fundraise&mdash;increasing your popularity and treasury, pander to voters directly, build public works, and work with celebrities to get out the vote.<br/><br/>To take their turns, players will be using an innovative card mechanism which allows them to control the actions of their workers. Cards are played into one of four action columns, each with three possible spaces. Each unique space connects the icons on the cards in a different way, potentially revealing bonuses on the board itself. These action include:<br/><br/>     Secure Funding: Construct a Public Works tile in this district to attract voters and increase your influence.<br/>     Celebrity Endorsement: Attract a celebrity endorsement to help get out the vote, increasing your polling in that district, and attracting new voters.<br/>     Research: Reveal the effects of a Celebrity of Public Work tile in a district, gaining support in the process.<br/>     Appeal: Spend your Popularity (credibility) to make a direct appeal to the voters of a District, increasing your polling and your vote share at game&rsquo;s end.<br/><br/><br/>After four weeks of campaigning the final vote is held! Voters are assigned to districts, players total up their vote shares in each district, and the player with the most votes wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It was the first major battle fought by regular US and UK troops, with regular Iraqi troops, against the Islamic Army of Iraq, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and several other insurgent groups, to capture and secure the city. Over six weeks from November to December 2004, Coalition forces became involved in some of the fiercest urban combat against Islamist forces, pushing them back house by house, street by street, frequently encountering prepared obstacles and improvised explosives, with heavy casualties on both sides, as well as civilians.<br/><br/>This expansion captures the high-intensity conflict faced by US and UK forces, with challenging new built-up missions and locations, and introducing Service Records into the Warfighter Modern era. This expansion offers 56 cards including:<br/><br/><br/>     4 Player Soldiers (2 US, 2 UK)<br/>     5 Non-Player Soldiers (3 US, 2 UK)<br/>     4 Squad Soldiers (3 US, 1 UK)<br/>     3 Weapons <br/>     6 Missions<br/>     6 Objectives<br/>     13 Locations<br/>     15 Hostiles<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Over the course of a 90-minute game, the players will act as councilors, local leaders, and generally important personages in a growing frontier settlement. Right now, Springsign is a &quot;quaint&quot; little town (some might even say &quot;dead-end&quot; or &quot;completely-untamable&quot;), but under the right leadership its potential is limitless. Together, the players will need to grow the town by constructing new buildings, keeping settlers fed, and fending off bandits. There's only one catch:<br/>This is not a cooperative game!<br/>The townsfolk will vote for a new mayor soon, so cooperation with the other players will only get you so far. As the players develop town, they'll also have to outmaneuver and outwit one another to garner more support for their own campaign. When the chips are down, will you do what's right for Springsign, or will you push your opponents out of power? Those greedy enough to steal victory from their opponents will be able to win, and some players may be willing to risk the town itself in their race to the top!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pax Pamini is an 18-card version of Pax Pamir Second Edition. It is a print-and-play game for free download. Thank you to Wehrlegig Games for generously granting me permission to create and post this game. Pax Pamini is a two-player game, but a solo mode is also provided in which you play against a crafty bot named Mikhran.<br/><br/>In Pax Pamini, players assume the role of nineteenth-century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.<br/><br/>In terms of gameplay, Pax Pamini is a fairly complex tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market and playing those cards in front of them in their court. Playing cards grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own tableau of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.<br/><br/>The big twist with Pax Pamini is there is no physical board. Player tableaus are organized into four columns, with each column representing one of four regions. Thus cards are in two places at once: the player's court and a location on the abstracted map. A card in your Kabul column, for example, is considered in your court. But any roads, armies and tribes on the card are also considered to be in Kabul, and can interact with your opponent's game pieces in Kabul.<br/><br/>To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a Dominance Check, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.<br/><br/>After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.<br/><br/>A note about Pax Pamini's components: there are 18 cards at the base game. The game is playable at 18 cards, but I recommend also using the bonus cards provided for a more streamlined experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With elements of take that and card taking, you must out wit other players to claim the most treasure. As a thief of the Black Hands, you can coerce members of Court into being your unwitting accomplices in this classic game of Battle of the Wits. Pull off great heists and save the King's gold ... by stealing it first.<br/><br/>Unique game mechanic!   <br/>Fun, fast and easy to learn!   <br/>Great replayability!<br/>Vibrant, hand-drawn artwork!<br/>Perfect for all ages!<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview:<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of turns called thefts. On a given theft, one player known as the Thief, will secretly choose a card to steal from the Castle.<br/><br/>All other players will try to predict what card the Thief will take and attempt to stop them. If predicted correctly, the Thief is caught and a reward is given to the captor. Otherwise, the treasure is taken.<br/><br/>Along with Treasures, Officials will be corruptible and make future thefts even more cunning and deceitful. Be warned though, as more Treasure is taken from the Castle, the stakes continue to go up and each heist becomes that much trickier.<br/><br/>The thief with the most treasure at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

In the game you will play as either the Resistance or the Occupation in a fight over the hearts and minds of the French People. The game strives to have players better understand the nuances of the Resistance and the clandestine nature of the fight that led to the founding of the modern French Republic.<br/><br/>In the Shadows will also offer a narrative solitaire option where players can take on the role of a leader of the Resistance movement. These different playable characters will allow for diverse experiences against a challenging Occupation automata. Using the same mechanics as the two player game, the solo option is focused on a more immersive gaming experience. This makes &quot;In the Shadows&quot; unique in that players will essentially be able to enjoy two different wargames in the same box.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Judge draws a Setting card and chooses a Conflict card to go with it. The other players then take turns choosing a Character card and an Advantage card from their hands. Then they must tell the story of that character in that setting. But beware, for other players can play Curse cards on you, which you must then incorporate into your story!<br/><br/>After each player has told a story, the Judge decides which one he likes the best. That player gets the Conflict card, which represents one point. The Judge card then passes to the player on the right, who becomes the next Judge for the new round of storytelling.<br/><br/>The first player to get as many points as there are players (i.e., five points in a five-player game) is the winner!<br/><br/>",

It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each expansion increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.<br/><br/>This second installment of Myths at War contains 300 cards split between the Aztec, Greek, and Elder One mythologies (GDM2+GDM4 spanish editions). Each mythology includes two pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings).<br/><br/>Each player in Myths at War needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each expansion  increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory but all expansions can be played on his own.<br/><br/>During the game, each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.<br/><br/>",

There has been a kind of special resource named &quot;core&quot; (as it is exploited from the earth core), which is of great use in the process of seeking settlement, so the UN releases the plan &quot;core&quot;.<br/><br/>In this plan, players represent giant companies of space science &amp; technology, sending airships to explore, exploit and finally settle on planets of the solar system. The game lasts for several rounds, with each round composed of a Plan Phase and a Implementation Phase. At the end of the game, the player with the most victory points is the best space settler, that is to say, the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Plan Core is a series of strategic board games, and Pathfinder is the first game in this series.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Russians then declared war, joining the remaining Austrian forces. As winter approached, the long, tenuous French supply lines through enemy territory began to crumble. Worse yet, the Prussians were forming on the border, threatening to join the coalition. Napoleon needed a victory now!<br/><br/>A master of deception, he lured the Allies into attacking by thinking he was much weaker than he really was. As the Allies attacked his right, their center became dangerously weak. As Napoleon ordered his decisive counter attack on the Pratzen Heights he stated, &ldquo;One sharp blow and the war is over.&rdquo; It was. Austerlitz became Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory.<br/>The true French Order of Battle is unknown. The Allies must attack forcefully to capitalize on French weakness. If they run into strength, they must be able to quickly transition to a secure defense. <br/> Beautiful large map. More blocks than Marengo but less than Waterloo. This hits the sweet spot.<br/>Tons of replayability. Yes, you can do what Napoleon did. This game opens things up to the many other possibilities. Craft your own brilliant plan of deception to defeat the Allies. There are many ways to approach this battle from both sides.<br/><br/>It is always fun to be Napoleon in a game but this game also presents a very interesting problem to the Allied player. There are many ways for the Allies to approach this battle. This game lets you explore and try them out.   <br/>The unknown OB also works great for solitaire play!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Earth Under Siege: Flashpoint is a 1-4 player, co-op, sci-fi dungeon crawler where players complete covert missions against an invading alien force bent on subjugation of the entire Earth.<br/><br/>Setting:<br/>The world is in chaos. Alien enemies are assaulting military bases all over the globe, obliterating any resistance before them. They attack indiscriminately and they show no mercy. They call themselves the Xethan, but where they come from is a complete mystery. They were simply not here one moment and initiating global conquest the next. If they came from space, there are no signs of it. None of the expected indicators of aliens traversing the stars, such as starships in orbit, have been observed. Indeed, the Xethan seem to possess no vehicles in their assaults at all. Instead, they rely on short range portal technology far beyond anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen, which allows them to teleport short distances bypassing many of our defenses.<br/><br/>But the situation is much worse than just that. These Xethan are being aided by an insurgent faction of human terrorists that call themselves the Vormacht who seem to be working with these alien invaders and betraying their own species.<br/><br/>It has only been six months since the Xethan first appeared and they have already conquered large numbers of military bases all across Europe. If their momentum is not halted, the human race may well fall to these alien invaders. Someone must stop them.<br/><br/>We are that someone. Now is the time. While the world is still reeling from this unexpected assault, we have not been idle. We have come together, as a species, in recognition of this greater threat to our existence. We are no longer just splintered factions of rival groups; no longer separated by our differences. Humankind has never stood so together, united, arm in arm, moving together towards this one mission. We have become AEGIS, an allied force drawn from countries all over the Earth to stand against this threat. No longer will we stay on the defensive. Now is the time we stand up and show these Xethan that humankind will not fall so easily. Now, at this flashpoint in history, we fight back.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Earth Under Siege: Flashpoint missions are heavily focused on stealth, covert actions, and sabotage. Players are Operatives of AEGIS, and their missions are focused on infiltrating enemy facilities, using every method available, such as cutting the power, using the ventilation shafts, making use of silenced weapons, and hacking into the enemy database.<br/><br/>Players develop their Operatives and HQ over the course of a 30+ mission campaign as they follow the story deeper and deeper until they uncover the true nature of the Enemy and where they came from.<br/><br/>Each round, players perform actions with their Operatives by exhausting one of their six action tokens until they run out of available tokens, or choose to pass. But players must be judicious in their use of their action tokens, because they normally only recover three of them each Refresh Phase.<br/><br/>Each Operative comes with a unique deck of Tactics cards which gives them access to powerful actions and effects. Each Player will develop these decks over the course of the campaign allowing them to tailor their gameplay to a particular style or focusing on specific combos.<br/><br/>",

Play as Orcades, a power hungry nation keen to prove their worth, or Colonia Lindis, who have been the dominant power for a long time, and now face a change in the status quo.<br/><br/>On your turn you can take one of three actions. Firstly, players can play cards for the actions listed on them. Various abilities will allow you to manipulate a number of trackers depending on your end goal.  Secondly, players can spend their cards to buy more powerful cards from a unique, asymmetric deck made up of three power levels - your Starter deck, your Prominence cards and your Dominance cards. Your Starter cards may only be used to purchase cards from the Prominence set, while these in turn can be used to bring your Dominance cards into your deck - ramping up your power and options as the game progresses. You can also choose to battle your opponent, comparing strength should they choose to fight back, but beware as even a successful battle can leave you weakened, and open to attack yourself. Finally, when your draw pile runs out you may take your Leader's action, the most powerful action available to you, that's only available when you have no options left.<br/><br/>To win the game. Orcades need to move along the International Relations track all the way to War, whilst Colonia Lindis want to move in the opposite direction toward Peace.<br/><br/>Recruit a unique roster of important figures, form volatile alliances, and fight epic battles as you vie for military and political dominance in Partisan from Earth Former Games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pollution is an interactive strategy game about building &amp; powering cities, and lobbying for political influence. Players strategically leverage their cities and power plants to amass wealth in each of the 6 rounds. However, they need to be careful about the pollution they produce: Without proper management, they'll be faced with a hefty fine at the end of the game. Political influence is used to gather permission for the construction of new power plants.<br/><br/>Different kinds of power plants &mdash; nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, and coal &mdash; each come with their distinct pros and cons, thereby influencing gameplay strategy. Building a power plant automatically unlocks the next development level, offering you an array of upgrades including more advanced versions and special abilities.<br/><br/>Players compete with each other in various ways but every competition brings lots of opportunities for synergies. On the lobbying side players inadvertently help each other in their attempt to influence politicians. On the building side player interaction is made possible by a shared map where each player can attempt to be the new energy provider for an existing city or use idle power plants for their new building project. Since a city and its corresponding power plant do not have to be built by the same player complex decisions quickly emerge.<br/><br/>Finally, there are a number of different methods to deal with pollution, from natural carbon sinks to decommissioning old power plants. These actions have to be carefully planned though as they require special circumstances to be most effective.<br/><br/>Changing setups and goals provide a high replayability factor and long-term planning.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The game is played over 6 rounds. <br/>In each round, players use their workers to perform one or two of four possible actions:<br/><br/>&quot;Lobby&quot;: Gain political influence<br/>&quot;Build&quot;: Spend resources to build a city or power plant. <br/>&quot;Offset&quot;: Implement a carbon offset project<br/>&quot;Decommission&quot;: Shut down one of your power plants.<br/><br/>Each action requires one worker. The round ends when all players have run out of workers. Now players take back their workers and gather income from the cities they have built, their lobbying efforts and the energy their power plants produced.<br/><br/>After the final round, a special income round is triggered which involves fines for all the pollution that is produced by each player. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the end of this century a rain of meteors hit the Earth, completely changing the landscape, killing the majority of people and destroying almost all signs of civilization. A few years after the impact, the remaining survivors started to gather in the ruins of cities where the effects of the meteors were less severe to try to rebuild what was left and start a new society.<br/><br/>Years have passed and some of those ruined cities have started to flourish, but the resources that could be salvaged in them are starting to run out. There are still not enough infrastructures and developments to generate all the needed resources for the growing population, so in order to survive, the people of these cities need to adventure into the Wastelands.<br/><br/>The Wastelands is a big land area that was hit especially hard by the meteors and that now is starting to be in a good enough state to be explored again. It is known that there are ruined cities to salvage resources from, but there are unknown dangers as well.<br/><br/>The need for resources, together with the different societies each of these newly populated cities have created, has led to a situation where conflict and distrust has grown among these factions. So now a race has begun to get resources, grow and develop as fast as possible to become the strongest faction to rule, not only over the Wastelands, but over all the nearby factions as well.<br/><br/>Summary<br/>Rise of the Wastelands is set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world, where resources are scarce and the remaining human survivors fight to survive and rule the devastated lands. Players lead one of the four factions with their own unique abilities. Starting from their capital, they will explore the dynamically generated map, discovering new areas and establishing outposts to recycle materials. With these newly generated resources, they can construct buildings and units, all while striving to upgrade their technology and gain a strategic advantage. This will allow players to accomplish the ever-changing achievements and let them spread their influence to rule over the other players.<br/><br/>Winning the Game<br/>The goal of the game is to spread at least 5 of your influence tokens among the other players. When the game is over, if only one player has been able to accomplish that, they are declared the winner. In the event that two or more players have achieved that, the player that has given away more influence tokens wins the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>In Rise of the Wastelands there are no rounds or phases. Players take turns one after another until a player claims their 5th achievement at the end of their turn. Then, the rest of the players play one more turn.<br/><br/>On their turn, players do the following in sequential order:<br/>1- Allocate influence. <br/>2- Perform actions.<br/>3- Claim achievements.<br/>4- Reset action points<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CONTENTS OF THE BOX: 1 rulebook, 86 cards, 6 help cards, 1 Purple 4-sided dice and 1 score papers.<br/><br/>Coles is a fun card game aimed specifically for children for his easy subject and at the same time makes them working memory and the development of the strategy.<br/><br/>It is easy to play, since every player will have to go down letters by order of turn one by one from his hand to the table for it linking types of cabbages in groups. Everything is seemingly easy but we will have to consider some rules at the end of the round: the sum of odd of the same type of cabbage groups not scoring, only scoring the pairs group (as this group of two, four, six...). If you manage to collect one of each type you will have an extra points. On the other hand, there are cards that have a skill modifier since I could throw a die and exchange that number by another rival cards to avoid or undo it groups, and we add them to our convenience, other letters of discard and others bid on the table to the fastest pinch it with your hand over.<br/><br/>The mechanics is go down cards of different types of cabbage from the hand to the table turns and try to form peer groups or quintets (odd no total points).<br/><br/>There are some cards that have a special ability:<br/><br/>&quot;Coles de Bruselas&quot; (Brussels sprouts) --&gt; allow Brussels sprouts that have bids in the center of the table.<br/><br/>&quot;Col blanca&quot; (White cabbage) --&gt; finally the extra cards are double points.<br/><br/>&quot;Repollo&quot; (Cabbage) --&gt; when you throw a card, you can throw another card.<br/><br/>&quot;Lombarda&quot; (Red cabbage) --&gt; it to table you can launch a 4-sided die indicating the number of cards to exchange with another rival.<br/><br/>&quot;Coliflor&quot; (Cauliflower)  --&gt; it's the key for the lombarda ability.<br/><br/>&quot;Col podrida&quot; (Rotten cabbage) --&gt; allows to discard cards to remove points to rivals.<br/><br/>&quot;Comod&iacute;n&quot; (Joker card) --&gt; it's copy other cabbage.<br/><br/>At the end there will be a count of points noted in a book and win that most points obtained in 2 rounds of play.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL LANGUAGE  (SPANISH):<br/><br/>CONTENIDO DE LA CAJA: 1 reglamento, 86 cartas, 6 cartas de ayuda, 1 dado morado de 4 caras y unas hojas de puntuaci&oacute;n.<br/><br/>Coles es un divertido juego de cartas dirigido especialmente para los ni&ntilde;os por su f&aacute;cil tem&aacute;tica y al mismo tiempo les hace memorizar y desarrollar estrategias.<br/><br/>Es f&aacute;cil de jugar, ya que cada jugador tendr&aacute; que bajar cartas por orden de turno uno por uno de su mano a la mesa para as&iacute; ligar a los tipos de coles en grupos. Todo es aparentemente f&aacute;cil pero tenemos que tener en cuenta algunas reglas al final de la ronda: la suma de impares del mismo tipo de grupos de col no punt&uacute;a y los pares s&iacute; (grupo de dos, cuatro, seis...). Si se consigue un tipo de cada col positiva, que son cinco, se obtendr&aacute; una bonificaci&oacute;n de puntos extra. Por otro lado, hay cartas que tienen un modificador de habilidad ya que permiten lanzar un dado y cambiar un n&uacute;mero de cartas con otro rival hasta un m&aacute;ximo seg&uacute;n el n&uacute;mero que salga en el dado para evitar o deshacerse de grupos, y a&ntilde;adimos a nuestra conveniencia, otras cartas permiten hacer a los dem&aacute;s descartes y otras permiten pujas sobre la mesa seg&uacute;n se ponga antes que los dem&aacute;s la mano r&aacute;pidamente sobre la carta.<br/><br/>La mec&aacute;nica es ir bajando cartas  de diferentes tipos de col de la mano a la mesa y tratar de formar grupos de pares o quintetos (los grupos impares no suman). Hay algunas cartas que tienen una habilidad especial:<br/><br/>&quot;Coles de Bruselas&quot; --&gt; permiten pujar cartas en el centro de la mesa.<br/><br/>&quot;Col Blanca&quot; --&gt; al final de la partida, las cortas sobrantes pares tienen valor doble.<br/><br/>&quot;Repollo&quot; --&gt; al bajar un repollo puedes bajar otra carta de tu mano a la mesa.<br/><br/>&quot;Lombarda&quot; --&gt; cumpliendo un requisito (tener al menos dos parejas de tipos de col diferente y una de ellas ha de ser de coliflor) permite lanzar el dado de 4 caras morado, indicando el n&uacute;mero m&aacute;ximo de cartas que se pueden intercambiar con otro rival.<br/><br/>&quot;Coliflor&quot; --&gt; es la llave para activar la habilidad de la lombarda.<br/><br/>&quot;Col podrida&quot; --&gt; permite descartarle cartas a los rivales para romperles sus agrupaciones y estrategias, permitiendo quitarles puntos.<br/><br/>&quot;Comod&iacute;n&quot; --&gt; copia la habilidad de otra col.<br/><br/>Al final habr&aacute; un recuento de puntos en una libreta de puntuaci&oacute;n y ganar&aacute; el que m&aacute;s puntos haya conseguido en 2 rondas de juego.<br/><br/>",

The Japanese struck back in turn, and fierce naval battles raged in &ldquo;Ironbottom Sound&rdquo; by night while aircraft carriers dueled by day. The Americans and their Australian allies steadily fought their way up the Solomons chain until the Japanese base at Rabaul was finally isolated in June 1943.<br/><br/>South Pacific is a complete Second World War at Sea boxed game based on the Solomons Campaign of 1942 and 1943. It covers the naval battles of Guadalcanal, the carrier battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz, the battles of Vella Gulf, Empress Augusta Bay and Kolombangara, and much more.<br/><br/>South Pacific includes over 1,000 silky-smooth, die-cut playing pieces representing the ships and aircraft of the United States, Japan and Australia that fought in the campaign. The 22x28-inch map includes all of the Solomon Islands plus the surrounding seas, and overlaps with the maps from our Strike South game on its western edge.<br/><br/>Unique in the Second World War at Sea series, South Pacific includes not only the standard, generic Tactical Map but also a special Tactical Map showing &ldquo;Ironbottom Sound&rdquo; north of Guadalcanal, where so many Japanese and American ships and sailors would be lost.<br/><br/>There are over 60 scenarios, organized in our popular &ldquo;story arc&rdquo; format that weaves the narrative of the campaign into the scenarios, allowing them to tell the story of this pivotal series of battles.<br/><br/>",

Then, it will be time to prepare your agenda: use your votes in international organizations to secure their support, obtain allied governments with the help of your influences and have your spies ready in case of conflict. But try to get a good public image achieving your leader's objectives in each round... or everything will become more difficult.<br/><br/>Statecraft is a deeply interactive political board game that reproduces some of the most relevant situations of recent history. It is played in four rounds plus a final bonus points round. At the end, the power with the highest score will be declared the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Halberds tend to be a relatively cheap weapon to produce, but those made for Lannister troops are still of the highest quality, almost guaranteed to never break, even when receiving a charge from enemy cavalry. And receiving a charge is just what these men are trained to do, and do it well.<br/><br/>The Lannister Halberdiers unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Lannister commanders new options for their forces. The unit is formidable in both offensive and defensive capacities, not losing dice after their first rank is destroyed, and being able to brace for an enemy charge, granting them a preemptive attack against their foes. The addition of an Assault Veteran Unit Attachment gives them staying power once battle has been met, adding extra dice to their melee attacks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The forward view was improved with changes on wings and cabane struts, and this aircraft was appreciated for its impressive climb rate and for its frontal twin machine gun. It was flown by a number of famous German aces such as Oswald Boelcke and Manfred von Richthofen and the Hungarian Rudolf Von Szepessy.<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>This is not a complete game.<br/><br/>",

Following the assassination of the High Council that used to unite the kingdoms, trust is gone. Rival rulers now vie for dominance, striving to be the one that rules them all.<br/><br/>Welcome to The Fall of Kingdoms - a fast-paced strategic social deduction board game. Your goal here is to outsmart other players, destroy their realms, and be the last kingdom standing. Each player starts the game with three Character cards (two known, one unknown), two Destiny cards, two coins, and a kingdom board with Defense at 3 and Morale at 2.<br/><br/>The game ends for a player when their kingdom's Defense hits zero or when all of their Character cards are eliminated. To navigate through this complex landscape of power and deception, players have a variety of strategies and tools at their disposal:<br/><br/><br/>     Character Cards: Players use these to sabotage, spy, manipulate, assassinate, attack, and fortify against rivals, leveraging the unique abilities of each Character to gain an upper hand.<br/>     Destiny Cards: These cards introduce over 30 unpredictable events that can dramatically shift the course of gameplay, offering surprises that can be used to a player&rsquo;s advantage.<br/>     Diplomacy: A key aspect of the game where players negotiate to join forces, make threats, and manipulate other rulers, navigating a complex web of alliances and betrayals.<br/>     Bluff: Players can bluff about their Character cards and Destiny cards, using the element of surprise to outsmart opponents and secure a tactical edge.<br/>     Accuse: A strategic move where players can eliminate an opponent&rsquo;s Character card from play by correctly guessing which Character they are using.<br/>     Kingdom Attack: This action allows a player to directly attack other kingdoms, aiming to reduce their Defense and bring it closer to destruction.<br/>     Morale: Represents the economic health and spirit of a kingdom, influencing its cash flow and ability to carry out certain actions.<br/><br/><br/>The game scales seamlessly between 2 to 7 players and is designed for quick, engaging sessions lasting 20 to 40 minutes. Each player will have one minute max during their turn, ensuring that The Fall of Kingdoms remains fast-paced and engaging throughout. This blend of strategic depth, the unpredictability of Destiny cards, and the dynamic player interactions through diplomacy and deception creates a richly immersive experience that is both challenging and rewarding.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You'll have to underhandedly and surprisingly steal your friend's corporations, before they steal yours.<br/><br/>Players are dealt a specific amount of corporations to start the game. Then are dealt a hand of five cards. These cards represent the player's assets. The player's assets could be money, power, or stocks. During a players turn, they can try to discard cards, to work on their assets, or they can attempt to take a corporation from a rival.<br/><br/>When working on your assets, you may discard up to three cards, and then draw back up to five cards.<br/><br/>When attacking a player, declare which corporation you are attacking, and with what choice. Players then show their hands and the one with the most power wins.<br/><br/>First to the set number of corporations (based on players) is the most successful tycoon and wins the game!<br/><br/>",

All players will have four Tops and four Bottoms; combining one each of these cards creates a description or phrase that we call a &quot;Name&quot;. Every round, a Judge will draw and read an Adventure -- a description of a fanciful and often naughty act -- out loud to the players. The other players each attempt to create a name for the Adventure from the cards in their hand and submitting it secretly. The Judge reads the submissions out loud and chooses the best name to win the round; its owner becomes the Judge for the next round. The game continues until a player has accumulated a number of wins  based on the total number of players, or everyone has laughed enough.<br/><br/>Oscar's Hot Night Out is a different kind of adult party game. Are there naughty words? Yes, most certainly. Adult Situations? Absolutely! But, Oscar's Hot Night Out is a raunchy game designed  for everyone to enjoy -- whatever your preference or background, you're welcome at this table (as long as you can handle the occasional dirty word...) Oscar's Hot Night Out is a sex positive party game that celebrates what two (or more) consenting adults can get up to without condemnation or judgement. The game can be played by all genders and creeds. Oscar's Hot Night Out is not about creating uncomfortable shock humor or belittling other sexes and sexuality; it is fundamentally about the delight everyone gets from devilishly naughty turns of phrase and the fanciful acts they describe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Army of Roussillon (AOR) is the eleventh volume in the Lace Wars series and the first in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV. As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France's borders. This was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King's ultimate aim this was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis' war of middle age - a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men.<br/><br/>Spain, then ruled by the Bourbon kings' great rival, the House of Habsburg, joined the Grand Alliance, but she soon wished she had not. The Army of the Sun King was the premiere military machine of its age, the Spanish Army a fallen titan. Nevertheless, the Spanish saw the war through to its end. While her exhausted allies struck secret peace deals, Spain fought on. Only with the taking of Barcelona in 1697 did she sue for peace - and the decision to capitulate came from Madrid, not its garrison. Barcelona held for 63 days against a massive bombardment and multiple assaults that left 15,000 French dead on her glacis and in her shattered bastions. By the end, both sides were wondering if they would have the strength to fight another round.<br/><br/>Catalonia was a secondary front. For much of the war the French fielded fewer men than the Spanish and were kept on a tight leash. The man in charge, Anne Jules de Noailles, II Duc de Noailles, was governor of Roussillon, formerly part of Catalonia. His Intendant, or 'commissar', was a Catalan. They hoped to harness one of the periodic peasant revolts that plagued the region and 'win hearts and minds' for France - or at least keep the Army of Spain dancing to their tune. Unfortunately, Noailles could not get his subordinates to buy into this program; the arrogance inherent in traditional military culture alienated the population and the French found themselves involved in a nasty guerrilla war. Only after Spain's allies began to withdraw from the struggle were the French able to bring overwhelming force to bear against her.<br/><br/>In AOR, you will have a chance to change history - and even if you cannot, perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books.<br/><br/>As the French, will you pursue a hearts and minds strategy, or try for all out conquest? Will you occupy territory or make surgical strikes aided by your fleet? (Be warned, the family that runs the Ministry of Marine is at odds with the family that runs the Ministry of War.) The French Army is state-of-the-art. You have more artillery, the latest equipment (bayonets instead of pikes), and access to an administrative machine capable of supporting nearly 500,000 men. But you command a secondary front. Versailles will forever be taking regiments away from you, forcing you to rely on local militia and even Catalan renegades. If you garrison every post, you will be too weak to go on the offensive. If you give up captured fortresses to concentrate, the local population will believe you are weak and rise against you. If you do nothing, you will lose the respect of the Sun King and the Court ladies.<br/><br/>As the Spanish, can you keep the French at bay? Or can you damage them enough to try a counter-invasion of Roussillon? Will the English send their fleet and land troops to aid you? Or, will the Holy Roman Emperor divert his attention from the Turks long enough to spare you some Imperial regiments? The Spanish Army, led by a succession of viceroys who often found themselves more in conflict with the local Catalan government than with the French, is a motley collection of regular regiments (the tercios), decent cavalry, poorly motivated and equipped militia, and mercenaries. Spain's best assets are her guerrillas, the migueletes, assisted by vigilante bands known as somaten, and the mountainous Catalan terrain.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>1) Two map sections representing the northeast corner of Spain at one league (4 Km) per hex.<br/><br/>2) 600 die cut counters representing the forces of the French and the Spanish and their allies. Scale is Battalion - that is, the playing pieces represent battalions and regiments.<br/><br/>3) Rules, charts, tables, and display cards.<br/><br/>4) An historical commentary.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1920 is a two-player, intermediate complexity, strategic-level wargame simulation of the  &quot;Polish-Soviet War&quot; the Soviet attempt to conquer Poland. Soviet and Polish forces engulf each other in swift campaigns, fighting on a large area stretching from Kiev and Smolensk in the East to Warsaw and Thorn in the West. Will the Red Army prevail and bring happiness and peace to the German and French working classes or will the Poles pull off a magnificent victory one can only describe as a 'miracle'? It only needs two players to find out an answer to this question in this exciting 2 hour wargame.<br/><br/>Players can learn the game via four short scenarios, being gradually introduced to the game mechanics and quickly able to grasp the accurate concept of lines of control, surprising rail transfers, and morale advantages and understand the strategic ramifications of the theater of war. Further rules cover army morale advantages, revolutionary mobilization organized by the hated Soviet political police the Cheka, the torn loyalties of the Ukrainians, fighting on both sides of the front and the formation of the Polish Volunteer Army.<br/><br/>A plethora of formations and units appear in the game: the Latvian Rifles, the dreaded Budyenny's Horse Army, counter-revolutionary Russian, Belorussian and Cossack troops, various Polish formations including the Siberian Brigade, support units such as tanks, flotillas, armored cars and above all armored trains, which were extensively used in the campaign.<br/><br/>",

The Specific Rules will cover the game scenario itself, with rules dedicated to this battle and where game turns will be 12 hours long (instead of one day per GT). In the historical campaign game there is no way for the Italians to win; the two players, or teams, will play the Austro-German and Italian right wing, against the Austro-German and Italian left wing. In detail, Krauss and Stein Groups attacking the Italian IV Corps, and Berrer and Scotti Groups attacking the Italian VII Corps and part of the XXVII.<br/><br/>The map will run from Mount Canin and Rombon on the West to Tolmino bridgehead on the East, and from Plezzo and Monte Nero on the North to Cividale and the Friuli plains on the South. It will be divided in sectors where each player, or team, will have to achieve its objectives faster than the opponent.<br/><br/>The campaign game will be big, with 2 maps, and over 1000 units and markers, but short, from October 24th to October 27th, when general Cadorna gave the order of general withdrawal in front of an unrecoverable situation. By that time, after 8 Game Turns, the Austro-German troops should have run across the whole map. Caporetto campaign game is a rush, but also a study of two different approaches to warfare in World War One. In Caporetto 1917 you will find units and specializations from the former two games, beside Stosstruppen, Arditi, gas and mine attacks, and more. Small scenarios will cover specific episodes of this epic confrontation, and an alternative campaign game, with Austro-German and Italian counterparts, where the Italian player can freely deploy its reserves (only), and can test if the battle could have gone better for the Italian colors.<br/><br/>Welcome to the mobile warfare in the Great War.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fields of Fire is a solitaire game of commanding a rifle company between World War II and the Present Day. The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based. There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, and various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single game is a mission and several missions from a historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 &ndash; 4 hours.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s New in the Deluxe Edition<br/><br/>Fields of Fire Volume I Deluxe Edition is a completely improved edition of Fields of Fire Volume I. Based on the past 15 years of feedback, hundreds of hours of playtesting, and long discussions with the design team, the Deluxe Edition presents Ben Hull&rsquo;s masterpiece of tactical infantry command in a way that is accessible to the modern gamer while retaining all of the deep complexity that veteran players have grown to love over the years.<br/><br/>New features Include:<br/><br/>- A Rewritten series rulebook. The Deluxe Edition comes with a rewritten third edition ruleset, packed with examples, diagrams and clarifying notes while maintaining continuity with the second edition rules. Series Developers Andrew Stead and Colin Parsons have worked to eliminate ambiguities and edge cases throughout, creating a much-improved reference manual for play.<br/><br/>- A Starter Guide. While Fields of Fire has a reputation for being difficult to learn, the Starter Guide makes it easy. Each chapter in the Starter Guide incrementally introduces new rules through training exercises that teach you the basics of infantry combat. Later exercises act as advanced guides on setting up for air assaults and making the best use of supporting vehicles.<br/><br/>- A Full Starter Mission. A stand-alone mission tailored towards easing new company commanders into the full game. This mission can be played repeatedly with a variety of simplified rules to allow you to adjust to the full historical campaigns.<br/><br/>- Four Fully Redesigned Mission Books. Using the much-improved format from Fields of Fire: The Bulge Campaign, the Normandy, Heartbreak Ridge, Naktong River and Vietnam campaigns are presented in a clarified and expanded manner.<br/><br/>- Over 200 updated counters plus various additional reference markers and new units.<br/>  <br/>- New elevation cards to enhance the Heartbreak Ridge campaign.<br/><br/>- A completely new set of redesigned player aids including new charts and air assault planning cards.<br/><br/>This game is based on four actual campaigns experienced by units of the 9th US Infantry (Regiment) in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The 9th infantry are known as the &quot;Manchus&quot; for their service in the Boxer Rebellion. Their motto is &ldquo;Keep Up the Fire.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with 3 meeples of his color and can do the following actions: walk up to 2 spaces apart, the maximum height that a miner can climb or descend is 2 tiles high. Use or draw up to 2 cards and the main action: mine a tile just below one of your miners. Mining means revealing the tile that can be a precious tile that will be worth points to the player, a natural disaster or a monster. All effects are resolved immediately.<br/>The game takes place in turns and each player can take each of the actions listed above on its turn.<br/>There are 3 colors of tiles, from the lightest and superficial, with less dangers and less riches, to the darkest and deepest, with more dangers and riches and also where is the only diamond tile. When any player takes the diamond, the game is over and the points are counted. Whoever has the most points wins the game.<br/>The diamond is worth many points but does not guarantee victory.<br/>To help move around the board, players can use a deck of equipment, including bridges and ladders that increase the possibility of locomotion, as well as dynamites that speed up and increase the danger for miners.<br/>It's a fun family game that can be quite chaotic, in a good way.<br/><br/>&mdash;Developer description<br/><br/>",

The type of card is chosen based on the movements of the pawns after the counting of points at the end of each round. Except for the third type of card, for which all players answer independently, the other two types allow the players to write false but convincing answers or definitions. Players score points by both hitting the real answer and convincing other players that your definition is the correct.<br/><br/>",

All these actions can be fought by releasing pieces, clearing pathways, by rescuing isolated blocks and attacking blocks that impede movement termination. <br/>A more strategic complexity is achieved with the four-player mode in teams of two; playing with half the blocks of his team each player has two opponents and one ally.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the far future, humans have spread across the galaxy. Gigantic ships ply the stars - stars that lie under the shadow of a terrible swarm. The militaries of humanity are joined in an impossibly huge fleet to dam the bugs&rsquo; advance, but many planets have already fallen.  While the bulk of the fleets weighs anchor for refit, a fast cutter is dispatched to Helos - one such ruined world - with a complement of one hundred volunteers. They have ninety days to rescue as many stranded survivors as they can.<br/><br/>Operation Last Train is a solo or cooperative game designed to use sci-fi soldiers from any range in any combination. Teams of six volunteers drop in mixed units to rescue civilians. They are opposed by a never-ending tide of ravening bugs. Fast combat and a simple AI make for quick and exciting games that fit on a kitchen table. Track the status and experience of each volunteer and rotate rosters to meet the needs of the day. This is a game of emergent narrative. It&rsquo;s easy to make the world personal and engaging. The volunteers may come from every company and regiment the future could hold. No two drops need look or play the same.<br/><br/>Each turn, a volunteer may take a move action and a shoot action (any melee combat is resolved as part of the move action that brings volunteers and bugs into contact). Combat is resolved with ten-sided dice.  The bugs have no ranged capabilities - in any shoot action, the bugs are either missed, knocked down, or killed depending on the roll.  In melee, the volunteers' roll decides everything: a volunteer's failure is her enemy's success. A volunteer's load-out and regiment determine how many dice she rolls, and what qualifies as a hit. After the volunteers have performed all of their actions, a simple AI governs the movement of any bugs on the table.<br/><br/>Scenarios lay out the specifics of the volunteers' objectives.  The game ends when those objectives are met, or all volunteers are off of the table. Generally, objectives revolve around searching for, and escorting survivors off the table.<br/><br/>",

In addition to the effects of the first stage, in Kings of Ruin it also boots the Health regeneration. Naturally, you can upgrade it to the third state with an Action.<br/><br/>Finally, the third stage of the camp adds some shelter, secured by runes and wyrdcandles. As expected, this final stage provides some protection against Wyrdness in Kings of Ruin, helping players on deeper forays into the wyrd-covered side of the map, or allowing them to survive better if for some reason all waystones were extinguished. <br/> Since Location cards in Tainted Grail: Kings of Ruin are only removed when you travel from one major part of the island to another, the Campsite will stay in place until you decide to tear it down. But since getting it to the final stage is quite an investment, better be sure where you want to build it.

While recovering the Kraters lies at the heart of the Gods' contest, they may also be impressed by the triumphs you accomplish at the city steps, and the company you keep might help to sway their choice of a victor.<br/><br/>The Immortals stand at the precipice of Olympus; breath held, attention turned to the mortal realm. Only one will join the Olympians, while the other will fade into antiquity as another forgotten spawn of the gods.<br/><br/>Whispers of the Muse | Omen Game 3 is a standalone card game for two players.<br/><br/>Like the other new Omen games, this standalone game features 22 Unique Unit cards and 6 Unique Krater cards, each offering new Traits and abilities, and is fully compatible with all new (and unreleased) Omen games.<br/><br/>Each Omen game is played over a series of player turns and ends when all three Cities have been destroyed (or when a player has a certain number of cards in their Rewards). Each City is comprised of 2 Krater cards. Players spend Coins to play Units to these Cities, and once a City become Sacked, the City is resolved and the player with the most Strength at that City gains 1 of the Krater cards at that City (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Krater's ability).<br/><br/>The turn structure is broken into five Steps:<br/><br/>WEALTH: The active player receives 3 Wealth Actions. Each Wealth Action is used to draw a Unit or gain a Coin. However, if a player spends all of their actions on the same resource, they receive a bonus resource!<br/><br/>SURGE: The active player spends their coins to play Units from their hand to their side of the Cities. Unit cards with certain Traits can also be discarded during the Surge Step for an ability. Cards played to a player's side of a City boost their Strength in that City.<br/><br/>PORTENT: The Active player will follow the abilities of any Units on their side of the Cities with the Glean Trait.<br/><br/>WAR: Any Sacked Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is Sacked if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).<br/><br/>OFFERING: The Active player can discard 1 card from their hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.<br/><br/>While this game reimplements Omen: A Reign of War, it is not compatible with any previous Omen: a Reign of War title or expansion.<br/><br/>",

Formed in 1942, and after almost two years of rigorous training, Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, dropped into Normandy, France, on D-Day, June 6th, 1944. By the end of the war, Easy Company was known as one of the best small units in the European Theater of Operations. The men of Easy Company have been immortalized in the book and mini-series Band of Brothers; now their story is played out in the dynamic medium of the Lock 'n Load Tactical system.<br/><br/>The We Stand Alone expansion module contains 15 scenarios, covering battles from the daring assaults on Brecourt Manor and Carentan, in Normandy, to the desperate defense of Hell's Highway and The Island, during Operation Market Garden, to the frigid foxholes of Bastogne and Noville, during The Battle of the Bulge. The scenarios can be played individually or in three five-scenario campaigns. Thirteen of the 15 scenarios are new designs, with two revised scenarios, plus a Brecourt Manor variant. Three new Maps, including winterized and revised Maps, bring the dramatic landscape of these battles to life: Entrenched German artillery positions in Normandy, an elevated dike and a watchful windmill in Holland, and chilly cratered forests of the Ardennes provide the setting; it's up to you to provide the leadership, heroics, and actions needed to win victory for the brave American paras or the obstinate Germans they faced.<br/><br/>The men of Easy Company were elite soldiers. Whether in the heat of battle or when battling the elements between contact with the enemy, they fought for each other. They fought for victory. And they fought for survival. Join the fight!<br/><br/>Requirements:  To play We Stand Alone &ndash; Battles of Easy Company you must own Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical &ndash; Heroes of Normandy and we highly recommend the Heroes of Normandy X-Maps or 4K X-Maps.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Critical Hit webpage:<br/><br/>WINGEN-SUR-MODER, FRANCE, 4 January 1945: Shortly before the crack of dawn on 4 January sleeping American soldiers were suddenly awakened by what some on the scene described as &ldquo;the most intensive machine-gun and automatic weapon fire that any had ever heard.&rdquo; Disoriented GIs awoke to the sudden outburst of fire but there was no panic. German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture Wingen-sur-Moder, situated along the road net needed for Operation Nordwind. The attacking enemy forces struck Wingen at the first light of day and rapidly moved through the village. In the confusion that followed, Company A lost communications with Companies B and C, and for a time the Company was without radio contact with the Battalion CP in the Kirchberg. Within the company perimeter confusion made it difficult for the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants to get their men organized. Nearly every squad was on its own. Their reaction to the sudden attack was left to the judgment of the individual squad leaders. By 0900 hours the Germans had captured and occupied the town, the high ground to the northeast of town, and established a bridgehead on the south bank of the Moder River. They immediately went about establishing a perimeter defense around the village then prepared to continue their attack southward toward Saverne.<br/><br/>During the first days of January 1945 German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture the towns that lay along the snow-covered route of attack. One of these towns was Wingen, along the Moder River. American units there were initially caught by surprise as battle-hardened troopers from the 6th SS Mountain Division stormed in and captured the town. American reinforcements were soon pouring in from the west and the south and despite bitter fighting, by January 5th the German offensive had been brought to a standstill. Lacking exits from the Vosges, planned armored reserves stood idle and Operation Nordwind ended in failure. Wingen sits in a small valley along the Moder River between Bitche to the north and Saverne to the south. Described in the following bucolic terms, &ldquo;...the village and the surrounding area looked very much like a winter scene one might expect to find on a Christmas card back home. Smoke rising from a few chimneys made the houses appear warm and inviting...&rdquo; Wingen would erupt on 3 January 1945 and become the focal-point of Operation Nordwind.<br/><br/>",

The major powers are preparing for the contest, but its resources for such an undertaking are very limited due to the social changes of recent times.<br/>That's why the big companies charge each nation to find and acopien resources. Where where more then abound.<br/>On Mars.<br/>Who has the power in these resources will have much of the war won.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Descripci&oacute;n del Juego:<br/>&ldquo;Extraordinarios aparatos y m&aacute;quinas maravillosas han permitido a los poderosos imperios europeos  de principios del s. XX  viajar hasta Marte. El descubrimiento del Unobtanium, metal de dureza imposible, en las  profundidades del rocoso suelo marciano, han  acrecentado las pol&iacute;ticas militaristas entre las grandes potencias en los primeros meses de 1914.Representas a unas de las Compa&ntilde;&iacute;as Mineras de los imperios, que agrupadas alrededor del Emporio Terrestre y compelidas por la guerra en ciernes, intentan establecer su dominio en el suelo marciano. <br/>Al final del juego triunfar&aacute; aquella compa&ntilde;&iacute;a que haya conseguido extraer m&aacute;s minerales y colonizar la mayor&iacute;a de regiones marcianas.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Mars Mineral War (1914) es un juego de mayor&iacute;as, gesti&oacute;n de recursos y colocaci&oacute;n de trabajadores,   en el que los jugadores utilizan un mazo de cartas propio para gestionar las acciones. <br/>Las cartas representan  los distintos &ldquo;Contratos de Explotaci&oacute;n&rdquo; que el Emporio Terrestre ha concedido a las Compa&ntilde;&iacute;as que  intentan extraer el preciado Unobtanium. <br/>Cada jugador posee un mazo de 20 cartas (Contratos). Cada mazo tiene el mismo tipo de Contratos pero diferenciados por los Logos y el color de cada una de las Compa&ntilde;&iacute;as. As&iacute; los jugadores gozan de  las mismas oportunidades de jugar cada carta   pero, dado que los mazos est&aacute;n mezclados  y boca abajo, esas opciones se presentaran para cada uno de ellos  en momentos distintos de la partida. Adem&aacute;s, bajo ciertas condiciones, tambi&eacute;n podr&aacute;n usar los Contratos de Explotaci&oacute;n  de las otras  Compa&ntilde;&iacute;as<br/>Al principio de la partida los jugadores barajan su mazo y lo dejan boca abajo. Al finalizar la primera ronda deber&aacute;n volver a mezclar su mazo de descartes y colocarlo, de nuevo, boca abajo. Los mazos que en la primera ronda eran id&eacute;nticos,  en la segunda ronda  contienen cartas de  los otros jugadores o descartes previos. <br/>Concretamente en su turno cada jugador toma  cuatro cartas (Contratos de Explotaci&oacute;n) de su mazo, elige una de ellas y la descarta boca arriba en un mazo de descartes propio, despu&eacute;s escoge otra de las cartas de su mano y la pasa al jugador de su izquierda. <br/>Posteriormente  los jugadores  juegan o descartan, una a una,  las tres cartas que quedan en su mano. <br/> Los Contratos de Explotaci&oacute;n (cartas)   permiten explorar la superficie marciana o bien realizar distintas acciones:<br/>i.- Realizar una o dos  acciones  sobre la Superficie del Planeta (iniciar explotaciones, ubicar trenes-oruga, reubicar minas, etc). <br/>ii.- Realizar una o dos acciones de Gesti&oacute;n y/o Explotaci&oacute;n en el Tablero de Emporio (formar mineros en los barracones, extraer Unobtanium, vender el mineral, reasignar recursos, conseguir contenedores de energ&iacute;a de Oort).<br/>iii. Descartase de dos cartas  y obtener, a cambio,  contenedores de energ&iacute;a o nuevos mineros formados de los barracones.<br/>iv.-Descartarse de una carta y obtener, cada jugador, una unidad de energ&iacute;a.<br/>Cada Contrato de Explotaci&oacute;n ejecutado  conlleva un gasto en energ&iacute;a. Adem&aacute;s si el contrato originalmente pertenece a otra Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a supondr&aacute;  un gasto extra de energ&iacute;a. El mantenimiento de las instalaciones sobre la Superficie de Marte tambi&eacute;n genera un coste de energ&iacute;a.<br/>El jugador con mayor n&uacute;mero de puntos de victoria despu&eacute;s del recuento de las dos rondas del juego ser&aacute; el ganador.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brave Sir Chauncey is a brave knight, not afraid to get his gloves dirty or his sword bloody. Indeed, someone would say he enjoys it. Sir John is known for being the first into any battle and the last to leave, the most violent of the knights and yet, somehow, the one who has survived the longest. He will attack just about every problem with his sword, dive into battles he has nothing to do with, and come out of it smelling of roses - and blood.<br/><br/>Sir Beauregard was a young man when this began. Other knights teased him, calling him Beauregard the Pure, Beauregard the Chaste, even the more so when the wenches of the village were particularly accommodating to a pretty-faced young man. He has aged horribly since the zombies first showed up, losing much of his naivete and hope for life. He had to cut his way out of the castle, mowing down zombies that had once been peasants - and village wenches. Now Sir Beauregard's eyes are shadowed, and he has vowed to true purity until the scourge of zombies is ended.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Gehenna also features cards whose social context deviates from the expected status quo of the World of Darkness: Camarilla-aligned Setite primogen, Sabbat Archbishops ruling over canonically Camarilla-held cities, and so on. Gehenna was the first White Wolf-published V:TES set to not receive a preconstructed starter deck, and thus the first White Wolf V:TES set to consist exclusively of new cards in the only format in which it was published.<br/><br/>Despite the cancellation of Vampire: The Masquerade and its contemporary World of Darkness games, V:TES continued publication after Gehenna, remaining the only active Classic World of Darkness game line for several years afterward.<br/><br/>",

A unique multi-faction treatment of the Vietnam War, Fire in the Lake will take 1 to 4 players on US heliborne sweeps of the jungle and Communist infiltration of the South, and into inter-allied conferences, Saigon politics, interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, air defense of Northern infrastructure, graduated escalation, and media war.<br/><br/>Renowned designer and modern warfare expert Mark Herman joins COIN Series creator Volko Ruhnke for a collaborative production not to be missed.

This is a thing that really happened.<br/><br/>In La Campagne de Tunisie, designer Philippe L&eacute;onard (1940 - The Fall of France) tells this story in a series of 13 Panzer Grenadier scenarios, as the French fight the Americans, the Germans, the British and the Italians (but not all at the same time). Initially resisting the American and British invaders, the French see things differently after the Germans toss aside the German-French Armistice of 1940 and occupy all of France. The French - including troops from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia &ndash; then fight against the Germans and Italians, providing a major component of the British First Army in northern Tunisia.<br/><br/>La Campagne de Tunisie includes 88 new playing pieces with some additional units for the German, American, British and Italian armies, but mostly the eclectic troops and weapons of the Army of Africa. There are Moroccan Goums, tough mountain tribesmen from Morocco who love to fight but are just as interested in looting. Camel cavalry. Obsolescent limited-production French tanks. And for the first time in Panzer Grenadier, the French Foreign Legion. Plus you get a set of 13 scenarios.<br/><br/>La Campagne de Tunisie is a supplement for Panzer Grenadier: An Army at Dawn. It is not a complete game: ownership of An Army at Dawn (and only An Army at Dawn) is necessary to play all of the 13 scenarios included. La Campagne de Tunisie also includes 88 die-cut and mounted playing pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The World's Greatest Baseball Game (TWGBG) is yet another baseball simulation based on player performances. Rules for TWGBG offer seven different levels of increasingly detailed game play. Regardless of the level of play, however, the path to victory depends as much on putting the best players on the field as in the result cards one draws.<br/><br/>The use of result cards and a Special Events chart are reminiscent of the Action Cards and &quot;Z plays&quot; chart from a contemporary product, Statis-Pro baseball.<br/><br/>One additional detail regarding TWGBG should be noted. In this game, the players for each team in a given season are those who were set to appear on opening day for that year; however, the stats for that player come from the previous year. For example, stats on the 1980 Don Stanhouse (LA) card reflect his 1979 (Baltimore) performance. This differs from baseball game systems such as Strat-O-Matic or Statis Pro, where card sets were published only after a season was completed. TWGBG was intended for players who wanted to use the opening day rosters and play out a season as it was progressing.<br/><br/>",

SIMSOC creates a situation in which the participants must actively question the nature of social order.<br/><br/>Included are: Rules for playing, materials needed for play and questions to guide discussions afterward.  Materials are provided on perforated sheets and include: SimBucks of various denominations, travel passes, sustenance tickets, and coupons which can be exchanged for &quot;munchies&quot; during the game (representing luxuries).  Also included are play-aids, scenario leaflets and several puzzle sheets that are distributed to players as wage-earning jobs.<br/><br/>Players are citizens of a simulated modern international society taking on roles of political and industrial leaders, workers, the media, the judiciary and the unemployed.  Some randomly selected players may be &quot;Minorities&quot; (wearing masks or armbands) and can be victims of prejudice at any time by the other players.  Players attempt to deal with scenarios presented each session while attaining personal goals and maintaining a viable society.<br/><br/>SIMSOC is best with approximately 40 participants, and is intended to be played in 5 to 10 sessions of about an hour apiece.  Rules adjustments are included to support smaller groups and fewer, abbreviated sessions.  Space should be available to divide the players into 4 groups (or 3 for smaller games) preferably in separate rooms, although corners of a large room will suffice.<br/><br/>",

The rules themselves run to 48 pages or so, with army lists from the First Crusade and references taking it to a cool 60 pages in total.<br/><br/>The main principles can be learnt pretty quickly however and after a few games, you will only need the supplied 'quick reference' sheet for much of any game, using the main book for special reference where necessary.&quot;<br/><br/>From the introduction, p.2:<br/><br/>&quot;These rules are primarily designed for the wars in the Middle East around the time of the Crusades.  In practice they can be used for warfare in Central and East Asia, the Middle East and around the Mediterranean.  Many armies over this range used tactics and organizations common to the Crusades.<br/><br/>The rules start with the Heraclean &quot;crusade&quot; against the Sasanids and the early Arab conquests.  They carry through to the Crusade of Nicopolis against the Ottomans (1396AD).<br/><br/>The rules emphasize the tactics used by the various Latin, Middle Eastern, Central and East Asian armies of this time.  The important feature of warfare of this era was the dominance of the mounted warrior.  A wide variety of tactics were used, from the traditional Arabic karr wa farr tactics to the furious Latin charge and the versatile Mamluk.  The rules are not intended to cover warfare by different armies of different eras.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In 2003 they finally produced a scenario set of their own.  Melee Pack 1 includes six scenarios and also comes with 5 cheat sheets for the AFV's used in the scenarios.   The scenario cards are in full color.<br/><br/>The scenarios include:<br/><br/>MP1: THE WOLF'S LAST TOOTH<br/><br/>January 17, 1941 Klisura, Albania:<br/>The remnants of the Wolves of Tuscany Division must break out through the thin infantry lines held by the ELAS<br/>Militia and the Greek 15th Division with only a handful of tankettes for support.<br/><br/>MP2: CURTAIN KALL<br/><br/>November 6, 1944 H&uuml;rtgen Forest, Germany:<br/>Task Force Ripple must utilize its inexperienced GIs, tanks and TDs to smash the dug in soldaten of the German<br/>89th Infantry Division. Add in a little heavy caliber OBA and the Americans just might have a chance.<br/><br/>MP3: HOLY GROUND<br/><br/>November 6, 1944 Vossenack, Germany:<br/>The 156th PanzerGrenadiers have the U.S. 112th Infantry on the run. The 2nd Battalion CP must cobble together a<br/>defense around the town church or lose Vossenack entirely.<br/><br/>MP4: BLEEDING THE FIRST<br/><br/>November 16, 1944 Hamich, Germany:<br/>The 1st Battalion of the 16th Infantry has been ordered to take Hamich. The elite 48th Grenadiers are waiting for<br/>them in the wooded approaches to the town where they&rsquo;ve been preparing defenses for weeks.<br/><br/>MP5: THE RATS OF HAMICH<br/><br/>November 18, 1944 Hamich, Germany:<br/>The 3rd Battalion of the 16th Infantry now leads the assault on Hamich. The 48th Grenadiers have set up a layered<br/>and well-hidden defense to make them pay for every muddy yard.<br/><br/>MP6: THE MARNACH STRONGPOINT<br/><br/>December 16, 1944 Marnach, Luxembourg:<br/>The 2nd Panzer Division must coordinate an armored assault to seize Marnach from the reconstituted U.S. 110th.<br/>Though surprised, the 110th may have just enough force to halt the German advance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the website)<br/><br/>Superschaak (aka Superchess)<br/><br/>creative chess without opening theory<br/><br/>Playing high-level chess is possible only with a thorough knowledge of the opening theory nowadays. Because of the rapid expansion of the modern opening theory its role becomes too large and sometimes even dominating according to more and more chess players and grandmasters, including Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer - by many considered to be the best chess players in the world.<br/><br/>This objection is overcome by Superchess: a natural and logical extension of chess in which the players create the starting position together following a simple procedure. Superchess is virtually chess without the opening theory.<br/><br/>Superchess is played on an ordinary 8x8-chessboard with ordinary chess pieces, but with a few additional new pieces. The new pieces move slightly different from conventional pieces. For example, the Amazon moves like a Queen or Knight. Studying the opening theory will not be worthwile in practice because too many different starting positions exist.<br/><br/>Now it comes down to strategical insight and tactical ingenuity only!<br/><br/>",

The book provides comprehensive coverage of the air wars between Israel and Egypt between 1966 and 1973 under one cover with five campaigns and 27 scenarios.<br/><br/>* The first campaign covers the Israeli surprise attack on Egypt and the first two days of air battles in the 1967 Six-Day War while the second covers Egyptian attempts to strike back over the final four days of the war.<br/>    * The third campaign covers desperate Egyptian attempts to regain the initiative in the War of Attrition, between 1969-1972, by employing new aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, and direct involvement from the Soviet Union.<br/>    * The final two campaigns cover the aerial struggle between Israel and Egypt during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The fourth campaign spotlights the desperate struggle of the Israeli Air Force against the massive air defense systems of Egypt. The fifth campaign covers the second half of the war, when Israel renewed deep-strike operations and faced a surviving and fighting Egyptian Air Force.<br/><br/>The book also features some of the world's top jet aces, including Michael &quot;Diamond&quot; Haber, Dan Sever, Giora Rom, Avraham Salmon, Israel Baharav, Yiftach Spector, Asher Snir, Eitan Peled, Amir Nachumi, Eitan Ben-Eliyahu and Shlomo Levi. The book also presents the little-known exploits of Egyptian pilots such as Mustafa Hafez, Nabil Shuwakri, Ahmad Atif, Qadri al-Hamid, and Nasr Mousa. The scenarios can be played individually, linked to form campaigns, or combined as one grand campaign.<br/><br/>HISTORICAL RESEARCH: This book includes several introduction sections containing campaign historical background, an annotated bibliography for further reading, a color scheme guide, and a campaign map.<br/><br/>AIRCRAFT STATISTICS and CAMPAIGN INFORMATION: This book contains aircraft statistics for more than 20 U.S., British, Israeli and Soviet-built aircraft in Check Your 6: Jet Age format for use in the scenarios.

This expectation was confirmed by a squadron of the Fife and Forfars who believed the village was clear of infantry but warned of the possibility of enemy tanks. Fond hopes were rudely shattered at 20:00 hours, as D Company moved into the ruins, supported by two troops of 7th RTR. The place was enemy held, opposition was heavy, and three of the Churchills were quickly knocked out. All through the long summer&rsquo;s evening, the battle raged to and fro over the ruins of the small town. Finally, the Cameronians and their supporting armour pulled back for the night, and shortly after so did the Germans. At midnight, the Cameronians&rsquo; M.O. and Padre ventured into the rubble to search for their wounded and found Grainville deserted. The Cameronians would be back.<br/><br/>Raise your hand ... or optionally SHOUT to your mates for a Projecter Infantry Anti Tank (aka &quot;PIAT) ... if you like the idea of a SIX FOOT LONG historical map with campaign game and macro scenario to play on it. Oops, that pretty much means you're shouting at the top of your lungs for a copy of ATS OMAHA or BERLIN from CH ... we just can't get past the desire to provide you the longest, largest tactical-level battlefields this side of joining a pile of geomorphs at a convention (may we suggest the new Museumfest in Michigan). If you wanted to know if the new British in Normandy releases, i.e., the new editions of the maps ... connect, the answer is &quot;yes&quot;. If you wanted to know if these new editions, unlike their predecessors, total about 6' in length ... again, check. Affirmative. Yes. If you want to know what it feels like to collect your Panzerkampfwagen Vg platoon around a hamlet ... and stare over a klick away in game distance .... and order your cardboard Frundsbergers ... panzer marsch! You'll need to mount up and take to the turret in the form of a copy of SHOUT FOR PIATS ... and ORDERS FOR THE MAJOR.<br/><br/>Of course if you want to know what it's like to order your Firefly troop (complete with AFVs bearing a troop leader pennant, see the sample directly above) ... to stop the jerries from going anywhere, let alone forward ... we suggest OFM and SFP ... on the double! Either way, you'll note the road signage says 'this way to Hill 112' and 'this way to Villers Bocage' ... both places that are in hand and coming from CH to build an unprecedented British in Nornandy collection of tactical-level modules ... start engines!<br/><br/>",

In Dice and Daggers, players attempt to reach 20 gold before everyone else without being knocked out of the game. On a turn, the active player rolls three dice, then chooses two of them, with the other players taking the action on the remaining die. When you roll three-of-a-kind, something good happens!<br/><br/>The dice have five symbols on them:<br/><br/><br/>    Coins: The player gains 1 coin.<br/>    Crown: The player draws 1 card.<br/>    Dagger: The player either discards a shield or takes 1 damage.<br/>    Shield: The player takes a shield token, which can later block a dagger.<br/>    Thief: The active player must choose this die, although it grants no actions.<br/><br/><br/>Let's say the active player rolls Coin, Shield, Crown. If he chooses the coin and the shield, he receives 1 coin and a shield to protect himself in the future should he roll a dagger (or be forced to choose the dagger). The other players each draw 1 card.<br/><br/>Dice and Daggers includes rules for five different ways to play.<br/><br/>",

She will get angry and not give yummy supper if the brothers are too late. Therefore, go home before she puts away food! Of course, the frogs have to eat flies enough on the load. Eating is our instinct. ;)<br/><br/>[Goal]<br/>Despite of mom's call, it's more important to eat flies than go home. Because we are tree frogs! But if you are too late, you'll get a scolding from mom. So be careful. Eat flies as many as possible and escape penalty points, and then win this game between brothers.<br/><br/>[Play - Brief Rules]<br/>This is a dexterity game by flipping the paper(origami) frog.<br/>On the game board, there are circle target and moving track. Each round the players flip own frog to the target, and move his tokens on the track according to the result of the target. Players should compete with each other to get more stone tiles which have points on the track. For this, flipping the frog to proper target area is very important. But it won&rsquo;t be easy because the terrible event cards are opened frequently. Flip and go, and eat flies(points)!<br/><br/>[Game Ends &amp; Scoring]<br/>Game ends when one of the following situations is happened.<br/>1. When any player's game token arrives at a home(Mom) space on the track. <br/>2. When 'Mom card' is opened from Event Card deck.<br/>In these cases, immediately game is over without the next round.<br/>Scores are as follow: Fly points + 1.Home bonus points - 2.Penalty points for late (Depend on the above end situations.)<br/><br/>",

The book provides comprehensive coverage of the 1965 air war between India and Pakistan with 19 scenarios. The scenarios pit the evenly matched Hawker Hunter and F-86F Sabre against each other in tense maneuvering combat &ndash; will Pakistan&rsquo;s new AIM-9B Sidewinder missiles prove to be the edge needed to carry the day? The book also features the first combat employment of the F-104A Starfighter and MiG-21 Fishbed, following these two legendary fighters in a face-off over the foothills of the Himalayas. Scenarios include the diminutive and quirky Folland Gnat, which gained a reputation in the hands of the Indian Air Force as the &ldquo;Sabre Slayer.&rdquo; Canberra bombers flying against Sabres in a do-or-die mission and the final air-to-air engagement of the deHavilland Vampire are likewise covered in exciting scenarios. The book showcases massive cannon armament against the effectiveness of the promising but unproven AIM-9B Sidewinder missile &ndash; and the outcome is always a surprise!  Whatever you do&hellip;don&rsquo;t make a mistake&hellip;<br/><br/>HISTORICAL RESEARCH: This book includes several introduction sections containing campaign historical background, plus a bibliography for further reading. A campaign map is included.<br/><br/>AIRCRAFT STATISTICS and CAMPAIGN INFORMATION: This book contains aircraft statistics for British, Indian and Soviet aircraft in Check Your 6 Jet Age format for use in the scenarios. The book also contains detailed notes and rare pictures of the various aircraft featured in the campaign.<br/><br/>Jet Age SPECIAL EVENT CAMPAIGN SYSTEM: This book includes an innovative Check Your 6Jet Age campaign system that features the possibility of special campaign events in each scenario. By winning battles, players earn Campaign Events, similar to action cards, which are played during the scenarios. This campaign mechanic allows players to make real-time decisions that shape the battles while adding extra dimension to the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

This allowed players &ndash; who adopted the roles of leaders of particular tribes &ndash; to submit special orders with their turns, instructions which were processed by a human being and could thus include any action imaginable rather than being restricted by a predesigned set of rules. This flexibility, combined with occasional opportunities to enact the role of a particular individual rather than that of an entire clan and the potential for games to continue indefinitely, made Crane&lsquo;s game play resemble that of a tabletop role playing game far more closely than that of a board and counter war game.<br/><br/>",

Join the revolution and battle across an alternate Victorian London!<br/><br/>Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke uses playing-card-controlled skill management and opposed-dice combat creating strategic, hybrid gameplay. Each character uses playing cards for a pontoon/blackjack mini game, drawing cards as close to 21 as possible to increase the selection of special actions that are available for use.  Bust hands only allow the most basic attacks, but increase the character's defensive abilities.  Attacks are resolved with opposed dice rolls and players alternate activation of their characters, so the players are continuously engaged in the game.<br/><br/>Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke has a range of intricately detailed, resin-cast, 32mm scale miniatures. Many Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke characters are based on famous individuals from literature and history, but given a steampunk twist.<br/><br/>It is set in an alternate Victorian London in turmoil through the development of advanced new technology. The city is packed with intriguing stories, fascinating characters and a deep history, making for a rich steampunk setting. Character cards describe the unique abilities of each character, creating games that have an exciting cinematic style.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Regatta is a combinatorial game for two players. It's the follow-up to Tixel, which itself is a follow-up to Tix.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can either place a new piece or move one of her own pieces already on the board. Pieces can be placed either side up, effectively mirroring the shape of the piece. The only way to change which side is facing up is by first picking up a piece in one turn (as a bonus move action, see below), and then placing it anew in another turn with the other side facing up.<br/><br/>A piece can be &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;; only active pieces, which are at a 45&ordm; angle, may be moved. Making pieces inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active piece.<br/><br/>Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks three additional move types (aside from placing or moving a piece). If a piece that is moved is made inactive at its end position &mdash; i.e., it is self-inactivated &mdash; a player can take an extra move if she so chooses; aside from placing or moving a piece, she can now remove a piece from the board, activate an inactive piece, or pivot an active piece to reorient it.<br/><br/>Another difference between Regatta and Tix/Tixel is that in Regatta pieces aren't at any time allowed to protrude outside of the board.<br/><br/>There's also a variant that allows the game to be played by three players.<br/><br/>",

The destroyer is sunk when received one hit. The carrier and cruiser are sunk when they receive 3 hits. Each hit in any target counts as one point. The game lasts as long as players have airplanes, ships and missiles to shoot at opponent. The winner is the player who has the best ratio of given and received hits.<br/><br/>",

Pulsipher's Britannia.<br/><br/>In a typical game of Corsica, during 16 game rounds players will take command of the different nations that invaded and partially or fully controlled the island between 556 b.C., when the Ancient Greeks first settled the spot of Aleria, and 1796 a.D., when the island definitelly fell under French control. Therefore, nations available in Corsica include the autochthonous Corsican Ancient tribes (3 each player), Greeks, Carthagenese, Etrurians, Romans, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Byzantines, Sarracenes, Lombards, Franks, Aragonese, Vatican State, Pisan, Tuscan, Genoese, modern Corse people (2 different factions), Ottoman, English and French.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Corsica comes with and expansion that adds the II World War conflict to the original game, and a 17th game round.<br/><br/>Invasions take place at the beginning of each game round, and the goal for each player will be to first invade the island  and then try to hold control of it fighting  the new invaders as long as possible, while trying to accomplish his own nation's objetives.<br/><br/>While trying to stick as much as possible to the original game of Britannia, this new version has undergone some minor and major changes in order to addapt the gameplay and game feeling to this new Mediterranean context:<br/><br/>A typical game round of Corsica consists of the following phases: The invasion phase (in which the new invaders attack and settle the island), the diplomacy phase (in which nations can seal up to 4 pacts for the current game round), the internal struggle phase (in which all nations settled on Corsica fight each other), and during punctuation game rounds the punctuation phase.<br/><br/>Cavalry has been removed from the game, as Corsican geography makes it useless, but fleets and sea combat have been enabled, as historically the control of the waters around Corsica has been of great influence. Other concepts like roads, fortifications or watchtowers have been added, and as the island is much smaller than Britannia, movement (both land and sea) has been eased, maybe resulting in a more dynamic game experience.<br/><br/>Corsica is well known  to European tourists for the beauty and quietness of its coasts and inlands. But what visitors may not know, is that on the same beaches where they do bath today, blood-thirsty, fierce warriors of all nations around the Mediterranean Sea have been landing during centuries with an only idea on their minds: taking full control of the island!<br/><br/>Be welcome to Corsica: a game that portraits the history of a 1500 years long conflict.<br/><br/>",

Notice that some half tiles contain several symbols (example: the number 7 contains all three). Notice also that each symbol is present exactly 36 times.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins. The maximum possible score is 531441.<br/><br/>Variant for 2 players: The small circle is not used.<br/><br/>",

Players control one character (usually an Occulite Tribal Chief) trying to settle a dispute with another tribe or tribes (the other players).<br/><br/>Unlike other skirmish games, Eye for an Eye can be played in both real time with a soundtrack timing the action, or in a turn based format. So you play the game at your own pace! <br/>In the Realtime mode, there are no turns and players can call out and resolve actions whenever they want to trigger them.&nbsp;​Actions are powered by allocating dice to different spaces on the player&rsquo;s board and cards. Each character has its own set of skills and restrictions on dice placement. It is likely that you will quickly form a bond with your favourite.&nbsp;<br/><br/>In the turn based mode, players break up the action into short stints, allocating dice in realtime and then grabbing a turn order marker. Players then resolve 2 actions each in an order based on who grabbed which turn order marker.<br/><br/>Play a single round in five minutes and an entire tournament in one hour in realtime OR play a turn based game in 20 to 30 minutes. The choice is yours!<br/><br/>With several different game modes including:<br/><br/>     Every Eye for Themselves<br/>     Alliances<br/>     Nymphlet Ceremony<br/>     King of the Hill<br/>     Domination<br/><br/><br/>and 6 totally unique characters (with more on the way), Eye for an Eye has a huge amount of replayability.<br/><br/>",

In contrast to the large cavalry forces included in the game, there are truck units, emphasizing the armies early reliance on motor transport.<br/><br/>The game is an adaptation of Bertrand Munier's CSR award-winning &quot;Nach Paris,&quot; system, modified to show the differences in warfare in 1916, and theater-specific aspects.<br/><br/>The game map will include the entire campaign area: northern Bulgaria, Romania, Bukovina and Transylvania.

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Elementy is a simple, fast, &amp; fun card game that has two exciting ways to play! Great for kids and adults. Elementy provides this type of exhileration with a minimal game. The game&rsquo;s foundation is built around Rock-Paper-Scissors but the premise of the game eludes this mechanic with the cute, quirky, and almost comedic looking cards along with a few components to fortify this card game. Elementy is played over 1 game with a few rounds. Each player has a premade deck where they select cards from fire, water, or earth in order to beat their opponent. The twist is the wind which adds a few die and a couple Elementyrolles to come out victorious. At the end of the battle count your cards and come out victorious if you have more than your opponent.<br/><br/>How to play Elementy:<br/><br/>START THE GAME: Two players divide the deck in half taking three of each element cards (Flame, Leaf, &amp; Water) and two Wild Windy cards. Shuffle your deck not looking at the cards and place them face down. Next draw the top three cards to start the battle phase.<br/><br/>THE BATTLE: To start the battle both players choose one card (not showing anyone) and place it face down. Once both players cards are face down, flip the cards over to see who won the battle. Before battling again each player draws another card from the top of their deck so they have three cards total in their hand.<br/><br/>THE WILD CARD:  Wild Windy is extremely unpredictable. To stop her wrath the opposing player must roll a 5 or 6, if her opponent rolls a 5 or 6 they win the battle.<br/><br/>THE TIE: If 2 players put out the same card they must roll a dice, whoever rolls a larger number wins that round. This rule does not change with Wild Windy.<br/><br/>THE WIN: The player that wins the battle takes their card and their opponents card and places them in a discard pile face up. The game ends when there are no cards left. Whoever has the most cards in their discard pile wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of Chinese nobility, vying to prove they have the Mandate of Heaven through military strength and efficient administration.<br/><br/>The game features a unique card acquisition mechanic, multiple paths to victory and lots of direct player interaction. The players struggle to control Provinces (positions at the start of 4 rows of cards), from which they can gain unclaimed cards currently on the board. The goal is to acquire tiles from the ends of each row. The tiles, which generate victory points at the end of the game, represent your dynasty's cultural and historical achievements.<br/><br/>The more cards you have in play, the higher the tax you must collect from your populace. Tax is discarded directly from your hand, and eventually, you will not be able to maintain your growing empire. Collapse is inevitable! Players develop their provinces, fight for position in Provinces and collapse until one of the end-game conditions is met. Then everybody counts up their Victory Points. The person with the most Victory Points clearly has the Mandate of Heaven!<br/><br/>",

Humanity is making a comeback. The zombies had us on the run, but now it&rsquo;s time to send in the military starting with the National Guard and even the army if need be.<br/><br/>The outbreak (Day One) took mankind by surprise, and for a long time, there&rsquo;s been no sign of resistance. But now rumors of safe zones are spreading through the land. They say the military has taken back large areas and local radio broadcasts are urging survivors to head to these safe havens.<br/><br/>But not everyone wants to go.<br/><br/>Groups of survivors have their own safe areas under their control. They are self-sufficient and doing okay. Not great, but okay. And they like their new found freedom and look forward to finding like-minded recruits. They&rsquo;re making the best of a bad situation.<br/><br/>But they&rsquo;re not alone. Gangs of lawless people have their own areas under control. These gangs patrol the highways looking for loot, prey, and in some cases new recruits. They like things just the way they are. In Nowhere Nevada you have three options &ndash;<br/><br/>MILITARY - We allow you to command military units by introducing you to better weapons, new equipment, and a list of missions for you to play. It&rsquo;s time to kill some Zombies and pacify the area.<br/><br/>SURVIVOR - We provide you with Nowhere Nevada, a self-sufficient community that you can explore, trade, and perhaps recruit from.<br/><br/>GANGER &ndash; We give you a ready-made gang, place to live, and opportunities to grow your power.<br/>It&rsquo;s all up to you&hellip;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Danger Suit is a multiplayer strategy game designed to pit one player as the Villain against a team of up to five Heroes who must work together to build mechanical superhero suits. While the Heroes build their suits, the Villain incrementally destroys the 25 city hex tiles that make up the game board. This gives the Villain special powers, fuels mutations, and helps him collect energy cubes to power his death ray. Heroes must battle the Villain to gain control of the energy cubes in an attempt to save the city.<br/><br/>Players start each turn with two Action Points (AP) which they may use on various actions. Heroes can use their AP to move around the board, fight the Villain, conduct research to build their suits, or charge up to gain energy cubes. The Villain uses his AP to move around the board, fight the Heroes, or destroy the city. Each Hero has unique powers that give them advantages in combat or suit building.<br/><br/>Heroes build their Danger Suits by entering laboratory tiles where they get to draw three cards from the Danger Suit deck. These cards can include parts for their suit (helmets, arms, torsos, or legs), Civil Defense Forces which help the Heroes, or event cards, which will hinder the Heroes with various setbacks. As their suits get more powerful, they can travel to power stations to draw energy cubes from the pool. Meanwhile, the Villain moves to city tiles and destroys them by flipping them over to reveal negative actions for the Heroes. As he does this he draws three cards from the mutation deck which change his evolving form and add armies of minions which he can attack the Heroes with.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the Heroes collect all the energy cubes denying the Villain any power, or when the Villain destroys the city. This can be done by charging the death ray in his fortress or by destroying all of two different city tile types.<br/><br/>",

One, the EOKA player, plays the role of General George Grivas, the military leader of EOKA. The other player, the Empire player, plays the role of the Governor of Cyprus (which at the time was a British colony). A third faction, representing Turkish Cypriot non-state militia and British expatriates who acted as vigilantes, is not played by a human player but will perform in accordance with a set of &quot;automatic&quot; rules.<br/><br/>The currency of victory in this game is a player's Political Support Level (PSL), which is measured in Political Support Points (PSP) and changes constantly during the game. If either player's PSL reaches 0 at any point in the game, the game will end.<br/><br/>If the Empire PSL reaches zero, it means something along the lines of a negotiated settlement has been reached among the British, Greek and Turkish governments on the future status of Cyprus. Historically, one was reached at the beginning of 1959 which decided that Cyprus would be an independent country, without ethnic partitions, and that the British would be allowed to maintain several military bases on the island.<br/><br/>If the EOKA PSL reaches zero, it means something like a collapse of the viability of the organization has occurred -  the Greek government decides it should no longer be supported, the population of Cyprus turns against what EOKA proposes, the security forces manage to round up or eliminate much of EOKA's field units, etc..<br/><br/>This game is the latest addition to a family of broadly similar games by Brian Train, including Tupamaro, Shining Path, Algeria, Andartes and Kandahar. New concepts added in this game include Civic Levels, the lasting effects of violent kinetic operations, and some simple solitaire rules (if a lone player wants to oppose an automated Empire).<br/><br/>",

Powerful VK generators concentrate heat waves into small tungsten cylinders around the actual barrel and then release them, projecting a phased discharge of raw energy. How Allied scientists managed to develop such a complex weapon in such a short amount of time is still puzzling for spy agencies around the world - almost as puzzling as how it actually works. The whole project is still shrouded in mystery.<br/><br/>When the scientists combined several phaser systems into one massive phaser gun with a nominal initiator power of 480 Watts (twice as powerful as any previous system) they needed a huge vehicle to carry it. The resulting M7D Devastator is built around the largest phaser energy generator ever built. Unfortunately, this VK generator occupies the space originally used as a passenger compartment, so it is impossible to transport any troops inside.<br/><br/>There is nothing on the planet that can survive a direct hit from a Devastator. The temperature at the core of the blast is believed to be as hot as the Sun, but since there are no practical ways to measure the heat effectively, no one can be sure. So far no known material has been able to survive a hit from this formidable weapon.<br/><br/>",

He claimed to be one of the men, who once discovered the fabled lands of Vinland. But was it true? Even as the old man left, his stories remained, took root in the dreams and desires of men. Most of them kept dreaming but some brave or foolish enought were ready to leave their lifes behind and become legends, or die trying. <br/>This is their Story.<br/><br/>In Vinland, the Players take the role of two of four characters from the Vinland Saga, the merchant brothers Helgi and Finnbogi, the fierce shieldmaiden Freyd&iacute;s and her brother Leif Eir&iacute;ksson, children of Erik the Red and in their shadow, Eyiolf Thorgestsson seeking revenge for a blood depth. Adventures and fame will welcome the brave, if they survive the sea of storms and blood, entangled in a net of betrayal and ambition. <br/>The first version of Vinland will follow the characters on their travel across Greenland, past the frozen island of bears and beyond the deep forests of Markland. The Game can be either played as a racing game, to reach Vinland first, or as a co-op game on a shared expedition. Vinland will be a 18 Cards game and tries to merge the dense historical references with a light encountersystem.<br/><br/>Coop Game:<br/>The theme resolves around the fabled Continent of Vinland (America) discovered by Vikings way ahead of Columbus. The player have to play two members of an expedition into the unknown West. Its a coop game in which they have to survive Weather on land and sea, encounter Wild Animals and rediscover lost settlements, ruins and gravesides of former expeditions.<br/><br/>The Game ends, when they cross the last of the seven sea(card)s and may reach Vinland. Its not about the arrival in Vinland, but about the Journey of the Vikings to that fabled place.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to escape the island by building a raft out of Trees and Vines you can find in the Materials Deck, and collecting the required Rations.  An alternate win condition is available if you think you can &quot;hack&quot; it.  But, it's not so easy to win, as you'll be bombarded with various Crabs from the other players in an attempt to sabotage you so that they can be the first to Escape the Island.<br/><br/>These Crabs can steal your rations and materials, sneak a peak at your hand, cause you to lose an action, and take various other actions to hinder your success.  While you may decide to smash a Crabs with your Shovel, capture them with a Crab Cage, or worse, turn them into extra Rations by boiling them in a pot of water, every action/reaction you take will likely expose you to a worse outcome.  So, choose wisely!<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 5 cards, and can take various Actions during their turn.  The number of actions you take per turn can change during gameplay, based upon what's in your Campsite, or play area.  You may play a card in your Campsite, play a Crab on another player, draw Rations, or attempt to collect Materials once you have the required tools.  There's a significant amount of decisions to be made in this game, as each Crab can be reacted to in some way.  You might choose to destroy the crab in numerous ways, capture it, redirect it to another player, or you might just deal with the punishment.<br/><br/>Once you've fought you way through all the Crabs and have collected the required Materials and Rations, you may triumphantly take your last action and Escape the Island by raft.  Alternatively, if you have managed to locate a special tool, ration, and enough rations for the journey, you may be in position to locate the Resort on the island and Win the Game that way.  But beware, if you make a break for it, you can bet all the other players will be looking to attack you.<br/><br/>Various Gameplay modes<br/><br/>Outside of normal gameplay which was developed for everyone to enjoy, we've included a few methods of gameplay to keep things interesting.  Rules have been altered to account for younger players, so this really is a game for the entire family.  But, for the more avid and hardcore gamers, there are Scenarios to play out, which will affect you in different ways each time you play, or Day/Night effects of the island that are designed to keep you guessing literally every round as to what might happen next to keep you from escaping.  Are you up to the challenge of Expert Mode?<br/><br/>",

Gathering the fuel of Etherium, they use these immense energies to battle for control of the ever expanding, ever changing Realms.  Those who dominate the most Realms claim victory over all!<br/><br/>In Realms of Etherium, 2-6 players will each control a small group of Mages that start together at the center of an ever expanding, ever changing board.  Each Round their Mages will take turns activating, moving to existing Realms, or expanding the board by summoning new Realms either randomly drawn or chosen from an existing pool. Each Realm has a different power to gather resources, gain Mage abilities, alter elements, affect other Mages, and even alter the layout of the board itself!<br/><br/>When a player has gained enough resources they can begin to take control of the Victory Point Realms to gain victory points in order to win.  All the scoring is based on the layout of the board relative to these Victory Point Realms, so points can be gained or lost every time the spaces are shifted or swapped, making for a tense, dynamic game that&rsquo;s different every time you play!<br/><br/>",

Think of famous episodes portrayed on TV and in the written word, all those feats can be performed whilst playing a game of Forager, hiding, climbing, jumping, diving for cover to name a few. <br/>Forager is set out in a very similar way to Stand to Game&rsquo;s Napoleonic ruleset Over the Hills, in that there is a basic rules section where you will find a few pages that once digested will allow you to play the game with confidence. The Optional rules are crammed packed with other rules that players can use to enhance their games of Forager, you will find rules for national characteristics for all the main players in the Napoleonic Wars, the United States, Canada and the Ottoman Empire.

Finally, to get you started there are two sets of character cards, one French command and one British command. These commands allow you to that you can get straight into the game with.<br/><br/>The basics of the game are as follows:<br/><br/>     Each force is called a command and is led by an officer/NCO and has several other soldiers, all being named characters.<br/>     Each character has a Skill level and Combat Statistic, Field Craft and Fatigue Score.<br/>     Characters can also be given Character Traits that shape how they fight during a game of Forager. <br/>     Characters can also be given Equipment that aids them during a game of Forager.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But a higher prize awaits: the presidency of the United States! The American government is built upon a system of checks and balances. Things get done only when everyone works together. At the same time, only one can rise to the highest office in the U.S. Will it be you? Only time - and the American people - will decide! God bless America!<br/><br/>In Congress: The Board Game, you and your fellow senators compete to earn the most nomination points (&ldquo;NP&rdquo;) in order to secure the nomination for the U.S. presidency. This is accomplished by passing bills that reflect your interests and agendas over three terms. You must also support the interests of your state&rsquo;s residents or risk defeat in your midterm elections, harming your chances in the presidential race. The game is over at the end of the third term and the winner is the player with the most NP.<br/><br/>Each session consists of four phases:<br/><br/>Committee Phase - players bid for 'speakership' and select a bill.<br/><br/>Amendment Phase - everyone takes turns adding riders and/or playing action cards.<br/><br/>Voting Phase - the bill is either voted through in simple majority or killed.<br/><br/>Election Phase - if this is the final session of the term, players receive campaign donations and roll for their election.<br/><br/>After the third term and final election, secret agendas are revealed and NP is counted. The most NP wins, and in case of a tie, richest senator wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A line up of 5 players is chosen and the tactics result in a number of attacks and boost cards used to play out the first half.<br/><br/>Attacks are carried out by rolling a custom 8 sided dice to see which player is attacking, the defending player rolls a different custom d8 to see which player defends - strikers are more likely to attack, defenders are more likely to defend! Stats are compared - dice rolls and boost cards are added. If the defender wins the attack is over, if the attacker wins he has a shot on goal.<br/><br/>At half time managers can change their tactics and their playing line up before battling out the rest of the game.<br/><br/>After careful selection of squads and tactics the matches play out quickly with a net full of drama, personality and goals a plenty. <br/><br/><br/>",

In 'Rio 1808,' players step into the shoes of leaders from influential families, vying for nobility during this pivotal historical shift.<br/><br/>Set against a backdrop of intrigue and opportunities, players dispatch their workers&mdash;represented as upgradable dice&mdash;to fulfill the wishes of royalty, construct iconic monuments, and sway both the church and society. Resource management is critical, with strategic delays in resource acquisition and a labor market where training workers enhances efficiency but also raises demands.<br/><br/>As influence with the court grows, so does income, but the social complexities among workers intensify. The 'jealousy' mechanic among nobles, coupled with the constant need for gifts, adds a layer of challenge to societal ascent.<br/><br/>At the game's conclusion, nobility is earned through the cumulative impact of influence, wealth, and achieved objectives. 'Rio 1808' delivers a eurogame experience set in colonial Brazil, featuring worker placement, influence control, and set collection mechanics. It provides a unique immersion into a crucial period in Brazilian history, where strategy and cunning are key to attaining the coveted nobility.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rail Roads &amp; Robber Barons is a board/card game inspired by the 18XX series of games.  All the fun and strategy of trains, stocks, delivery's, profits, and hand management, in about a fifth of the time!<br/><br/>The game is designed for 1 to 6 players.  Solo play is handled by the use of AI decks to represent other players.  There are standard AI decks, which are a challenge all by themselves, or you can chose to play against other legendary Barons, each with their own strengths and play styles.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of Rail Roads and Robber Barons of the mid to late 1800's as rail lines grew to cover the United States and immense profits were there for the taking... with the right moves.  The choice of which Baron and which Company to take at the beginning is very important, as each gives a player unique advantages.<br/><br/>The game is driven by Action cards, which the players use to guide their turn.  Once an Action card is used, it can't be used again until you step back for a turn and retrieve them, so you have to plan ahead and pay attention to what your fellow Barons are doing.  Don't get caught with that vital Action card you need unavailable to you!<br/><br/>As players place down their trains and complete the available contracts, they earn money that can be used to upgrade their trains or buy stock in theirs or other player's companies.  Balance is required, because if you invest heavily in the stock market early, you may be caught short when your train is too slow to fulfill the remaining contracts.  As a Baron completes contracts and upgrades their train, their stock becomes more and more valuable and it much more expensive for you to buy into.  Stocks also pay out dividends when their Baron completes a contract, giving a player much needed cash, but careful decisions are required to manage the best use of a player's money.<br/><br/>Buying more powerful Engines is the key to making more money, but even here many choices face each Baron.  The first train purchased in each strength is a prototype that comes with a special ability that allows the player to modify or even break the game rules, however these Engines are more expensive then the standard ones.  A player can also pay extra when they purchase a train to skip a level or two and dramatically increase their engine power, but doing so costs much needed capitol.  As stronger Engines are purchased, the price of the weaker engines becomes reduced.  So, a player can be patient if they want, let others pay heavily to upgrade and then swoop in and buy that slower train at a hefty discount, then use their extra funds to buy stock or save to upgrade to faster Engine themselves at a later time. Both strategies, and many in between, can win the game, but the player has to adapt to what the other Barons are doing and flexibility is the key.<br/><br/>Even the completing of contracts requires decisions.  Do you place one of your trains to claim the payout, or do you invest even more in the delivery and place one of your few City Station tiles instead.  As you complete Routes, you will be placing cargo in the Depot, and your Routes with Cities in them give you even more crates in the Depot, which will result in larger payouts at the end of the game.... but if you spend too many resources on your Cities, you may lose valuable time while you replenish your hand, time other Barons are surely using to make more money.<br/><br/>In the end, players cash out their stock, count their funds on hand, receive bonuses for the trains they've purchased and the cargo they have waiting in the Depot.  The Baron with the most money wins and becomes a legendary Tycoon!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Shift into 1st gear, avoid wheelspin and race for victory pushing the limits while using your pilot awereness and abilities along with tactical cards and your resources!<br/><br/>The Grand Prix takes place on one track of the two-sided gameboard. By literally shifting gears you gain movement points to spend during your turn. However, using the resources of your racecar - such as engine, fuel, tires etc. - you can gain extra speed. Along straights there's an opportunity to use slipstream or try to take over the car in front with a bold move from a certain distance. There are strict rules for cornering (based on gears and car setup), but using your resources wisely you can violate them and get further. Resources can be gained back during a pit stop.<br/><br/>Rulesystem is created so, that players get to know more and more functions of the elements as they approach advanced level.<br/><br/>'AI' drivers lets you fill up the grid when playing with a small amount of players or solo.<br/><br/>&sbquo;Team orders&rsquo; game mod lets you control two cars between wich you have to share your initial income evenly or favorizing one of them for victory.<br/><br/>You can also compete against an AI driver on your friends&rsquo; side in &sbquo;Co-operative&rsquo; game mod during a four-round championship relying on each others&rsquo; developments while racing for 1st.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Hot Dry Season: Operation Attleboro in War Zone C (AHDS) is an operational-level game dealing with the National Liberation Front (NLF) Dry Season Offensive in the III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ) in November 1966 and the subsequent counterattack by forces under the command of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV).  From the designer&rsquo;s website:<br/><br/>&quot;To Military Assistance Command-Vietnam (MACV), Operation Attleboro was a meeting engagement in War Zone C that grew into the largest operation involving US Forces conducted in South Vietnam at that time.  To the Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN), Operation Attleboro was unexpected early contact by a force attempting to conduct an offensive that snowballed into a desperate defense and fighting withdrawal to protect precious logistic and command capabilities essential to their future operations in III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ).<br/><br/>MACV grossly underestimated the National Liberation Front&rsquo;s (NLF) capability to supply their own forces, tactically maneuver them, and evade detection in order to threaten US/Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) infrastructure and units when operating in close proximity to Peoples&rsquo; Liberation Forces of South Vietnam (PLAF &ndash; what are popularly known as &ldquo;Viet Cong Main Force&rdquo;) base areas in Cambodia.  COSVN grossly underestimated the US&rsquo;s capability to rapidly reinforce an area of operations using strategic mobility and rapidly employ such reinforcements almost immediately in the field.<br/><br/>MACV underestimated the proclivity of COSVN to use PLAF forces confront and destroy threats to its logistics and supply system.  COSVN erroneously expected US Forces to respond to tactical and operational dilemmas like the ARVN.  To wit, responding to &ldquo;Ambush and Bait&rdquo; with dispersed pursuits of the ambushers on multiple axis, thus leaving some pursuing units vulnerable to destruction via &ldquo;One Slow, Four Quick&rdquo;.  Both sides were unaware of flaws and gaps in their respective intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, and the murky picture of active operations that would result from a clash of this magnitude, in the trying terrain of War Zone C.  Neither side gained any lasting advantage from Operation Attleboro, though both sides missed opportunities to secure them.&quot;<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s scale is Company as the primary unit size, day turns and a mile per hex.  AHDS uses a concealed information/movement mechanism for NLF units and a limited information availability mechanism for both sides, and heavily emphasizes Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and their impact on revealing concealed/limited information units.  The game uses a movement point system and combat result table mechanisms fires, air defense fire and ground combat.  AHDS has an asymmetric component to its turns, as an Initiative player determines the order of resolution of Fires attacks and missions and then Operations (movement and combat).  Within Operations, interactivity and reactions to phasing player action; reaction moves and hasty attacks may be performed by the non-phasing player as the phasing player&rsquo;s turn is resolved.  Uncertainty is added to victory and even game end in the campaign by the use of Operational Guidance chits which are selected before set up &ndash; neither side may be exactly certain what the other&rsquo;s priorities are, which impacts victory conditions and player strategy as the game progresses.<br/><br/>AHDS contains 7 scenarios: Introductory, Basic, and Intermediate, ranging from 3 to 10 game turns. The campaign is 25 turns long, but may, through Operational Guidance chit play referred to above, last 30 turns.<br/><br/>AHDS is the first entry in a new series, Campaigns in Vietnam, which features a &ldquo;Ground-Up Build&rdquo; system.

The gates lend unhuman strength to the warlords and their armies, while distorting their bodies and their minds. The corruption streams forth from the gates, consuming more and more provinces.<br/>The few remaining clans have to unite to make a stand against the forces of darkness.<br/><br/>The players will side with one of the warring factions: the Keepers of the Gates or the Free Clans.<br/>The game is utilizing the following features: hidden agenda, territory control and hand management. Each side has its own unique asymmetrical card-based mechanics for performing actions: moving forces, conducting rituals, initiating battles, building defences etc. The objective of the game is carrying out personal hidden agendas. The game uses highly detailed miniatures and a large playing board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Yamato (大和, &quot;Great Harmony&quot;) and her sister ship, Musashi, were constructed shortly before the outbreak of World War II. They were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed; armed with nine 18.1&rdquo; Type 94 main guns &ndash; the largest guns ever mounted on a warship.<br/><br/>The battleship&rsquo;s design was an answer to the numerically dominant US Navy &ndash; Imperial Japan&rsquo;s primary threat in the Pacific. Though laid down in 1937 the battleship was not actually commissioned until late 1941, a week after fated attack on Pearl Harbour. She served as the flagship of the Combined Fleet. It was from her bridge that Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto directed the fleet at Midway in June 1942, though this proved a disastrous defeat for the Japanese. She was thereafter replaced by the Musashi as flagship and spent the larger part of 1943 and 44 moving between ports in a responsive role.<br/><br/>October 1944 was the only occasion on which Yamato fired her main guns in anger, at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Yamato had been tasked with repelling American forces invading the Phillipines. Though success lay within Japanese grasp, such was the ferocity of a counterattack of a light escort carrier group of the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Task Force 77 that the Japanese enacted a retreat, falsely believing they faced a much larger carrier force.<br/><br/>By early in 1945, Naval superiority in the Pacific belonged firmly to the US Navy. In an effort to delay the Allies&rsquo; advance, Yamato was dispatched to Okinawa in April 1945, with no expectation to ever return. Her orders were to beach herself and fight until destroyed. This was not allowed to occur when, on 7 April 1945 when she was sunk by US carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers, with the loss of the majority of her complement.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Model Ship<br/>  ‣ Yamato<br/>1 Ship Card<br/>Damage Sliders<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two Bismarck-class battleships were built for the Kriegsmarine. Bismarck was the first, named for the Chancellor (Otto von Bismarck). The battleship was laid down in July 1936 and launched February 1939. She and her sister ship, Tirpitz, were two of the largest battleships built by any European power, and certainly the largest built by Germany. Whilst the physical power they held was tremendous, they also wreaked psychological havoc amongst the allies. Churchill was determined that the two battleships not be let loose upon the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Bismarck's career, however, was woefully short, spanning just eight months under a single Captain, Ernst Lindeman. During this time, she only took part in a single offensive action that lasted just eight days in May 1941. This operation, codenamed Rhein&uuml;bung, was to attempt what the Allies feared, a breakthrough to the Atlantic and raid allied shipping efforts between Britain and North America (along with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen).<br/><br/>The two vessels were detected multiple times off Scandinavia, prompting Britain to initiate naval blocking maneuvers. The resultant battle, the Battle of the Denmark Strait, saw the British vessels HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales engage the two vessels. Hood was destroyed for her efforts and Prince of Wales suffered damage, forcing a retreat. However, Bismarck had suffered damage significant enough to put an end to her raiding mission.<br/><br/>Limping for occupied France for repairs, Bismarck was pursued by a Royal Navy set on retribution for the sinking of HMS Hood. She was attacked by 16 Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers deployed by HMS Ark Royal. A direct hit rendered Bismarck's steering gear inoperable. The following morning, she suffered crippling damage in a battle against two British battleships and two cruisers. She was subsequently, on 27 May 1941, scuttled by her crew and sank with many lives lost.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Model Ship<br/>  ‣ Bismarck<br/>1 Ship Card<br/>Damage Sliders<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Slam Wars is a card battle game that celebrates the various wrestling territories that existed from the 1940's until the 1990's. It captures the unique flavor of the territory by using historical wrestlers, tag teams, managers, promoters, announcers and referees. Each Slam Wars set is a standalone game, but can be seamlessly integrated with any other Slam Wars set to form a larger playing pool.<br/><br/>Slam Wars: Wrestling Legends of Michigan comes in a 2-piece full-color dual deck poker box and includes a 20-page full-color instruction guide. There are a total of 90 playing cards:<br/><br/>     44 solo wrestlers<br/>     16 tag teams<br/>     13 stat boosters<br/>     10 common match stipulations <br/>     6 special grudge match stipulations<br/>     1 championship <br/><br/><br/>A round of play is called an &quot;event&quot; and consists of 7 matches (4 solo and 3 tag team). Seven match stipulation cards will be exposed, one for each match of the event. Each wrestler and tag team card is rated in 5 different categories (represented by symbols that match the stipulation cards). The objective is to strategically place the cards you were dealt in matches where they can perform the best (i.e. have high ratings). Like a good wrestling booker, you are trying to maximize your wrestler's strengths and minimize their weaknesses. After comparing the stats in that particular category, the card with the higher rating wins the match-up.  Whichever player wins a majority of the 7 matches wins the event and is awarded the championship card. The holder of the championship card has an advantage heading into the next round of play. Much like poker, the rounds can continue until the participants decide to end it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

While Hunters is a standalone game, the rules for the game expand upon the core mechanics and settings of the Star Breach tabletop game ruleset. Thus, the Star Breach core rules will be often referenced throughout this expansion. The main difference between this expansion and the original game is that Hunters shifts the gaming action of Star Breach from &ldquo;player vs player&rdquo; to &ldquo;players vs game&rdquo; in a cooperative (co-op) environment. In this rulebook, you will find rules and mission based scenarios for solo play, co-op play up to four players, a campaign system, and a &ldquo;GM&rdquo; alternate mode where one of the players&mdash;or a 5th additional player&mdash;may play as the &ldquo;game master&rdquo; against their peers.<br/><br/>As with Star Breach, Hunters is a free ruleset allowing players to creatively play with any sci-fi models and within any scifi setting of their choosing. The industry standard of 28-32mm height models and gaming accessories are recommended for play, but the game will do just as well in any other popular gaming scale (such as 15mm). However you choose to use this expansion and the contained rules, I hope you and your gaming group have an absolute blast doing so!

The French commander, General Jean-Baptiste Girard, was commanding the Magdeburg Garrison and had been asked to support Marshal Oudinot in his drive towards Berlin. He was faced by a mainly Landwehr force commanded by Prussian General Karl Friedrich von Hirschfeld and supported by the Cossack General Alexandr Chernyshev. The Prussians and the Russians were given the task of stopping Girard&rsquo;s French from joining Oudinot&rsquo;s army.<br/><br/>The Battle of Hagelberg was a bitter battle, held on the same day as the Battle of Dresden. Though the casualties were high on both sides, the Coalition prevailed and stopped Girard from affecting a union of the French forces approaching Berlin.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>1.

You travel across the board which contains a diverse number of regions and locations that have unique opportunities and dangers as you set out to complete your quests and become the Master Gem Hunter!<br/><br/>Quests are unique jeweled items that contain specific numbers and types of faceted gems and pearls and have a monetary value once all the components are collected and turned in at the jeweler&rsquo;s.  There are 50 unique quest cards that can consist of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, topaz, opals, and various pearls.<br/><br/>Rough gems and pearls are obtained on unique locations on the board. Rough gems need to be cut into faceted gems to count toward completing your quest. There are some other opportunities to acquire gems and pearls in the game which gives players the opportunity to take a chance on finding an alternate means towards their goal.<br/><br/>Gem Town is the central hub of the island nation of Pacifica, which contains various locations visited throughout the game.  The island also has a mountain region, jungle region, and desert region; which are interconnected and accessible via rope bridges.  Each movement space visited requires the player to draw a fate card which can be beneficial to the player or a dire challenge.  There are 100 unique fates and 240 fate cards in total.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>At the beginning of each game the players decide whether to play a game based on completing the most quest cards in a specific time frame (first to achieve a specific total value in completed quest cards) or a speed round, which is the first player to complete one quest card.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Gem Hunt uses a turn-based, card drawing, and die rolling game system. Every turn has a movement phase and an action phase. The movement phase can consist of crossing a rope bridge, taking a ferry, taking the underground railway, taking a ride on a zip line, or moving on the board on one of the regional movement spaces. The action phase can consist of mining for gems, digging for oysters, cutting rough gems into faceted gems, performing transactions in the appropriate location, turning in completed quest cards, playing one of the mini games, or drawing a fate card after landing on a regional movement space.

Other Nationalist forces attacked from the north and east to surround the capital and lay siege. In mid-December 1936 the Nationalists launched their offensives, but these soon bogged down at the end of the month due to inclement weather and a lack of fuel. During the respite both sides rushed reinforcements to the front along the road from Madrid to La Coru&ntilde;a. Besides additional troops and aircraft, tanks were sent in large numbers by both sides. For the Nationalists, new Panzer I tanks from Germany were deployed for the first time in the war, along with more CV-33 tanks from Italy. The Republicans dispatched T-26 tanks and BA-6 armored cars that had just arrived from the Soviet Union. One of the largest battles of the war was about to be fought for control of Spain&rsquo;s capital.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

After launching Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22nd, the First Panzer Group of the German Sixth Army led the offensive into the Ukraine. Critical to the German success in the opening days was taking the main road leading to Kiev and Kharkov, and the bridges spanning the Ikva and Styr rivers. Any delays or setbacks here could have severe repercussions as the other German Army Groups and panzer formations drove deeper along Sixth Army&rsquo;s flanks. Desperate to stop the German blitzkrieg, Joseph Stalin, over the objections of General Zhukov, ordered an immediate counter-attack. The largest tank battle of the war to that date was the result. Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>A complete game of A Long, Hard Road is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch map sections<br/>&bull;    279 double-sided, un-mounted counters.<br/>&bull;    One players&rsquo; aide sheet<br/>&bull;    8 pages of rules<br/><br/>Players will also need one six (D6) and one ten-sided (D10) dice to play the game.

A player takes a card and separates it from the rest and indicates what data must be located as indicated by the rocket pencil on the back of the removed card.<br/>How to play:<br/>When all the players are ready, one player turns over the top card of the deck. All players at the same time and without touching the card will have to search for the data. The first to say it out loud and cover the letter will get the letter set aside as a point.<br/>The letter that was face up is left to one side, but in this case face down in order to see what the rocket pencil indicates.<br/>The data to look for in the charts are the following:<br/> Red (number): the emotion that is repeated the number of times indicated by the card (joy, sadness, surprise or anger)<br/>Purple (sex): the largest group represented on the card (boy-girl). In the event of a tie, &ldquo;tie&rdquo; must be indicated.<br/>Blue (hair): it will be necessary to discover which hair color is the most numerous in the group of boys and girls on the chart.<br/><br/>When there is only one letter left, it will be turned over to check what data to look for (what the rocket pencil marks). When everyone is ready, it is turned around again and the players try to be the fastest to discover the data.<br/><br/>Game over:<br/>When the deck of cards is finished the players will count the cards obtained. The participant who has collected the most cards will be the winner. In case of a tie, all are winners! Shall we play another?<br/>RECOMMENDATIONS: It is highly advisable to play the first few times with a single data to search, that is, it is always the same data for the entire game. You can start looking in the cards for hair color, the next game look for the majority in sex and in the third look for the coincidence in the number of repetitions of the same emotion that indicates the back of the card.<br/><br/>Un juego para conocer y reconocer las principales emociones con diversos modos de juego<br/><br/>",

Erupting from earth below your feet to snap and scratch, they can easily overwhelm even the most experienced wastelander with the fury and surprise of their attacks. Observant wanderers may notice their burrows and avoid them, but attempts to eradicate them when burrowed are almost always fruitless. They are expert diggers and their sharp claws are just at good as shoving dirt as they are at slicing the unwary.<br/><br/>While mole rats burrow and erupt from the ground, Radroaches will stay hidden and attack weak, wounded things. Their preferred habitats are cool, dank cellars and sheds, or underground sewers and train stations. Irradiated and swollen versions of their pre-war namesakes, Radroaches thrive in these inhospitable environments, sustained by refuse, decay and even (when necessary) each other. Despite the squalid nature of such places they often hide diamonds in the rough such as pre-war loot, energy sources, military bunkers or even entire vaults. Anyone daring enough to delve for these treasures should beware; more than a few wasteland wanders have met their ends via the incessant chittering bites and infected slashes of a wave of sullied Radroaches.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>6x Radroaches<br/>3x Mole Rats<br/><br/>Please note does not include cards, unit and weapon cards are available to download for free, or get everything including their AI cards in the Raiders Wave Expansion Card Pack<br/><br/>",

An open-ended sandbox style game where the pirate captain may choose his own path.<br/><br/>Set in the Caribbean Islands during the year 1718, as a pirate captain, you will attempt to build your wealth by attacking merchant ships and selling their goods, by attacking and pillaging towns, kidnapping or assassinating a town governor or his daughter, gambling in a tavern, and by recovering buried treasure from acquired maps.<br/><br/>Game components include navigation maps, various mats, a tables book, and a counter sheet representing individual ships, etc.<br/><br/>The player moves his pirate ship's game counter across the Caribbean map, traveling around and searching for merchant ships to take attack, visiting the pirate town of Nassau to buy and sell goods, plus repair the ship. The player may also construct a hidden pirate haven where he may store stolen goods and booty, plus repair his ship at no cost.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to save up enough booty in order to buy your pardon before the Royal Navy invades Nassau. Will you succeed, or be hanged for piracy?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By 1942 the British Admiralty was increasingly fearful of losing control in the skies over the English Channel. Earlier in February the German&rsquo;s Operation Cerberus saw the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gniesenau, as well as the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen sail up the channel to ports in Germany, beneath the very noses of the RAF and Royal Navy. New German radar and anti-aircraft and shore batteries installed along the north coast of France were making life more dangerous for Allied shipping as well as increasingly dangerous for their bombers crossing the channel to conduct bombing raids in occupied France, Belgium as well as Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>In May it was decided to conduct a raid on the channel port of Dieppe. Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbattan, commander of the British Combined Operations Center, was charged with planning the raid. It was hoped the raid could cause serious damage to the German&rsquo;s defenses, demonstrate to the Soviets that the Allies were earnest in their desire to quickly take the war to the Germans on the European continent, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of large scale amphibious operations. The RAF was counting on the Luftwaffe also rising up to aggressively defend the skies above Dieppe in a battle the RAF leadership was confident they could win. It was also hoped that intelligence agents, that would land with the 5,000 Canadian and 1,000 British  assault troops (along with 50 US Rangers), could perform &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; operations to capture German code books, samples of their new radar technology, and perhaps an Enigma code machine (this aspect of the raid was overseen by Ian Fleming, the future author of the James Bond novels). An earlier raid to be launched in July, dubbed Operation Rutter, was cancelled but the raid was resurrected in the first week of August and called Operation Jubilee.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your opponents?

        "description": "Imagine a raceway that begins in the woodlands.  Typhon, Angrboda, Arachne, Tiamat, Grendel, and Qilin are lined up and ready to compete in a marathon to the volcano.  The breeze seems to rot and die from the festering tension, sensing the oncoming rampage that will shake the world.  Typhon bursts from the forest with his hundred dragon heads scrambling over each other, creating havoc to disrupt his competitors.  Angrboda wields her frost giantess magic to freeze the others with Fimbulwinter cold.  Arachne, ever patient, takes her time to weave and scatter web traps far in the distance, beyond the sight of those without eight eyes.  Tiamat, unwilling to risk another defeat, unleashes her ten monstrous children throughout the battlefield to ambush her foes and help her when she needs them most.  Grendel, the living dreadnought, bashes his way past the others, refusing to be slowed.  And the Qilin, well&hellip;this dragon deer doesn&rsquo;t care about the violence, opting to prance ahead, helping whoever they feel like, swaying the tide of the race with benevolent magic.  Who wins?  What do they do at the end?  That&rsquo;s up to you to decide.<br/><br/>Now imagine that with any combination of 100 monsters from all across the globe.<br/><br/>Monster Marathon is the wild 2-6 player race to set back your friends.  Each character has 6 abilities that match your dice roll, so you&rsquo;ll have to use what you get to survive the 40 spaces to the end.  (My original intent for the game was for each player from 3-6 to control one monster, but over the course of playtesting, I've discovered that it also plays quite well at two if both players each pick 2-3 characters on a team.)<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s a glance at the basic rules:<br/><br/>All players can select the monster they want.  Then, choose a lane to start in.<br/><br/>Pick a monster figure and the matching color of tokens.  Some abilities will give you tokens for wards, curses, or traps.  When you use an ability that gives you a token, select one with a number that matches the ability.<br/><br/>During each turn, you will have two separate rolls of a six-sided die.  You roll a die for an ability at the beginning of each turn.  The number you roll determines the ability you get to use.  After you&rsquo;ve used your ability, you roll a die to move on the board.<br/><br/>First to the finish wins!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Friends are at the heart of a good life &ndash; and what we want when we get together with them is an opportunity to share what is really going on inside us as well as the chance to hear about what has touched, moved or preoccupied them.<br/><br/>This is a game designed to get the very best out of our friendships. Played on a board with a dice and cards, it invites us to ask one another a series of kind but searching questions about our lives. The more honestly and clearly we answer, the faster we advance around the board. The winner of the game is the person who has best demonstrated that bedrock of true friendship: the capacity for sincere, kindly self-disclosure. The game is guaranteed to bring out new facets of our friends and will allow for a series of fascinating moments of revelation and mutual discovery.<br/><br/>The cards cover four categories:<br/><br/>     Love<br/>     Work<br/>     Self<br/>     Family<br/><br/><br/>Questions cover topics such as:<br/><br/>     Have you ever been secretly a bit attracted to someone you probably shouldn&rsquo;t have been? (Light)<br/>     Have you ever acted on this attraction? (Heavy)<br/>     Do you have a strong sense of right and wrong? (Light)<br/>     Have you ever violated your own moral code? (Heavy)<br/>     Have you ever complained about a colleague&rsquo;s behaviour? (Light)<br/>     Has anyone complained about your own behaviour in the workplace? (Heavy)<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>In The Friendship Game, players score points by giving out information about themselves. Each turn, a player will roll the dice and move their pawn forward. Then, they get a question based on the location they landed on. They can choose to answer the light version of the question, the heavy version of the question, or neither. If they choose to answer the question, the other players will judge if the player has shared fully; if they feel this is the case, the player scores points.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has reached the end of the track; the player who has scored the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Contains Game Board, 4 Sets of 24 Cards, 6 Wooden Counters, 1 Wooden Dice | 197 x 197 x 35mm | Instructions included | 3 - 6 Players | Suitable for 15 years +<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deep in the Hexenwood, four powerful tree spirits fight an endless war to control the forest. Take control of one of these spirits, then engage in a strategic, turn based battle. By the end, one tree will come to dominate the forest - are you wise enough to prevail?<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>First, build the forest with however many Blinks you&rsquo;d like, and in any shape you want. The larger the forest, the longer the game will take. Below are some examples of typical setups for 12, 18, and 24 Blinks.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;re happy with your setup, click any Blink to plant your starting Trees. Single click a Tree to change its species. Each player should choose a different species of Tree and a unique starting position on opposite ends of the forest. There are four species of tree, each with a unique color and leaf pattern.<br/><br/>Hexenwood is a very flexible game, and can be set up in many different ways. For instance, you can begin a game with each player having multiple starting Trees, or even with some players having more than others. This can be helpful for players with mismatched skill levels.<br/><br/>After you plant your starting trees, double-click any Blink to start the game. When mapping is complete, the game begins.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Hexenwood is a turn-based game. The board will show which player&rsquo;s turn it is by pulsing their Trees. If it is your turn, single-click one of your Trees to activate it. Only trees that can make valid moves can be activated.<br/><br/>When a Tree is activated, the board will display all of the moves it can make. There are two ways of moving: Spreading and Jumping.<br/><br/>SPREADING<br/>Unclaimed positions adjacent to your Tree will be fully illuminated. If you click it, you will plant a Tree in that spot, and you will capture any neighboring Trees controlled by other players. This is the safest way to expand your territory.<br/><br/>JUMPING<br/>Unclaimed positions that are one space away from your tree will show a bright pattern. If you click one of these Blinks, you can Jump to that spot. The Tree you jumped from will uproot itself and take over the new area, also capturing any neighboring Trees controlled by other players. This is a slightly risky way to expand because it leaves holes in your territory.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve made your move, the game will automatically move to the next player&rsquo;s turn. If a player has no Trees that can make a valid move, their turn will be skipped and the game will move to the next player immediately.<br/><br/>Importantly, you cannot rearrange the board during gameplay. If a Blink is removed from the field, the game will pause and the faces that are missing neighbors will flash. You must return them to their original positions to resume the game.<br/><br/>If at any point during the game you wish to restart and go back to setup, triple-click any Blink.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION<br/>When no players can make a valid move, or if there is only one player remaining with Trees in the forest, the game ends. The entire forest will flash white, then reveal the winning player. All Trees controlled by the winning player will flash rapidly, and all other Blinks will revert to an empty forest floor.<br/><br/>",

You will lead either the Royal Expedition Force of the Wami Kingdom, or the 3rd Fleet of the Neupert Prefecture.<br/><br/>Each turn, the opposing fleets engage over one of the contested planets, and players select a vessel to engage. As the more powerful ship prevails, the system will join the victors stellar empire. If the ships fight to a draw, as they skulk away to lick their wounds, the following battles become more important, as the victor of the next battle will be able to lay claim to each system where combat was unresolved.<br/><br/>Once both players have exhausted their entire fleet, cooler heads will prevail and an armistice will be signed.<br/><br/>While both stellar empires may have made territorial claims, only the empire with the more worthwhile conquest can justify the skirmish and be called the victor!<br/><br/>",

In the past two thousand years, 158 bloody battles have been recorded in history.<br/><br/>In November 1948, a decisive battle of unprecedented scale was about to break out. The number of troops participating in the war exceeded that at any time in the past. The total number of troops invested by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached 1.4 million. Compared with other wars in history, it is really not worth it.<br/><br/>With regard to this decisive battle, the strategic objectives of the two sides are different, and they also have two different names. The Kuomintang's expectation of the campaign was that the whole army would guarantee the lifeline of the railway from Xuzhou to Bengbu on the Jinpu line, so it was named &quot;Xubeng battle&quot;. Su Yu's plan is to attack Haizhou first and then win the two criteria. Therefore, our side is called &quot;Huaihai Campaign&quot;.<br/><br/>In this decisive battle to determine the fate of a country and a nation, the Kuomintang army invested more than 800000 people and the people's Liberation Army invested 600000 people. In the end, 600 thousand destroyed the 800 thousand. Over the years, the war history textbooks of military academies in various countries have called this campaign a &quot;classic war example&quot; and studied it as a major topic. Generation after generation of professional soldiers of different nationalities, different skin colors and different political beliefs are no strangers to this war case. What makes people deeply interested is its process. How did the 600000 people with inferior military strength and equipment defeat the 800000 people with superior military strength and equipment.<br/><br/>",

The loyalty of your factions to the cause is never certain!<br/><br/>The game system adapts the key mechanics of Matt Calkin's Sekigahara game (2011, GMT). Players receive a hand of cards each turn which are used to play for the actions, and to deploy game pieces into battle. In Revolution &amp; Reaction, there is a political phase, in which players try to gain political control of the various areas of Spain by placing influence blocks; in the military phase, players move their units and start combats in locations on the board (towns cities). Blocks and cards are hidden from the other player, so the opponent's true political and military strength is only know in struggle.<br/><br/>The game includes diplomacy and elections, special units (such as the International Brigades), and rules to simulate the outbreak of war, giving the game a strong connection to the real history of the Spanish Civil War.<br/><br/>",

A game of kings and peasants alike.&quot;<br/><br/>Vilitum is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. Each player controls an army of 5 unique units. If you defeat all of your opponent's units, or if they surrender, you win!<br/><br/>On each turn a player may move and/or attack with 1 piece. If a piece receives enough damage, it is removed from the board. Each unit has a unique combination of movement, attack range, and special ability.<br/><br/>For younger players, or for your first game, a simplified rule set gets players use to the basics, and adding in the advance rules opens the DEEP strategy of Vilitum.<br/><br/>Adding in the Soldier Expansion gives each player a new unit. Each player now has a pair of soldiers, that while having the lowest life, are tough, and if they are adjacent, deal extra damage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This volume presents the rules of one of the first real wargames developed in Italy. At first it was played at the A.R.G.O. (Roman Association of Operative Games) and then, in the '70s, it was slowly presented, piece by piece, on the defense magazine Esercito e Armi - Interconair. At last it was published as a book by the Italian editor Mursia that had a series of book dedicated to adult gaming.<br/>The game reproduces, at operational level, the clashes for the control of a sea zone. The players control ships and planes that are clearly the transposition of the class of planes that were available in the '70s. By reading the rules it is clear that the creator was a navy staff officer, you don't have any real nation but you lead hypothetical nations. With the book was supplied a map representing the contended sea zone.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Il presente volume costituisce la prima trattazione organica e completa apparsa sinora in Italia sulla simulazione dei conflitti aeronavali di epoca contemporanea, in ambiente prevalentemente strategico.<br/>Il testo affronta praticamente tutti gli aspetti di una guerra aeronavale sia dal punto di vista strategico sia da quello tattico ambientando gli avvenimenti in un'area geografica ipotetica, in modo da non conferire eccessiva complicazione al gioco: ci&ograve;, peraltro, non ne riduce la validit&agrave; per quanto riguarda gli aspetti tecnico-dottrinali relativi all'inpiego delle forze aeronavali e delle risorse dei belligeranti.<br/>L'opera - per la sua struttura, per la complessit&agrave; e la variet&agrave; delle situazioni che possono essere riprodotte, per la maturit&agrave; e le conoscenze richieste ai giocatori - si rivolge essenzialmente al pubblico degli adulti; tuttavia, con un minimo di guida iniziale, &egrave; possibile effettuarne un'adeguata reinterpretazione e un adattamento che lo rendano agevole e gradevole anche al pubblico dei giovani.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the cover<br/><br/>",

Players assemble a gang of local Dwellers with different talents (your gang tableau) and move through ancient tunnels hunting treasures and other rare finds. Treasures can be stashed for victory points or used to boost capabilities (movement, carrying load, health, dueling skill and gang recruitment) and activate tools. Treasure also hires you Dwellers for your gang. As your gang grows your capabilities also grow. As you travel deeper into the tunnel labyrinth, the going gets harder. Blessings from the Green Man God aid your quest, but the murderous Weasels will stop at nothing to prevent you getting your hands on treasure.<br/><br/>Undergrowth is a tableau building game with mixed, interacting mechanics where the aim is to assemble the most skillful, most renowned and wealthiest treasure hunting gang. The winning player has the highest value card tableau and the most stashed gold at the end of 12 rounds. The game combines point to point movement, resource management, tableau building, dice combat and a hint of push your luck to produce a fun, adventurous and interactive tunnel crawling treasure hunt. Players have thinky dilemmas and interesting tactical choices. Deploy your tunnellers, move them through the tunnels, seek and find different treasures, avoid obstacles, interact with opponents, build your gang and grow your wealth and local reputation. Recruit new gang members from the local Inn and pay their cost to add them to your gang, then use their immediate or ongoing skills to become the dominant treasure hunting gang.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It was created with the purpose of having a seal inside the Carcassonne&rsquo;s community and was given as a gift in the 2018-2019 catalan&rsquo;s league of Carcassonne.<br/><br/>The expansion consists of a tile of the &lsquo;Sagrada Familia&rsquo;. When it appears in the game, should be played normally placing it where the player wants. Since from that moment on, the enlarged city with the Sagrada Familia tile no may be closed throughout the game, but it will be possible to expand with more city ​​tiles while never closing the city ​​with the Sagrada Familia.<br/><br/>Exception 1: In the case that the placement of the Sagrada Familia tile closes a city, that city will have 0 points and the meeples will return to the corresponding players.<br/><br/>Exception 2: In the case that the Sagrada Familia tile can&rsquo;t be validly placed anywhere on the board, this tile will be returned to the box and will not come into play again during this game. The player in turn takes another tile from the pile in order to do his turn normally.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the city with the Sagrada Familia tile will be counted as an incomplete city following the usual scoring rules.<br/>If any other tile taken during the game can only be placed in the city with the Sagrada Familia tile closed, this tile is removed from the game and the player in turn takes another tile in order to do his turn normally.<br/><br/>Variant: In this variant the city that contains the tile of the Sagrada Familia yes can be closed normally but in this case it will count 0 points and the meeples will remain blocked until the end of the game. So be careful not to close the city if you have meeples inside and try to make it as big as possible to avoid it<br/><br/>",

This is a two player wargame, but if you wish to play in two teams you can, dividing your assets as you see fit. The game can also be played solitaire because, although it uses cards, it is not &lsquo;card driven&rsquo; as such.<br/><br/>The base game includes an A1 map of Middle Europe and features unit counters for all those that fight in the main European theatre of war at a regiment or brigade scale. The Wider World expansion adds four more A2 sized maps for Maritime Europe, Latin America, North America, and India, plus extensive named naval units, and numerous colonial units. The Wider World expansion adds naval rules including rules for movement between theatres of war. For the most ambitious players the expansion also includes the Global Grand Campaign that stitches together all theatres of war providing the ultimate bird&rsquo;s eye view of a world at war.<br/><br/>",

The player assumes the role of the titular Dragonborne: a person who is psychically bonded to an ancient biological war machine known as a Dragon. Together, the Dragon and rider confront a series of enemies human, mechanical and monstrous in tactical battles of resource and position management on their journey to fulfil their destiny.<br/><br/>This is a pure solitaire game. All enemy activity is regulated by an automata controlled by a single die roll per turn and answering a few questions. There are 29 different opponents included, each presenting their own strengths and weaknesses for the player to discover and overcome. Each battle is connected to the next by a story, and the player's resources are persistent from one fight to the next so thinking ahead is critical. Depending on the player's performance, they will end up playing one of three branching campaign paths, each with their own different opponents.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, the Dragon will evolve, gaining new powers and abilities randomly or as directed by the player along an evolutionary tree. There are 60 different evolutionary powers to choose from and combine, allowing for a huge range of strategies. You may end up with a massive, heavily-armoured Dragon able to absorb incoming attacks and retaliate using the attacker's own energy, a swift, nimble Dragon that outmaneuvers it's opponents before finishing them with precision attacks, an offensive powerhouse that rends it's enemies to pieces with jaw and tail, or a shamanistic monster that uses magic and the elements to overcome adversaries.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nordic teams love a good fight above all else - and that's certainly what they do best on the field! The Nordiques spend their entire lives in the cold north, which makes them very tough. These hardened players excel at scrimmaging, making blocks in all directions as they punch their way into the end zone - and presumably the tavern just beyond!<br/><br/>Of course, it's not just about causing a midfield brawl; there's also that crucial detail of scoring touchdowns. The Nordic teams work best when they can use their generous fighting skills to punch a hole in the opponent's defense, so that their Valkyries can use their impressive speed to get through and win.<br/><br/>This kit consists of 120 plastic pieces with which you can assemble the Norsca Rampagers, a Nordic team to use in your Blood Bowl matches. The team consists of 6 Norse Raider Linemen, 2 Beer Boar, 2 Norse Berserkers, 2 Ulfwereners and 2 Valkyries. It also includes 2 double-sided Blood Bowl pieces, 2 turn and raise counters, 4 balloons, and a sheet of 292 decals.<br/><br/>These figures come unpainted and require assembly.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Then the game begins along with a full on war of deceit, persuasion and cunning weapon play. 4). The first team to win 5 battles wins the game. 5). Benedict should remain discreet through the process. If revealed to be a Redcoat spy they compromise their chance for an early Redcoat Victory!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They're looking for a &quot;go-to&quot; crew of mercenaries and pioneers, so they've issued a galaxy-wide challenge... Bring them what they need in a timely manner and you'll be rewarded with a full-time contract(handsome salaries and benefits included).<br/><br/>Build a crew, mod your ship, and race against the other competing crews, to mine resources and battle your way to victory! This is an uncharted galaxy, so anything goes.<br/><br/>The game board is customizable and modular, so gameplay is different every time you play. Before you start the game, players will take turns placing game pieces for the session. You can play however you'd like!<br/><br/>A single mission card, showing which resources and how much of each are required, is drawn for the game session (all players will be racing to complete this). The first player to gather the requested resources and travels back to the space station wins the game. All players (given three random crew members) start at the space station at the beginning of the game, and roll dice to determine how far they can navigate that turn(crew skills can increase this roll).<br/><br/>Once a player has reached a planet or asteroid(each have their own unique resources) they can mine. You can mine a planet once per turn, for a max of two turns. Mining does not end your turn however, so its best to start it by mining every time.<br/><br/>You can also battle other players to steal their resources, eliminate crew members, or destroy any tech mods they may have. This requires you to be on the same spot as the opposing player however. Another way to use your turn is to spend any unneeded resources to upgrade your ship with tech mods or new crew members (max of 4).<br/><br/>Once a player has acquired the necessary resources to complete the mission card, they must navigate back to where they started the game. Once they have arrived, they win the game. Watch out for other players trying to steal your loot though!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Khalkin-Gol War: Struggle for Mongolia, 1939 is an operational-level, two-player wargame covering a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; Japanese-Soviet war in Mongolia in 1939. The historical campaign saw a series of limited actions in the late spring and early summer of 1939 along the Khalka River (Khalkin Gol) on the Manchukuoan/Outer Mongolian border. The campaign ended in a corps-level battle in August 1939 in which the Soviets decisively defeated the Japanese and produced a cease-fire between the two antagonists. The assumption of the game is that both Tokyo and Moscow decided instead to turn this into a full-scale war.<br/><br/>Each turn of play represents a month of operations. Each hex on the map is approximately 30 kilometers across. Ground units are mostly built around divisions, with breakdowns into brigades and regiments. Air units represent anything from an elite squadron to a mediocre group.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Ties are resolved in reverse player order (where the player that was the &quot;first player&quot; in round 5 being last).<br/><br/>This expansion makes the game easier to finish before the end of the last round as you are more likely to get an additional reward or two.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "<br/>        Board Game Design Lab Finalist 2020<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>It's Caturday! In Cool Cats, you are helping lazy, entitled felines have the best day ever!<br/><br/>On each player's turn, they must take all cards of one value and assign those numbers by marking off each value on their sheet.  The unique aspect of this adorably addictive flip and fill game is the bingo style play in which you will be able to deduce what numbers might appear as there are only 3 of each value in the deck (including the joker).  Plan your day carefully based on what you are able to get because your opponents might have the same idea!<br/><br/>Each area on the player sheet can earn you style points toward your day or even help you create entertaining combos. Play with your human to keep them sharp (and get sweet bonuses as a reward), sleep in the sun to earn style points and extra numbers, beg for specific belly rubs that only a cat could be satisfied by and eat as much as you can to multiply your style points.  Cool cats need bathroom breaks too-- so fill as many litter boxes as you can for big points!<br/><br/>Cool cats get bored quickly so once you take five cards or more, you are out of the round.  Balance getting large sets of numbers with your aspirations to be the coolest cat on the block and diversify your choices.  Style points can come easy if you plan right, but you'll have to work for them.<br/><br/>Multiplayer is only part of the game, however!  Take on Feline Fiends who specialize in all sorts of feline chaos in two separate modes:  Campaign and Free-For-All.  In Campaign Mode, go solo or bring some friends to take on each Feline Fiend in order from Lucky Cat to Captain Ameowica to the all-powerful Sam and outsmart them in all of their pawfect skills.  Players must work together to reach a point threshold while facing cats who don't like rules and take whatever they want.  Should Campaign Mode be too stressful, take them on solo or with friends in any order you like in Free-For-All.<br/><br/>Cool Cats combines the flip and fill mechanic with drafting, press your luck and deduction into a print and play game that feels bigger than the sheet of paper and marker you are using.<br/><br/>-An earlier version of this game was a finalist for the Board Game Design Lab Challenge in 2020.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The battle of Fleurus was initiated by a call from the Protestant Dutch to relieve the city of Breda, then under siege by another Spanish army under the command of Ambrogio Spinola. The aim of the Protestant troops was to cut off the retreat and trap the Spaniards, not just to end the siege.<br/><br/>The Protestant army encountered their opponents near Fleurus, and a furious battle ensued, where the better led (even if weaker) Spanish army was able to crush their Protestant enemy and provide a means of retreat for Spinola&rsquo;s force.<br/><br/>Each combat unit represents from 300 to 1000 soldiers, and it is rated, from left to right, for combat factor, morale factor and movement factor. Each infantry strength point is around 150 men, each cavalry strength point around 60 men. Each leader is rated for Command (indicating how many activation chits that leader has) and Movement. Each hex is about 100 meters. Each turn represents a half hour of time.<br/><br/>Players draw leader markers from an opaque container (mug, envelope) to activate their leaders' formations. Units move about a hex map of the battlefield and use a six-sided die to resolve combat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The coin uses the Luminary Sun &amp; Initiate Moon illustrations by Carson Ellis from the game Illimat.<br/><br/>The Luminary Matriarch added a special rule when using the Syzygy Coin as an okus. When a player clears a field and collects the Syzygy Coin, they must immediately flip the coin; this occurs before drawing cards, refilling the field, or revealing the Luminary.<br/><br/>If this flip reveals the Sun, it&rsquo;s Opposition. The player who claimed the coin must give one card from their hand to each of the other players in the game, beginning with the players to their left and continuing clockwise.<br/><br/>If this flip reveals the Moon, it&rsquo;s a Conjunction.  The player who claimed the coin must take one card chosen at random from the hand of each player, beginning with the player to their left and continuing clockwise.<br/><br/>The effects of the Syzygy will leave one or more players with more than four cards in their hand. This is temporary. Players only draw cards at the end of the turn if they have fewer than four cards in their hand.<br/><br/>The coin was originally commissioned by Benjamin Franklin to circulate the meeting dates of his local Philadelphia society chapter. Today, its minted in partnership with the artisans who bring the worlds of The Lord of The Rings, Game of Thrones, Labyrinth, and The Kingkiller Chronicles into the palm of your hands, Shire Post Mint.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It all begins when...<br/>While organizing our move, we found a lost box, forgotten a long time ago. Upon opening it, we discovered many photographs. We quickly called everyone to come and see the photos and remember each moment that was captured.<br/>Do we have the same memories of those moments? What feelings do we perceive when we look at them?<br/>We sat in a circle and pulled out the first photo...<br/><br/>Players: 2+<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of levels, and players win by reaching level 5. The game begins with two revealed pictures, and one player must choose a feeling card and secret selects a picture that he/she thinks best relates to the feeling, then the other players have to vote on which of the open pictures corresponds to the chosen feeling.<br/><br/>Then they must choose a single voting token that indicates how many spaces the pawn will move on the track, depending on whether the guess is correct or incorrect. Then a new picture is opened, and the next player to the left must remove the chosen picture and reveal a new one, and they must open a new feeling card so that there are always 4 cards available.<br/><br/>If the voted picture is the one chosen by the player, the level marker moves to the right the number of spaces indicated on the voting token. If the guess is incorrect, the marker moves to the left.<br/><br/>If the level marker reaches 0, everyone loses immediately, regardless of the level (it doesn't go back to the previous level). When the picture is chosen correctly, the marker moves to the right the number of spaces indicated on the voting token. If the marker reaches the star, the next level is reached. The marker goes back to space 5, and an additional picture is revealed. There are 3 pictures at level 3, 4 pictures at level 4, and 5 pictures at level 5. To win, you need to reach the star at level 5.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle for Byzantium is a historical action/ conquest board game set in the Byzantine Empire in the year 1025 which features several elements and references from the Byzantine Empire. Here, with the death of the emperor Basil II, 4 warriors from within and beyond the empire all compete for control of the Byzantine Empire taking advantage of the weak position the empire is at considering that its strong ruler had just died. In this 4-player dice game, players can choose from among the said 4 characters being Demetrios the Byzantine Cataphract commander, Al-Sadin the Arab general, Jean-Pierre the Norman adventurer-knight, and Freydis the female Varangian warrior. The objective is to capture all 18 on the map and the winner is the player with the most number of cities. To play the game, players must roll the dice and thus move across the golden mosaic tiles in the map of the Byzantine Empire in 1025. If players land on any red porphyry tiles by the roll of the dice, they are to select action cards. There are 7 different kinds of action cards and each has a different function. Once used, cards must be surrendered to the discard pile.<br/><br/>One of the 7 action cards that players randomly select when landing on the red porphyry tile is the &quot;Gain Gold&quot; card which allows a player to move 4 steps forward, though this card can be kept for future use especially when 4 steps are needed to capture a city or land on a red porphyry tile, and once used this card must be surrendered. The second kind of action card is the &quot;Gain an Army&quot; card which allows players to capture any open city- except the capital Constantinople- on the map only when landing on it with the roll of the dice, and once used this card must be surrendered. The third kind of action card is the &quot;Besiege a City&quot; card which allows players to automatically capture the city closest to them without landing on it with the roll of the dice, thus when selecting this card the player must move his or her character to the city he or she captures, but once used the card must be surrendered. The fourth kind of action card is the &quot;Plague&quot; card, and when a player selects it he or she must move his or her character to the location known as Ragusa on the upper-left corner of the map where a player loses a turn due to plague, and again after the card is used it must be surrendered. The fifth kind of action card is the &quot;Greek Fire&quot; card which when selected forces a player to return his or her character to its starting point on the map, and again after the card is used it must be surrendered. The sixth kind of action card is the &quot;Rebellion&quot; card which when being selected forces a player to lose one city, however if a player selects this card without owning a city yet then the card has no use, and again after being used the card must be surrendered. Last but not least is the &quot;Sack a City&quot; card which has the most powerful function as when being selected, players can steal any owned city by another player, however this card can only work if an opponent already owns a city, and once being used the card has to be immediately surrendered.<br/><br/>Each of the 4 in-game characters have their own special abilities which can however only be used ONCE. For those who play as the Byzantine Demetrios, the &quot;Greek Fire&quot; card when being selected can be used once in the game to capture an open city. If a player chooses to play the Arab Al-Sadin, he or she is immune to the &quot;Rebellion&quot; card only once in the game which means when selecting it one does not lose a city. When playing as the Norman Jean-Pierre, the player for at least once in the game is immune to the plague when selecting the &quot;Plague&quot; card. Lastly for those playing as the Varangian Freydis, one &quot;Gain an Army&quot; card can be used twice for only one time in the game to capture not just one but two open cities. Additionally, players can use the game's 2 &quot;Gain a Navy&quot; functions- wherein both are located on opposite sides of the map to capture any city of their choosing, though each &quot;Gain a Navy&quot; function can only be used once in the game. When playing the game, each player is given a pouch with their respective color- red for Demetrios, green for Al-Sadin, blue for Jean-Pierre, and gold for Freydis- and inside the pouches are 18 conquests tokens each wherein these round tokens have the first letter of the respective character's name on them. When capturing a city, players must place the token with the first letter of their character's name on the city they take. Once a city is taken by a player, he or she must claim the city's respective illustrated city card in which there are 18 of them (one per city) depicting a Byzantine landmark of the city and on the back side of the card some information on the city. Capturing the imperial capital Constantinople meanwhile is different from capturing other cities in the map as first of all, Constantinople cannot be captured with the &quot;Besiege a City&quot; card while it also requires 2 &quot;Gain an Army&quot; cards to acquire it. Other ways to take Constantinople includes using the &quot;Gain a Navy&quot; function or using the &quot;Sack a City&quot; card if another player already owns it. Owning Constantinople however has a lot of benefits which for one includes being immune to the &quot;Rebellion&quot; card, thus those who own Constantinople cannot lose any city except Constantinople if another player steals it with the &quot;Gain a Navy&quot; or &quot;Sack a City&quot; card.<br/><br/>When playing the game, the action cards may run out in the middle of the game. If this happens at the middle of the game, players can choose to end it when the action cards have run out and thus the player with the most number of cities at this point wins the game. However, in the full version of the game, once the action cards run out they must be reshuffled and once that's done the game resumes. The full version of the game ends when all 18 cities on the map have been taken, and once this happens players must count the number of cities they own. The one with the highest number of cities thus wins the game, though at the end Constantinople is equivalent to 2 points, and thus the player who owns Constantinople has 2 additional points.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

On May 27th British forces near the north end of the Niagara River were forced to retreat into the sanctuary of Fort George by an American force led by Generals Henry Dearborn and William Winder. After successfully withdrawing nearly all of the other outposts along the river following the American invasion of the Niagara Peninsula, Brigadier General John Vincent began planning for ways to strike back at the Americans, whose force was joined by another led by General John Chandler. Local informants, along with a daring night-time reconnoitering by Colonel John Harvey of the American encampment at Stoney Creek near what is today Hamilton, Ontario, disclosed the lackadaisical nature of the American deployment. Although outnumbered by nearly a five-to-one margin, General Vincent ordered a risky night assault, counting upon superior knowledge of the local terrain, surprise, as well as training with his regulars. The battle that resulted was one of the most intense and lop-sided battles fought in Upper Canada.<br/><br/>Can you do as well, or better, than your historical counterparts?<br/><br/>Each copy of A Feeble and Negligent Action is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    One 11 by 17 inch map with Turn Record Track.<br/>&bull;    100 double-sided counters.<br/>&bull;    8 pages of rules.<br/><br/>Players will also need a six-sided die and a standard deck of playing cards to play the game.<br/><br/>Each hex is approximately 35 yards across, a regular or militia infantry unit is 150-150 men, and artillery units represent 1 cannon or mortar.

The battle cruisers of Britain&rsquo;s Grand Fleet and Germany&rsquo;s High Seas Fleet met in the January 1915 Battle of Dogger Bank, and both fleets continually sortied into the waters dividing them.<br/><br/>Jutland: Dogger Bank&nbsp;continues the story we began with&nbsp;Jutland: Battle Analysis 1914. It&rsquo;s a book of history, scenarios and game/historical analysis, all woven together to use our&nbsp;Great War at Sea: Jutland&nbsp;game as the basis to tell the campaign&rsquo;s story in a unique manner.<br/><br/>Dogger Bank&nbsp;picks up the story with the Cuxhaven Raid of December 1914, and continues it into the operations of early 1915 - a rarely-if-ever-discussed part of the North Sea naval campaign. There are 28 new scenarios (11 operational and 17 battle scenarios), plus historical articles and analyses all relating the game play to the actual events. We look at how the game simulates the operations, and then we flesh them out with still more scenarios: fast-playing battle scenarios using just the Tactical Map, and additional operational scenarios using the operational map as well to pick up the action at key decision points and discuss why the admirals involved made the decisions that determined the battle&rsquo;s outcome.<br/><br/>Jutland&nbsp;is already a very fine game (our most popular ever, even more than&nbsp;Third Reich) and a good instrument through which to re-play history.&nbsp;Dogger Bank&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Battle Analysis&nbsp;make it even more so, while adding more quick fun by fleshing out the battle scenario aspect of the game.<br/><br/>Dogger Bank&nbsp;is a 64-page, large-format history/analysis book for&nbsp;Jutland; you&rsquo;ll need a copy of the game to play these scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It features two game modes in which players can choose between simplicity and complexity.<br/><br/>Fury offers a fast-paced 3x3 battle on the strategy play mat, similar to Final Fantasy's Triple Triad. A typical Fury game lasts for just 5-10 minutes. Use two 60-card Power Decks and the Elemental Reverse card to outwit your opponent and claim victory by occupying the majority of the play mat.<br/><br/>Titan's Fury features an ultimate strategic battle that lasts an average of 30 minutes. The full game is played on a 5x5 play mat and uses the same components from Fury mode, plus the Void, Clash, and Titan cards. In this high-stakes battle, the winner is determined by the player who captures the most Elemental Power from their opponent's Power Cards, and any bonuses from other scoring mechanics.<br/><br/>In Fury of the Elements, everyone plays, and every card can determine victory or defeat!<br/><br/>Engage in battles with Power Cards, each deck containing 60 cards with four elemental types: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. From the Wisp to the mighty Lord, strategically place your cards on the play mat, initiate battles through position-based combat, and capture your opponent's cards.<br/><br/>Power Clashes and Clash Spells add a dynamic twist to the game. Reversing the Elemental Hierarchy with the Elemental Reverse card and drawing from the Clash Spell Deck can be the key to victory. Playing a Clash Spell can alter the hand, decks, or battlefield for the active player, and may be done once per turn.<br/><br/>Draw a card, so that you are back up to your hand limit.<br/><br/>Pass your Turn to the other player.<br/><br/>Game Mechanics and Interactions such as the Clash Spells may slightly affect the length of a turn, as these cards can be played at any time, once per turn on that player's turn, in addition to the one per-turn, Power Card.<br/><br/>Create matches of 3, 4, or 5-of-a-kind in an attempt to score bonus points. Form Flickers, Rages, and Furies to gain scoring bonuses and to increase the possibility of defending against the Void's destructive power. But beware, greed summons the relentless Void that threatens to consume everything in its path.<br/><br/>The Titans, which are powerful elemental creatures, are a key component in Fury of the Elements. Choose your Titans wisely, reveal the first one at the start of the game, and strategically unleash its abilities to turn the tide in your favor.<br/><br/>Whether you choose the swift pace of Fury or the strategic depth of Titan's Fury, Fury of the Elements offers an immersive and challenging card game experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You receive one point for each piece that remains on the board and something called the button exchanges hands throughout the game and awards the player who has it at the end of the game half a point. The game ends when no more moves of any kind remain.<br/><br/>Definitions: Hollow: A hollow is any set of cells partitioned by stones of either or both colors and possibly board edges.<br/><br/>Button: The button is a piece off the board worth half a point that the last player to create a hollow always receives or retains.<br/><br/>On a turn a player may either place a stone of his color, such that it does not alter the number of hollows or he may create a new hollow by removing the maximal group of stones, regardless of who they belong to, and leaving just the stones outlining the new region, often in conjunction with board edges.<br/><br/>Special thanks to Luis Bola&ntilde;os Mures for creating a much simpler way of preventing hollows from being filled in with some classic efficient technical writing. My original plan was that players would always play in the uniquely largest region and that placements could never create hollows, but he instead suggested the current wording that seems so obvious now. My original approach would have led to a much less interesting game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mindbug: Battlefruit Kingdom is a stand-alone game of Mindbug about a Kingdom of Pineapple Paladins fighting the mighty Lychee King. Plant your fruit and vegetable creatures, protect them from your opponent, and Harvest their crazy abilities. Being a stand-alone game, Mindbug: Battlefruit Kingdom can be played on its own, or mixed with any other Mindbug sets.<br/><br/>This new set introduces the Harvest mechanic allowing you to trigger extremely powerful abilities a few turns after a creature is played. It also introduces the new FAST keyword allowing some creatures to attack the same turn it's played. Pressure your opponent and protect your creatures to harvest their rewards.<br/><br/>In Mindbug, you summon hybrid creatures and send them to battle against your opponent. But be careful: your opponent may use one of their Mindbugs to take control of it. Outwit your opponent in a fascinating tactical duel in which having the best cards and playing them at the wrong time can be deadly for yourself.<br/><br/>Mindbug combines the accessibility and fairness of a simple card game with the strategic depth of a complex Strategy Card Game. The result is a skill-based dueling card game that feels utterly different from all the other card games you have played before.<br/><br/>",

Believing he had reached the Indies, he landed on a Caribbean Island, unaware that he had stumbled upon a new continent. This momentous event, later known as &quot;The Discovery of America,&quot; marked the beginning of an era of exploration, colonization, and cultural clash.<br/><br/>Sea &amp; Steel: Columbus' Voyages is a historical board game that immerses players in the tumultuous years following Columbus's arrival in the Caribbean. Players take on the roles of either the Spanish conquistadors or the indigenous peoples, each with their own unique objectives and challenges.<br/>The game spans the period from 1492 to 1505, encompassing the four voyages of discovery led by Columbus and the subsequent Spanish colonization efforts. Players will use Event Cards, to gain control in the 15 distinct Caribbean land zones. The game incorporates historical events and challenges, such as the construction of palisades, gold mining, and the maintenance of Spanish ships. Players must carefully manage their resources, deploy their units effectively, and adapt their strategies to the ever-changing game state.<br/><br/>The game offers two distinct modes:<br/><br/>     Basic Mode: Designed for new players or those seeking a quicker game session.<br/>     Advanced Mode: Provides a more in-depth simulation for experienced players.<br/><br/><br/>Both Basic and Advanced Modes feature a solo play option, allowing a single Spanish player to face off against an AI-controlled indigenous faction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This community of monks, which had already settled in other regions, would have to manage the territory and resources of this place. In order to do that, an enormous monastery was built in Alcoba&ccedil;a and that same monastery would go on to become one of the most important for the Order.<br/><br/>The Cistercians' motto was Ora et Labora (prayer and work), so their abbeys were usually in secluded locations. Silence for their prayers was paramount, as was easy access to stone (in order to build the monastery) and several other goods, such as wood and iron (which were essential to build farming equipment and tools). Fertile land and access to water (necessary for food, hygiene, and agriculture) were also essential to achieve self-sufficiency. Alcoba&ccedil;a filled all the requirements for the task, so the Cistercians accepted the king's challenge &mdash; and this is the historical background from which this game was born.<br/><br/>12 Monks is a competitive game in which players emulate the mission given by the King to the Cistercians to manage and run the resources from the grounds of Alcoba&ccedil;a. Players will occupy this territory, produce and manufacture cultivated goods, extract the necessary resources to build the monastery of Alcoba&ccedil;a, and build the levada (that is, a system of aqueducts) that will give them access to fresh water.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/><br/>",

Players will face off against a main demonic foe, and they'll need to utilize their followers to stop catastrophic events, acquire relics, and delay the final ride of the Four Horsemen.<br/><br/>Each asymmetrical hero has their own divine powers and starting deck. Upgrade your deck by acquiring powerful relic cards each turn. Play strategically and choose carefully which relics to play and which to sacrifice to optimize your ability to respond to new events, destroy the demonic horde attempting to overrun the world, and delay the horsemen on their ride to bring about total destruction.<br/><br/>Will your strategy keep the world intact long enough to seal away the demonic entity forever? Featuring gorgeous art on every card, hero and Horsemen minis, and a surprising blend of gameplay mechanics, Four Horsemen is a game where every round brings new challenges. With a large variety of heroes, villains, and events, Four Horsemen has thousands of unique scenarios, meaning no two apocalypses are the same.<br/><br/>Four Horsemen is for 1-4 players and takes 60-120 minutes to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

An extension of scenario 1, as reinforcements from Sedgewick's Corps descends upon Ewell's left flank. Hay's Louisiana Tigers help stem the blue flood.<br/>3 Hill to the Attack! Two divisions of A.P. Hill's 3rd Corps rattles up the Orange Plank Road and attempts to cut Grant in half by capturing the Brock Road intersection. A single division, commanded by VIth Corps George Getty, stands in his way. Hancock's II corps arrives just in time to save the day. Or will he?<br/><br/>May 6th Scenarios<br/>1 Lee to the Rear! Early in the morning of may 6th Hancock strikes Heth's and Wilcox's divisions of Hill's 3rd Corps. Both divisions have been strung out and exhausted from the previous days fighting. They expected Longstreet's early arrival, and so neglect to fortify their line. Hancock initially drives them almost handsomely, and nearly captures Lee's HQ at the Widow Tapp farm. The engagement witnesses one of the most dramatic moments of the war, when the Marble Man himself proposes to lead the Texas Brigade of Longstreet corps in a counter-charge.<br/>2 Like a Wet Blanket. Now fully arrived, Longstreet strikes the over-extended flank of Hancock's corps. In a swift and dramatic reversal it's now the Yankee's turn to run. Will Longstreet capture the ever important Brock Road intersection?<br/>3 Gordon's Assault. John B. Gordon, ever the thorn in Grant's side, jumps the VI corps and nearly shatters the Yankee's right. Only the coming of darkness brings his assault to an end.<br/><br/>The Campaign Games<br/>These games implement Custom command rules simulating the problems of controlling armies over vast broken terrain. Lee struggles to coordinate his widely separated wings, while Grant whittles away the days, goading reluctant subordinates to action.<br/>1 The May 5th Mini-Campaign game. Combines scenarios 1, 2, and 3, and provides additional units and player options.<br/>2 The full Campaign Game. Play the entire 2 day battle.

        "description": "Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.<br/><br/>In the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.<br/><br/>As with Agricola and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space &mdash; which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.<br/><br/>Nusfjord Big Box contains the Nusfjord base game, two previously released expansions (Plaice deck and Salmon deck), and two new expansions (Trout deck and Besoekende deck), along with extra components, among them new guest meeples.<br/><br/>",

This party game with an ounce  of trading, is a good immsersive way to imagine you sitting at a table of a turbulent dwarf tavern.<br/><br/>A game of Houblon takes place in 5 rounds. Each round is composed of 2 phases: Event phase and Action phase.<br/><br/>During the Event phase, a Event card is revealed and his effects are applied. It could be change many rules for the round, or challenge the player in some tavern mini-games.<br/><br/>Next, each player is doing his Action phase. It is composed of one action, and a dice roll to win some golds or Lottery cards.<br/><br/>During his Action phase, a player can buy or sell some hop, that will influence the hop rate. Each purchase will increase the hop's price, and each sale will decrease the hop's price.<br/><br/>A player can also take and play some Lottery cards, that allow him to bother and challenge his opponents. But the Lottery cards can make him win some victory points, some golds, or some hop !<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the higher score in victory points. He is proclaimed &quot;Master of the Tavern&quot; !<br/><br/>Houblon is a game with a lot of interactions between the player, and it is compatible with friendly parties and good beer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legion is a development on Phalanx, the previous Society of Ancients game by the same designer. It is essentially a boardgame, as the game comes with counters and mapboard, but also is designed to be played with miniatures. The miniatures option also requires a hex grid to be played.<br/><br/>The core of Legion is the main historical ruleset which simulates any of 36 different Greek and Roman battles ranging from Marathon to Munda (basically the same battles as in Phalanx). The ruleset, while still fairly simple, if compared to miniature rules sets, models all the historically important variables such as troop quality, fatigue, surprise, ability of generals, weather, etc.<br/><br/>The game also contains a &quot;simple&quot; version of the rules + scenario that is well suited to introductory wargames (it was in fact used as the Society's &quot;Participation&quot; game at shows) as well as a &quot;mix-and-match&quot; tournament style system whereby the different armies are randomly matched against each other. This essentially provides a huge amount of random scenarios to supplement the 36 &quot;canned&quot; scenarios on which the rules are based.<br/><br/>",

Players push-their-luck against each other and the game itself before the tide comes in.<br/><br/>Each player has a team of five children and their dog.  Players take turns to turn over Stone Cards to reveal what&rsquo;s in the Rockpool: shells, starfish, creatures, dog toys or rubbish. At any time, players can &ldquo;Shout&rdquo; to use one of their team to empty the Rockpool and add the contents to their collection. Each child or dog can empty the Rockpool once. The children are trying to collect the most shells of their favourite type while their dogs want to collect the most different types of dog toys. Starfish give extra points whereas creatures deduct points.  Rubbish can be good or bad depending on whether it is cleaned up or ignored.<br/><br/>Stone Cards occasionally reveal Waves that wash the contents of the Rockpool out to sea.  After eight Waves the tide comes in and the game ends. Those who were most successful in their collecting celebrate by paddling in the Rockpool. The player with the most of their team paddling wins the game.<br/><br/>Rockpool is a good mix of easy to play but hard to master, making it enjoyable for players of different ages and abilities. The key challenge is judging when to Shout as players can only use each of their team cards once.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Speed is often the deciding factor in combat. The one that can get in a good, strong strike against their opponent will be at an advantage for the rest of the battle. The swift Ranger Hunters excel at lightning-fast strikes. Using either their short bow or their trusty daggers, they conduct rapid raids against enemies. However, that speed comes at a price in terms of armor. If caught in a protracted engagement, the favor quickly tips against them.<br/><br/>The Ranger Hunters unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Night's Watch Commanders a fast and agile unit on the battlefield. Their short bows can reach out and attack enemies before they can fight back. In melee, their Swift Strike attack allows them a free Retreat maneuver afterward. They also gain a bonus when attacking enemies that have yet to activate, allowing them to reroll misses once.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Salvage Hidden Treasures, the game where you take the helm as Salvage Ship Captains aboard the treacherous high seas. Throughout 16 rounds, you and your rivals will discover and salvage treasure from the depths of the ocean. When the game is up the captain with the biggest haul of treasure will claim victory. Easy, except within the seven seas are pirates, sharks and other hazards lurking in the depths. A clever combination of strategy and good fortune will score you treasures that swing the odds in your favour and ruin the hopes of your rivals.<br/><br/>Being a salvage ship captain means fighting it out on the high seas, searching for treasure and owning the biggest haul at the end of the game. Starting with one ship, you will take turns discovering, salvaging and bartering for treasure tiles. Navigating your boats across the ocean, you will pay to discover what lies beneath the waves salvaging treasures to claim them as your own. You may want to think of investing some of your money into expanding your fleet from one to three salvage ships. Each boat can only hold so much weight!<br/><br/>Salvage Hidden Treasures is a turn-based strategy board game taking place over 16 rounds.<br/>Each player&rsquo;s turn has four phases:<br/><br/>     Income<br/>     Market<br/>     Navigation<br/>     Action<br/><br/><br/>But it&rsquo;s not that simple. Among the valuable treasure tiles are twists and turns in the form of events, from pirate attacks to weird weather they will either benefit or scupper your chances of victory. The treasure itself also carries unique abilities that will change the shape of the game entirely depending on what you manage to discover and salvage from the sea.<br/><br/>Each game lasts for 16 rounds or until all the tiles have been collected. If you are in a 2-player duel or want more time at sea, opt for 20 rounds. The winner is the player with the highest combined treasure value indicated by the treasure chest on each treasure tile.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Owing its lineage to the successful line of sesquiplane fighters as the Nieuport 17, the Nieuport 28 continued a similar design philosophy of a lightweight and highly maneuverable aircraft.<br/><br/>A shortage of SPADs led to the production of Nieuport 28s. It became the first aircraft to see operational service with an American fighter squadron. It was flown by famous aces such as Ralph A. O&rsquo;Neil, Harold E. Hartney and Edward Rickenbacker.<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.

However, Persian pottery is known as the epitome of art, creativity, and practicality coming together. Along the history many people have tried their hands at pottery. But it takes a master potter to create a timeless vessel, and there can&rsquo;t be more than one master potter in each generation. And now the time has come to choose the master potter of your generation.<br/><br/>The Master Potter is a competitive worker placement game, in which 2 to 5 players take on the role of pottery masters. Players must send their apprentices to different spaces across the board to collect the essential materials and form and decorate different pottery utensils which are among the available requests. Creating a pottery utensil will grant points to its creator, and the player that reaches 20 points first, will be the winner of the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in consecutive rounds. Each player has 4 meeples, representing their apprentices. Each round begins Each round begins by players putting all their meeples on the board to collect resources, one at a time, until they are all placed. At that point all players collect their meeples, the first player marker is passed to next player in clockwise order, and the resource spaces are refilled and prepared for a new round.<br/><br/>Each requested pottery consists of a basic shape and two sets of ingredients, each of which may include different number of colors and patterns or even additional clay blocks for ornamentation. Clay blocks can be collected from different parts of the riverbank, colors and minerals are up for grabs at the market, and artists can be hired to add different ornamentation to the pottery. However, remember that if you go to a space before others, you will get a better choice and a lower price.<br/><br/>What will your pottery collection look like when this fierce competition is over?<br/><br/>",

As the title suggests, this expansion was the first V:TES set to focus on the bloodlines. Additionally, Bloodlines was the first V:TES set published by White Wolf to consist entirely of new cards, with no reprints from the earlier sets produced by Wizards of the Coast. Bloodlines was also the first set to feature Camarilla, Sabbat and independent vampires in quantity, although the Camarilla is less well-represented than the other groups.<br/><br/>The Ahrimanes, Baali, Blood Brothers, Daughters of Cacophony, Gargoyles, Harbingers of Skulls, Kiasyd, Nagaraja, Salubri, Salubri antitribu, Samedi and True Brujah were introduced to the card game in this expansion, along with their signature Disciplines: Daimoinon, Melpominee, Mytherceria, Obeah, Sanguinus, Spiritus, Temporis, Thanatosis, Valeren, Visceratika, and new forms of Necromancy.<br/><br/>",

In this card game, prepare to contain anomalous SCP items, sacrifice D-Class Personnel, play scientists and insurgents, and survive cataclysmic scenarios in order to win the game.<br/><br/>Inspired by Unstable Unicorns and the Call of Cthulhu LCG, the overall gameplay of Uncontained is quite generic: you draw cards from the Draw pile, and do things with those cards. However, there's a twist: most cards don't really go to your hand and are immediately played on the board for everyone to see. Some cards would still go to your hand, and if they do, they should be able to give you an edge. There's also a dedicated Public pile that contains the Civilian cards which act as the game's general resource.<br/><br/>Your goal Uncontained is to Contain as many Anomaly cards as possible. When an anomaly is drawn, it's by default Uncontained (placed in a special area called the Uncontained zone), and must be Contained during your turn through &quot;Sacrificing&quot; civilian cards. Each anomaly is unique and can either harm or benefit you, depending on its contained or uncontained status.<br/><br/>The player with the most Contained anomaly cards when the draw pile runs out wins the game! Or the last player standing, in case everyone gets knocked out by SCP-370!<br/><br/>The SCP Foundation Wiki and this game are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.<br/><br/>Get the game here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/uncontained\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/uncontained</a><br/>Print and Play download: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://kenoma.itch.io/scp-card-game\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://kenoma.itch.io/scp-card-game</a><br/><br/>",

But in his great Villa, the old Don is now lying on his deathbed and tensions are stalking the streets. The doctors are saying that Don has got a week to live. Tops. And while he is still breathing, the families are already clamoring to get his seat at the table. Which family (cosca) will prove the craftiest and sway the city&rsquo;s mafiosos to their side before the Don kicks the bucket?<br/>Cosca is a strategy party game of gaining influence through using secret bids and dice, which are never rolled. Over seven rounds (a week), you will secretly send your henchmen (dice) to locations, where they will gather resources in the form of money and guns. Then, you will use combinations of the symbols on your dice to gain the favor of the mafiosos on offer.<br/>At the start of each day (round), players hide their dice behind screens and secretly select symbols on the dice. Each symbol matches one of the six locations in the city, which will then be resolved one by one:<br/><br/>     The bank gets you money.<br/>     You can buy guns at the gun shop.<br/>     Visiting the horse races can get you a wad of cash on specific days.<br/>     The Club lets you bid for a mafioso, even if you do not meet the requirements.<br/>     You can visit the Don at the Villa. He will offer you help in the form of an extra die.<br/>     The streets are the place to go for extra guns and money, but you gotta be cunning.<br/><br/><br/>You use the resources in a bid to gain the favor of individual mafiosos, or in other words, cards in the display, which will grow by one new card each day. The bids for the mafiosos are resolved in sequence. The players whose dice match the symbols on a given mafioso can secretly bid any number of resources to gain the favor of that particular mafioso. The player who bids the most wins the bid. The mafiosos expand your family&rsquo;s influence in the city and provide you with extra henchmen (dice) on specific days. However, the more mafiosos you control, the harder it is to keep them all. At the end of the seventh day, the player with the most mafiosos on their side wins.<br/><br/>Will you rule the city and become the new Capo di Tutti Capi?<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "InEPTT is a skirmish game that runs from 1890 thru to 2020. It pits small elite teams of &quot;Agents&quot; against the evils and aliens of this world. The monsters are normally referred to as creatures and the Aliens as &quot;XRAYs&quot;. InEPTT is built with three basic Genres of play 1890 to 1930, 1930 to 1960 and 1960 to 2020.<br/><br/>These genres have various weapons armouries with which you can build your teams to take on the Creatures and XRAY's that you will face. The game uses the term Mission for a single scenario and Operation for a series of linked Missions. You can build your team as you go as you collect credits with successful mission completion and &quot;kills&quot; of Creatures and XRAYs. The game is run by a Game Master (GM) who designs and runs the missions and or operations and the scope is massive!<br/><br/>There are two &quot;Missions&quot; in the core rules but those missions lend themselves to quick development into literally hundreds of missions with minor tweaks to terrain, victory conditions and forces involved. Some of the key points for InEPTT from a mini/terrain view point is &ndash; there are no specific miniatures that you &quot;must&quot; buy. You can use just about anything you want really, the one stipulation being that Allies and Henchmen should be a What You See is What You Get concept, but for your Agents (term for InEPTT Soldiers) you can use any figure you like. Also the teams range from 3 to 12 so you don't need hordes of figures although your XRAYs and Creatures will often need to out number Agents by as many as 3 to 1 and for zombies 5 to 1 or more &ndash; but that is up to the GM. Also the games usually run from 30 minutes (small 4 x 4 table) to 4 hours for massive 10 x 6 table with 5 teams and over 40 bad guys, with all teams having separate Mission Orders to complicate the system even more. The game has huge amounts of growth still and there is depth in every category from which to develop more and more.<br/><br/>",

On different sides of the strait players have their own port where are ammunition depots and workshop for repairing damaged ships.<br/><br/>The main characteristic is that the game board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. The vertices of these triangles are points at which players hold the position and move figurines.<br/><br/>Each player has a display, which shows the characteristics, loaded ammunition, and received damage of vessels. The main objective of the game is to sink as many opponent ships as possible and to hit as many targets in opponents harbor. The game lasts as long as players have ships and ammunition, but may be finished earlier. The winner is the player who gave more hits, but the game can end differently - if a player manages to make a landing. That is a case when at least one landing boat succeed to land on the opposite shore.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Medusa report is part 2 of the trilogy &quot;Het spoor van Abigail&quot; (Abigails trail). Just like in part 1, you are asked by Helena Boekanier to help her investigate clues on the whereabouts of her missing sister Abigail. While doing so, you learn more about the family history of the Boekanier sisters.<br/><br/>The game works the same as part 1. You first receive a letter from Helena by mail, asking you for your help. A few days later a package arrives by mail with a report made by Abigail, Helena's sister. You have to deciper the clues to find the current location of Abigail. When you succeeded in doing so, you can upload it to Helena on a website to find out if you have the correct solution.<br/><br/>The Medusa report is an escape game. Solve puzzles, find hidden clues and turn everything upside down to find the clues to solve the mystery.<br/><br/>",

Though their numbers are few next to the hordes of beasts and demons that have overrun the land now tainted by the void energies of the Dark Stone, the Valkyries have come to help defend the lands of mortal men from the encroaching Darkness.<br/><br/>This Kickstarter Exclusive Promo Hero Valkyrie is a full new Hero Class for the Norse theme. She is not part of the Viking Team Heroes, but rather a stand-alone Hero Class in her own right. A Mythic warrior in the service of Odin, the Valkyrie is one of the strongest fighters around. As the Valkyries, by definition, are female, the Valkyrie Hero Class does not have a &lsquo;Male&rsquo; version on the back of the Hero Character Sheet. Instead, there are two different versions of the Valkyrie herself, each with different Starting Gear and stats.<br/><br/>The Valkyrie Shield Maiden is a defender of light sent by Odin to protect the world of mankind against the spread of Darkness. Heavily armored with a helm, shield, and Spear, the Shield Maiden can challenge foes, shrugging off damage with her Valhallan Armor and turning aside blows to protect herself or others with her Mythic Shield, while skewering them with her warrior&rsquo;s spear.<br/><br/>The Valkyrie Avenger instead embodies the sum of Odin&rsquo;s wrath! Equipped with a helm and spear, she has forgone any heavy armor for speed and agility. Cutting through enemies with each stroke of her Avenging Blade, a mythic sword that can actually slice Enemies in half, potentially killing them outright!<br/><br/>Includes Valkyrie Character Sheet, Game Cards, Upgrade Skill Tree, Rules Sheet, 1 Female Valkyrie Shield Maiden Miniature, and 1 Female Valkyrie Avenger Miniature, with 30mm bases.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

The deck is shuffled, and five cards are dealt face-up alongside the keys. Each player is dealt three hand cards, and gets a player aid showing the possible combos.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player draws a card and then plays a card to the tableau, or discards and pulls a face-up card to the tableau instead. Whenever a player completes a column on three cards, they draw one more card and discard from their hand.<br/><br/>Cards can be played face-down to a column. A player can discard two cards, and use a discard from the other players side instead.<br/><br/>When the three keys have three cards set on both sides, any face-down cards are turned up. Equal combos do not get a key, otherwise the winning combo claims a key.<br/><br/>The deck is shuffled over for the next round and fresh keys are pulled from the bag to make up the line.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player wins enough keys.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The game itself evolves over the course of multiple plays, with map stickers, location modifiers, new abilities, and hidden codes.<br/><br/>The innovative open movement mechanism in Boundless Stride creates a feeling of exploring the wilderness. Each scout uses a unique set of track tokens and a special ability to move across the map in a freeform way. The game includes four colorful maps that are completely free of grids or pre-defined movement spaces. Instead, you&rsquo;ll use track tokens to construct a path for your character, carefully matching each track token with the terrain beneath it. On the way to objectives, you&rsquo;ll reveal encounters that may grant resources, offer special actions, or trigger new content from the encounter book.<br/><br/>In Boundless Stride: Into the Denlands, the rules and components of the game will permanently change through repeated plays as you place stickers, solve puzzles, mark progress, and record your findings. As Scouts, you'll explore the vast Denlands, charting the stars, learning new animal languages, and uncovering the mysteries of the GREMs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
