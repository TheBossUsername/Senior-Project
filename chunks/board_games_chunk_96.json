Its three decks of question cards are arranged in three levels of difficulty. Players with a very limited or a Beginner's level of knowledge play the game with Deck A; Intermediates with Decks A &amp; B; and, Experts with Decks A, B &amp; C. The game's goal is to stimulate curiosity and encourage all players to eventually &quot;graduate&quot; to playing Feilong with all three decks.<br/><br/>TO PLAY<br/><br/>Players start by deciding if the game will be played by the rules for Beginners, Intermediates, or Experts. They then select one of the &quot;Tours in Time &amp; Space&quot; listed in the Rules Folder and enter the chosen tour's eight destination numbers (i.e., space numbers on the game board's playing track) in the blocks at the top of the Score Pad. Players advance around the playing track by correctly answering questions and outwitting opponents that exploit the game's strategy options. The first player to &quot;visit&quot; (i.e., land on the space of) each of the tour's eight destinations and enter the map of China in the center of the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The cards have the name of the location on one side and a map on the other side, showing contiguous locations.<br/><br/>The object is to void your hand by playing a card with something that shares a borderline with the last card played. Wild cards when played are automatically considered a match and can then be named as any location in the deck except for those in the player's hand. If a player cannot play a contiguous card, cards are drawn from the deck and added to the player's hand until a card can be played.<br/><br/>Instead of drawing, a player can play a card that does not share a borderline and hope to not be challenged. Challenges can happen after any play. If the challenging player is correct, and the card played does not share a borderline, then the challenged player has to take back the card and take a card from the challenging player's hand. If the challenge is incorrect, the challenger takes a card from the deck and the challenged player gets another turn.<br/><br/>",

There is also an Industrial inter-phase every third turn which is used to adjust the amount of resources available to each player.<br/><br/>The rules contain many special cases and details but with no index looking up any specific clause is difficult.<br/><br/>According to a Galaxy-Foundation Games catalog, they licensed Taurus to produce an initial print run of 6,000 copies of this game. It is not known if GFG did any further print runs.<br/><br/>There were further games in GFG's strategic series: Deliverance From Beyond the Stars, The Xenon Empire's Star Wars: Crusade Against the War-Lords, and The Collodian Conspiracy: Science Against Chaos Unleashed. These games used Andromeda Foundation Official Battle Manual, which is a slightly changed version of the Battle for Andromeda rules, as the series rulebook.<br/><br/>There was a companion tactical series of games beginning with Warriors of the Dark Star: The Age of the Neutron Wars.<br/><br/>From the GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):<br/><br/><br/>        The Battle For Andromeda - Conflict for a Trillion Suns, is the title of the over-all Strategic Series. It is on these boards that the history, the fleets, the hundreds of worlds, star systems, space armies, etc., are covered. The player handles FLEETS, LARGE SCALE DECISIONS as a RULER-COMMANDER of an ENTIRE CULTURE. He is concerned with over-all scientific Progress, the Huge Wars, and their effects and the mass movements so shown in the &quot;BFA&quot; Scale.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The title (The bear is sleeping) is a well-known children's song in Norway and Sweden. The game was first released in Norwegian in 2002, and in a much improved Swedish version in 2004. In the original version, the players try to collect gold coins without waking the sleeping bear; in the later version they gather blueberries instead.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, circular tiles are randomly placed face down on the board. In the original only the central 20 spaces are covered, in the later version all 44 spaces (not counting the four starting spaces). Players roll the die and move their pawns on the board. If they land on a face-down tile, this is revealed and acted on, and then turned face down again. If it depicts 1, 2 or 3 coins/blueberries, the player may take that number of couns/berries from the pool. The remaining symbols differ between the editions:<br/><br/>Norwegian edition: If a bear tile is revealed, the bear wakes up, and all players currently in the lair lose one coin. If a player lands on one of the bear paw symbols (printed on some of the non-covered spaces, not found on a token), two face-down tiles may be swapped.<br/><br/>Swedish edition: If it is a bear tile, the player loses one berry. If players stop on a face-up troll tile, the player may pick up the tile and use it to defend against the bear. Face-up bear print tiles may be used to swap two face-down tiles around (so that if players remember where the 3-berry tiles are they can use this to their advantage).<br/><br/>When all coins/blueberries are taken, the player with the most coins/berries is the winner.<br/><br/>Contents of the Swedish version:<br/>Gameboard<br/>44 wooden gameboard tiles<br/>10 spare wooden tiles<br/>27 wooden blueberry tiles<br/>4 pawns<br/>1 oversized die, numbered 2-2-3-3-4-4<br/>Rules<br/><br/>Contents of the Norwegian version:<br/>Gameboard<br/>20 cardbord gameboard tiles<br/>20 cardbord gold coins<br/>4 pawns<br/>1 die (not stated if this is numbered 1&ndash;6 or 2&ndash;4)<br/>(Rules are printed on the back of the box)<br/><br/>4 years and up (Norwegian version is given as 5+, but is actually slightly simpler than the Swedish marked 4+).

In each round of the game, players draws a mission from the deck matching his or her role and then take turns to throw dice and move their playing piece around the board to complete the mission and get back to their respective headquarters first.<br/>Along the way they have to avoid red numbered squares, 83 in total, that correspond to a bad event, like a parking ticket, or could make you draw a Chance! card that are divided 50/50 between good and bad. They also have to avoid refueling squares that make you go to the very nearest fuel station and pay for fuel before you may proceed. Players are however encouraged to buy different kinds of Esso solutions that make this cheaper or even make you immune within a radius of your headquarters.<br/><br/>The number of rounds played are variable between one and ten and the goal is to have the most money when the game is over. The first player to complete the mission each round get a bonus, the second a smaller bonus and the third an even smaller bonus but the last player, no matter if second, third or fourth, instead get a late fee for every space left on the mission. Red numbered squares often make you lose a turn or charge you a fee while the five good Chance! cards often give a sizable reward. Missions also often give a cash reward for one or more steps or a larger reward when completed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Die Angelschlacht (the pivotal battle) 1944 covers the 25th SS PG\\12SS Panzer division's counterattack on June 7th against the strung out Canadian forces west of Caen. The 12thSS struck with 45 tanks and quickly advanced causing a panic to the allies. The Canadians had little armor and were out of artillery range. The battle lasted 6 hours and the SS advanced only a few miles but this attack delayed the allied advance for another 30 days! The game has over 280 counters and one 11x17&quot; map, rulebook. Include in the game are unique random events that makes game play never the same. For those interested in historical or what games, player's may choose to do either. The game contains many scenarios.<br/><br/>Each hex is 200-250 yds, each turn is 30 min. Units are company level, each with a morale and movement rating. Actual fire strengths depend on the unit firing, type of attack, range to target, and weapon firing. New rules cover random events, anti-aircraft fire, air units, M10's, Panther tanks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By August 1919, the British 45th and 46th Battalions, together with over seven river monitors and gunboats mounting up to 9&quot; guns, over 25 aircraft (mostly DH9A bombers) were in place for the final blow on the Red virus known as Bolshevism. By this time, the French and Americans had all left. It was now a British show and one that was destined to leave a bloody nose upon the Reds. At least that was the plan! As the troops gathered along both sides of the Dvina River (the river was very large), the opposing forces were as determined. The Reds fielded the 3rd Brigade\\18th Division amounting to the 160, 161, 162 Regiments, numerous large artillery barges, six fighter aircraft, many gunboats, lots of mines, trenches. The overconfident British had not factored in the effects of Mother Nature, which as the battle wore on, smiled too often on the Red forces. Clearing BOTH sides of this major river ( think Mississippi) and advancing hundreds of miles to Kotlas (the main Red base) in hindsight, seemed like a crazy idea, but at the time, was a tempting objective. And so it was. The Dvina River Offensive had it all: dogfighting aircraft, ground combat, naval surface action, naval bombardment, bombing, machine guns, artillery, river monitors and gunboats, unpredictable river currents, water levels, sandbars, floating mines sent down by the Reds, foul weather, balloons. The offensive lasted four days. One part went extraordinarily well-another part nosedived into hell-both sides get to enjoy this game!<br/><br/>Game scale is 750 yds a hex, turns are 12 hrs, 10 in all. Ground units are platoons, artillery batteries, single aircraft include: Sopwith, Spad, Avro, DH9A, Re 8, Neuiport, M20 and Short. River ships include: monitors, gunboats, each representing one ship. Ground units include Lewis guns, MG, Stokes mortars, leaders, infantry. There are two game maps, one covers the ground action and the other the air to air combat at a different scale (50 yd a hex). Aircraft are rated for speed, bombing, size, maneuver, altitude. Thus, the game is really two games: an operational ground game, a tactical naval and air to air combat game!<br/><br/>",

Your 'hand' is the side that's facing you and the cards are 'shuffled' by turning the rows cube-style. Take anywhere for fun for the whole family!&quot;<br/><br/>Pressman #1493 is basically a Rubik-style cube with stickers having playing card denominations on the faces. Also included are two six-sided dice. One of the dice lists a series of rotation instructions, and the other is the usual pip layout. Both dice have faces in six different colors that correspond to the centers of each face on the main card cube. The values of the central cube spaces increase by twos from 2 to Q (12) and progress through all four suits (hearts &amp; spades are represented twice). The edge pieces are always two cards with a numerical difference of two and are always different in color. Similarly, the corner pieces progress in increments of two, half of them clockwise and half counterclockwise, and always two black and one red or two red and one black, with like colors never in matching suits. Rules for playing variants of Texas Hold 'Em, Black Jack, Vegas, Spades, Chicago Hi/Lo and Rummy are provided, but others could probably be adapted.<br/><br/>",

The letters are divided into three groups: Blue tiles (vowels-A,E,I,O), Green tiles (common consonants &amp; &quot;U&quot;), and Pink tiles (less common consonants &amp; wild &quot;infinity&quot; tiles).  Certain spaces on the board have a color &amp; symbol that might affect scoring or word placement.<br/><br/>Some of the games are simple and suitable for young spellers, while other games are more complex.  The winning condition for most games is either (1) to score more points than opponents or (2) to use more letter tiles than opponents.  Players face their own letters in the upright position based on their seat at the table, and, in most games, your letters cannot contact opponents' words.  When scoring is based on points, the letter value is based on its color -- one point for blue, two for green and three for pink.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two to six family tribes from the planet Laura get bored with their own planet and set off to find a bigger and better home in outer space. Not much later, they all descend on an unspoiled planet which they call Laura-2. The land grab and inter-tribal bickering starts as soon they settle into, and on to, their new home.<br/><br/>A simple abstract placement game for 2-6 players that is played in two phases. In the first phase players scatter their 18 tribe members and 2 item counters (a throne and a private saucer) on to the circular planet's surface. In the second phase the Lauranians will swap places until one tribe manages to get all family members unified into one single group that includes their own flying saucer and chief's throne.<br/><br/>In the settling phase, the first player places one counter in the defined central area of the board, and each subsequent player places one more settler as the previous player next to other Lauranians on the board, until all counters have disembarked. In this phase, no tribes may form a family group larger than 4.<br/><br/>In the relocation phase, in turn, each player will swap two tiles as long as they contain one own family member and the 2 tiles are lying in a straight line on the board. But a family member that is part of the tribe leader's group, including the tribe leader, can only be prized away by swapping it with another tribe leader. When you move your tribe leader more than once, you unnerve the other families, and each other tribe leader will see one of their own people take shelter under the tribe leader's throne, making it much easier for them to keep their family together.<br/><br/>The flying saucer can be used for one of two special moves that replaces the normal swap-2-tiles turn. One is to lift it up and move it in a straight line to land on an empty space besides a friendly tribe member. The other is to beam a family member in a straight line  on to an empty field besides the saucer.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, no move is allowed that would leave the entire Lauranian split into two groups at the end of a turn.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (2/1984 apr-jun), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series.<br/><br/>",

The game itself is played on the  6x6 inner part of the board.<br/><br/>The 4 neutrons are placed in the middle of the board. Object of the game is to get the most points by moving these neutrons to the home bases. The neutrons are worth 3, 6, 8 and 10 points, depending on the order, when they have been captured. That means, the first captured neutron gives 3 points, the second 6 and so on.<br/><br/>After all, Primus is much better balanced than Neutron and the clever point values forces the players to think at more than just at capturing every reachable neutron.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, all playing pieces are placed on the board, but not on fixed locations. In fact, one player places the pieces on the board and the other player chooses the color he wants to play with.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to &quot;break away&quot; all your playing pieces: as soon as a player manages to have all his 7 pieces isolated, that is with no own neighbors on all adjacent spaces, he is the winner.<br/><br/>The number of spaces a piece must move is ruled in an unusual way, too: 1, 2, or 3 spaces, alternating with every move of each player (resulting in 1-3-2-1-3-2-1-3-2... for a single player).<br/><br/>",

The introduction refers to Armageddon: Das strategische Fantasyspiel, because the Spielbox game plays in the same fantasy world, &quot;Magira&quot;.<br/><br/>Armageddon has rules for a simplified game as well as for an advanced game. Both versions are played on a 17&times;20 hex board showing Magira with 1 fortification in the middle and 2 on the sides.<br/><br/>The easier version is played with 12 axe men, 12 pikemen and 12 swordsmen only. Object of the game is to capture the fortress in the middle of the board. All types of warriors have the same movement factor. Combats are decided by the throw of 1 die, but several bonus point are added to the throw. One of them is a kind of Rock-Scissors-Paper effect, because an axeman fighting a pikeman, a pikeman against a swordsman and a swordsman against an axeman gets 1 bonus point.<br/><br/>The advanced version adds several new units (archers, horsemen, veterans, horses), enables ranged attacks, combat support possibilities and faster movements. The victory condition stays the same.<br/><br/>There is also a variation, where a siege of a fortress is simulated.<br/><br/>",

Each tile is potentially a piece of their sword which requires only 30 tiles to complete. Every tile represents a different Sorcerer. Specific Sorcerers allow the players to cast spells as the tiles are put into play, as well as displace their opponent's tiles.<br/>Tiles can be linked together in many combinations as long as they don't break elemental rules (for example: Water cannot be linked above fire since fire would then be extinguished). Element combinations allow the players to obtain, or steal rings which can give the controlling player certain game advantage.<br/>The first player to complete their sword wins.<br/><br/>",

Sensors marked on his heads up display where each of the other four in his squad where located and where the enemy troopers where positioned, or as best he could tell from what his scanners were telling him anyways.<br/><br/>As he leaped over the terrain, he became exposed and incoming fire began to pelt off his armor. Best to stay low he figured as he hit the ground running. Over his communication link the lieutenant was yelling at Private Jones to lay down suppression fire on the enemy set up on the low hill to the right. Another day in the Core, Chaves sighed, as he headed off to that same hill to kill more of the enemy.<br/><br/>This is Battle Armor, the second Mini Game by Bad Baby. Wars in the future will be fought by heavily armored warriors. Powered Battle Suits will rule to battlefield as each man can pack the firepower of a battalion. Mobile, heavily armored and capable of laying down a path of destruction like no other weapon ever made, the Powered Battle Suit will rule the future of warfare.<br/><br/>In Battle Armor you take control of a single man, or a squad of battle suit armed warriors, as they fight their endless and bloody wars in the future. Everything you need to play the game is included, rules, full color counters, map boards and terrain tiles.<br/><br/>Fast, easy to play and quick to learn, Battle Armor will supply you with endless hours of fun.<br/><br/>PDF can be found at:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wargamedownloads.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.wargamedownloads.com</a><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.rpgnow.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.rpgnow.com</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game from the Wing National Game Company of St. Augustine, FLA was indeed copyrighted in 1898.<br/><br/>[The box says this game was published by Parker Brothers.]<br/><br/>The game consists of a Battle Ground with 31 Navy Paths (31 circles) each of which are intersected at 5 or 6 places by other paths. These intersections are called fighting positions.  Red, White and Blue designs across the battleground are called Line of Shot.<br/><br/>The game comes with 9 white and 9 black washers that represent Battleships from two Navies.<br/><br/>Each navy changes form (moves) in turn. Only one move is allowed at a time. The sinking of an opponents ship occurs when you manage to get two of your ships on the same line of shot as that of an enemy ship, with your nearest ship half way between the enemy and your back ship. When the range is so short that your two ships and the enemy lay in 3 consecutive positions then the enemy is captured and not sunk. When that happens you may remove the captured ship and place any of your ships in one of the starting positions. This allows you to fix placement errors by returning your ship to the start.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vilajet is a Hungarian game about the Turkish-Hungarian Wars set in the medieval times. Unfortunately it is only Hungarian language, but easily translated into English.<br/> The game map represents about 100x100 km territory near Lake Balaton, and shows little villages, towns and cities. In those times between these two countries there at peace, but there were a lot of border disputes which eventually caused a battle to be fought. Those are simulated in this game.<br/> The players should build armies in their castles, improve their current defenses and collect taxes from villages, while trying to work against the enemy opponent.<br/> Battles are one of the unique features that this game has. When you have a battle you take the &quot;battle&quot; map, and place your army there. On the strategic map you only have one counter, which shows only the name of the army, but you have to administrate, what kind of troops that army consists of (250 Hussars, 85 Infantry...etc). On the battle map you take the corresponding counters, and play battles with them, writing down casualties. Every unit has different fighting/moving values. The sieges are also great! Another map is used (there are about 6 different castles), and modified by the defenses you have built since the start of the game. It also has some extra rules, which make sieges fun. (for example when you go for a siege, you have to decide how much grain you will bring with you)<br/><br/>The good side of the game is that the Hungarian and the Turkish sides really differ from each other, and need completely different playing styles.<br/><br/>Of course, the game has a downside. The amount of administration needed to play might cause the casual player to never sit down and play a game.<br/><br/>This game is great in Hungarian history, and shows those times, which were so full with death, battles and instability.<br/><br/>",

Players dice for initiative order, draw command cards that act as division and corps commander interpretations of battle orders.  Each player moves divisions in an attempt to affect a combined arms attack.<br/><br/>Novelty is the grid movement system where the board is divided into a point grid system.  It allows complex maneuver similar to standard &quot;measure and move&quot; miniature games, but needs no rulers.  Allows for more dynamic play than hexagonal grids with eight possible positions rather than six.<br/><br/>Major battles of the era can be played rather quickly, and a small number of troops are needed.  It is an excellent game for beginners to get into the era, and it has enough complexity to keep veteran gamers interested.<br/><br/>The rules are full color, brief, well written, and easy to follow.  Rule book includes a sample scenario in the back along with scenario building guide and open gaming army development matrix.

This ensures that any subsequent invasion of the Italian mainland would be faced by far fewer Axis troops. <br/>The most immediate objectives are airfields and ports in the advance towards Messina.<br/>Depending on his reinforcement schedule, the Axis player may attempt to delay Allies conquest of the island, or decisively defeat the Allies by a strong counterattack.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>- Map Board<br/>- Sheet of Counters<br/>- Rules Handout<br/>- One 6 sided die<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is on the market.  Anyone attenting RECON in Orlando is welcome to stop by the Flaming Monkey Games booth for a quick demo.  :)<br/><br/>OPORD is a game designed specifically to allow players to experience the sensation of launching a coordinated combined arms attack.  The game challenges a player with modern land warfare based upon existing tactical doctrine at the battalion level, but condensed in such a way as to make the make exiting and playable.  Players develop and execute operations to affect a coordinated tactical victory over their opponent.  To win, a player will have to successfully execute the instructions on his Mission Card while keeping the opponent from doing likewise.<br/><br/>In modern warfare, there is no shoot, maneuver sequence, as all shooting and maneuvering is simultaneous.  This is a key difference between modern warfare and that of WWII, and thus a main component of OPORD.  Movement is continuous, and shooting is sustained.  This is a key concept built into the OPORD game engine.  The variable turn sequence forces tactical forethought beyond the old &ldquo;my turn, your turn&rdquo; design mentality, and as a result players get a sense of fluidity of motion throughout the game.<br/><br/>Another key aspect of OPORD is the mission card driven objectives.  Players are not playing to slay each other&rsquo;s armies, since this is akin to senseless banzai charges with no real aim other than to roll dice.  Rather, the game is set around typical &ldquo;real world&rdquo; sorts of missions that soldiers are given to accomplish.  Seize this hill, secure this route, recon in force here, set up a defense there&mdash;all of these are typical missions you&rsquo;ll see in your mission cards.  And like the real world, you job is to use your troops and support elements to accomplish the mission.<br/><br/>In short, OPORD is a game that very closely relates the gaming experience to that of a real life Battalion Commander but in a fun way.  Receive your orders, allocate your troops and resources, design your plan, execute your plan, and complete the mission.<br/><br/>A typical turn.  Both players dice for initiative and turn sequence.  Initiative is obvious, winner goes first.  Sequencing dice determines the player's turn sequence.  Sequencing can be shoot/move/fight or move/shoot/fight.  the initiative winner goes first in the first two phases, while in the third phase &quot;fight&quot; all combat is simultaneous.  Movement variables are factored into the terrain boards, so there is no worry about modifiers for moving.  In combat, units shoot/fight collectively if in the same sector, or individually if in separate sectors.  Essentially both players dice (attack dice for phasing player, defend dice for non-phasing).  The interactive nature of every phase of every turn means no players are passive, which gives both a sense of fluidity.  Results are based upon combat dicing.  Units can be depleted, eliminated, or forced to withdraw.  The object of the game is to accomplish your mission and deny the enemy his.  While there are some mission cards that are all out attacks, most of the missions require you to combat in support of your own mission or to deny the other's.<br/><br/>Terrain boards are modular, so there is no limit to the size map one can create.  But a game comes with six maps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This was the first in a series of tactical space combat games linked to Galaxy-Foundation Games' strategic Battle for Andromeda: Conflict for a Trillion Suns! series. Further games using the same rules were Duel of the Sun Slayers, Vengeance Crusaders vs. The Monads, and the probably never published Plunderers of the Planets.<br/><br/>Galaxy-Foundation Games licensed Taurus Games to produce the initial print run of the game (6,000 copies, according to a later GFG catalog). Whether GFG produced any further copies is unknown; at least one later game in the series included a completely rewritten Warriors of the Dark Star rulebook, but no copy of the original game with that rulebook has been seen.<br/><br/>From the GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):<br/><br/><br/>        The Warriors of the Dark Star - in the Age of the Neutron Wars covers the Tactical aspects of the same subjects above, except that the player is concerned with the piloting of ONE ship, its intricate operations, the application of SPECIFIC SECRET WEAPONS, individually applied, ship-to-ship single combat, Tactically oriented Battles, similar to a duel between Battleships, etc.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>        Often &quot;WD&quot; games are issued immediately with a companion &quot;BFA&quot; game; while the BFA game has all the ships in quantity as well as specialized weapons systems, the &quot;WD&quot; series takes in a particular FEATURE emphasized STRATEGICALLY in RFA, and allows a &quot;Close-Up&quot; in-depth treatment of particular ships. Thus, a war involving 20 or 30 ships of which 12 of these units are representative of a Special Dreadnaught with unique capabilities, fighting an ENEMY with ships of unusual properties, is concentrated on. &quot;WD&quot; would concern itself with the broad exposition of these forces in the form of a single ship which would be cast in a series of Scenarios that would reflect the small battles occurring in ONE HEX of &quot;BFA&quot; to give the emotional and personal &quot;FEEL&quot; not of an Admiral of the Fleet, but of a Captain of one vessel, where his piloting skills and crew efficiency is most vital! This does not cover a single bizarre ship in BFA that might be of special use, but of the Main Line items that won or lost the war; the ones that carried the major burden of the battle,   whose over-all effect was sufficient to provide subject matter on what ONE ship would teach players that would help them understand the LARGE view of BFA. It is also a TRAINING AID in teaching Captains in individual combat in WD to become Commanders after the TEST OF BATTLE of fleets in BFA. Of course, if popular demand requires special, and/or additional types exposed in BFA, not covered in WD to be produced, an extension kit to HD for a minor cost of $2 to $4 is printed allowing the ND kit an unlimited number of &quot;Expansion modules&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Listed in American Games, #4175.  1976, Military, Board Game.<br/><br/>A typical move-and-capture game, such as Draugths or Checkers. The board represents a castle and a perimeter. Players move along paths that connect spaces together. Capture is by jumping over an adjacent piece to any vacant space beyond and is mandatory. Both players have the same pieces - one King, four Knights and eight pawns. The pieces have a hierarchy where a piece may not capture a more important piece.<br/><br/>One player is the Defender and the other the Attacker. The Defender starts his pieces from the middle of the board whilst the attacker starts on the perimeter. The object is to make the other player resign by eliminating enough pieces that there is no point in continuing.<br/><br/>The rules are extensive with many elaborations, hints and examples of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of many local variations on the boardgame Monopoly, Sonopoly is based on Sonoma County, California.  Produced by Santa Rosa-based Trinity Productions in 1985, it was assembled by Rapid Mounting and Finishing Co. of Burlingame, California.<br/><br/>The mechanics, most rules, board, and themes are mostly the same as Monopoly, but there are some significant differences.<br/><br/>Board and Properties: The properties are all businesses in Sonoma County; there are no railroads or utilities; there are no jail, free-parking, or go-to-jail spaces; there are chance cards, but no community chest or equivalent; all four corners are properties which players can buy and on which they must pay rent; the purchase prices and rent are all different.<br/><br/>Rules: There are coloured monopolies essentially the same as in Monopoly, but in addition, the four corners together make up one monopoly just like properties of one colour.  Players build &quot;investments&quot; instead of houses and can build up to 2 on each property.  The few non-coloured properties not at the corners are stand-alone properties on which one can build an investment without owning any other properties.  Finally, players collect $2,000 not for passing &quot;go&quot; but for passing the West America Bank space (at the location of the go-to-jail space in Monopoly).<br/><br/>Pieces:  Money is in demoninations of $20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000.  Each amount has a different business and picture on it.  The player pieces are coloured plastic pawns. The investment pieces are not houses and hotels, but coloured wooden cylinders called &quot;barrels&quot; in the rules.<br/><br/>",

(Ralph is also a common expression for vomiting.)<br/><br/>Dietary note: &quot;Ralph has a sensitive stomach! Please don't feed him anything except the special cardboard food enclosed.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Win as many cards as you can, but remember, only the player who wins the last battle can be King of the Hill!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragons, &quot;The Family Game of Frenzy,&quot; is a family-style card game where up to eight players simultaneously attempt to get rid of their deck by playing their cards to sequentially build &quot;dragons.&quot;<br/><br/>This game's core mechanic is a type of simultaneous, speed-based card play similar to that used in solitaire.  Players have five card slots in front of them, from which they play cards into the center of the table onto piles which comprise dragons made up of first a tail, then the numbers 1-10, and then a head.  When players have played a card from one of their slots, they then quickly replace it with one from their deck.  Players may play on any dragon stack in the center, which leads to a great deal of frenzy as players try to monitor their own play stacks, keep an eye on the multiple dragon piles that are constantly growing, and try to avoid allowing other players to gain an advantage in building.<br/><br/>Optional rules introduce complexity in scoring, the color sequencing of dragons, battles between players for simultaneous card play, and two-headed or two-tailed dragons.  A notable feature of the game is its giant fold-out play mat which includes markings for card play and card slots.<br/><br/>",

On each turn, the guesser can either ask the setter if a given set of three colors are in a given row or column, or can ask if a given space is a specific color. In the former case the colors present and the colors not present are placed in different sections of the board for tracking purposes.<br/><br/>",

Most of the spaces on the board correspond to one of the four categories, but some spaces allow a player to choose which category they want to answer a question from. Some spaces require a player to draw a &quot;Miracle&quot; card which will give the player some benefit like skipping ahead on the board, while other spaces require the player to draw a &quot;Pitfall&quot; card. These cards have negative effects like, for example, causing a player to lose a turn. There are spaces that allow players to take shortcuts along the path and other spaces that require a player to take a longer detour. Finally, there are slide spaces which allow a player to slide forward or backward one space to get to a category space that might make it easier for the player to answer the question.

The &quot;winner&quot; is the player who is most successful in robbing the others. You can't trust anyone here, the police are corrupt and the other well-known companies in town never sleep either. They are constantly watching you and will use every opportunity to get your money back, even with interest. For these cases, it is always useful to have a bribe or a well-guarded safe in your pocket.<br/><br/>In each round, a player starts by buying cards. He can buy one or more cards from the supply pack, for which he pays with his gold. The first card costs one gold, if the player wants more cards, it is always more expensive. Gold used to buy cards creates a bank next to the supply deck. It is empty at the beginning of the game. If the card says &quot;remove&quot; the gold, it means to put it in the bank. After buying the cards, the player goes to loot.<br/><br/>During the Loot phase, a player rolls the dice twice. The first roll determines how many gold he can loot that round. If no opponent reacts to this throw, the player throws a second time. The second roll determines who gets robbed that turn. The number of points rolled is the distance of the opponent to be robbed. The player whose turn it is decides whether to count to the left or to the right. If the roll equals the number of players, the roller, he cannot rob anyone.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player loses all their gold. The player with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>",

For instance, the peg in your 6 lane moves one space closer to home with every 6 you have rolled on the dice. Once you peg out on a given lane, you now score victory points every time you roll that number. Opportunities exist to bump your opponent back by landing on him, or to have your roll count double, depending on your peg position.<br/><br/>But first, each time you roll the dice, you have to set aside any pair of dice that add up to seven!

        "description": "Drew Pearson was a radio personality in the 1940s United States who had a segment on his show where he predicted upcoming events in politics and current affairs.  This game was apparently created to market the show through the public's association of Drew Pearson with predictions.<br/><br/>The game is played by first spinning a spinner to decide which letter of the alphabet will go in the top left corner of a 5x5 square grid.  The players then, in turn, call a letter to fill in the rest of the grid, one letter at a time.  Each player has their own grid, and places the called letter on their grid without seeing where the calling player has placed theirs.  Hence the 'prediction' - players must 'predict' what word the calling player is trying to build in order to know where to place the letters being called.<br/><br/>The game includes a rule booklet including a list of helpful words, a spinner, and a pad of blank 5x5 charts.<br/><br/>",

So the players - as detectives (private eyes) - are appointed to find the loot.<br/><br/>The game uses a special movement system regarding the famous German pub game &quot;Knobeln&quot;. It is all about bluffing and hunting for the best cards. Sudden events can alter the personal strategy.  Each player gets 5 small (movement) sticks.  Acting simultaneously with his neighbor both hide a certain number of sticks in their hands, then open their hands and count up the total amount.  Players may move if both hands show different numbers of sticks and the total amount does not equal 5; if you end on a loot slide check it (value 0 - 4) &amp; keep it.  If a player lands on another player, it offers you an opportunity to steal.  If the stick-count equals 5 players add a barrier, and an equal number of sticks held by each player forces them back to the starting point, and they draw an event card.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, 5-8 dice are thrown. Whales can move to adjacent rhomb edges, when the die on the board corresponds to one of the die numbers.<br/><br/>A restriction is that the 4 whales of a player must always form a herd, that is they must always be connected to each other.<br/><br/>Moving the whales on the side where the opposing herd stays is allowed, but only, if they are not blocked by such moves. Thus, a certain amount of cooperative play is requested!<br/><br/>Winner of the game is the player whose herd reaches the opposing side of the board first.<br/><br/>(Karin and Reinhold Wittig are named for the copyright of the game rules. The game is by Reinhold Wittig alone, though).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Players are intended to use about a squad each.<br/><br/>The game relies on a card based activation system - each character is assigned a card and activates when it is drawn.  Elite characters get a second card but receive fewer actions when it comes up.<br/><br/>Task rolls are done with a single six-sided die and generally scale by distance.  Better trained characters receive a larger bonus to their tests.<br/><br/>Damage is an opposed roll (damage versus strength) and can inflict death or one of several wound states.  Wounds reduce movement and penalize a character on skill tests.<br/><br/>The morale rules are tucked away in the back of the rules, but boil down to checking morale for certain casualty-based triggers.<br/><br/>The rulebook does not provide a points or scenario system, though there is a system for generating squads.  Wargames Journal has published at least one scenario for the game as a free PDF download.<br/><br/>",

In it, you take on the role of a senior at SVU, bent on completing a series of Secret Agendas that will be culmination of all your hard work and launch you into the world as a card-carrying Junior Supervillain In Training. The only problem? You have a bunch of classmates (read: enemies) who are hell-bent on stopping you and beating you at your own game. With elements of resource-gathering, roleplaying and fast-paced screwing over of all those who oppose you, there&rsquo;s truly something for everyone. Provided, of course, that &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; enjoys backstabbing, conniving and The Wrong.<br/><br/>There are two main phases to the game. In the resource-gathering phase, one player (the rotating TA) reveals an Opportunity that might present itself on a typical day at Supervillain University. All other players will quickly respond, in secret, with their chosen Evil Deed. The TA collects these played actions, reveals them and determines (based on whatever utterly subjective criteria he or she deems fit) which one is the winner. The player with the winning Evil Deed for the round now collects critical resources needed to complete the all-important Secret Agenda in Phase Two.<br/><br/>After collecting sufficient resources, a player may reveal their Secret Agenda &ndash; a truly nefarious scheme guaranteed to bring the world to its knees. If the player can survive a flurry of attempts by the other players to sabotage their Secret Agenda, he or she will collect valuable &quot;points.&quot; After collecting an arbitrary number of &quot;points,&quot; the winning player may then lord his or her mastery over the other losers playing the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an auction-based roll-and-move election game that adds party and platform-based strategy.<br/><br/>To start the game, prevailing public opinion is rolled (6- Democrat, 7 Independent, 8+ Republican on 2D6). In addition, each player chooses one of five alignments (moderate or conservative Republican, Independent, moderate or liberal Democrat), and secretly chooses up to 6 of the 15 available issues. The 30 issue tiles are shuffled and 3 placed randomly on each side of the board (region): North, East, South and West. The track around the board has a variety of plus or minus spaces, but six out of 10 spaces on each side are blank and trigger auctions.<br/><br/>The player landing on the space can put any unclaimed state in his current region up for auction. Bids are secret and paid in Political Capital (PC), the game&rsquo;s currency, and players pay their bids whether they win or lose the auction! After their bids are revealed, they are modified by regional issue matches (1/3 = 5 PC; 2/3 = 10 PC; 3/3 = 20 PC) and any card bonuses. Finally, all players roll dice that depend on their affiliations and the state&rsquo;s preference. (A pink state gives 3 extra D6 to a moderate democrat, 2D6 to a liberal democrat, 1D6 to an Independent, and nothing to Republicans.) The highest total then wins the auction.<br/><br/>While issues help in some states, taking fewer stands allows a player to collect more PC for each circuit of the board. As soon as a Republican and Democratic candidate reach 5 states with 50+ electoral votes, they win the party nomination, and other players in the party either drop out or become independents. Three scenarios are available: full campaign to electoral vote majority; most electoral votes after one time through the Momentum card deck; or a short game won by the first player to win at least one state in every region with at least 50 electoral votes.<br/><br/>",

Inhibiting your progress are the Son'a and their drones which attempt to tag the Ba'ku, thus removing them from the board. You win the game if at least one of the Ba'ku makes it to safety.

First one to 100 (by exact roll) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Instead of advancing to Boardwalk or taking a ride on the Reading, you will now visit Shrek's Swamp or hitch a ride in an Onion Carriage.  In addition, the locations are grouped so that like locations are in the same color-group.  For example, the orange group (traditionally St. James Place, Tennessee Avenue, and New York Avenue) are now Charming's Dinner Theater, The Poison Apple, and Tower Castle-which in the films were presented as places where villains were found.  Special tokens are included for this version-Pinocchio, Gingy, Puss in Boots, Donkey, Fiona, and Shrek.  Chance and Community Chest are replaced with Spells and Potions, and Houses and Hotels are recolored teal and purple, and are called Cottages and Castles.  Also includes special bank notes which feature the heroes on the face.  The bills are as follows:<br/><br/>1's-Pinocchio<br/>5's-The Three Little Pigs &amp; Big Bad Wolf<br/>10's-Gingy<br/>20's-Puss in Boots<br/>50's-Donkey<br/>100's-Fiona<br/>500's-Shrek<br/><br/>",

A &quot;Captain&quot; player keeps score on a laminated scoresheet for all players. With 2+ players, the player with the highest score at the end of 10 frames wins.  With solo play, you try to beat your previous best score. The highest possible score is 300 points!<br/><br/>The original (1960) edition contained two decks of cards (108 total), enough for 1 to 4 players to play right out of the box. The 1964 edition came with only one deck of 54 cards supporting either one or two players unless you purchased a second set of 54 cards separately to allow play with up to 4 people (the laminated scorecard in both versions includes 4 player lines to support up to four players).<br/><br/>Trivia: The yellow 1964 &quot;Authorized Edition&quot; box shows the game named &quot;Don Carter's Strike! Bowling Game&quot; and doesn't mention &quot;300&quot; anywhere on the box, but the instructions only refer to the game as &quot;300&quot; and don't mention Don Carter anywhere! The most likely reason is that they licensed Don's endorsement for the 1964 edition of the game but neglected to update the rules sheet to accommodate the newer name. Don was and is (apparently) widely considered the greatest bowler of all time.<br/><br/>",

The object is to capture as many &quot;burglers&quot;, &quot;robbers&quot; and &quot;thieves&quot; cards as possible and to obtain the valuable &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; cards. All players play at once and there is never a dull moment. A large part of the fun of the game consists in making a &quot;sweep&quot; by turning up the card &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; thus allowing you to quickly seize an opponents pile of cards which would contain the most &quot;robbers&quot;, &quot;thieves&quot; and &quot;burglers&quot;. Players can also call &quot;Scotland Yard&quot;, forcing everyone to pass 3 cards to the player on his left. The first player to 50 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

You have 4 different terrain types, Countryside, road, river and railway. Traveling by night you pick a relevant card which has a distance and time these are moved along a track. The longer you are out the more tired you become, but you must find somewhere to rest before daylight comes. some cards are German soldiers but these may be avoided if the conditions are right, if you are challenged I hope your language skills are up to scratch and that the 6 days in the outdoors isn't going to give you away.<br/><br/>Tactical decisions include how long into the morning are you prepared to travel before you find somewhere to rest for the day, balance this with how good will you be if you were challenged by a German soldier. How far you have to travel before your safe compared to the fact the more days your out the more disheveled you look and therefor more suspicious.<br/><br/>Other things included are crossing rivers, swimming, boat, or bridge, weather which may change half way through the night. The heavier the rain the less likely you will be challenged but the less rest you will get. Going into a town to seek resistance members but beware the Gestapo and German sympathizers. Stamina, food, blending in, stealing a German soldiers push-bike all take a role.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Flip Four is a set of four games, all of which are played with 49 of the cards from a standard deck, placed in a 7x7 grid. They also share the central mechanism, which is turning over a card which is in the same row or column as a card of the same suit or rank.<br/><br/><br/>     In Matchline a token moves to a matching card and then the previous card is flipped. The goal is to flip as many cards as possible. If more than one person plays they each need their own deck and compete to get the best score for the same layout.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Connections is the same as Matchline except that any card with a match may be flipped; there is no token.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Saboteur is for three players, who are dealt three specific removed cards. One card designates the saboteur, who scores for cards not flipper, while the other two players score for flipped cards. If two players vote that the third is the saboteur the accused player must stop playing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Cross/Block is for two players: one tries to connect two opposite edges with a chain of flipped cards and the other tries to prevent this.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a cross between regular chess and Mark Steere's Dipole.  The game is won by either capture your opponent's King instead of checkmating, or by having your opponent not be able to move any pieces.  This is done by restricting non-capture movement to only moving forward (straight or diagonally), rather than laterally or backwards.  Castling remains the same as in normal chess, and pieces may capture as the do normally, including laterally or backwards.<br/><br/>This small change in the results results in a game that last only a finite number of turns, and with one side guaranteed a win.  Even though the game is more restrictive in some regards over normal chess, it is still a deep game.  Due to the game being a cross between Dipole and normal chess, it bears the name Dipole Chess.  Fans of chess and Dipole should consider checking this game out.<br/><br/>The latest version of the game rules for Dipole Chess can be found here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSdipolechess\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSdi...</a><br/><br/>A Zillions adaptation of the game can be found here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.zillionsofgames.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/90451?do=show\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.zillionsofgames.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submission...</a>;id=1617<br/><br/>",

The game, the first offering by fledgling publisher Gurushar Games, provides 2 to 4 players six different paths to victory: either by amassing 80 Gold (a measure of the civilization's wealth), 30 Order (a measure of infrastructure and governmental improvements), or 10 Support (a measure of the civilization's morale).  Alternatively, a player may attempt to reduce their opponent's Gold, Order, or Support to 0, thus eliminating them from the game.<br/>Similarly to Magic: the Gathering, Resource (i.e. land) cards, such as farms or villages, are played, and then taxed to produce Gold.  This Gold is then spent to play more Resources.  It is also possible to use this Gold to buy Units (which defend the land, or can attack an opponent's Order), or Systems (e.g. Democracy, Capitalism, Martial Law), which provide permanent upgrades to a player's capabilities.  Alternatively, your Gold may be spent to trigger 1-time Event cards, or simply hoarded to reach the 80-Gold victory condition.<br/><br/>",

For a while Saladin, as he was known in the West, maintained an uneasy peace with the crusaders. However a series of provocations by the crusaders broke the truce and finally forced his hand.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He gathered a large army and laid siege to Tiberias. The Crusaders went for the bait and marched to the rescue. Their line of march took them across a desert where the heavily armored knights suffered terribly in the summer heat. Saladin sent soldiers to harass them during the march, slowing their advance to a crawl.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The army was dying of thirst when they approached Lake Tiberias only to find Saladin&rsquo;s army blocking their path. In the battle that followed the crusader army was destroyed. Raymond of Tripoli was the only commander to escape, the other the crusader leaders were killed or captured.

The simulation is not set in any specific part of Europe, and the term &lsquo;baron&rsquo; is used to refer to nobles. It is intended to familiarize the students with some of the basic characteristics of life in the Middle Ages: the feudal system, the church, the crusades, castles, political marriages, etc. With modifications it could be used for similar civilizations in other places and times, such as feudal Japan. This simulation is intended to be played one or two turns per week, with each turn taking 10 - 15 minutes, while the students are studying a unit on this topic.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex-shaped hex map, five hexes on a side. The game also requires a standard deck of playing cards (used to resolve battles and determine the death of barons) and a set of event cards that must be created.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The students should be divided into 6 groups. You can play with more groups, but in that case you should use a larger map. Each group represents a noble family. You can assign the students roles if you wish: Baron, Baroness, Seneschal, and Bailiff. Each team will be given control of a fiefdom. This consists of their home hex and the six surrounding hexes.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Objective: The goal of each team is to become the most powerful baron. This is measured by their fame. Fame represents the reputation and status of the baron. Another important measure of a baron's power is how many hexes he controls. This will determine how large an army he can call up for battles, and how much gold he will collect in taxes from his territory.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Fought near Chaeronea, in Boeotia, this was the greatest victory of Philip II of Macedon. There, Philip (with 32,000 men) defeated the smaller combined forces of Athens and Thebes, securing Macedonian hegemony in Greece. The battle itself pitted the classical phalanx of the Athenian and Theban confederates and the Macedonian phalanx of Philip.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use. The Macedonian units portrated in the game include the Companion Cavalry, Pikemen, Skirmishers, and Commanders (Phillip and Alexander). The Greek units include Athenian and Theban Hoplites, Skirmishers, and the Theban Sacred Band.<br/><br/>The designer states: &ldquo;This game was designed for an advanced 5th grade class studying classical Greece. I picked Charoenea because I didn't have any Persian figures, and because I thought it would be fun for them to get to see Alexander on the battlefield . . . The Greeks probably don't have much chance in this scenario, I'm afraid, and the players should be prepared for this. It is more a historical simulation than a &lsquo;fair&rsquo; game. There were 8 students, but the game is designed for 9 players.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

This army of farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen were able to defeat and capture an important French settlement.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The siege of 1758 was as a result of the British Government's strategy of weakening France by capturing her overseas Empire. A British army of 15,000 soldiers and sailors was dispatched from Britain to Halifax, Nova Scotia to train and then launch an attack on the Fortress. The French this time were ready for an invasion and had prepared beach defenses. However, the British were still able to land and after a seven week siege, the French surrendered.

        "description": "&ldquo;The first English Civil War (1642 - 1645) was a power struggle between King Charles I and his Royalist supporters on the one hand, and Parliament and its supporters on the other. At the battle of Naseby (1645) the Parliamentarian New Model Army scored a major victory, thanks in large part to the exploits of Oliver Cromwell's cavalry. With his army on the brink of defeat King Charles was prepared to personally lead his reserves into battle. A subordinate asked the King &lsquo;Will you go upon your death?&rsquo; The King decided to retreat instead of continue the fight. This defeat effectively ended the hopes of the Royalists.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).

This battle ended forever Napoleon's dream of invading Britain, and the Royal Navy would dominate the seas for the next century.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table. Free print-and-play paper miniatures (flats) are provided for use with the rules. The rules cover fouling, grappling, boarding, cannon fire, drifting, and wind effects. <br/> Colored yarn is taped around the edges of the game table to give a quick visual guide to the effect of the wind based on the color a ship is facing. &ldquo;If the ship is pointing towards the green then the wind is behind the ship . . . If the ship is pointing towards the yellow it is close quartered . . . If a ship is pointing towards the red then it is &lsquo;locked in irons&rsquo;&rdquo; and must pass a skill roll to move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Ski Sprung Spiel (in English: Skijump Game) is trying to simulate a ski jump competition. After team selection each player will roll dice for selecting the highest position on the jump tower. Therefore all seven dice are rolled. After each roll at least one die has to be set aside face up. When all dice have been allocated the jumper is placed on the tower according to the rolled total result which is equivalent to a certain jump distance in meters. After all players are set up one player puts one of his jumpers for the jump. Then card play takes over. The effect of cards is to add or subtract jumping length from the a fore determined jumping length (the dice roll) or to move the jumper left and right on the hill simulating wind. Other players play cards for this jumper which are countered by the jumping player. This goes in turn i.e. player A plays card jumping player plays card, player B plays card jumping player plays card and so on until each non-jumping player had the chance to play a card. If the jumper is moved too much to the left or right or too long or too short of the board it is counted as a fall. Finally the jumping player plays a card for the landing again adding or subtracting metres. The final result will be noted down. The player which ski jumper has the farthest jump wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "According to Mancala World:<br/><br/>Cenne (literally &quot;beautiful&quot; in Tulu) is a mancala game of the Tuluva in Southern India with several unusual game mechanisms, some of which remind of the totally unrelated Ethiopian game of Lamlameta. It was first described in 1986 by the ethnologue Peter J. Claus, professor at the State University of California at Hayward (USA).<br/><br/>The game plays an important role in the Siri cult of South Kanara. It is prohibited to play the game after the rice seedlings (neji) are in the growing fields and up to harvest time. There is an old custom in the Bant caste of playing the game by the male head's of the boy's and girl's families during the marriage negotiation ceremonies (niscaya). It is regarded a good omen if the girl's party loses. The game is also often associated in Siri legends. Another prohibition is to lend out the board overnight and gambling. More prohibitions concern the players. Sisters are not permitted to play the game together (not even classificatory sisters, e.g. a woman with her husband's sister), nor are brothers (including classificatory brothers, e.g. mother's brother and sister's son), nor husband and wife. The game is not normally played among men except in association with marriage alliance. The social prohibitions coincide with an asymmetrical relationship within families characterized by potential feelings of jealousy, competition, aggression and self-interest which could destroy the strength and unity of a matrilineal family.<br/><br/>The Cenne board is usually made from hard, dense wood such as rosewood or ebony. The counters are the small seeds of the arnotto tree (Bixa orellana), the coral tree (Erythrina caffra) or cowrie shells.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board called mane has 14 holes (variously called guri (&quot;pit&quot;), illu (&quot;house&quot;) or kone (&quot;room&quot;)) arranged in two rows and two larger hollows at either end used for storing captured seeds. Each player owns the store to his right.<br/><br/>Initially there are four seeds (parelu or kayi) in each hole.<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes in the ensuing holes, one by one, in a counterclockwise direction.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into an occupied hole, its contents are lifted for another lap.<br/><br/>During a move a seed may not be dropped into a hole containing three seeds (called murte) unless the player has just one seed seed in his hand.<br/><br/>In rare circumstances all holes may have three seeds. If the player still has one or several seeds in hand, he puts these in the hole to his far right (called atappe (&quot;heap&quot;)) without capturing them. The opponent then takes the three seeds from his heap and drops one of them in his opponent's heap, another one in that hole from which he removed the seeds and the last one in the next adjacent hole on his side, giving it four seeds, which he then captures, thus ending the move.<br/><br/>This seed, which would become a singleton, is called jeppe (&quot;sleeper&quot;) and may not be used to begin the next turn.<br/><br/>If the last seed in hand is placed into a murte, its contents becomes wanasu (&quot;meal&quot;), that is, all four seeds are captured and put in the player's store.<br/><br/>Afterwards the player continues his move by distributing the seeds of the following hole.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last seed is placed in an empty hole, when the hole following a wanasu is empty or after an atappe play.<br/><br/>The game is played until a player can demonstrate at his turn that in four consecutive draws he does not have to place a seed in one of his opponent's holes. That player wins the seeds that are still remaining on the board.<br/><br/>The player who captured more groups of four has won the round.<br/><br/>The successive rounds are played by filling the holes on the player's side with his winnings. Holes that cannot be filled are not used in the next round. It is possible, albeit difficult, to reconquer lost holes. Seeds that are not used in the round are stored as if they were captures.<br/><br/>The game is over when at the beginning of a round a player can fill less than four holes. The phrase to claim victory is poli maipunu (&quot;plunder&quot;).<br/><br/>",

The game of warriors, which is never played by woman, is usually played by teams of eight. <br/>It is said that the game was invented by Sindillo, the son of the first man, Maitoumbe, when he was an old man. According to a legend, he also discovered honey which then became a food of the Masai. The first European to describe En Geh&eacute; was the German Moritz Merker of the Imperial Protection Troops (Kaiserliche Schutztruppe) of German East Africa in 1904. He is also regarded to be the first ethnologue of the Masai.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on a board which consists of two rows of 40 - 50 holes each. The holes (sing.: en gurt&oacute;to; pl.: 'n gurt&oacute;t) are dug into the ground. Each team controls one row (sing.: ol m&aacute;tua; pl.: el m&aacute;tuan). <br/>Each hole contains at the beginning four counters (sing.: os soid; l.: es soido). The Masai take small pebbles or seeds of the ol gulangulu (Caesalpinia bonduc). Depending on the size of the board 320 - 400 counters are needed.<br/><br/>At his turn a member of the team picks up the contents of a hole and distributes the stones (or seeds), one by one, in counterclockwise direction into the succeeding holes. <br/>If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap. <br/>The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole. <br/>If the last stone is dropped into an empty hole of the team's own row, the contents of the opposite enemy hole are captured. If anything was captured, then the stone which caused the capture is also taken. <br/>The game ends when one team can't move. <br/>The stones which are still left on the board, are captured by the team which could move last. <br/>The team who captured more stones wins the game. <br/>If both teams captured the same number of stones, the game is a draw.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It is the recreation of adult males, and to a lesser extent boys and youths. The game is played on wooden boards with seeds in the open air or, during rains, in houses or just outside them in the shelter of the roof. The name of the game literally means &quot;grouped in pairs&quot;, a word related to lama, the numeral two in the Gallinya language. The game was first described by the ethnologue and renowned mancala games expert Richard Pankhurst in 1971.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board, called toma tag&eacute;ga, has 2x12=24 pits (awa). Initially each pit contains two seeds known as tag&eacute;ga.<br/><br/>At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his pits which are then sown in a counter-clockwise direction into consecutive holes. Although Pankhurst stated that the opening move starts with the hole on the player's &quot;extreme right or more preferably penultimate right&quot;, these moves appear to be just common openings observed by him.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are picked up together with the last seed, and continued to be distributed.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last seed is dropped into an empty hole.<br/><br/>It is not permitted to drop a seed into opponent's holes which contain two seeds except in the very first move. Later these holes are jumped.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into an empty hole of your own facing an enemy hole containing two seeds he captures this pair, as well as any other groups of two seeds on his opponent's row.<br/><br/>Play comes to an end when one of the players can no longer move. The remaining seeds are won by his opponent. The player who captured more pairs is declared winner.&quot;<br/><br/>Pankhurst, R. 1971.

        "description": "&quot;A fun and exciting card game for kids and adults.  Over 100 cards that will keep memories of the 20th Century alive forever.&quot;<br/><br/>This unique deck has one card for each year from 1900 to 1998, with 5 events that happened that year, of all types: politics, sports, arts, inventions, etc.  There are also two 1999 cards, which act like wild cards, and four 2000 &quot;Millenium Bug&quot; cards, that are penalty cards.  The events each have an icon next to them to show a specific type: e.g. car, tennis player, Olympic rings, airplane, dollar sign, national flag, anchor, skull, etc.<br/><br/>There are rules to three games included.  In all of them, 10 cards are dealt to each player.<br/><br/>Century Classic is rummy-like: during their turn players draw, lay down melds, and discard.  Acceptable melds are: chains, 3 or more consecutive years; and matches: 3 or more that have the same event icon.  Players can also add to their previous melds, but not to others'.  When a player goes out, the others receive penalty points for what's left in their hand.  1999 cards are wild, and each player may use their birth year as a personal wild.  If you have a 2000 card may play it to the table and draw a replacement, taking up your whole turn; 2000's in your hand at the end add to your penalties.<br/><br/>Century Chain is Uno-like.  Players may play a card to the discard pile if it matches one of its icons, or is adjacent in year.  You may continue playing until you have nothing left.  If you have nothing to start, you may draw one card instead.  (1999s and 2000s are not included in this game.)  First player out of cards wins.<br/><br/>Century Face Off is a quasi-trick-taking game.  Players take turns playing a card to the center, and the one who played highest year takes the trick and leads to the next.  After the  10 cards are out, another 10 each (or however many are left) are dealt out.  Winner is the one who takes the most tricks.<br/><br/>",

In truth, it has been several days, each intervening day filled with frantic activity as the crew prepared for the forthcoming battle. Now that battle was upon them. On the plot, two fleets could be seen closing in on one another. As the captain of the Horan watched, flanking forces detached themselves first from the European fleet, quickly followed by matching elements from the Union fleet. These elements would attempt to get around the heavy screens to the key units the escorts were protecting, the flagship and carriers. Soon the battle would truly be joined...<br/>__________________________________________________________<br/>What you hold in your hands is the Master Rules to the Fleet Action 2 combat system as well as the introductory information to the epic Turning Point Universe. These rules will allow you to fight massive battles involving potentially dozens of ships and even more fighters.

Players represent imaginary persons who are part of an imaginary TV reality show. Their lives are filmed by cameras... In this frame players develop their identities while entering into the world of plots, strategies and psychology. After a certain time some players fall out (he/she can't try to gain the main award) and he/she continues as a 'passive' player (who is supposed to be noticeably active).<br/><br/>Tasks of play: is a collection of cards with more than 60 tasks and the center of the game. Most tasks have a certain psychological background. But this psychological element is rather only an additional dimension of tasks and it isn't necessary for players to mark it. Players draw one task card in each round, they read a setting and a certain numbers of players will be able to register to the task. If the task is carried out he/she will get a number of votes (this number of supposed votes is chosen by each player himself/herself before carrying out the task). Players can carry out about 16 tasks in each game.<br/><br/>",

Among them, mechanical monsters called Reapers dig, drill, and blast to feed &ldquo;the Machine&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Inside Arcadia, one of the last remaining human enclaves, powerful armor and weaponry are being developed, and Arcadians known as Herobits are training to wield them, working together to combat the Machine and restore the Earth.<br/><br/>Herobits decks are complete - no booster packs required. New 3 character (deck) releases are scheduled at two to three-month intervals. The vibrant artistry is unique to each Herobits character as artists from around the world imagine their own Herobit, in their own unique style.<br/><br/>Cards are printed to collectible card grade standards using an extremely high-grade paper.  Both an entertaining strategy game and a collectible, Herobits is a card game  for two players that&rsquo;s easy to learn, play, and enjoy.<br/><br/>Play revolves around two Herobits duelling in a competitive training battle to better prepare themselves for the war against the Dominion.  Starting with the LRX1 Reaper in Series 2, Herobits will be able to battle the Robots of the Dominion and other enemies!<br/><br/>",

In a struggle of warfare these nations are divided into two teams, the Axis Powers and the Allied Powers. By the cunning use of research, diplomacy, production and warfare every player tries to achieve a global victory for his team.<br/><br/>The enormous map covers the whole world and is seperated into four parts. By the size of approximately 47 inches by 138 inches it includes over 500 land territories and a lot more sea zones. Beside new options in diplomacy e.g. the control of neutral nations and a large research tree, the game uses over 25 different units, each with special skills and attributes.<br/><br/>In every game round randomly chosen event cards bring political decisions or historical incidents which affects the gameplay. This makes sure that every game of Rising Tide will be a new challenge. By the use of new concepts in combat and movement the game provides a fast gameflow where each player only executes a small action like a single attack or the movement of a few units before the next players turn. Nevertheless Rising Tide is a grand scale boardgame where each match keeps you busy for a long time.<br/><br/>",

This deluxe glow-in-the-dark edition features classic Scrabble crossword game play and a board shaped like Jac's face. Some extra creepy rules and terrifying bonus dictionary words will send you into the night for the absolutely most frightening fun game of Scrabble you've ever played.<br/><br/>This game is Scrabble with a differently shaped board that is not the standard 15x15 board and a theme from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. The game also features 5 extra tiles with character from the movie which, if drawn can be played to allow special actions. <br/>The characters and actions are:<br/>Christmas Gift from Halloween Town: Give your opponent an unwanted gift of any tile you want to get rid of. Blind draw one of his/hers.<br/>Zero the Ghost Dog: After an opponent places a word, use this tile to change one of their letter points to zero points. This zero will now affect any double/triple letter or point spaces. The score should be adjusted.<br/>Oogie Boogie: Oogie Boogie loves to gamble and is ready to test his luck by mixing up everyone's tiles. After a player plays this special tile all players place their tiles face down and mixes thime up. Players now pick new tiles without looking at them. The original player who first restented the Oogie Boogie tile chooses whehter or not to participate in the reshuffle.<br/>Sally: When Sally needs to escape for the night she often slips deadly nightshade into Dr. Finklestein's soup causing him to sleep long enough for her to sneak away. Use this tile to make your next opponent &quot;sleep&quot;, causing them to have their turn skipped. Play continues with the next player.<br/>Mayor: The Mayor of Halloweentown often flips his head around to express joy or anxiety and this tile can help you &quot;flip&quot; your opponent's rack around. When using this tile, choose any opponent to spin his/her rack around. He/she can spin the rack as fast as he/she likes but should be careful as tiles often fly off in many directions.<br/><br/>",

The 36 double-sided tiles are divided among all the players. The tiles make up the octopus arms. There are two levels. In the beginners&rsquo; game, the players match up the colors. The purple ovals start a new arm. The arm is completed when a hand is placed down. The winner is the first player to lay down all of his or her tiles.  The advanced game is the same, only the players match up the number side of the tiles. An arm will start with a blank.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Great Northern War (1700 - 1721) was a military struggle between Sweden on one side, and Russia, Denmark, and Saxony-Poland on the other.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In 1708 Charles XII launched an invasion of Russia, determined to capture Moscow and force the Tsar to accept a peace treaty that favored Sweden. Peter the Great ordered a 'scorched earth' policy to deny supplies to the Swedish invaders.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In September of 1708 Tsar Peter learned that a Swedish force protecting their supply train was separated from Charles XII and the main Swedish army. He pounced. Peter lead a flying column to attack the Swedes while the main part of his army blocked Charles' path to Moscow. The battle took place near the village of Lesnaya.&quot;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.<br/><br/>While the fast play rules are relatively straightforward, they still manage to encompass a number of historical aspects that affected the battle. The rules cover unit formations, terrain, charges, morale, commanders, and differences in the battle tactics of the Russian Dragoons and Swedish cavalry.<br/><br/>",

All it takes is a little luck...a little concentration and knowing when to keep your mouth shut!<br/><br/>(From front page of the rules.)<br/><br/>Drawing on traditional Jewish humor, this game encourages players to aspire to their Mama's dreams of becoming somebody.  Players begin at home with Mama and through the course of the game, pick up Odd Jobs and Tools of the Trade.  Once the player gets to their target profession after acquiring 4 Good Tools for that Trade, they win!<br/><br/>Movement on the board is via dice, one specifically for each dimension, with the player choosing the direction.  Landing on a free Odd Job gains the player both a random Odd Job card and a random Tool from a profession of their choice.  If a player lands on someone else's Odd Job and they get to steal a Tool.  Being lazy will cause a player to lose a turn, and sometimes it's best just to Go Home to Mama.  However, if a player can catch a Lucky Break, then end up on a square of their choice, which is the best way to land a profession!<br/><br/>The mechanics are simple, but remembering who has what can be more difficult as cards are constantly being exchanged.<br/><br/>",

And the deck stacking isn't the only way to activate your card functions.<br/><br/>As with all computers, random factors can cause you benefits or issues.  So, dice also activate function #s.

Overall the game can be very deep, but is still accessible and easy to learn.<br/><br/>The game plays via rounds and is only very loosely &quot;turn-based&quot;.  Players can buy and use actions/cards even when it's not their turn.  There are game balancing mechanics to help losing players catch up.<br/><br/>This game falls into the Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, Glory to Rome, category of games in that you build your own arrangement of cards in front of you, and try to build combos.  Cards are bought via hand discards, but Two Bit Hack has a very unique method for how card functions are activated.  This aspect is most similar to Settlers of Catan.  Also, cards in hand are not only your money, but also your method of activating your functions with certainty.  Or you can leave things more up to luck and leave more cards in your hand for purchasing.<br/><br/>",

Also be careful with swarms, as you do not always know what you crush.<br/><br/>(from the publisher web site)<br/><br/>The &quot;insect&quot; player  mixs tokens (1 hornet token,1 mosquito, 1 wasp and 4 flies) in the center of the table taking care that none overlaps or is in contact with another then takes one of his cards and puts it in front of him back side up, so it is visible to all. He is then free to distract the attention of the players by any means until  the moment when he turns the card revealing one or several insects. The action the players will need to do depends on the insect on it.<br/><br/>If it is a hornet, mosquito or wasp, the first player who puts its hand on the correponding token or on a fly gets victory points. A player making a mistake loses victory points.<br/>If it is an evil fly, only the fly earns victory points.<br/>If it is a nice fly, no insect must be harmed !<br/>As for the swarms, usually the most numerous insect on the card counts. But if there is only one nice fly, the card is considered as a nice fly card.<br/><br/>(personal sum-up based on the rules.)<br/><br/>",

Each player must try to perform in every city the best play according to the demands of the public and the festival it takes place there.<br/><br/>The game is played in different rounds. Each round the players play cards in order (the first player will play the city of the performance, the second will play the festival and the third the public). Each city card, festival card and public card has associated a symbol and a number value. There are three different symbols for cities, three different for festivals and three different for publics. The number values are all from 1 to 3.<br/><br/>After all the players have played their cards they must choose a plot to perform. They all have 6 plot cards to play, and every turn they play one and get a new one from the deck. Every plot is a combination of 3 symbols (one city symbol, one festival symbol and one public symbol). So the players get points for each symbol that matches the requirements stated at the beggining of the turn.<br/><br/>After 12 rounds have been played the game ends and the player with a higher score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each night, the players attempt to out perform each other by sending their raid teams into the nearby Robot outpost to recover alien weapons and technology.  Whoever recovers the most valuable tech is named ace raider for the night and earns promotion points.  The players have ten nights to gather as much as they can and get promoted ahead of their peers.  Because in ten nights, all of those recovered Robot weapons will be used in the first organized offensive since the invasion ended.

You can hit shots out-of-bounds, into hazards or water, or score eagles (two under par for the hole) with the best shots of your career.  Scoring is also just like the real game of golf.<br/><br/>You will be asked questions on the rules of golf (coded to the 1984 USGA rule book), golf history, major tournaments, famous players, courses, and general golf knowledge.  Since almost all the questions are true/false or multiple choice, you may find a non-golfer being the winner of GOLF: THE GAME.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/>contains one two-sided playing board, eighty game booklets (40 Front Nine [green] and 40 Back Nine [blue]), 147 Go For Broke cards, 50 Pro Play cards, score cards, six denominations of play money (500; 1,000; 5,000; 10,000; 25,000; 50,000) , two dice, and four player tees.<br/><br/>",

It is played on Martian Coasters, with fewer overall required pieces, incorporates a simple dice element, and the attacking of other players.  Replay value should be much higher than Diamond Mine.<br/><br/>Players will be moving towards hidden caches of variously colored gems and delivering them to specified areas of the board to be able to score them as points.  Players must carefully choose how to use their movement points (rolled randomly each turn).<br/><br/>Opaque Icehouse pieces will conceal colored pieces beneath, and pieces may only be delivered in a particular area of the board, so depending on what is found, when and where it may be worthwhile to abandon those pieces and explore more or to simply race to get them delivered for points.  However, players must also beware that other players could steal those pieces at any time, and may want to, as pieces of a player's own color will count for double points!<br/><br/>IceMiners is a redevelopment of Diamond Mine.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Rulebook:<br/>Assault of the Dead: Tactics is a tactical board game with roleplaying elements, The game combines thematic elements from the Assault of the Dead game but with a combat system unlike any other previously seen in the series. In contrast to Assault of the Dead: Tactics has a character building system (that includes Perks, Weapons, and Survival kits) as well as support for solo play.<br/><br/>Assault of the Dead: Tactics is set in a fictional zombie-infested city called Cloverdale. The game's story follows through scenarios, unfolding part of the city map allowing the players to explore new and dangerous areas. As the story progresses, you and your allies discover a sinister effect behind the zombie outbreak.<br/><br/>The game-play of Assault of the Dead: Tactics differs in several key areas;  Characters move on a battlefield composed of circular tiles; movement and actions are determined by the character's Perks, Weapons, and Survival Kits he carries. Battles are low luck; a character can use any number of actions to attack, with attacks always hitting. During battle, whenever an attack is made, dice rolls determine the number of damage points the character can 'spend' on hits and weapon crits. Deal enough hits, and the Zombie is defeated leaving behind a Survival token -- used to buy actions or resupply your character.<br/><br/>Like the original Assault of the Dead: Tactics adjusts the level of reaction from the Zombie side based on how well the characters are doing. Do well and the game spawns more zombies, makes them aggressive, and more powerful. Do poorly, the game will end your misery soon enough.<br/><br/>",

If the picture is already occupied, the active player ends his/her turn as well.

The quickest player wins the pair.<br/><br/>At first glance this looks like a game of memory, but the card pairs are a bit different. One player starts by turning one tile, and play continues this way around the table until two matching tiles are face up. As soon as anyone sees the match, everyone tries to smack their hands down on the oldest matching tile (i.e. not the one just turned). The quickest can claim the tile pair.<br/><br/>Note: Tiles are _not_ turned face-down again, so the amount of face up tiles increases during the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last pair is gone.

You have to uncover the true answer whilst also revealing your opponent's crackpot creation!<br/><br/>Instant fun &amp; laughter for those who love word play!<br/><br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Rules<br/>4 True/Bluff flash cards<br/>Score pad<br/>Pencil<br/>50 double sided True or Bluff cards<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The game is played by two teams, nominally of four aside but smaller or larger numbers can easily be accommodated.  It is essentially a game version of the TV show Call My Bluff.<br/><br/>Each True or Bluff card contains an obscure word and four answers, a) to d), one of which is true and one of which is the phrase 'Your definition.'  The cards are double sided with a different word and answer set on each side, giving 100 words in total.<br/><br/>Each team takes it in turn to read out the word on the card followed by the four answers, one of which they must make up on the spot (they have 2 minutes to do this although it usually takes much less time than that).  The other team then has 2 guesses to try and work out which is the correct answer whilst trying to avoid the definition created by the other team.  There are 10 rounds of this so each team has five turns bluffing and five turns guessing and at the end the team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>If the guessing team gets it right with their first guess they score two points.  If they get it right on their second guess they only get one point.<br/><br/>If the guessing team gets it wrong with both guesses the bluffing team gets a bonus point.  Additionally, if the guessing team picked the bluffing team's made up definition for either guess (even if they subsequently got it right) the bluffing team gets two more bonus points.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives 16 chips of the same color. Choose a playingcard together to play with. There are 2 copies of each card, one for each player. Place the chosen card under the holes in your playfield.

You recognize your own wordcards by the white or black triangle in the corner of the card. Player 1 chooses a card from the stack with white triangles, and player 2 from the stack with the black triangles. This is your secret word your opponent has to search for. Put the wordcard against the sloping side of the playingfield, so your opponent can't see it.<br/><br/>The first player to guess the word from the other player wins. On your turn, you ask your opponent a question which he can answer with yes or no. For example: Does your word start with a &quot;B&quot;? If your opponent answers no, you can put a chip on every word on your playing card that does not start with a &quot;B&quot;. This goes on until only one word remains.

        "description": "Wyvern Pass Not is a tile placement-solitaire game for the Decktet. It is an adaptation of a flash game by Sandhill Games Ring Pass Not<br/><br/>You are a great mage, represented by the excuse, taming the wyvern; put it in front of yourself in a way that the little fool is standing up. As the mage you need to create a ring of protection before the wyvern breaths fire upon you. Well a wyvern, or a balrog, or whatever please you because the nature of the Decktet you could represent whatever battle, or characters, or universe that please you, well, always when the story to represent must be the creation of a protection against a superior physical or magical power.<br/><br/>The player must create a ring of eight tiles (Decktet cards) in a perfect circle with perfect links to win. Each link is formed by two cards that share a common suit. The player takes the tiles/cards from a drawing pool of four cards. The player can deal new cards onto the drawing pool but this will deplete its maximum number of cards by -1. If the player deplete all his drawing pool, or form a ring with not-working links, he loses.<br/><br/>Rules at the Decktet wiki:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://decktet.wikidot.com/game\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://decktet.wikidot.com/game</a>:wyvern-pass-not<br/><br/>",

The active player flips open the top card from one of the three stacks (showing 1, 2, or 3 balls depending on the degree of difficuly of the card) in the middle of the table and memorises the arrangement of the playing pieces (animals, director, balls etc.) After turning the card face down, the player tries to arrange the pieces in the same order that is shown on the card. In the meantime, the other players roll dice. If they manage to roll the star symbol four times before the active player completes his/her task, the attempt ends. If not, the active player keeps the card, as long as they got the playing pieces arranged correctly. At the end of the game, the player with the highest number of balls on his/her cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Battle of Gods, is a variation on the good old game of War, which tries to add some subtleties, both with tactics and bluffing.<br/>The first new idea is that cards are played in pairs. First, each player plays a card. Cards are revealed, and then each player plays a second one, and their values are added. This makes for some interesting dilemmas.<br/>The second new idea is that there are 6 sets of 12 cards, for six different mythologies. In each game, each player plays a different mythology. In each set, two or three cards have special effects when played, making for interesting combos and even more bluffing.<br/>It's a two player game, but the six available mythologies make for 15 different possible duels.<br/><br/>",

The heroes each have a unique starting deck of 15 Special or Super Power cards, the latter of which come in three levels of increasing potency. These cards are used by the players to act during the game - mainly to neutralize Threat cards by matching the symbols found on them with the symbols on their Power cards. Throughout the game, the players can upgrade their Super Powers (and unlock new ones) through the use of Valour Points accumulated by facing threats and neutralizing plots.<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Midnight Men est un jeu coop&eacute;ratif de super-h&eacute;ros hautement th&eacute;matique aucours duquel les joueurs utilisent leurs &quot;decks&quot; personnels de cartes Pouvoirs pour neutraliser les menaces et complots initi&eacute;s partout dans la ville par le Vilain. Les joueurs doivent oeuvrer ensemble pour vaincre le Vilain avant que son complot ne r&eacute;ussisse, ou avant que le niveau de terreur devienne extr&ecirc;me.<br/><br/>La gestion de cartes et du risque sont les aspects cl&eacute;s du jeu. Les h&eacute;ros ont chacun un paquet unique de 15 cartes de Pouvoirs Sp&eacute;ciaux ou Super Pouvoirs. Ces derniers viennent en trois niveaux de puissance croissante. Ces cartes sont utilis&eacute;es par les joueurs et permettent principalement de neutraliser les cartes Menace en jumelant les symboles qui s'y trouvent avec les symboles sur leurs cartes. Pendant la partie, les joueurs peuvent am&eacute;liorer leurs Super Pouvoirs (et &eacute;ventuellement en d&eacute;couvrir de nouveaux) en utilisant les points de Valeur qu'ils auront accumul&eacute;s en faisant face &agrave; des menaces ou en neutralisant des complots.<br/><br/>",

The land is rich, travelers abound, and there is money to be had in founding a village!  Will you create an economic hub, or a haven for the underprivileged?  Will you foster the arts, or train mighty soldiers?  When people gather and speak of your village, what tales will they tell?<br/><br/>Village Tale is a Print and Play Card Drafting game inspired by Satoshi Nakamura's Fairy Tale.  The game takes place over four rounds of play.  In each round, players are dealt six or seven cards.  Each player chooses one card and passes the rest of the cards to his or her neighbor (alternating left and right each round).  From the remaining cards, players choose one and pass the rest, and so on, until no cards are left to pass.<br/><br/>From those cards, players simultaneously play one card into one of the four districts of their village (north, south, east, and west).  Any card effects are resolved.  Then players play three more cards, one at a time in this fashion.  Players discard their remaining cards, and go on to the next round.<br/><br/>After four rounds, players find out how many points their buildings are worth.  Each building has a fixed value or a variable value based on the other types and locations of buildings a player has played.  Whichever player has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

This game isn't meant to be a realistic portrayal of fights, rather it portrays the over-the-top fights of B-grade cinema. Each player in the group controls a group of six, one is a group of hardworking cowhands and the other is a group of ne&rsquo;erdowells looking for trouble.<br/><br/>The game map is a hex grid of the saloon and the wooden sidewalk outside. Objects inside the saloon such as tables and the bar also represented which serve as movement obstacles to the players. There are a total of three maps included with the game.<br/><br/>Each player has 50 points which are allocated to the six men either as strength points or dexterity points before the fight begins. Fighting is carried out in order of descending dexterity (highest dexterity goes first). The men can be hurt, knocked unconscious, stunned, or killed and the game provides counters to indicate their status during the fight. The fight is initiated between two randomly chosen men who must throw the first punch at each other before any other characters can join in.<br/><br/>The game includes counters for townsfolk such as piano players, saloon girls, and the bartender, each of whom has strength and dexterity characteristics and may get involved in the fight. The game turns are timed based on the camera cuts of old Western movies.<br/><br/>",

Players start off as survivors of an airplane crash, they know that something is wrong but not what.  They must first leave the safety of the abandoned village and collect clues from other island locations.  Once they have collected enough clues a Horror themed Goal is revealed that usually requires gathering certain objects and bringing them to a given location (eg. To escape from the island you must take the motor from the docks and repair it in the workshop, and return with the keys and gasoline to escape).<br/><br/>As the players move about the island they will come under attack from the Peril Deck.  The hand of cards each player holds represents the energy they have to escape from the attacks, attacks chip away at your hand (the Action Deck also represents how much daylight is left).

        "description": "An old war game made during or after World War II. The game is a simple dice game where up to four players moving a playing piece towards an enemy city. Each player is allowed ten raids to the objectives of their choice, with the highest score tabulated at the end of the game declared a winner. If a playing piece lands on a black square during a raid, the piece is removed from the board and that turn is lost. The high ratio of black squares (40 out of a possible 179 spaces) is a depressingly accurate reflection of the high casualties facing wartime bomber crews.<br/><br/>The original wartime edition was printed in brown on thin beige cardstock, while the post-war version had a glossier red board with black squares. Both versions fold out to a size 16&quot; x 11&quot;. The coloured playing pieces are made from 1/4&quot; painted wooden dowel and the die is wooden as well. Game instructions are printed on the face of the board.<br/><br/>",

After a consensus has been reached, the first points are awarded.<br/><br/>The players then continue with each of them writing an ending for the partial headline. One of the players, the reader, collects the sentences and reads them all aloud. The players then vote for their favourite sentences, which awards points to the creators of those sentences.

For example; The first card played (which cannot score points) is a 3. The next player could play an A5 (A for Addition) he adds 5 to 3 to make 8. This is two 'Fours' made, score two points. The next player could play S4. 4 from 8 = 4, so one 'Four' created, scores 1 point. Next player plays a SAM 8. He scores 3 points for Additions (8 + 4 = 12, so 3 Fours made) but as it is a Sam card he can also score for Multiplication (4 x 8 = 32, so 8 points scored). In this example, Subtraction would score nothing. You can see that SAM cards are very valuable.<br/>The first player to score 100 points, wins.<br/>The rules refer to the cards as 'Blocks' and the intention was to make a more substantial version with the cards being replaced as tiles (called Blocks) but this never happened, possibly because The Great War started and materials were limited because of the war effort in industry.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Editions vary, but a familiar phrase or name is hidden on the gameboard. The number of words and the number of letters in each word along with the category of the puzzle is on the clue sheet chosen at random. The gameboard is marked thusly. Before guessing letter, a player must spin the eponymous Wheel of Fortune to determine how much each letter, if revealed, is worth to one&rsquo;s account. Every spin is risk, however, because one could lose a turn or spin &quot;Bankrupt&quot; which means lose a turn and forfeit one&rsquo;s earnings! Consonants only can be guessed after spinning the wheel; vowels can be guessed at a cost.<br/><br/>A player can continue taking one&rsquo;s turn until a wrong guess is made and then the turn passes to the next player. Only the player who solves the word puzzle can keep the earnings made for that round. The player who has made the most money after a predetermined number of puzzles is the winner.<br/><br/>As the title of the game suggests, this version of the game is designed for portability and to be played without a gamemaster to verify responses. The players can check their own responses without revealing to much of the puzzles ahead of time.<br/><br/>The game is a faithful adaptation to the wildly popular television series.<br/><br/><br/>",

The continents are each in a different color, so they can be distinguished easily. The countries are easy to find by numbers and colors. At the edge of the board flags are shown.<br/><br/>The game contains 110 illustrated cards with questions (and answers) such as: Where do polar bears live? Where is the Eiffel Tower located? Background information, continents, countries and people pass by. Players have to respond the correct country, continent or ocean and have to designate them on the world map. By doing this correctly chips can be earned. The first player who has collected 8 chips wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules also describe a second way of playing. Here 24 random cards are put face up in the middle of the game board. The players take turns throwing a die and moving their pawn in accordance on the flags around the game board. They have to collect cards by selecting cards from the middle which are related to the country their pawn landed on. If no such a card is available, the player just has bad luck. Once a player reaches the last field, the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Fun for everyone! Tangram Fury can be played individually, or in teams, with as few as two players.<br/><br/>Players compete against each other to be the first to build tangram puzzles shown on cards. The first player done, wins the card. The first player to earn five cards, wins the game.<br/><br/>Tangram Fury has two levels of play: &ldquo;Fan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Expert&rdquo;. The Fan level is easier, because the shapes on the cards have borders that show how each of the seven tangram pieces fit together to form the shape. The Expert level only shows a silhouette of the shape and players must figure out which pieces go where.<br/><br/>The game includes four categories of tangram images: people, animals, fish &amp; birds, and objects &amp; shapes. Each category is represented by colored cards. Rolling a multi-colored die determines the categories.<br/><br/>",

If the player winning the item that round under-estimated the item they make a profit and the item is scored as a treasure on the score sheet.

Players roll a die and move through the city, trying to reach the famous sites (especially those two whose cards they drew at the beginning and which are marked). Additionally, taxis, buses and the tube can be used to get around more quickly, but they have to be paid for in travel chips. When a player reaches a site, s/he is asked a question. If answering correctly, the site card can be discarded and a new travel chip is drawn. When reaching an unmarked site, they can earn a new site card (if that belongs to someone else, it can be &quot;stolen&quot;). <br/>When a player can reach both sites they drew at the beginning and gain two more site cards and return to their starting location, s/he wins the game.<br/><br/>Each card has two questions, one about German, one a trivia question, so language learners can play it with non-language learners as well.<br/><br/>",

Clockwise the players roll and move their pawns according the die roll. Sometimes they get to take a card, sometimes they must get rid of a card, and sometimes they challenge the other player. Challenging means putting the die in one hand and then the player guesses which hand. Correct guesses give the player a card, false guesses make him lose a card. The first player to have 7 (out of 12 per player) cards has a full farm and wins.<br/><br/>",

Gameboard inserts are available for conversion to Basketball, Soccer, &amp; Ice Hockey.<br/><br/>Before each play, the Defensive player (D) secretly sets his Linebackers -- 3 blue INDEPENDENTLY MOVABLE static-cling dots -- on a hinged, clear plastic, overlay.  He then swings the overlay against side of stadium and hides the Linebackers with a large black card.<br/><br/>The Offensive player then studies the tacklers printed on the field, HIDES HIS EYES WITH HIS PLAYBOOK, and either marks a line on the field with an erasable pen on a run, or lifts the pen and tries to land on a pass receiver (and then runs from there).  D tells him when he runs into a tackler, and then both players look at the field while D flips the overlay onto the field to see if a Linebacker tackled him sooner, caused a fumble, or batted down/intercepted a pass.<br/><br/>From the website:<br/>&quot;With an erasable pen and your EYES COVERED by a Playbook, how well can you evade tacklers, pass to receivers, or execute kicking plays?

In the game, players play and win (or lose tricks), and then draft cards for their hands from a 4 by 4 grid of cards, with a card being taken freeing up another card.  Players score a point for each trick won, and win the game by being the first to reach a target score.<br/><br/>Besides what is described above, the game also has cards which will lose a trick if led, but will win a trick if it follows what was led.<br/><br/>The game is playable with a standard deck of playing cards and two jokers.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to reach a certain number of bananas (money in the game) and a certain number of completed products in play, both based on the number of players in the game.<br/><br/>You have three types of workers (cogs in the great corporate wheel) to help you reach your goal: Engineering Monkeys, Marketing Monkeys, and Operations Monkeys. Each product in play requires an Operations Monkey to manage it. Engineers are allocated to products each turn to advance development. You collect bananas every turn for finished products in play. On a product's initial release, it gets a push from the marketing department, increasing sales on that turn, so the more Marketing Monkeys you have, the higher your initial sales. Meanwhile, your opponents are hiring their own monkeys and developing products at break-neck speeds. Using action cards and VPs will help you gain an advantage over them (allowing you to crush them mercilessly, in fact). Good luck creating your corporate empire!<br/><br/>",

We&rsquo;ll, now you can.<br/><br/>Pixel Patch: The Real Life RPG is a 2-6 player card game that turn a standard deck of 52 cards into a a fun 8-bit RPG-influenced battle system. Players will try to work their way past their opponent&rsquo;s defense through the cards they draft and grow more powerful through the games they play.<br/><br/>Every round, you will choose cards to decide whether to attack, defend, heal or gain influence for special abilities. You and your opponent will then decide whether to perform your action in an aggressive or defensive fashion and then draw a varying number of cards to determine your success.<br/><br/>This entire game can be played with just a deck of cards and a pad of paper if necessary, but player aids and guide books are also provided in the downloadable PDF.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player&rsquo;s health reaches 0. At this point, experience points are handed out, which allow you to level up, boosting your original stats from your entrance exam and making your card drafts more powerful. All these stats are recorded on the printable booklets that come with the game.<br/><br/>This game is a great head to head challenge as you work to figure out what your opponent will do next and of course is immensely repayable as you work to unlock and master 11 unique classes.<br/><br/>Players can also boost their stats by purchasing RPG Patches from our website (listed in the links section); each one of these patches gives a different permanent stat boost to your character, without breaking the game.<br/><br/>",

Who'll manage to raise their young first?<br/><br/>How it is played: The board shows 12 nests. The players start in the first nest and try to reach the last nest as fast as possible. Movement is determined via 7 action tokens. These are placed in a circle in the middle of the board. Only three of them are placed face up at any time. The tokens show 1-3 mice (= move the corresponding number of spaces), a fleeing mouse (= player does not move his/her bird this turn), a cat (= player turns over the three face-up tokens and shuffles them with the others, then three new tokens are placed face up), a buzzard (= player doesn't move his/her bird but gains an additional turn), or two birds with an arrow (= player exchanges position with the leading player).<br/>Which of the three face-up action tokens affects the active player is determined as follows: At one end of the board, there is a wooden peg. On this peg sits Buteo, a wooden buzzard figure. Over the board, there is a wooden scaffold, from which hangs a cord with a wooden ball attached at the end. The active player tries to hit Buteo by swinging the wooden ball towards him. If he/she is successful, Buteo attaches to the ball with the help of magnets. Then he flies a round (because the cord keeps swinging), until he finally stops over one of the tokens (which are also magnetic). Then the action specified by that token takes place, the token is turned face down, a new token is turned face up and then it is the next player's turn. The player who reaches the final nest first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game the tiles are placed on squares of corresponding colour: f.i. blue tiles on blue squares. Each group of 9 squares (in the corners) is rimmed by a line in one of the four colours, blue, green, red or yellow.<br/>The object of the game is to move the tiles to the corner rimmed by the colour corresponding with the colour of the players tiles.<br/>In each move the players may move one of their tiles a number of squares (1 or more) in a horizontal or vertical direction.<br/>From the moment a player has reached the target square with one of his tiles, he is allowed to remove one of the tiles of the opponents from his target area, thus making room for his own tiles.<br/>When a target area is filled with eight of the required tiles of the same colour, there is one square unoccupied. The only one that may fill that square at this stage of the game is the player that needs to complete the number of nine tiles in the target area. That would be his final move. However he is only allowed to move that final piece one square per turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from the designer's website:<br/><br/>The new game is called Kink.  The idea is simple: it's a basic N-in-a-row game where the row is allowed to have a single bend in it.  Put another way, the row can change direction once, anywhere along it's length.  The angle of the bend formed can be right, or obtuse, but not acute.<br/><br/>The introduction of a Kink has two effects which I believe will make the game richer and more strategic (consistent with my experience of the first few plays):<br/><br/>1. The number of degrees of freedom in the winning pattern is much higher for Kink than for the equivalent standard N-in-a-row game.<br/>   2. The number of stones in a row required for winning must be larger.<br/><br/>To write the rule set, I modified the rules to Connect 6, which is to my mind the most canonical (and one of the best) N-in-a-row games.<br/><br/>Kink is a game for 2 players, played with a Go set.<br/><br/>1. The board begins empty.  One player owns the black stones and the other owns the white.<br/>   2. To begin, Black places a single stone on any empty space.<br/>   3. From then on, starting with White, each player places 2 stones per turn.<br/>   4. The first player to form a row of 9-in-a-row wins.  The row may have up to one Kink in it, which may form a right or obtuse angle (but not an acute angle).  Rows may run both orthogonally and diagonally.<br/><br/>Note: I don't yet know if 9 is the right number.  If it's not 9, it's probably 8.  Play with it and report back here with insight.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Star Game is a 3-dimensional occult board game for two players. In addition to being a game, it is also used as occult sorcery with each occult initiate expected to make their own boards and pieces.<br/><br/>There are two versions of the game, the simple and the advanced. The simple game has seven boards placed one above the other in a spiral, with the boards named after particular stars. Each board has nine black and nine white squares, making 126 squares in total over the seven boards. Each player (white and black) starts the game with three sets of nine pieces (27 pieces per player) with each piece allowed to move across a board, and up or down from board to board, in a different way. Only some types of pieces can capture other opposing pieces, and a captured piece is removed from the boards and plays no further part in the game.<br/><br/>The seven boards are named Naos, Deneb, Rigel, Mira, Antares, Arcturus, and Sirius. At the start of the game, each player has six particular pieces on Sirius, three pieces on Arcturus, six pieces on Antares, three on Rigel, six on Deneb, three on Naos, and none on Mira. As in other board games, the players take turns to make their moves.<br/><br/>The basic rule of play is that after a piece has been moved - whether across a board or from one board to a higher or lower board - it is transformed into another piece according to a set sequence and then can be moved according to its new designation. Another rule is that pieces can only stay on the Mira board for three moves.<br/><br/>The basic aim of the simple form of the game is for one player to place three of their pieces on certain squares on Mira, with the type of these pieces and their placing on that board decided by both players beforehand. The first player to do this wins the game. This takes some skill and some time since not only can an opposing player capture pieces on Mira but also pieces are only allowed to stay on Mira for three moves, after which the player must move the piece. Depending on the skill of the player, to win a simple game takes from a few hours to a day or more.<br/><br/>In the advanced Game, each board has six (minor) boards (three at each end), with there being additional pieces (more sets of nine for each player making 81 pieces per player). There are also additional rules regarding movement. In this version of The Star Game, each board is divided into three other levels so that there are four levels to each board, making a total of 308 squares over the seven main boards. Depending on the skill of the player, to win an advanced game can take several days.<br/><br/>In both the simple and the advanced games, the pieces are usually small tetrahedrons (or small squares) marked with the particular abstract symbol (or the particular occult symbol) which is used to designate that type of piece.<br/><br/>Complete game rules are outlined in &quot;NAOS: A Practical Guide to Modern Magick&quot;. A free software version is also available.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Simple card game set in the universe of the Power Rangers.<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards and lay them all face-down on the table with no over-lapping. A player turns over two cards. If they don't match, he puts them back face-down on the table (in the usual fashion of a Pairs game). If they match, he keeps the pair and has another go. He stops when he doesn't draw a pair.<br/><br/>The twist in this game is the Lord Zed card. If a player reveals Lord Zed, that player must return all his pairs won so far to the face-down area in the centre of the table and must start collecting again from scratch. Once Lord Zed has made his entrance, he is removed from play so that it can only happen once a game.<br/><br/>",

Fighters who distinguish themselves in the tournament may challenge the Midnight King himself for a chance to win the ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a unique fighter to control. Players take turns playing their cards. A player may put an arena into play, fight to take over someone else's arena, and train fighting techniques. Fighting techniques are permanent increases to total fighting power, and other cards may temporarily increase fighting power during a fight. Fights are resolved by comparing the fighting powers of the two fighters. A fighter who controls six arenas fights the Midnight King and then either wins the duel to end the game or loses an arena.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "King of 20 is a new competitive board game that is simple yet challenging. It can be played by anyone who understands basic math operations.<br/><br/>In King of 20 players use number and operation tiles to form expressions which are placed on the game board. The goal of the game is to receive the lowest score possible by making expressions that are as close to the number 20 as possible. A player's score is determined by comparing the solution of their expression to the number 20. For example: an expression with a solution of 18 would have a score of 2. Players must use tiles already on the board and those in their hand to form or add to expressions.<br/><br/>Although King of 20 is an effective educational tool, players of all ages and skill-sets can enjoy it. Young children and adults alike will love the games competitiveness, simple gameplay and sleek design.<br/><br/>Ishmael King created King of 20 in March of 2011 when he was a freshman in high school. He noticed that subjects such as English and History were regularly adapted into board game forms, while the subject of Math was poorly represented in the industry. The few math board games that existed were too simple or too complicated to play, or were made for an age range that was too specific. So he took the opportunity to make a game himself.<br/><br/>",

The Nort and Souther armies are asymmetrical (army lists are featured in the rulebook; units each have a base points cost and upgrades available for additional points).<br/><br/>The scope of the game is intended to be from a handful of miniatures (one GI vs. a Nort squad for example) up to company level actions, including light vehicles.<br/><br/>The range planned for release currently includes:<br/>GI Rogue Trooper<br/>Souther soldier squad set (8 figs)<br/>Nort soldier squad set (8 figs)<br/>Nort elite assault squad set (8 figs)<br/>Nort &amp; Souther officer squad set (6 figs)<br/>Souther lazooker team squad set (6 figs)<br/>Nort snipers and Black Dome sniper squad set (7 figs)<br/>Skorpion Battlewagon (light tank, 3 variants planned)<br/><br/>Troops have their own basic statistics (points cost, movement, defence and armour values, morale (called Will-to-Fight; WtF in this game!), individual abilities (traits) etc. which are then augmented by the range and damage ratings of the weapon with which they are equipped (range, damage, traits).  The more powerful a weapon is, the more combat dice rolled.<br/><br/>Rules cover ranged and close combat, remote weapons, indirect fire, elevation, suppression, air units, fighting from and in structures, etc.<br/><br/>Missions can be generated within the 'Engagement' chapter by combining various mission profiles (attack, defend, probe, hold, etc) to give an alternative to simple meeting engagements of equal cost forces.  Success or failure is adjudicated by victory points specific to the various missions.<br/><br/>NB: This information is based upon the first release of the draft rulebook, and thus may be subject to change before release.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher website:<br/><br/>&quot;In 1812, after a period of considerable victories, Napoleon found himself fighting on two fronts, suffering setback after setback. With his forces in Spain being pushed back, Napoleon launched an invasion of his former ally, Russia, leading the half-million-strong Grande Armee to Moscow and a brutal defeat at the hands of Russian forces and the bitter winter. On the defensive, Napoleon was defeated and exiled, but returned to lead his loyal armies against a coalition of European nations in a final campaign that culminated at Waterloo. &quot;Triumph of Nations&quot;, a companion for &quot;Field of Glory Napoleonic&quot;, provides players with all the army lists and details they need to recreate the battles of the later Empire, from the disastrous invasion of Russia to the glorious Hundred Days.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DARK WORLDS is a science-fiction strategy board game of space exploration, discovery, technological development and conflict, for two to four players. Each player assumes the role of a ruler of a space-faring civilisation. Rulers are tasked with spreading the influence of their civilisation throughout the universe. This requires the control of space sectors, and the discovery of unknown worlds (planets), with the aim of colonising them and harvesting their resources.<br/><br/>Planets come in a variety of types. Some, due to their harsh environments, support only limited populations. Others, such as lush, earth-like terran worlds, can support vast populations and have abundant resources. The greater the population that a colonised world supports, the more precious resources (and victory points) it will yield for the ruler that controls it.<br/><br/>Gathered resources pay for establishing colonies, and for technological research, such as hyper - drive engines and weapons for spacecraft, and improved planetary infrastructure. Each technology developed will yield particular advantages for a civilisation, in addition to providing victory points for winning the game. Resources may be spent to hire mercenary fighters, serving your battle for control of space sectors.<br/><br/>Some worlds also yield rare alien artefacts, which confer victory points for the player that finds them.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the ruler who controls the most developed worlds, controls the greatest number of space sectors, researches the most technologies, and discovers the most valuable artefacts will be victorious!<br/><br/>",

The King has hidden his only heir to the throne (one of the 4 cards the players just saw) and it is up to you to find them.  As you draw a card into your hand and play a card to family lineage lines on the table, you begin to prove which peasants and nobles are not related to the King, the hidden one becomes more apparent to everyone, as more cards are played to the table.<br/>Your family lineage lines on the table prove which people are not royal heirs. Players must complete family lines with a family crest card (to score extra points)  before the other player slaps the King and names the hidden heir.   You must decide between quickly exposing the King's secret before your opponent can play the right cards.. or making sure your family lines are complete so you score more points.

        "description": "Swords and Heroes is a unique, history-based tactical game that allows players the opportunity to battle some of the greatest armies in history. The flagship game of the independent company ZAMA Game Design, Swords and Heroes challenges players in a simple-yet-engaging combat system.<br/><br/>The game uses a detailed &ldquo;Cards and Shards&rdquo; system that uses board-based tactical &ldquo;shards&rdquo; to represent battlefield units of the respective armies. Basic statistics and abilities of these units are represented by beautifully-designed game cards held by each player. Units range from light-armored infantry to long-ranged archers or heavy cavalry, but vary wildly based on the historical civilization chosen by the player.<br/><br/>After custom-designing their armies using a simple point-based creation mechanic, players field their armies and face off for the control of the board with easy-to-learn dice-based turn mechanics. Players also make use of &ldquo;General&rsquo;s Orders&rdquo; cards that offer players powerful and unique means of shifting the course of battle. Once the enemy has been eliminated from the board, the remaining general stands victorious!<br/><br/>The Swords and Heroes: Starter Set comes with all of the necessary rules and game components required, as well as two Classical Age armies: The Roman Empire and the Germanic Tribes. Future expansion packs will also offer players additional armies, such as Han China, Alexander&rsquo;s Macedonia, Parthian Persia, and more!<br/><br/>",

Each player takes the part of a Land Hermit Crab God guiding their chosen Land Hermit Crab through their life in order to be the first to be big enough to worship at the Crab Temple.<br/><br/>Each player rolls 4 d6s which determine direction of movement, distance, the nature of the god gift (usually food but sometimes a shell), and the area where the gift will drop. It is up to the player to decide which die will be carrying out which role.<br/><br/>The Game components (which include crab pictures in a photo frame, hermit crab playing pieces and the entire board) fit onto just 3 pages (2 if you have your own tokens). Compact rules (1 double-sided standard sheet) and an optional player's aid page are also available. The board is modular so as to enable easy storage.<br/><br/>",

All players immediately stop rolling and grab a wooden cake piece from the middle of the table. Who was able to manage to grab a piece gets a puzzle piece of his/her choice. The player who is missing out on a cake does not get a puzzle piece. The first player to complete his/her puzzle wins.<br/><br/>From the box back: The dice roll and the cake fight begins. Everybody grabs quickly but not everybody gets a piece. Only good reaction gets a sweet reward. Who is the first to have a whole cake wins the game.

Second, one player knows what all the cards are that are dealt and decides which hands are to be given to each player, stacks their hand and always leads with their hand.  The other player ends up picking trump suit, without fully knowing what all the cards are in (unlike the player who stacked their hand).<br/><br/>Included with the game is a variant that adds bidding, with each player bidding differently.<br/><br/>",

The UN voted to recommend military assistance to the Republic of South Korea, and President Truman sent US troops to Korea.  The North captured much of the Korean Peninsula and the only hold outs were in the Pusan Perimeter.  General MaCarthur proposed relieving the pressure on Pusan with a surprise amphibious landing behind enemy lines at Inchon.  The landing was a  major victory for the UN forces in Korea.  UN forces went on the offensive and drove north until the Chinese intervened.  The war ended in an armistice, with a demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas near  the 38th parallel.  The border remains an area of heightened tensions to this day.  The Korean War is sometimes called the &quot;forgotten war&quot; in the United States because it comes between two more famous conflicts, WWII and the Vietnam War.&quot;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.<br/><br/>Forces portrayed in the game include American squads in units of 8 soldiers, with an officer, radioman and two BAR machine gunners for each squad and North Korean squads in units of 15 and have one officer and one machine gun.<br/><br/>",

The &lsquo;fate of the whole Western world?&rsquo; Syracuse? How?<br/><br/>Simple. If the Athenians had taken Syracuse, during their invasion of 415 BCE, they would have captured Sicily and become a major superpower. They would dominate the Italian boot as well, and make it much harder for a city-state named Rome to expand.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the oddest things about the lengthy Peloponnesian War is that, after decades of balance, the Athenians actually lost it with a campaign well away from the Greek mainland.<br/><br/>The Athenians have a mighty host of fleets and men, filled with confidence. The Syracusans have a long history of clinging to their independence (and powerful allies coming to foil Athens).<br/><br/>Combat units include cavalry, light troops, peltasts, and the heavily armed hoplites&mdash;the backbone of both sides&rsquo; armies.

From their shining black hulls, with huge golden figureheads bearing the crest and coat-of-arms of Spain, to the tops of their masts where fluttered proudly the immense silken flags&hellip;to the brightly colored awnings over their decks, they bespoke luxury and chivalry, and a proud defiance.<br/>--George Edward Graham of the Associated Press as he witnessed the sortie of the Spanish Fleet from the Santiago Channel, July 3rd, 1898.<br/><br/>Death Before Dishonor is an introductory level wargame simulation on the naval actions that occurred near Santiago harbor during the Spanish-American War. The game design is meant to be simple and highly playable, yet one that portrays the historical challenges facing the combatants. Historically the US failed to bottle up the Spanish fleet, and was forced to undergo a lengthy blockade while the US Army fought the Spanish garrison for control of the city and port. The capture of key fortifications and the heights at Kettle and San Juan Hills compelled Admiral Pascual Cervera to sortie on July 3rd to prevent his ships from being sunk at their moorings by US artillery, or capture when the town surrendered. The US navy would sink all of the fleeing Spanish ships with little loss, scoring a lop-sided win.<br/><br/>Each copy of Death Before Dishonor is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    One sheet of 61 single-sided counters.<br/>&bull;    One 8.5 by 11 map.<br/>&bull;    This set of rules.<br/><br/>Players will also need a one ten-sided die (D10).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the Publisher's website):<br/><br/>Build your fame and glory!<br/>Viziers is a game of foresight set in a land of trade, combat and discovery. As a Vizier to the Sultan of Arpeya, you govern an Oasis on his behalf. With some planning, adaptability, and a good record of service, you're certain to become the next Grand Vizier!<br/><br/>Gain the Sultan's favor by developing a prosperous Oasis. Entice the trade caravans to your domain with livestock, weapons, food and artifacts but beware the raiders and conquerors who will surely seek to steal your wealth! Build academies to make discoveries, strongholds to protect your Oasis and palaces to curry favor with the nobility. Every once in a while make an effort to set a rival back - but take care that you don't suffer the same fate!<br/><br/>Do you have the foresight to lay a successful path to victory, or the creativity to adapt to the changing needs of your Oasis? Can you stay a step ahead of your rivals as you jostle for ultimate power and the title of Grand Vizier?<br/><br/>Personal Description:<br/><br/>Viziers is played over rounds, as players race to first gain 10 victory points, winning them the game. Each round, cards to be auctioned are passed out to players who secretly study them before they are called to commit to purchasing the different resources necessary to win (or avoid winning) the cards in their possession and everyone else's during the upcoming auctions. The cards are then returned and resolved in the order of their numbers. Both lucrative trade and strong enemies are acquired by the player with the highest of the relevant resource, along with global events and technologies. After the cards (and their rewards and punishments) are assigned to the players, a new round begins.<br/><br/>",

The accessories are round tokens that are randomly placed in 24 slots (three available in each room).<br/><br/>Then the 32 cards (two of each accessory) are shuffled and players take turns, drawing a card from the pile and attempting to location the making token, showing everyone the chosen token. If it matches the card, you keep the token and the card. If not, you put the token back, and put the card at the bottom of the draw pile.<br/><br/>If the card you draw is one someone has already matched, set it aside and draw again. The first player to find 4 accessories wins.<br/><br/>For younger players allow them to look at the tokens they are placing in the various slots.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These French Fries Are Terrible Hot Dogs is a party card game where players must lie to tell the truth, and convince others that their card is something else, more specifically, cards drawn by other people. Players are encouraged to be clever and to speak with a silver tongue!<br/><br/>During each round of the game, one person will act as the Judge and will take a card from the deck and place it face up. That card is the Target Card. Everyone else then takes a card from their hand and places that card face down. Next, each player must try and convince the Judge that their card is the Target Card by using true information about the card that they just placed down. The act of convincing the Judge is known as The Pitch.<br/><br/>Let's say Bob is the Judge, and he flips over the Target Card &quot;Hot Dogs.&quot; Susan then decides to player her &quot;French Fries&quot; card and places it face down. During her pitch, she can say:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Well, mine's really good plain, but people usually put toppings on it, like ketchup. Others might add chili or cheese. Oh, and you really don't want to eat it cold, it's much better warm.&quot;<br/><br/>Once everyone is finished making their pitch, the Judge picks the person who they feel had the best pitch, and declares that person the winner of the round. Players then discard the cards used during that round. Everyone but the Judge and the round winner draws a new card to replace the one that they just played. A new Judge is chosen, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>A winner is determined once a person discards all of their cards and says &quot;These French Fries Are Terrible Hot Dogs!&quot;<br/><br/>",

You must turn the lights back off after each use, and if you forget to turn them on before the shot is poured, the effect is wasted (but you still have to drink the shot).<br/><br/>     The owner of the Shot Glass is the sole judge of what liquid(s) may be used.<br/><br/><br/>",

Watts (Railway Rivals and others) for the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive as part of publicity to show how easy it was to get around Glasgow and the surrounding areas (of west Central Scotland) using public transport.<br/><br/>It is a race game comprising a number of short rounds (the rules suggest 3 or 4), where each player starts from a randomly allocated railway station, and must visit three places of interest (in any order) using a combination of overground rail, underground/subway system (affectionately known as &quot;The Clockwork Orange&quot;) or buses, then return to their start point to win that round. The person to get back &quot;home&quot; first scores 5 points, the others scoring one point for each site of interest reached. The overall winner is the person with most points at the end of the pre-agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>The board is made up of a hexagonal base, overprinted with the main rail routes, stations and places of interest (that the players must visit). Each round has a different theme - shopping centres, scenic locations, sports stadia, etc. Players roll two dice if they want to travel by train or subway, and one die if travelling by bus. Certain die rolls will result in &quot;incident&quot; cards, which may force a detour, a missed turn etc.<br/><br/>2-6 players, but best with 3-4.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Game Board<br/>Rules (1p)<br/>2 6-sided dice<br/>8 Hexagonal plastic playing pieces with a Bus on one face, and a Train on the opposite<br/>30 Destination Cards<br/>14 Rail Incident Cards<br/>14 Bus Incident Cards<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction<br/>Satat is the most popular card game in Mauritius. Its name comes from the from the Hindi &quot;saat hant&quot; meaning &quot;seven hands&quot; and it is related to the Indian game of Seven Hands (also known as Court Piece). The objective is to win at least seven of the 13 tricks, or even better to win the first 7 tricks, or better still all 13 tricks.<br/><br/>Players and Cards<br/>The game plays with four players in fixed partnerships using a standard 52-card pack. What distinguish Satat from other Whist-like trick tacking games are the fact that the 2 of heart is the highest trump card of the game and the ways trump is decided.<br/><br/>Making Trumps<br/>The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer's right cuts, and the dealer deals a batch of five cards to each player. The trump maker, to dealer's left, looks at these five cards and announces the trump suit. Alternatively, if unwilling to decide trumps on the basis of these first five cards, the trump maker may elect to use the last four cards to determine the trump suit.<br/><br/>End Game and Scoring<br/>Normally the play ends when one team wins by taking seven tricks. However, if a team wins the first seven tricks (a 7-0 win) they may continue the play and try to win all the tricks (13-0 win). The winning team then gets to pass cards to the losing team in exchange for trump cards in a way similar to Sergeant Major.<br/><br/>There is no formal system of scoring and no fixed length to the game, but the players may like to keep track of how many games each team has won or lost.<br/><br/>Variations<br/><br/>Trup kasiet<br/>In this &quot;hidden trump&quot; variation, instead of announcing the trump suit, the trump maker places one card of the trump suit face down. If the trump card is selected unseen from the last four, the trump maker looks at it before placing it face down.<br/><br/>In this variation 7-0 and 13-0 wins are more frequent, but no cards are exchanged after a 7-0 or 13-0 win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tribello is a trick-taking game of the Whist type for three players, using a standard 52-card deck.<br/><br/>Four hands of 13 cards are dealt - one for each player and a spare hand called the pickup.<br/><br/>There are four rounds of play with three deals per round. In the first three rounds the object is to win tricks; in the fourth the aim is to avoid winning tricks. The rounds are as follows. Each player has a quota of tricks. Each round, the way trumps are chosen is different.<br/><br/>In the first three rounds, the dealer has a quota of six tricks, the person to the left of the dealer has a quota of four tricks, and the person to the right of the dealer has a quota of three tricks. If you take more than your quota you score one point per extra trick; if you take less than your quota you score minus one point per trick below quota.<br/><br/>In the fourth round, the dealer has a quota of three tricks, the person to the left of the dealer has a quota of four tricks, and the person to the right of the dealer has a quota of six tricks. If you take more that your quota you score minus one point for each surplus trick; if you take less than your quota you score plus one for each trick below.<br/><br/>For each round, after the players have looked at their hands, the dealer decides how many cards he wants from the pickup (zero to 13). He discards this number of cards from his hand, and then draws an equal number from the top of the pickup, which remains face down. If there are cards remaining in the pickup, the process is repeated with other players.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the fourth round.<br/><br/>",

Hens have become easy prey for the wild animals that roam the outskirts of the land. Each night the weasels and foxes sneak in to nab a nice dinner from the shelter of the chicken coop.<br/><br/>Lately, the farmers have not been as diligent as they should when it comes to the safety of their broods. The roosters have decided to stop their cock fighting and stand up against the attacking beasts. They band together and wait for an attack from the vile creatures, hoping their numbers can fend off the nightly attacks. All is not completely safe for the hens however, as the farmers still like the taste of poultry in their meals&hellip;<br/><br/>The Hen House is a fast paced card game for 2-8 players. Each player tries to defend their Hen House while trying to stop the other players from building up their brood.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player represents a royal family that is attempting to influence the King or the Queen of an Ancient Kingdom in order to gain the royal favor that will make you become the next most powerfull family in the land.<br/><br/>In order to achieve the goal the players will have 10 (Ten) Archetypes they will use to surround the Royal Consort of their color with as much influence as possible.<br/><br/>The player who uses with cunning the resources at his/her disposal will be the winner.<br/><br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>Each player will place his/her 10 tiles with the ACTIVE (This is the side with the banner) side up in his/her Activation Zone (Area close to the player where all the archetypes will enter play or return from play)<br/><br/>Place the king and the queen in the middle ground between the players in the same row with 2 spaces between them.<br/><br/>The game will be played in an imaginary grid with each space the size of one tile.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>Flip a coin, roll a die, find your method of convenience to choose a first player.<br/><br/>The game will be played in turns one player at a time. On your turn you must do the following actions:<br/><br/>1) PLAY A TILE from your Activation Area.<br/><br/>The first tile played by each player WILL NOT ACTIVATE ITS ABILITY. So it is very important you choose well which of your archetypes wont be used in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>A tile played must always be adjacent to another tile (even diagonally) So you cannot place a tile anywhere in the imaginary grid.<br/><br/>A tile played always enters the game on the side it was in the Activation Area. So if the tile played was ACTIVE it stays with the side of the banner up and if the tile was INACTIVE it stays with the side that has a token drawn.<br/><br/>Consider INACTIVE tiles as protected from abilities when they are in PLAY since abilities cannot target INACTIVE tiles. It&acute;s a very good strategy to keep this in mind because an opponent won&acute;t be able to affect one of your INACTIVE tiles.<br/><br/>2) ACTIVE its ability (if possible)<br/><br/>Tiles that have been affected by an ability are turned to the INACTIVE SIDE (the one with the token on it). Same happens with the King and Queen.<br/><br/>Abilities cannot affect tiles that are in play with the INACTIVE SIDE up. This means that once a tile has been turned to the INACTIVE SIDE it&acute;s safe on the board. It can be moved as usual by its owner but will not altered by an opponent.<br/><br/><br/>3) MOVE ONE OF YOUR TILES IN PLAY ONE SPACE (diagonally or perpendicularly)<br/><br/>Notice that the joker has a special ability that allows you to move ONE MORE TIME after you placed it. This is a very strategical ability that can make big difference when you are trying to reposition a high influence tile on your turn or when you want to remove an opponent tile as well. Under no circumstance a tile can end up or move over another tile in the table.<br/><br/>When you move a tile it must always end adjacent to another tile. So you cannot move it on empty space unless it ended there due to the movement of the other tiles.<br/><br/><br/>END GAME &amp; WINNING CONDITIONS<br/><br/>The game will end when one of this two conditions happen:<br/><br/>1) One player starts his/her turn with his target consort surrounded by his own tiles  (perpendicularly).<br/><br/>The victory is total. The more you play the less this condition is going to happen.<br/><br/>2) The players have played all of their tiles.<br/><br/>Once the players have played all of their tiles comes the scoring. For this step only the tiles that surround PERSPERNDICULARLY (up, down and sides) each royal consort will count. Add all the influence numbers in the tiles, PLUS all the tokens if there are INACTIVE tiles among them (each one is worth 1 point) MINUS the total influence on the tiles your opponent has surrounding your royal consort. Compare this numbers... the player with the most influence WINS the game. In case of a tie... you are both too smart to outwit each other :)<br/><br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>20 double sided tiles<br/>1 king<br/>1 queen<br/><br/>",

In each round, two players are the detectives; the other players look at one of the 42 puzzle cards and choose one item from the list of possibilities. These players then receive a &quot;clue&quot; card at random, with these cards saying things like &quot;word&quot;, &quot;person&quot; or &quot;animal&quot;. The player to the left of the detectives must give a clue matching the type of clue listed on her clue card. Each detective can make one guess at the hidden word or phrase, then the next player gives a clue, etc.<br/><br/>If no detective has guessed the right answer after twelve clues have been given, the round ends, no one scores, and the detective role shifts around the table. Otherwise, the detective who guessed correctly scores one point and the player who gave the clue scores two points. After everyone has been detective two or four times (depending on the number of players), whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Time is of the essence. Meanwhile, you must maintain the political will and support of both the American and Iraqi governments. You will be combating insurgents whose goal is to inflict as many casualties as possible and force American 'infidels' from their city, and eventually, country.

Players start by choosing one of the four magi classes, each of which have a unique ability to be used during the game. While taking turns players choose sets of spells to include or exclude in the game. Once this phase is complete, the chosen cards of each spell type are then shuffled together and placed on the board in the appropriately labeled spots. Staged face-up, the cards are drafted one at a time from the board as each player builds their own customized deck of spells. Once deck building is complete, the game board is flipped over to the dueling ground side and players engage in a spell casting fight to determine the winner. Part of the dueling strategy is gamesmanship in the form of alliances and negotiations. Do what you must to ensure you survive to the end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Made entirely of wood and designed to be self-contained, Tabula is its own box. The game closes in on itself to become an sleek tabula, &quot;tablet&quot; in Latin.  The name Tabula  also comes from &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;, meaning &quot;blank slate&quot; - the board starts as a blank slate that then becomes filled with the tiles.<br/><br/>Tabula is a a simple turn-based strategy game in which the objective is to occupy the most spaces of the board. In this game, each player has access to four different type of special tiles that have unique abilities: Attack, Defense, Expansion, Jump. The game-play consists of playing either 1 special tile or two regular tiles (that have no abilities). The game ends when all the spaces of the board have been filled. Whoever has the most tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>Not only is this game a source of tremendous fun, but also is a beautiful aesthetic addition to the home.<br/><br/>",

Take on the role of an ex-soviet super spy, a time traveling steampunk cyborg, or the nordic God of Thunder as you play for the highest of stakes: your lives.<br/><br/>In Killer Croquet, you control a player piece and a ball piece. You get two actions on you turn that can be split up between moving, hitting your ball, and hitting the other players. When you move you can choose to move to your ball or 3 spaces in any direction. When you hit your ball, you choose a direction and a strength and then roll custom dice to see how far the ball goes: Softly (1,1,1,2,2,3), Fairly (1,3,4,5,6,8), or Wicked Hard (Both dice added together)<br/><br/>Pass your ball through each wicket in the correct order and direction and hit the ending post to gain the &quot;Poison&quot; Power Boost. Afterwards, pass your ball through the wickets in the reverse order and direction and hit the start post to win the game. Or simply knock enough players down to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the early 21st century the Rytell Corporation created the first androids, vat-grown, speed aged, altered humans with a shortened lifespan. These androids, and the cheap disposable labor they represented paved the way for the exploration of space and Earth&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Off World Colonies&rdquo;. Mining corporations soon began to exploit the riches of the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In Off World Colonies players pilot mining ships in the asteroid belt finding resources needed for a depleted, desperate Earth. Players will use androids for labor and defensive armies on their mining claims. Beware the new generation of Androids - Naxos 7 - resent their lower class status and have begun to revolt.<br/><br/>Off World Colonies is a game for 1 to 3 players lasting 20-30 minutes.<br/><br/>Players have 3 action points (AP) to spend each turn in the game (in a 2 or 3 player game, the 2nd and 3rd player each get one additional AP for their first turn). Players may earn more APs as the game progresses.<br/><br/>A player can land on an asteroid, orbit the comet or dock at PKD Station and remain there for multiple turns if they desire. Only one player may mine any one asteroid at any one time. Multiple players may be orbit the comet or be docked at PKD Station.<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn they may do one or more of the following, spending their AP:<br/><br/><br/>    Stake a Claim<br/>    Mine an Asteroid<br/>    Refuel<br/>    Refine Fuel<br/>    Defense<br/>    Claim Jump<br/>    Attack<br/>    Process Resources<br/>    Buy Upgrades<br/><br/><br/>During the game androids are blind drawn from the game bag by players. If all players have completed a single turn and none have purchased any androids during that time, the first player must blind draw an android from the game bag and place it on PKD station.<br/><br/>Once all the number of white Naxos 7 Androids have been drawn from the bag (3 - 1 player, 4 - 2p, 5 - 3p), the androids begin their revolt and take over the asteroids and the comet, preventing players from using them.<br/><br/>The game ends when a specific number of tiles have been flipped over either due to being mined out or take over by the Naxos 7 Androids.<br/><br/>For 1 player = 5 tiles<br/>For 2 players = 6 tiles<br/>For 3 players = 7 tiles<br/><br/>The player with the highest number of credits is the winner. In the case of a tie, the player with the greatest number of androids (in the Cryopod and on any asteroids) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It can thus play as a form of solitaire, or as a competitive game, depending upon how many wish to be involved.

The aim is to place all of your cards, while preventing your opponents from doing so.<br/><br/>Use two suits from a deck of playing cards, one red, one black. Place an Ace in the centre of the table, and place the other Ace crossed over it. Shuffle the other 24 cards.<br/><br/>Connecting Cards:<br/>The main gameplay consists of connecting cards to form hierarchies. To connect a card in your hand to one in the tableau, the following conditions must be met:<br/>1. It must not overlap any of the cards in the tableau.<br/>2. It must not touch any card other than the one it is connecting to.<br/>3. Its short side must be placed flush against a side of the card in the tableau.<br/>4. The touching sides must touch in their centres.<br/>5. The two cards must be of the same colour.<br/>6. It must be at most three cards distant from the Aces. (It must connect to the Aces, or connect to a card that connects to the Aces, or connect to a card that connects to a card that connects to the Aces.)<br/>7.

The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>     A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>     Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>     Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan. <br/>     The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode. <br/>     The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>     The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>     The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/>     Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.<br/>     Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.<br/>             Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not. <br/>        <br/>    <br/>     Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)<br/>     The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

In the game, players alternate turns drafting cards from a 5 by 4 grid of cards regular playing cards face up, with players taking cards from the lower part of the grid first, revealing other cards.<br/><br/>After each player has drafted 10 cards, play begins.  Players attempt to play a single card, or a set of cards, each one must succeed the prior one played with a higher value, or greater amount of cards.  Players then score points based upon how long of a run their last play was, with points lost for cards left in hands.  Players also have jokers that act as wild cards, used to complete the going out in a single run.<br/><br/>The solitaire version works like the 2 player version, but a player plays both sides.<br/><br/>There is also a competitive version that utilizes the same drafting mechanism, but tweaks how cards are played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Murder Party &agrave; Manhattan is a crime investigation boardgame for 1 to 16 players.<br/><br/>The players are plying either alone or in teams. Each team stands for an official police or law enforcement department : NYPD, NY State Police, FBI, NSA.<br/><br/>The game is turn based. It plays on a map of Manhattan. At your turn, chose where you want to move your pawn to, following the subway lines available. Each move costs points. Depending on where you stop, you open the enveloppe related to this point, that is for example the interrogation of a witness or suspect, or other information that you get in order to solve a case.<br/><br/>At your turn, you can also stop the game instead of moving. In this case, all teams must write down their conclusions, and then open the &quot;Solution&quot; enveloppe.<br/><br/>For each good answer, you get points. For each false anwser, you lose points. If you stopped the game, you get a bonus. If you used the most transportation points, you get a malus.<br/><br/>The player or team with the most points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

It is a complex simulation of the same order as FITE/SE. But with experience, an extensive Europa library and this package, you can simulate the strategic alternatives open to the Italian Commando Supremo from the entry of Italy into the war through the three years to the point at which the Allies were poised to invade. As might be expected, initiative rests largely with the Axis. The British/Allied side remains on the strategic defensive until late in the game. While it can be played two-player, a better game ensues with multiple players on each side with different players for ground/air and naval commands. Operational commands, such as the Balkans, Levant, Iraq and East Africa, provide opportunities for temporary commanders to participate within the larger campaign.

The chips can be anything...candies, toys, coins, stones, etc. Who loves the ocean most between you three? He becomes the first dealer. Shuffle all cards well, and deal one card to each player. Do not show your card to anyone. Put the remaining card face down at the center of the table.<br/><br/>The first turn goes to the player to the right of the dealer and continues counter-clockwise. The active player decides to either PARLAY (trade cards with the player to their right) or KEEP (keep their currently held card). The next player does the same. If the third player chooses PARLAY, they change cards with the remaining card in the center of the table.<br/><br/>After each player has had one chance to PARLAY or KEEP, a countdown...3, 2, 1...is shouted and everyone reveals their card at the same time. The highest numbered card wins UNLESS both the 3 Card and the 0 Card have been revealed. In this case, reverse the order and the lowest numbered card wins! The player with the weakest card pays a chip to the center of the table.<br/><br/>Play more rounds until one player is out of chips. After that, the dealer deals 1 card to each player and 2 cards in a stack, face down to the center of the table. If a player chooses to PARLAY, they replace their card with the top card in the stack at the center of the table. Continue playing rounds until only one player remains and is declared the winner!<br/><br/>",

This card is intended to be used as a more fun, thematic, and prowess-showing way of determining the start player.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>The illustration on the card depicts blocks with and without numbers. The non-numbered blocks are the basic setup, but by adding the numbered gray blocks, you can increase the difficulty to level 2 or 3 (this is clearly depicted on the back of the card).<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>     First, all players simultaneously bid by showing fingers from their fist equal to the skill level each thinks she can complete. Then, the player who has shown the highest level (e.g., three fingers = difficulty level 3), has one attempt at the appropriate route.<br/>     If the player masters the route, she takes the white route marker and becomes the starting player on the route map. If she fails, she takes the last position in turn order, followed by the player with the next lower difficulty level, etc.<br/><br/><br/>Very important: If several players have shown the same number of fingers, then whichever of them is first to shout, &ldquo;Trapper,&rdquo; is the one who must face the challenge. If there's still a tie, then whoever shouts &ldquo;Grizzly&rdquo; first takes the challenge!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>Also known as Super-spit in Wisconsin, Spit 2 in Texas, Rush in Missouri, and Spit 3 in Kentucky,[citation needed] California Spit is a fast paced shedding card game that has the added bonus of shuffling the deck.<br/><br/>The two players sit at opposite sides of a vertical playing surface. The dealer deals half of the cards to each player. The cards are held face down. Every round, each player plays four cards face up vertically in between both players and slightly closer to themselves. Once both players have done this, they look for two or more cards having the same number. When a player finds one, he places another card on top of the cards with that number until all of the cards with the common number are covered. In other words if there are three fours out then all three cards can get a new card on top of it. If a four is played on top of a four it is called a double, and the player may place a third card on top of it. This requires that players pay attention to the cards they are laying down on the pile. If a player runs out of cards then that player wins. When there are no more groups of cards remaining, each player scoops up the four piles directly in front of him or her and places them face down on the bottom of his or her deck. That round ends and the next begins.<br/><br/>In some versions of the game, there is a move called &quot;spitting&quot; in which the player is allowed to spit on the other player to distract him/her. It is common that they call &quot;doubles&quot; to inform the other player what they did. ment for {21+ age} a longer period of time usually 3 hours is the min, and 4 is the max.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Melee in the Mines is a print-and-play microgame that pits two players against one another. The dwarves&rsquo; silver mine has cut into the tunnels of a monster lair, and now a band of adventurers is fighting for their lives in the narrow confines of the mine against a band of monsters. Each player starts with 7 of 18 characters (18 Monsters or 18 Adventurers). The winner is the party that drives the other from the mine!<br/><br/>Only the first character in each party can use hand-to-hand combat. Other party members can use ranged weapons or special attacks -- provided they have a clear line-of-sight over their companions&rsquo; heads. In these tight quarters, jostling for position is important. It&rsquo;s great to have your troll at the head of your party, given his strength, but then no one behind him can see past him to use a ranged attack. If your halfling is at the front, everyone taller can fire over him, but he himself won&rsquo;t be doing much damage.<br/><br/>Each turn you can either battle (roll 2 six-sided dice) or take an action (see below) and attack with 1 die. Each die roll is assigned to a character whose abilities match that roll &ndash; each card has die faces on it, with corresponding attacks: 1 = Rush, 2 = Strike, 3 = Panic, 4 = Fell, 5 = Do, 6 = Kill.<br/><br/>You can download the 4-page PDF from the Files section. You will need two 6-sided dice.<br/><br/>This game was created for the 2015 BGG Microgame Prototype Design Competition.<br/><br/>",

Once you think you know the Identity of another spy, you can make a guess to potentially unmask that spy...but look out, unmasked spies can fight back!<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, players are given a secret Spy ID card that lets that player know which five Spy Gear cards (of 12 different Spy Gear cards) they are able to score with.<br/><br/>Each turn, spies draw a card from the Spy Gear deck, then play a card to their face-up Spy Set. Once they have added a new card to their Spy set, they must do one of three things:<br/>&bull; Swap any card in their Spy Set for any card in another's set.<br/>&bull; Destroy one of their own Spy Gear cards from their set to use it's ability. <br/>(This can be asking other spies questions, or increasing their own score.)<br/>&bull; Guess the Identity of another spy. <br/>(Add points to your total for correct guesses, and subtract points if incorrect)<br/><br/>If you are incorrect with your guess, you do not eliminate yourself.<br/>If you are discovered, you are considered &quot;unmasked&quot;.<br/><br/>Unlike many other elimination games, Masters of disguise doesn't REALLY eliminate players. unmasked spies can still swap spy gear cards around the table, and make guesses on other spies, so &quot;eliminated&quot; spies are still engaged throughout each round.<br/><br/>The player with the least total points between rounds will be the first player of each new round.<br/><br/>Rounds end when there is one undiscovered spy remaining.

This game is loosely based on the traditional Chinese/Japanese game Sugoroku.<br/><br/>In this game, players choose a character from the Naruto manga and then roll a die to move their characters along a track.  Some spaces have instructions that only affect one character--other characters may ignore the instructions.  If two players land on the same space, they play rock-paper-scissors, with the loser moving back one space.  Various &quot;stage&quot; spaces along the way allow a player to roll a die and move all other players back that number of spaces or to jump ahead is a one a rolled twice consecutively.  Certain events can put a player into a &quot;passive state.&quot;  While in a passive state, players are protected from most negative effects.  The last part of the path splits so each character has their own individual track.  Players must roll the exact number to land on the ending space, and must move back any excess spaces.  First player to arrive there wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A 32 card pack is used, consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7 in each of the four suits, but when playing the game the four jacks are regarded as forming a separate trump suit. So there are effectively five suits: jacks (trumps), clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds.<br/><br/>The ranking of the trumps from high to low is: jack of clubs, jack of spades, jack of Hearts, jack of Diamonds.<br/><br/>In the four non-trump suits the cards rank from high to low A, 10, K, Q, 9, 8, 7.<br/><br/>Certain cards carry penalty points, and the object of the game is to avoid taking tricks containing those cards. First, all the cards carry their normal penalty point values as in Ramsch:<br/><br/>Jacks    2<br/>Aces    11<br/>Tens    10<br/>Kings    4<br/>Queens    3<br/><br/>Taking queens in tricks has an additional effect. The club, spade and heart queens carry extra special penalties which swamp the normal card points above, but these can be neutralised by taking the diamond queen:<br/><br/>Queen of clubs    300 points<br/>Queen of spades    200 points<br/>Queen of hearts    100 points<br/>Queen of diamonds cancels all special queen penalties for the player who wins it in a trick<br/><br/>Nines, eights and sevens are neutral - the carry no penalty and have no special effect.<br/><br/>The player to dealer's left leads. Players must follow suit if they can. A player who has no card of the suit led can play any card.<br/><br/>Jacks count as belonging to the trump suit, not as members of the suits printed on them. This means that if a jack is led the other players must follow with a jack if they can.<br/><br/>[Rules paraphrased from Pagat.com entry.]<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ve read the guides, and heard about how stressful it is for some parents, especially with that top of the hour marketing blitz, but you have a plan and are good at reacting to situations, so you aren&rsquo;t worried about losing your mind on this vacation.  All you have to do is make it back to the main entrance with your child comfortable and satisfied before the park closes, and you&rsquo;ll win the game.<br/><br/>Designed for the 2015 Solitaire Print and Play contest, Iwanna's Theme Park uses a Mancala style mechanic to deal with potential disasters on your vacation.  Cubes of multiple colors move around a Mancala styled &quot;Brain Board,&quot; tracking potential problems with crowds, hunger and bathroom needs, and your child's craving for a special souvenir.  Grouping too many cubes of the same color create a potential for disaster. The player will have to plan ahead, and deposit the right cubes at the right times to prevent the vacation from getting out of control.<br/><br/>A Vassal module designed by Chad Mestdagh is available at this link:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0WBVnUE4NbHZWJ2b0VtR0NrZVU/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0WBVnUE4NbHZWJ2b0VtR0NrZVU...</a><br/><br/>",

Really, this open game allows for house rules and so forth. The options are endless and the game can be altered based on your groups play-style.<br/><br/>    Note* Dice and 'extras' do not come in this game, they are simply suggestions.<br/><br/><br/>Before the game begins, determine what 'score' you're playing to. Might be 5, might be 10, might be 34! It's up to the group to determine how long they plan to play. (See below, how to win)<br/><br/>On your turn, draw a photo card and choose a number (or roll a die, if thats your thing, completely up to you!). That number correlates to a question to be answered about the photo selected. Maybe you have to come up with a caption for the photo or maybe you decide what the portrait is thinking. Format similar to Cards Against Humanity, best answer wins picture card which equals 1 point. Or maybe you want to play by coming up with alternative answers and the group determines who said what best. Winner of that round keeps picture card and scores a point. First person to win &quot;X&quot; number of cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The playing area consists of four transparent square boards, made of ICI Perspex acrylic, each containing a 4 x 4 array of depressions. The boards are assembled prior to play, and using the 12 supplied Perspex support rods, in the form of a set of offset steps: the lowest is on the right and to the fore, the next one up is back a little and to the left, the next is at the back and to the right, and the highest is at back left.  Each of the two players is allocated a pair of boards, a lower one and the upper one on the same side.  Each player has 16 glass marbles (also referred to as 'pieces' or 'ollys') in his own colour (black or white) which he/she initially places in the depressions of his/her lower board. <br/>Each player's aim is to be the first to get four of their marbles on the opponent's lower board. Marbles move up to the owner's upper board, across to the opponent's upper board, and thence down to the opponent's lower board, governed by a set of rules stating what moves are permissible. When pieces move across to the opponent's upper board, it is possible to capture opposing marbles, and these may be taken back and re-entered when the opponent gets a marble into his/her target lower board. <br/>The game is one of pure strategy, with no randomising element, but has some similarities to Backgammon.<br/><br/><br/>     The configurations of the boards may be varied slightly but this  has no bearing on the game play.<br/>     The game comes with a separate rule sheet for a solitaire version.<br/>     An enclosed sheet states that &quot;additional games will soon be available that can be played on the REFRACTION board, for 1, 2, or 4 players&quot;.<br/>     The name of the game is spelled in capital letters throughout the box and printed enclosures.<br/>     The following tag lines are used:<br/>         The Ultimate Game<br/>         The Three Dimensional Strategy Game Of The 21st Century<br/>         The Game Of The 21st Century<br/>         3D Game<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

Produced with permission of Days of Wonder, for non-commercial use only.<br/><br/><br/>This follows the principles of the basic Ticket to Ride game on a special board with special cards and rules. The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop. You can use stations if you wish.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of cards for the &quot;cities&quot;, each with a value to be earned by visiting that &quot;city&quot;.  These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for these.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn.  This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll fight saber tooth tigers, hunt woolly mammoths, gather food and herbs, build shelters, weather the environment, and overcome any obstacle that the Stone Age will throw at you.<br/><br/>Rise of Man: Stone Age is a strategic card drafting board game. Players will choose Resources specific to the Stone Age to overcome Obstacles and Hazards that they will face in each of the 5 Rounds of play.<br/><br/>As tribal leaders, players must overcome a new Obstacle (or Hazard) in each of the 5 rounds of play by choosing and accumulating suitable Resource cards. At the end of each Round, players earn points for overcoming Obstacles, but lose points by failing to overcome their Obstacles. Resource cards accumulate each round so that players can also play &ldquo;Special Events&rdquo; to earn additional points. Special Events are played by using different combinations of specific Resource Cards. Special Events include Chieftain, Feast, Shaman, and many others.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll build a life for yourself and your tribe to really create something worth fighting for. Here, it&rsquo;s not victory or defeat, but life or death, and it&rsquo;s all up to the choices that you make.<br/><br/>",

One player is &quot;at-bat&quot; and one player is &quot;in-the-field&quot;. The both roll three six-sided dice and the highest roll uses their dice result to determine the outcome. It's a single for the &quot;at-bat&quot; player and an &quot;out&quot; for the &quot;in-the-field&quot; player. There are special results on rolls of doubles (two dice having the same number) and triples (all three dice having the same number) for both players (provided they win the roll off).<br/><br/>The come comes with a LARGE set of cardboard stand-up players that are moved around the bases. However, there is no &quot;outfield&quot; players.<br/><br/>In the &quot;advanced&quot; rules, both players are given a set of &quot;one-use&quot; cards which can also affect play. For the &quot;at-bat&quot; player these are: Stolen base x2, Balk x1, Sacrifice x3, Hit by pitch x2, Walk x4, Bunt x2, Double x3, Triple x1 and Home run x2.<br/><br/>For the &quot;in-the-field&quot; player these are: Ground out x4, Pick off x3, Fielder's choice x4, Double play x4, Triple play x1 and Bring it back x2.<br/><br/>That's pretty much it. Other than choosing when to use which card there are not many decisions to make and no way to influence the dice rolled, so that parts primarily luck.<br/><br/>A simple family game with nice components.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop. You can use stations if you wish.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of cards for the &quot;cities&quot;, each with a value to be earned by visiting that &quot;city&quot;. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn. This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Yomi is a fighting game in card form in which physical dexterity is replaced by hand management skills. Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.<br/><br/>More specifically, Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.<br/><br/>Yomi Starter-Set 2 features two character decks, allowing players to face off immediately. Individual character decks allow new matches to be fought between different pairings.<br/><br/>Game Modes<br/><br/>     1v1, the main mode<br/>     2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom<br/>     A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent<br/>     A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>     Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.<br/>     Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.<br/>     Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.<br/>     Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.<br/>     Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.<br/>     Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck. In that case, time is out and the player with the highest life wins.<br/><br/>",

Each of the trivia cards is double-sided with a question on both sides and the answer to each question on the opposite side; therefore, the person reading the question can play along, too. Each card features an odd trivia fact&mdash;and somewhere in the text, there are two possible choices&mdash;one is a fact, the other is a fib (these choices are a different color than the rest of the text).<br/><br/>The active player picks one (the fact or the lie), and reads the sentence aloud to the other players. Here's an example: &ldquo;Al Capone's vault was opened on live TV by (Barbara Walters/Geraldo Rivera) and there was virtually nothing of value in it.&rdquo; Players then decide if the given answer was correct. For instance, the active player includes &ldquo;Barbara Walters&rdquo; in their statement. If a player thinks that's right, they put the voting chip in their hand. If a player thinks that&rsquo;s incorrect, they put nothing in their hand and have an empty hand. All players then reveal what's in their hand. The correct answer is &ldquo;Geraldo Rivera,&rdquo; so those players with empty hands receive one point&mdash;in the form of a nut&mdash;to put into their score cup. After three rounds of each player having had a turn to read a card, the player with the most nuts wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player has an IT project assigned, in which a bunch of little, nasty bugs are hidden. 64 of these ulcer causing monsters must be eliminated for the project to run smoothly. The first bug-free player wins the game. You're not a developer, but are a part of the IT world? Don&rsquo;t worry, Bug Industries has enough bugs and fun for you as well.<br/><br/>The game rules: On the game board &ndash; the headquarters of Bug Industries &ndash; you move your game chip up or down &ndash; depending on whether you can deduct or receive more bugs. You roll two dice: a numbered dice called &ldquo;bug dice&rdquo; and an &ldquo;action dice.&rdquo; The result of the bug dice can be directly deducted from your total bug count. The action dice gives you different options: pause, roll the dice again, draw a bugs card or draw a code card.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of bug cards: The good ones reduce your total bug count and the bad ones increase it. With the second type of cards (code cards) you can influence the whole game. While you have to play the bug cards immediately, you can keep the code cards for yourself without showing them to the other players and then play them when the time is right. Knowing when to drop the code cards on the other players is a key part of the strategy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carta F&uacute;tbol Club is a quick card game, in which two teams of up to three players each must alternatively play cards, trying to score a goal. Each can be played either as an offensive play or as a defensive one (two different numeric values in the same card). If a team plays at least three offensive cards in a row without the defensive team being able to stop it (by playing a card with higher value than the offensive one), they can (if they have the proper card) shoot and score a goal. There are also special cards that can modify the game (like fouls, great plays, etc.).<br/>The game is divided in two halves, ending when a player runs out of cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mythic Wars: Clash of the Gods is a card-and-dice game for 2-8 players, aged 12 to adult. In the game, each player takes on the role of advocate for a faction of four gods and/or goddesses. Each round, the advocate chooses which god or goddess to invoke and bring into the battle, and what attacks (or other actions) the active deities (and any supporting entities) should perform.<br/><br/>Each entity has 3 scores: Attack, Defense, and Energy. Attacks (and other actions, such as Clashes) are resolved by comparing the appropriate score for each opposing entity, and adding a die roll from their respective advocate. Taking damage reduces an entity's energy points, and when they run out of these points, that entity is considered defeated and out of the battle.<br/><br/>Additionally, most of the gods, goddesses, and other entities have abilities that affect the game in different ways, but their abilities only remain active until they are defeated. Once each active entity in the battle has been empowered with a chance to perform an action, the round ends. After four rounds, all of the deities have been invoked, and the battle continues until only one faction remains.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction<br/>This is a two player card game covering the experience of the British VIII Corps on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, July 1st 1916. The game follows the course of the pre-battle preparation and the first day of the battle itself.<br/><br/>It is not a balanced game and one where the British will find it very hard to win.<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>To win the game the British player must capture two of the three German Support Lines.  To do this they must overcome the First and Second Lines of defence in sequence before succeeding in attacking the final German line of defence.<br/><br/>The game is turn based. The early turns consist of just one phase solely concerned with strategic actions by both sides. Later turns consist of a strategic phase followed by a tactical phase. A tactical phase consists of British attacks, and the much rarer German counter-attacks, played in sequence.<br/><br/>The switch to multi-phase turns represents the end of the initial bombardment and the beginning of the infantry battle.  The exact timing of the switch depends on whether the British player decides to prolong the pre-battle barrage or not.<br/><br/>Attacks, be they strategic or tactical, are made by playing a selection of cards.  Strategic cards can only be played in the strategic phase and likewise tactical cards can only be played in the tactical phase.  Furthermore, many strategic cards must be played immediately in the turn in which they are drawn so players do not have a totally free hand in deciding which cards to play.<br/><br/>The British player always takes the initiative unless the German player has chosen to counter-attack at the end of the tactical phase when the playing order is reversed.<br/><br/>Once the turn contains a tactical phase and the infantry battle has commenced, the British player must initiate at least one attack in every tactical phase. If they cannot attack, this counts as a failure.  Only when the British have completed all their attacks may the Germans counter-attack.<br/><br/>To reflect the difficulties faced by the British on the day, the game ends with a German victory if two consecutive British attacks have failed.  Failure to defend a German counter-attack does not count toward victory or defeat.<br/><br/>Plan your tactics carefully!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Way back during the depths of the Great Depression in 1934, patriotic American and underemployed heater salesman Charles B. Darrow literally took an idea he&rsquo;d refined to Parker Brothers, who literally bought it.<br/><br/>That idea was the board game Monopoly, and Darrow &ndash; who&rsquo;d claimed he&rsquo;d invented it himself &ndash; became the world&rsquo;s first millionaire game designer/capitalist.<br/><br/>But he didn&rsquo;t invent it &ndash; he only expanded upon versions of traditional games that had been played for generations. In other words, he made it slightly better.<br/><br/>Way back during the aftermath of the Great Recession in 2016, the founders of Diogenes Games &ndash; also underemployed, patriotic Americans and potential millionaire game designers/capitalists  &ndash; literally took an idea born during the historically weird presidential campaign and literally sold it. To you. That idea was the expansion of Darrow&rsquo;s board game Monopoly, called SOCIALISM.<br/><br/>OBJECT<br/>The object of the game is to achieve total fairness and equality through the renting and selling of property under a modern, progressive, and populist public policy. The game is over when no one is bankrupt and everyone has $300 or less!<br/><br/>NOTE<br/>The Game consists of an enlightened rule-book, a quick-reference card, 20 &ldquo;Fat Chance&rdquo; and 20 &ldquo;Communism Chest&rdquo; cards, and 4 new game tokens. The object of SOCIALISM: The Game is not to &quot;win,&quot; but instead, is to achieve total fairness and equality through the renting and selling of property under a modern, progressive, and populist public policy.<br/>Requires a copy of Hasbro&rsquo;s MONOPOLY to play.<br/><br/>",

The Board game can be played with two to six players with the aim of visiting twelve significant periods of time (&quot;Eras&quot;), as described in the bible. While travelling from Era to Era players can land on bible characters and collect their card if no one else has already landed on it. The aim of the game is to be first to collect as many Era tokens (worth 20 points) and character cards (worth 10 points) and finish on the &quot;Second Coming&quot; and have the most points overall.<br/><br/>The character cards are a helpful tool to get to know some details about certain Bible characters. Some of the characters are examples to us in regard to what qualities a godly person ought to show in the Faith, Obedience, Love, Suffering, Wisdom, and Leadership. The aim of the card game is the learn more about how to be godly in your own character: to have more faith in what God has planned for your life; what it means to be obedient; to show love for each other and love for God above all else; to count it a privilege to suffer for doing what is right; to make wise decisions based on the character of Jesus Christ as found in the Bible; and to be a godly leader who is an example and deals justly with others, who upholds the teaching and example of Jesus, the Servant King.<br/><br/>Discuss and debate the ratings that each character has been given and look up the references to find out more about each character. Each card also gives more information about the name meaning and where you can read more about them in the Bible.<br/><br/>",

Game plays well as a party game, a family game, and even as a solitaire puzzle.<br/><br/>Knowledge of the English language is necessary as the primary element of the game is based on one's ability to create or derive solutions based on word structure and composition.<br/><br/>",

Following the battles of Grozny and Ulus Kert, the Russian forces reorganized and cornered their Chechen opponents in the town of Komsomolskoye. The Chechens took the town in a daring surprise attack, and on the 6th the Russians struck back. However, the Chechens did not flee this time, and instead fought a two week slug fest in a battle in which no quarter was asked or given, and town of five thousand inhabitants was largely destroyed in the attempt to save it. The &ldquo;sister&rdquo; game to Perry Moore&rsquo;s Valor and Vengeance: The Battle of Ulus Kert, Blood and Carnage has the same scale and design in a very interactive and easy-to-learn game.<br/><br/>Each copy of Blood and Carnage has 384 single-sided counters, two 11 by 17 inch map sheets, one Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet and 10 pages of rules. As with Valor and Vengeance, Antonio Pi&ntilde;ar Pe&ntilde;a did the graphics for Blood and Carnage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Peacekeepers tells the story of 5 factions seeking to bring peace and stability to a war torn nation. Peace must be created without using the factions greatest assets, overwhelming fire-power and military strength. <br/>Imagine advanced western nations with their mech&rsquo;s striving to keep the peace in a country as it tears itself apart.  But imagine being unable to use many of those powerful weapons because your mission is to prevent carnage and civilian causalities. Where the mission to being peace is a harder tactical challenge to your leaders than to invade. Peacekeepers is set a civil war in a mid-European country, 30 years in the future. Where fires of war still darken the night-time skies.<br/><br/>Imagine ingenious insurgents using stolen, scavenged and bolted together machines and monstrous weapons to attack, or welded together parts of western mechs, or black market weapons. While commanders must show restraint and work out who is the enemy or the innocent on the ground. This is the setting of peacekeepers.<br/><br/>Peacekeepers is a 4X inspired game set in a near future world reminiscent of our world. It is a &lsquo;peace em up&rsquo; where civilian casualties are the 'countdown' timer in the game and where players can cooperate to protect the populace from events, or compete with each other. Its board game about peace - using giant machines of war.<br/><br/>Peacekeepers thus is a delicate balance of strategy, public relations and maneuvering.<br/>Sometimes not using tactics is harder than using tactics. Sometimes the hardest strategy game of all is to not fight.<br/><br/>",

If a player can't play all of the cards in their hand, they risk dropping out of a heat early while their opponents continue to build lines.

        "description": "Every Christmas the whole family goes to Grandma's big house to celebrate. But this year Granny went to the Bahamas! Panic-buy your way to a happy holiday and invite relatives who have nowhere else to go - you have to show everyone in the family that you had the best Christmas!<br/><br/>Players take the role of families doing their last-minute Christmas shopping in order to lay on meals for guests on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, and buy and decorate a tree. The board consists of a number of shops; each shop has a separate queue, and each space in the queue offers a different reward - from food items to trees to decorations. On a player's turn they first move all of their limited number of pawns one space down the queues they're in, then choose to either start a new pawn at the top of a queue or retrieve a single pawn from a queue and take the item they've reached. The player must take exactly one of these two actions, meaning they have to carefully plan ahead to make sure they don't run out of pawns before they reach their goals, and don't end up with more than one pawn on a desired space in the same turn.<br/><br/>The task is complicated by the opportunity to bump other players' pawns around in queues or make trick telephone calls that distract your opponents from their shopping, and the juicy bonus points on offer for inviting various relatives to come and have dinner with you... so long as you don't offer anything they don't like!<br/><br/>Ridiculous Last-Minute Christmas Shopping Family Brinkmanship is printable as a single A4 or US-Letter page, intended to be included in a Christmas Card; to play 4 coloured pawns, a pen or pencil and a piece of paper for each player are also required.<br/><br/>",

This communication device must eventually hook up to the control panel at the final location: SATCOM #1.   Each of the sixteen locations may also provide critical supplies and equipment to help you along your mission.  Be careful, within each location you will find yourself constantly being attacked by hordes of zombies and murderous raiders that will kill you on site!<br/><br/>",

Beneath the surface of society, an ancient and enigmatic Church suppresses knowledge of the supernatural to protect the greater good of humanity and retain its grip on the world. Vast conspiracies with unknown ends move in the shadows &mdash; secret societies and ancient empires &mdash; and they seek to restore the lost, mystical power of ages past. Dark magic breeds monsters within the hearts of men, which break through to the surface and consume them. It falls to the hunters of the Church to destroy these monsters before they come to light.<br/><br/>Take on the role of a Church Hunter, a sworn defender of the world against the forces of darkness,  in Seventh Cross and delve into the heart of evil as you explore your way through ever-changing castles filled with unique narrative. Meet mysterious and treacherous characters, do battle with terrible monsters, and confront the darkness in your own soul as you walk the narrow line between the pursuit of power and its ultimate cost.<br/><br/>Seventh Cross is a rogue-like exploration game for 2-6 players that combines elements of paragraph adventure games like Tales of the Arabian Nights and exploration elements like Betrayal at House on the Hill together to form a Castlevania/Bloodborne/Helsing sort of narrative adventure.<br/><br/>",

Early learners will enjoy the sorting game - a race to match the most numbers and colors on their card! Advanced learners will love the counting game- a race to collect the most tokens by counting up and down from one to ten! With a device that makes colorful tokens appear like magic, Spin-a-roo keeps young learners excited about practicing their sorting and counting skills. There are two ways to play:<br/><br/><br/>    The Sorting Game (Green Side)*<br/><br/><br/>The goal is to collect the most Tokens by making color and number matches on your card. A player is chosen to turn the Spinner Handle and fill all seven slots in the Spinner Tray. The chosen player should crank the handle around in a circle until it is back on the starting position. When any player sees a token that matches any color or number on his/her card, he/she calls out the number, takes the token, and places it on the matching space on his/her card. When no player can make a match, or the seven slots in the tray are empty, the next player (moving clockwise) cranks the handle a full turn to reload the slots. When there are no tokens left in the spinner handle and no more matches can be made by any player, players stack all the tokens they have collected. If you are the player with the tallest stack--YOU WIN!<br/><br/><br/>    Counting Game (Purple Side)*<br/><br/><br/>The goal is to collect the most tokens by counting up and down from one to ten! A player is chosen to turn the handle and fill all seven slots in the spinner tray. They should crank the handle around in a circle one full turn until it is back on the starting position. When any player sees a token that comes before or after any number on his/her card, he/she calls out the number, takes the token, and places it on the correct space on his/her card. Any number may be placed on the &quot;WILD&quot; space to start. When no player can make a match, or the seven slots in the Tray are empty, the next player (moving clockwise) cranks the handle a full turn to reload the slots. If your stack reaches 10, clear that stack and start over. The tokens that you have cleared will be counted toward your total points at the end of the round. When there are no Tokens left in the Spinner Handle and no more matches can be made by any player, players stack all the Tokens they have collected. If you are the player with the tallest stack--YOU WIN!<br/><br/>",

Then players take turns setting traps in clearings along the forking paths of the road, expanding the number of routes the travelers can take. The aim is to prey on the specific follies of the wicked, dim-witted, greedy, and lazy merchants that travel the path because merchants will only fall for traps set specifically to lure in travelers with their folly. The follies of each band of merchants changes from round to round, as does the flow of traffic between the two main roads. Once all players have set traps, built roadblocks, or seized empty clearings for their own, each of the five bands of merchants follow the path based on the follies of their leader. Once they fall for a trap and lose some of their profit, the next merchant in the band becomes the leader and they continue in this manner until they reach their destination. Players must also be careful their plans for wealth are not ruined by traveling guards, which will destroy every trap that match their folly they come across on their patrol.<br/><br/>Once any player has amassed 25 profit ( or 20 in a five-player game), the game is over at the end of the round, and the player with the most profit wins.<br/><br/>",

Additional add-on modules add more cards for greater customization possibilities, and open up new campaign options.<br/><br/>The game uses deckbuilding aspects that allow players to customize their deck to fit their preferred play style, and features play that only requires the cards themselves in order to play a game.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to either destroy all of your opponent's forces in play, or capture all territories on the board.

        "description": "The &ldquo;Hattrick&rdquo;  game presents one of the episodes from the Norticles universe, which took place during  prince Linnamen&rsquo;s detective journeys. He was one of the private investigators secretly hired by the town authorities, and it was his conclusions that let the inhabitants of Loch Scarland inform the investigators from the capital city, where to look for the fugitive murderer. Karn did not mention this in his report, so as not to expose the inhabitants to repressions due to the illegal involvement of prince Linnamen. <br/>During the game of &ldquo;Hattrick&rdquo;, the players become the characters of this story. They may once again solve the duel between the two antagonists  (Karn and Milton), changing not only its progress, but also the final outcome. This variant is available also in  the &ldquo;print and play&rdquo; version, which can be found on <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.norticles.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.norticles.com</a> . <br/>In the box version, you can get to know other characters involved in the story, which will make it possible for you to play alternative scenarios. Among the characters, you will see prince Linnamen, the monks Rafael Gabriel and Augustine, and Mid Guns, the villain. All the characters come from the gamebook titled &bdquo;The Wasteland&rdquo;, where some of the events also take place in a wooden hut. The Hattrick game is therefore a perfect addition to prince Linnamen&rsquo;s adventures in the Kaer-Nar-Nort wasteland.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://norticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Wasteland_demo.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://norticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Wasteland_de...</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played on a slanted grid using three pieces to a player, representing viking longships; the goal is to cross the playing field to your opponent's starting spaces the fastest. Each turn a die is rolled, with an odd result usually resulting in moving one ship one space, and an even result meaning a lost turn. Opposing ships block but do not capture each other. Some spaces require a specific die result to enter, and other spaces are effectively forbidden, sending a piece back to the start if for some unexplained reason you should enter them.<br/><br/>The game is nominally for 2-4 players, representing the vikings of Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, but it would not be fair to play with 3, since the board is effectively divided in half and with 4 players the two pairs interact very weakly except for the racing aspect.<br/><br/>There is no year of publication, but the Alga logo (or lack of one) suggests the 1940s or 1950s.<br/><br/>",

The stones and the pentacles each come in three colors: crimson, cream, and cobalt. Stone placement follows this order, and players take turns placing the next color of stone on the board. There are only two rules to placement: no stone may be placed on a pentacle of its own color, and no two stones of the same color may be placed next to one another.<br/><br/>Stones on pentacles sharing an interface are connected. Connected stones, enclosing at least one pentacle, are a loop. A loop that encloses at least one pentacle of each color is a shrine. The player to complete the first shrine wins the game.<br/><br/>Shrine is distinct from classic stone-placing games in that players become decoupled from colors. A winning structure will usually include stones laid by both players, but the winner is the one who places the final stone. This leads to an interesting dilemma: how much do I cooperate with my opponent to build this shrine?<br/><br/>",

Draw Phase<br/>-   Draw 1 card and place it in your hand. <br/>-   You may discard a motivation card to draw 2 cards.<br/><br/>2.  Move Phase<br/>-   Roll 1 die and move forward that many spaces OR discard a card from your hand and move forward a number of spaces equal to its force value. <br/>-   If you land on a Revolution Space you may do one of four actions: <br/>    -   Roll the die and move again<br/>    -   Move to any other revolution space on the Board<br/>    -   Draw 1 Card and place it in your hand<br/>    -   Play a Counter onto any Country Space you have radicalised.<br/><br/>3.  Action Phase<br/>-   If you land on a Country Space that has no card on it, you may play a Revolution card to that space. Tuck it partially under the Board directly next to the space. Place 1 of your counters on the space if you placed a card there. If you have a card under a space you are said to have radicalised it. If a country already has 1 card of the same type, you cannot play a second. For example Tunisia can only have 1 Intervention card tucked under its spaces.   <br/>-   If you land on a Country Space that you have already radicalised (You have a card and one or more counters there already) you may do one of the following: <br/>    -  Place an additional counter on the Space.<br/>    -  Exchange the tucked card with one from your hand.<br/>    -  Draw 1 card and discard 1 card (it may be the same card). <br/>-   If you land on a country space radicalised by another player, you can either do nothing or play one or more resistance cards with a combined force value equal to or greater than the number of counters your opponent has on the space. If you do so, discard all the counters on the space and the card tucked under it. Remove the resistance cards from the game. <br/>-   If you land on a country space that is overthrown skip over it and go to the next space and resume your move.<br/><br/>4.  Overthrow Phase<br/>-   If you played a revolution card under a country space this turn and all the other spaces for that country have already been radicalised (by you or others) the country is now said to have been overthrown. Immediately score Victory Tokens (VT) for the country. <br/>-   You gain 2 Victory Tokens for playing the final card to overthrow the country. <br/>-   The player with the highest combined total of counters and card force values gets 5 VT. <br/>-   The player with the second highest total of counters and card force values gets 3 VT. <br/>-   All other players with at least 1 card and counter in the country get 1 VT each. <br/>Overthrown Countries are out of play.  Pawns cannot land on them, they simply move past them without counting them.<br/><br/>5.  End Phase<br/>-   Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when 4 countries have been overthrown. <br/>Each player gets 1 extra VT for each Space they have a counter in. <br/>The player with the most VT at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game for 2 players based on the Highlander Movies and TV shows. The game depicts two Immortals engaging in a duel.<br/><br/>Each player picks a pre-made Immortal (from a choice of three) or makes their own by rolling dice for stats. Each Immortal has 12 basic stats: Wits, Will, Courage, Strength, Skill, Reflexes, Agility, Endurance, Initiative, Experience, Judgement and Size.  The average Immortal will have a score in each between 4 and 9. Each Immortal starts with a number of Life Points = 15 + Endurance.<br/><br/>Immortals are armed with swords, and players can select from a choice of 9 different types.  Each sword has 5 stats: Sharpness, Impact, Speed, Guard and Length. These also have scores between 4 and 9.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck formed from 5 different cards types: Attack, Defence, Both (can be used for either Attack or Defence), State, Early Event Card and Late Event Card.  Combat cards (Attack, Defence or Both) generate the indicated amount of Force - this will usually be a number between 2 and 9. Some combat cards list their Force as a Stat (Immortal or Sword). In this case use your Immortal&rsquo;s or sword&rsquo;s stat value as that of the combat card.<br/><br/>Before combat players must chose a location (from a choice of 8). They can agree on one or choose randomly. Most locations will have special rules that modify the combat.<br/><br/>Each turn has 7 Phases:<br/><br/>1.   Draw Phase<br/>-    Each player fills their hand to 5 cards.  If one Immortal has more Experience than his opponent, he fills his hand to 6 cards.<br/><br/>2.   Initiative Phase<br/>-    Players roll one die each and add their Initiative Stat. The higher total wins the Initiative. If tied, roll again.<br/><br/>3.   Early Event Phase<br/>-    Players take turns playing Early Event cards and State cards.  The initiative winner chooses whether to go first or last.<br/><br/>4.   First Combat Phase<br/>-    The Initiative winner may play an Attack card (or use a Both card as an attack card).  The other player may play a Defence (or Both) card. If the Force of the Attack card is higher the defender takes damage equal to the difference.<br/><br/>5.   Last Combat Phase<br/>-    The Initiative loser may play an Attack card (or use a Both card as an attack card). The other player may play a Defence (or Both) card. If the Force of the Attack card is higher the defender takes damage equal to the difference.<br/><br/>6.   Late Event Phase<br/>-    Players take turns playing Late Event cards. The initiative winner chooses whether to go first or last.<br/><br/>7.   End Phase<br/>-    Players may discard down to 2 cards.  The player with the higher Judgement score may discard down to 1 card.<br/><br/>The winner is the player that kills his opponent&rsquo;s Immortal.  To do this you must first reduce his Life points to zero. Next, you must do extra damage to him with a decapitation card.<br/><br/>",
