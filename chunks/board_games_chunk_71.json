FARMily Feud provides players with the choice of 14 identical actions on seven farm cards, so the playing field is level and each farmer has an equal shot at victory.<br/><br/>Everyone has an identical starting card showing three of their crop--tomato, aubergine (eggplant), carrot, or corn--which is placed in a set formation with the other players' starting cards.<br/><br/>From here on out, the game is played in rounds, with players picking and simultaneously announcing the number of the action they'd like to take. The numbers determine player order. The action is executed by paying its cost in seed, then placing the card back side up, generally in order to either increase the player's own crop or decrease another's.<br/><br/>In addition to outnumbering rivals' crops, players can also score points if they are able to finish with their crop in certain formations. The game plays quickly so you can challenge anyone at any time, so let's settle the sibling rivalry once and for all and kick off this FARMily Feud!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Small Wars: Mohicans is the first game of the Small Wars series. Covering the French and Indian War of the mid-18th century, it is based on a popular 1983 Canadian boardgame called Mohawk. Mohicans starts in 1754 and continues to 1760, which historically was the year after the conquest of Quebec by British forces (a founding event in the creation of modern Canada).<br/><br/>In Mohicans, the powerful regular forces of Britain fight for control of north-eastern North America against the mixed regular and irregular forces of the French and their local allies. The forces of both sides are bolstered by local militia units and other irregular forces, such as the famous French Couriers des Bois or British Rangers, and the arrival each year of more regular reinforcements from Europe.<br/><br/>While the British have the edge in firepower and numbers, the French have better mobility and their Indigenous allies can make effective use of terrain, particularly the massive forests that covered eastern North America at the time. The British are also more vulnerable to having their supply lines cut off.<br/><br/>Both sides seek to curry favour with the powerful but neutral Iroquois Confederacy, as an alliance with them is an enormous strategic advantage. With each major victory on the battlefield, one of the six tribes of the Iroquois will offer its support to the winning side. Get the support of all six tribes, and the Iroquois will join the fight.<br/><br/>To win the game, the British must hold three of the French cities and towns of Louisbourg, Frontenac, Duquesne, Montreal and Quebec (and at least one must be Montreal or Quebec). If they don&rsquo;t do this by 1760, the French win by default.<br/><br/>The French can also win by holding the British cities of Albany and either New York, Boston or Philadelphia. This will be a tall order for the French but they can take comfort in the fact that the British, like NATO 250 years later have the watches, but the French have the time&hellip;<br/><br/>Combat occurs at the different locations, after the seasonal movement has been processed. It covers different battles, such as ambushes in woods, landings, raids on enemy villages and towns, field battles or forts assaults.<br/><br/>During the Winter between each of the 7 years of the war, reinforcements are received, militias and Indians are mustered and forts can be built.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shot&amp;Spin! is a Print &amp; Play golf game designed for solo or group players, bringing the challenge and strategy of golf right to a printed sheet.<br/>Utilizing a unique combination of simple physical components such as a pencil, a stopwatch, a ruler and a paperclip players navigate through various game maps representing golf holes, each with its unique challenges including fairways, roughs, bunkers, ponds, and trees.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to complete each hole with the fewest strokes possible, maximizing your score. Players choose from different types of clubs (Woods, Irons, Wedges, and the Putter), each with specific distances and shot times. Accuracy is key: players must estimate the distance by eye and mentally calculate the time to &quot;hit&quot; the ball towards the target. However, if the shot isn't precise enough, the &quot;Spin&quot; factor comes into play: spinning the paperclip on a table determines the unexpected outcome of the shot, adding an element of randomness and fun.<br/><br/>Shot&amp;Spin! boasts a great replayability, ensuring that no two games are ever the same. This dynamic quality stems from the game's diverse course maps, each presenting unique obstacles and strategic decisions. Players are constantly faced with different challenges, requiring adaptation and tactical thinking with every round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It would be wise for players of this game to apply the principles of warfare when planning, coordinating, and executing their game strategy.<br/><br/>This game is played on a gridded game board by two or more players who use FOLLOW ME game pieces to maneuver and fire on their opponents in order to accomplish a chosen game objective. The game pieces represent the warriors, leaders, supports, and assets that are employed on the field of battle, and their fate is determined by a roll of the dice. The game ends when the chosen game objective is accomplished by the winning player.<br/><br/>Mechanically, the game centers around formation-based grid movement and dice-based fires adjudication.  Units moving in a formation near a leader are more mobile and effective than those operating alone, but they those benefits require staying close to a command piece.<br/><br/>This game was designed in 2019 and initially released in 2024.  It is based on the designer's experience in the US Army with the goal of creating realistic and instructional models of squad-level and platoon-level combat on the modern battlefield.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beware the Ides of March is an operational hex-and-counter game covering the Liberators&rsquo; Civil War &ndash; the conflict which saw erstwhile allies Mark Antony and Octavian team-up against Brutus and Cassius. It was here that Rome&rsquo;s fate was decided once and for all: would the republic be restored, or had it fallen irrevocably to despotism?<br/><br/>The war between the Second Triumvirate and Caesar&rsquo;s assassins was decided in two battles a few weeks apart - but it didn&rsquo;t need to happen that way. Designer John Theissen (Antony and Cleopatra, Campaign of Nations) presents players with an operational sandbox. It models the realities of the conflict: the logistical challenges of supplying an army in the ancient world, the uncertainty of combat, and the dangers of sea travel. You will need to be bold, but every action carries with it significant risk, and just as was the case historically, you are not protected from the consequences of failure.<br/><br/>Theissen&rsquo;s designs are some of the most approachable and streamlined in operational gaming. Rolls on tables simulate sudden storms, external invasions, internal revolts, and the effects of plague. Together these create texture and give context to your decisions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Two rows of number cards are laid out, with each row having three cards more than the number of players.<br/><br/>The game lasts seven rounds. In the first round, reveal three number cards from the reserve. Each player then chooses and reveals a card, marking it with their player token, with all cards then being placed in a row above the existing cards. Players then claim any group of at least three cards in the same color if the card they played is part of this group. (Player order is determined at random by the left or right arrow on top of the card deck.) After a group is claimed, drop any cards that have an empty space underneath them, which might possibly create a new group that is claimed by the active player. If a player doesn't claim a group, they take an action card from the deck. Place a number card from the reserve at the bottom of any empty column.<br/><br/>The next six rounds play out similarly: Reveal three number cards; everyone plays a number card, then claims a group, if possible. Now, though, anyone who doesn't claim a group can either draw an action card or play an action card. The action cards let you &quot;eat&quot; a card from the play area to score it, move a card to another column, or swap two cards. Ideally these actions will let you score groups.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, tally your score, with multicolor cards being worth 2 points and every other card 1 point.<br/><br/>",

A rough river separates them from home but the power of friendship, quick wits and a little magic will help them overcome all obstacles!<br/><br/>In this cooperative game you will roll dice and decide the best way to use them together. The Bridge dice will tell you how the kids can move forward and the Spell die will help them go faster and lull the dragon to sleep. To win, lead the kids across the river back to their village before you run out of Dream tokens and the dragon wakes up.<br/><br/>Every turn you roll 3 dice: 2 of them indicate what kinds of bridges the kids can walk on, the 3rd one allows you to cast a spell. Spells help you reroll the dice, choose bridges and walk silently without disturbing the dragon.<br/><br/>If at the end of your turn at least one kid has reached the village, the dragon keeps seeing the same dream as before. If no one has reached the village during your turn you have to discard a dream token. When you run out of dream tokens, the dragon wakes up.

It focuses less on civilization building and focuses more on fast-paced, competitive gameplay.<br/><br/>Enter through a black hole into uncharted space. Discover new planets to capture them for resources and tech. Use this tech to upgrade your ships with basic upgrades and special upgrades found in space. You can then customize your three different ship types to create a superior fighting force and dominate your opponents in large battles. Battles can have dozens of ships, from multiple players all fighting for control of an area, and the battles move so quickly you'll have lots of opportunities to come back for a second chance at winning.<br/><br/>You can use planetary enhancements to develop and defend your planets. During each round marauder ships will enter through new placed wormholes to attack and when defeated, they drop new special upgrades to enhance your ships. These wormholes open up the battlefield as you can travel through them to access different parts or the map. The tiles are placed in a new spot every game, so find new strategies to win.<br/><br/>Beyond the Event Horizon features streamlined rules with complex, engaging strategy. This is a great game for beginners of 4X space tile games, with still so much for long time lovers of the genre.

Monsters appear alongside the train&mdash;when they are placed next to the car with no Passengers, they will move forward with the aim of reaching the Locomotive. When the Monsters attack, you will notice very quickly the unique kind of threat each of them pose to your journey.<br/><br/>The new red monster looks to be a very calm woman with a strange haircut, but don&rsquo;t let its appearance fool you! As soon as this creature notices potential victims, it becomes clear that the woman's body is a twisted disguise for the real creature hidden underneath. She metamorphosizes during the game and reveals her true face&mdash;a bloodthirsty plant-like beast that will try to kill everything in its path.<br/><br/>The new blue monsters are winged creatures that spread insanity among the Passengers. How do they do that? They kidnap people from the train and take them on a very unpleasant ride, during which their victims are treated to life-like visions of their own darkest memories&hellip; The Passenger is then returned to the train, but never their previous state of mind..<br/><br/>Green insects move in swarms, searching for a warm and cozy space to begin their reproductive process&hellip; That&rsquo;s why they can enter the train cars!

Once all of the players have seen the letters the timer is flipped and they have one minute to write a phrase. The phrase they come up with has to begin with the three letters drawn in the order they are shown on the plate, articles (a, an, the) prepositions (in, on, with, of) or conjunctions (and, but, or) can be added to the phrase to get your thoughts across better. Other then these exceptions, players aren't allowed to add additional words. It is up to the group to determine how vulgar or family friendly you will play. Once time is up, the judge reads the entries aloud and chooses a winner. The criteria for picking a winner is up to the judge, players can feel free to plead their case. Each letter card has a score associated with it and points are awarded according to how many are shown on the plate for that round. The letter cards are set aside and the role of judge moves to the next player. The game ends when a player reaches the finish on the board.<br/><br/>Like a lot of party games, the goal of License to Laugh is for everyone to have a good time, a laugh, and maybe stimulate conversation. Unlike other popular party games, License to Laugh puts the creativity completely in the players hands, no prewritten responses here! This ensures each game is unique to whichever group you have assembled.<br/><br/>",

Players then choose a card from their personal deck of numbered cards and reveal them simultaneously. These played cards are lined up in order beneath the movement cards, and each action is resolved from the highest-numbered card to the elowest. However, if two players play the same number (resulting in &quot;butting&quot;), they do not get to take an action and receive mana instead. Mana, which can be obtained in several ways, allows the player to roll the movement die to advance. This functions as a catch-up mechanism, with the first-place player paying 6 mana to roll and the fourth-place player paying 1 mana. The player who reaches the goal fastest wins.<br/><br/>In addition to the basic rules, there are advanced rules where player characters each have unique abilities as well as special actions on each space of the race course. There are also cooperative rules where players work together to escape the dragon!<br/><br/>",

A descendant of a noble clan, she was raised in Konomine Castle, and became one of the court ladies there.<br/><br/>Her life of privilege was interrupted when a large army led by Ouchi Teruhiro attacked the castle. With their lord and his army off on raids of his own, the defense of the castle fell to Lady Ichikawa. Knowing her few remaining warriors would not be enough, Lady Ichikawa armed Tatsu and the other court ladies and prepared them to defend the castle against Teruhiro's army.<br/><br/>Tatsu was only 17, and this was the first time she raised a sword. But to her surprise, she felt no fear in battle. Instead, a thrill energized her and she fought ferociously. After 10 long days of battle, Teruhiro's army fled, but not before Tatsu suffered a vicious gut wound.<br/><br/>The days that followed were pure agony as her wound festered. This continuous intense pain brought about her awakening in a thunderous blast of sound and force that left several dead and a hole in the castle wall.<br/><br/>Unaware of her sorcerer&rsquo;s heritage, Tatsu was confused and frightened. She fled the castle, and was presumed dead.<br/><br/>In the years that followed, Tatsu was irresistibly drawn to the thrill of combat. The combination of an intense training regiment and the sorcerer&rsquo;s power running through her veins made her a force to be reckoned with. In battle after battle her reputation grew, and she became a famous Onna-bugeisha.<br/><br/>Drawn by visions and nightmares she didn&rsquo;t fully understand, Tatsu eventually left Japan. She met Li Xian, a Chinese sorcerer, and they sought out ancient artifacts connected to the Jade Emperor. On their centuries long quest, Tatsu found many items of great power and mastered long forgotten enchantments and alchemy.<br/><br/>Tatsu&rsquo;s Character Deck is full of deadly attachments with the new &ldquo;Concealed&rdquo; mechanic that allows them to be played face-down. As a tactic, you can pay the attachment&rsquo;s cost and reveal it, unleashing a powerful effect.<br/><br/>",

The Shrine Maidens decorate the path of the Fox Spirit beautifully to score points. It is crucial to create patterns using unique numbers effectively. The player who scores the highest points wins and is chosen as the new Shrine Maiden by the Fox Spirit.<br/><br/>Each card is composed of two colors, and the number on each card represents its rarity. It might seem easy with only two colors, but this is a peculiar game where you can still score points even if you lose a trick.

Each round consists of three phases:<br/><br/><br/>     City Phase;<br/>     Adventure Phase;<br/>     The Battle Phase;<br/><br/><br/>In the first, players will have to rebuild new buildings in the City, train new troops from Recruits, calculate resource revenues and losses.<br/><br/>In the second, players move Heroes with their armies around the map, opening new territories, capturing mines, killing robbers, and most importantly, capturing new villages that will bring new Recruits and bring the player closer to victory.<br/><br/>And the third phase unfolds when the Hero encounters another Hero or a band of robbers. The battle takes place in a separate Arena in the center of the playing field, where players will command their troops, trying to destroy the opponent's army. By winning, the Hero player receives experience points, with which you can develop the characteristics of the Hero, which will directly affect the course of battles and your advantage in the game.<br/>The game is designed for two or four players, lasts 4 game weeks (12 rounds), on average the game takes from 3 to 5 hours.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Place three cards face up in the pool and one card face up on the floor. A condition tile starts on the pivot side; more on that later.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can play any number of cards from your hand as long as the first number on these cards matches the last number on the floor card. (That last number is the &quot;pivot&quot;.) Arrange your played cards on the floor in the order of your choice with the top card becoming the new floor.<br/><br/>If you can chain three consecutive numbers, you can play them no matter what the floor card is, then you take another turn.<br/><br/>Instead of playing or chaining, you can take a pool card or the top card of the deck into your hand, refilling the pool, if necessary.<br/><br/>Finally, you can reset by taking all three pool cards into your hand, then flipping the condition tile. The side opposite &quot;pivot&quot; is relay, and when relay is the condition, you can play cards one by one, with the first digit of each played card matching the last digit of the new floor card. Maybe you can empty your hand all in one go this way?<br/><br/>When one player empties their hand, everyone else can only play or chain from that point, exiting the game when they can't put down cards on their turn. Each wild card still in hand is worth 3 points, and each non-wild card is 1 point.<br/><br/>Play three rounds in this manner, then whoever has the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

Choose from 24 of the greatest tennis champions in history and pit them against each other in a fun, fast-paced game that isn&rsquo;t packed full of tables and charts. Instead, the entire game is designed to get you thinking about strategy right from the first strike of the ball. Each player in the game is rated for various Strokes such as 1st Serve, Backhand, Forehand Volley and Touch, from a low of F (a terrible shot for a pro player), to AA (one of the legendary Strokes in tennis history). Play Strategy cards to increase your scoring chances, defend against your opponent&rsquo;s Strokes, or try a variety of Tactics (Crowd the Net, Pick up the Pace, etc.) to shake things up.<br/><br/>The fun comes not only from the wide variety of Strategy cards in play at any particular time, but also from the effects different cards have on each other. Do you risk hitting a Cannonball Serve, knowing that your opponent might have secretly played a card that negates it? Can you keep using Go for the Lines as a Tactic, knowing that you might miss, and hurt your scoring chances? And depending on which players are involved, the strategic decisions each set only multiply. As you master the Basic game and move on to the Intermediate and Advanced games, we add the possibility of a Set ending earlier, more Random Events, Tiebreakers, and even Fatigue and Injuries, for those who want more realism, without much increase in complexity.<br/><br/>Stage your own tournaments, find out which courts best fit your style, and serve up some of the greatest Strokes the world has ever seen! Will you lead your favorite players to victory? Put the ball in your court with TC Tennis!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/>Number of Players: 2<br/>Ages: 10 and up<br/>Playing Time: approximately 45 to 90 minutes<br/>Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale<br/>Unit scale: Individual tennis players<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>&bull;    1 8-page Color Rules booklet<br/>&bull;    80 Strategy cards<br/>&bull;    24 Player Cards<br/>&bull;    56 single-sided markers<br/>&bull;    One 11&quot; x 4.25&quot; Tournament Tables<br/>&bull;    1 Momentum Mat<br/>&bull;    Polybag packaging and component storage<br/><br/>Microbadge Available:<br/>  TC Tennis Fan<br/><br/>",

During placement, each player takes turns placing one piece on the board, unless a capture is available, which immediately takes precedence. Pieces may not be placed such that they force an immediate capture unless there is already a capture threat elsewhere or there is no choice but to place a piece in jeopardy. The last player places all of his/her remaining pieces on the board at once in one tall &quot;shadow&quot; piece. Players control stacks when their piece is on top. In the movement &amp; capture phase, players move one piece one square at a time to the next square (only on the black squares -- connectivity is four) or capture (mandatory when possible) the top piece of a stack under the bottom of another stack by jumping over it. Jumps can be repeated, and maximal captures are mandatory. The first player unable to move loses.<br/><br/>As originally published the game used a hexagonal grid.<br/><br/>",

Challenged, I devised a game using only an available pencil and some sheets of paper. I was rather surprised when it gained a considerable measure of popularity among my friends, some praing it as the &quot;last word&quot; in word games.&quot;<br/><br/>Last Word is played in a grid on squares 9 x 9. The central 9 squares are filled with 9 letters at random. In his turn, each player puts a new letter adjacent to at least two others already in the layout. Using this letter and the others that are in line with it, the player forms words. The letters can be rearranged in the layout to acomplish this. He can not put a letter if he can not form a word in at least two different direction and he scores by multiplying the lenght of all words formed by that letter. It is not necessary to use all letters in a direction, but all letters used must be continuous up to the letter added.<br/><br/>The game ends when all four edges of the grid are reached with at least one letter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sink the Carrier is a co-op game, where each player take control of one Douglas SBD Dauntless, a dive bomber, on board the USS Yorktown carrier during the early days of May 1942 in the Coral Sea. The objective is to find and sink one of the Japanese Air Carriers. The Japanese army wins if players lose a certain number of planes or if the USS Yorktown is sunk.<br/><br/>Each turn you have to choose between different actions, move between sea zones, attack enemy planes, or search for the Japanese carrier. All dice rolls are based on poker hands--the better hand you roll, the more efficient the action is. You can reroll as many times as you want as long as you have enough fuel and time. Time is a precious commodity in the game.  You have to beat a certain number of event cards each day before the clockwatch runs out.<br/><br/>You will get trophies when you destroy enemy planes, which help your piloting skills improve. You will prepare for the final Dive Bomb, a risky attack maneuver, for which you only have one bomb. Fail and you will have to come back to the carrier reload.  Hit the deck, and the explosion can crack the carrier with just one hit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Destruction of Force Z is a tactical level, solitaire simulation of the short air/naval campaign off the coast of Malaya in late 1941 which saw the destruction of two Royal Navy capital ships, HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse by Japanese bombers. The player takes the British side, and the game system plays the Japanese side.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for the British to disrupt Japanese invasions taking place, while not losing his ships. You as the player are presented with a difficult situation. Pearl Harbor has just been attacked; the entire Malayan peninsula is under threat of invasion. There are not many offensive options open to you and your ships, but doing something to take the war to the enemy is preferable to meekly doing nothing at all. Perhaps you can disrupt invasion sites? Intercept enemy warships? Whatever you decide, it will be an uphill battle for the British. In the actual campaign, Force Z sailed out of Singapore into the South China Sea in the early evening of December 8. Admiral Phillips, onboard the Prince of Wales, ordered strict radio silence. If the two British capital ships were able to reach the Gulf of Siam undetected, they might be able to wreak havoc among enemy warships, transports, and invasion sites. If they were found, they risked the wrath of land-based Japanese bombers located in Indo-China. But danger from this eventuality was judged to be minimal, even though the RAF had warned the Admiral that they could not guarantee protection of the ships from the air.<br/><br/>The stage is set, the campaign is about to begin. Can you pull off a British victory, and avoid the destruction of Force Z?<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>     an illustrated 12-page digest-sized rule booklet that includes all rules and tables necessary for play, <br/>     a small map and <br/>     set of 59 counters (which must be printed and separated before play, depending on version), <br/>     Reference Card, and <br/>     optional ship counters for a game variant, originally published in Panzerschreck #16 (2014). <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher for 2018 edition<br/><br/>",

Reveal card 0 of the scenario and read the intro out loud. Aside from explaining the current situation, this card will tell you a) how many info tokens of each type must go in the bag, and b) on which positions of the alert track must the police cars go. Place the rest of story cards in order, face down and without looking at them, next to the story track, making sure that the arrow points at the position indicated on the<br/>back of each story card.<br/><br/>GOAL:<br/>The goal of the game is to collect enough info tokens to reveal all the story cards and overcome the final challenge before the alert track reaches the limit.<br/>Each story has their own cards that will change some game mechanics, introduce new ones, and will also tell you what the final challenge is. At any time, if the alert track reaches its limit, the players will have until the end of the round to reach their goal, or they will lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Put the sorted victory point cards aside, they are only needed at the end of every round. Now a circle is laid out. The size of the circle and the number of cards and champions depends on the number of players and the variant the players agree on.

At the end of each round the best players gain points. A round consists of 5 turns per player. The game ends when each player was starting player of a round.

Here, the Soviets have air superiority, albeit somewhat uncoordinated.<br/><br/>Duel on the Steppe includes one counter sheet (228 counters), and one map of the Ukraine area of the Soviet Union (approximately 260 miles, or about 418 kilometers), each hex representing about 6.5 miles (~10 kilometers). Unit sizes vary from kampfgruppes to corps, the latter which can be broken down into smaller formations for more operational flexibility, or simply to absorb casualties.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters<br/><br/>",

Finally she came, blossomed by a tear of light, which gave rise to all living beings, now she has been imprisoned by her power-hungry children and you will have to free her. ETEREA princess has been chained to the heart of the first world, her children, custodians of the six dimensions , they overturned the throne determined to master the fundamental principles to be able to reign over the entire universe. What was once a thriving planet is now a distant memory, that place where life was born has died out, the Vital Essences, now lost, they no longer generate beings and the thread that binds all the galaxies is corroded and close to splitting. The last hope is a handful of Architects, faithful heralds of the princess, designers of all perceptible dimensions and im palpable. Only they will have the ardor to undertake a mission to the limit of the impossible to try to subjugate the six tyrants, take their keys and free ETEREA from an unacceptable fate; if they fail, everything will be lost, the universe, as we know it, will cease to exist giving way to despair, chaos, ruin.<br/><br/>In ETEREA you are one of the architects who will attempt the enterprise to recover the keys, guarded by the six Bosses who govern the six dimensions: Water, Fire, Wind, Earth, Cosmos and Oblivion, to free the princess and save the whole ETEREA is a game divided into two parts: in the first you will have to wander through the six dimensions trying to reconstruct the Requirements, now swept away by the tyrants, to repopulate them; doing this will allow you to acquire Requirement cards and Artifacts, which are essential to succeed in the mission; to create the Requirements you will need careful planning in the dice roll and a careful use of certain skills or Vocations. In the second part you will have to face the Bosses and recover the keys, in doing so you will have to build your dice set , thanks to what I learned in the first part, and launch yourself in a desperate attempt to defeat them in an unequal duel, but thanks to a careful strategy, nothing will be impossible. There is more, always keep an eye on the time that passes , you will only have eighteen hours, a single day on ETEREA, then everything will be lost. Only an Architect will be able to succeed in the heroic action, but everyone will be able to perish in battle leading everything known to ruin. Good luck, that the glow of ETEREA accompany you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Avoid the dreaded Pirate's Mark as you navigate the open waters to gain prestige and treasure.Take turns staking your claim on how many cards you can pull without being marked. The last pirate without a Pirate&rsquo;s Mark wins.  Will it be you?<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple to pick up on. Cards are dealt out in a 13X10 grid all facedown on the table. There are one less dreaded Pirate's Mark cards in the deck than players. Players take turns clockwise making a bluff of how many cards they can pull without getting a Pirate's Mark card increasing their bid by at least one each time. When the bid gets high enough, let's say 17, a fellow pirate may call the bluff.<br/><br/>Once called, you have to prove your bluff by picking one card at a time from the grid. You can pick whatever card you have your eye one, but must follow the instructions on the cards. Some cards are curses that make the game more treacherous for you while others are a bit of luck. If you pull a Pirate's Mark card, you are out for now but may return later if you successfully call another pirate's bluff. However, if you are successful the player who called your bluff must pull a card themselves as punishment. Bluffing then resumes and gameplay continues until there are only 2 players left or 10 cards at sea. At this point, duel mode is enacted and players pull one card at a time until only one is left un-marked and wins the game!<br/><br/>This game keeps you on the edge of your seat because the tides can turn at any time. It's a great game for small and larger groups that mixes luck and skill well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When setting up the playing area, the Cutpurse is laid out as an additional third market tile next to the Coin Changer and the Head Merchant.<br/><br/>When a player draws one or more black counterfeit coins from his or her purse, these coins are not set immediately onto his or her character tile anymore. Instead, the black coins are set next to his or her side of the Cutpurse.<br/><br/>As soon as one player has set three or more counterfeit coins next to the Cutpurse at the end of his or her turn, this player receives the Cutpurse's services. The player may choose to either:<br/><br/>Steal one seal from the next player in clockwise order who has one or more seals,<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>Receive as many reputation points as there are currently universal tender coins (white coins) set next to all merchandise and market tiles. It does not matter whether they are the player's own universal tender coins or whether they belong to other players. The player then moves his or her scoring marker forward this number of spaces in a clockwise direction on the game board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Solid State War is a print-and-play game line set during a war of resources beginning in the year 2035 AD. It is a light, fast-playing game of aerial dogfights between small numbers of jets. The objective of play is to defeat your opponent's air forces in close combat. The game is designed to be suitable for quick pickup games as well as long term campaigns.<br/><br/>As a print-and-play game, players are expected to print out and prepare the playing pieces with household craft tools (scissors, hobby knife, and ordinary glue). These playing pieces include jet fighters, movement and shooting tools, unique dice and (as an option) 3D paper models.<br/><br/>Game sessions begin by choosing a scenario. Each scenario establishes the starting positions and objectives of the fighter jets on each team. There are two sides in the war, the Rebels and the State. The scenarios are sometimes written to favor one side, to reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing armies.<br/><br/>Once a scenario is selected, the players spend a certain number of &quot;army points&quot; to purchase their aircraft and outfit them with more experienced crews, weapons and special devices. Each jet uses its own record sheet, and during play the player controlling that jet is responsible for marking its current damage, ammo and other variables.<br/><br/>Gameplay proceeds by rounds, with each jet taking a turn according to its initiative score. Movement is handled using a fan-shaped &quot;movement key&quot; and rolling dice to determine the maximum turning angle for that instance. Attacks are handled with a &quot;range finder&quot; tool that is placed in front of the attacking jet and used to determine if any targets can be fired upon. Dice are rolled to determine the severity of damage.<br/><br/>Scenarios may be won by destroying the enemy team's jets, or by disabling or disarming the enemy team, forcing a forfeit. Some scenarios have special victory conditions, such as taking recon photos or bombing a ground target.<br/><br/>After a scenario, both sides are awarded some army points to further develop their air forces or replace ruined equipment. These changes may be carried over for use in the next scenario.<br/><br/>The base release for this game is the Air War Starter Set PDF. It contains all of the essential components, such as print-and-play dice, maneuvering and range-finding tools, speed tokens, smoke clouds, bombing targets and 2D jet fighter game pieces. This set includes two versions of the RG-6 Tigress, a fighter jet used by both sides during the war. The custom dice include a unique distribution of numbers, as well as keywords that are used in different situations.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be supplemented with individual vehicle packs containing new options and game pieces, as well as 3D paper model PDFs that can be assembled and used in place of the standard 2D jet fighter pieces. Expansions are planned that will introduce new jet types, heroic crew members, campaigns, ground vehicles and ships.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Torpedo Raiders is a solitaire WW2 air combat card game, depicting torpedo bombers and their exploits in historical scenarios.  The game system is similar to the game system used in Stringbag, which appeared in Panzer Digest #13.  Players take the role of one (or a group) of torpedo bombers and fly through flak to deliver torpedoes against enemy warships.<br/><br/>Includes eight-page illustrated rule booklet, two identical Reference Cards, and one counter sheet with individually rated warplanes. (Counters must be cut apart prior to play.)  Optional rules are provided as well. There are five historical scenarios that come with the game:  Taranto 1940 (involving British Fairey Swordfish planes), Bismarck 1941 (Swordfish), Pearl Harbor 1941 (with Japanese B5N Kates), Force Z 1941 (Japanese G3M Nells and G4M Bettys), and Midway 1942 (American Devastators).<br/><br/>This is a small solitaire game, that plays quickly, so it is ideal for short play sessions, overnight business trips, or tray table action while flying. All you need to do is supply a regular deck of cards, a six-sided die, the supplied plane counters and Reference Cards, and an imagination, and you are in business. Like other Minden designs, Torpedo Raiders delivers high playability and historicity for you to enjoy.<br/><br/>World War II torpedo bombing attacks create an exciting narrative for a wargame. The theater of your imagination--along with the straightforward mechanics of this game system--will bring these raids to life on your tabletop.<br/><br/>",

Do you have what it takes to run the greatest zoo the world has ever seen? Compete with the other zookeepers to find the most exotic animals, design the best enclosures, and create the most beautiful gardens and pathways for your lucky patrons to enjoy. Prove that you are capable of attracting the most visitors to your zoo and you might just become the new director of Zooronga - the World&rsquo;s Greatest Zoo!<br/><br/>Zooronga is a zoo-building, tile-laying game. Each player is a zookeeper with some money and a place to start. The game lasts for five months and each month 5 zoo-tiles are auctioned for the highest bidder. At the end of the month points are calculated. Each zoo-tile contains two animal enclosures of animals from different regions (eg. polar animals, African animals etc), some roads and possibly trees.<br/><br/>Each player secretly selects the amount of money he is willing to pay for the tile and the highest bidder wins the auction. Whenever a tile is bought it needs to be added to your zoo so that the roads and green areas match. It might be that after the tile is added to your zoo, your zoo becomes more interesting than before. Interest value is shown with little stars on the tiles. The more stars of one color you have, the more interesting your zoo is for that region. Visitors are also interested in trees and parks. Visitors always go for the most interesting zoos and at the end of the month each visitor in your zoo gives you points. When the month ends, each player receives some income and new zoo-tiles are drawn for auction.<br/><br/>The goal is to attract as many visitors to your zoo as possible and thus score more points than others.<br/><br/>",

After you come up with a gameplan you still have to get the presidents' approval or it's a no go. If the problem is not solved it carries over and you will lose status.

However, keep in mind, that this game simulates hundreds of variables that can occur in any race. As with any sport, sometimes pure luck can be the deciding factor. That&rsquo;s no exception with Championship Drag Racing. On the whole, you&rsquo;ll experience very realistic results. But, within the confines of a single qualifying run or elimination race, anything can truly happen!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Championship Drag Racing: Top Fuel Edition gives you every Top Fuel Racer that made a successful qualifying attempt in 2005. You also get all 23 circuits rated by lane making the lane choice strategy just as important as real life. A full schedule, complete points standings, complete final ladders for each event, as well as a list of drivers that attempted to make every field are included.&quot;<br/><br/>The standard game is printed in black and white. The Deluxe edition of the game is printed in full color.<br/><br/>",

One die will be used for Winnie the Pooh, while the other die will be one of his friends coming to help. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, however each player determines how to use the dice.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each Round you will roll 2 dice and then use each die to place a number in any open hexagon in any beehive. One die will be used for Winnie the Pooh, using the number on the die for a hexagon space. The other die will be used for a Friend, which will also place a number in an open hexagon space. The goal is to make number runs and/or sets of the same number in each beehive. The longer the run or the larger the set, the more points you will earn.<br/><br/>Round Summary:<br/><br/>- Roll 2 dice - Roll the 2 dice. Write the numbers in the current round&rsquo;s track. The round tracker is just used as a helpful reference. (Over a game you will mark 24 numbers, filling all the beehives. It will be 2 numbers each round, over the 12 rounds)<br/><br/>- Use one die for Winnie the Pooh<br/>     Choose one of the dice for Winnie the Pooh. Write the number on the die in any open hexagon space in any beehive.<br/><br/>- Use one die for a Friend<br/>     Use the other die for one of Pooh&rsquo;s friends, using whatever their special ability is. Some friends will give you a choice between two numbers. Some friends will look at Pooh&rsquo;s die and then make another number based off of that number. Write the number in any open hexagon in any beehive. Also, mark an X over the leftmost heart on the friendship track under the friend you chose. Note: You may choose a friend more than three times, there just is not any additional bonus.<br/><br/>- Repeat this until you have completed 12 rounds<br/><br/>Scoring: The goal is to make number runs and/or sets of the same number in each beehive. The longer the run or the larger the set, the more points you will earn. You can use each number you wrote once for a run and once for a set. You can use the number already in the center of each beehive in multiple runs or sets. A run is three or more numbers that are connected and continuously increasing by one. A set is a group of two or more numbers that are connected and all the same number.<br/><br/>End of Game:<br/>Total all your runs, sets, furthest star on the honey/bee track, and also all stars earned from friends. Total these points and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

In the late 70's Phil had added a game of random event cards to Cartel to add variety to the game.  In Dallas, those cards are added, the board is also slightly changed in the new theme, which is based on the Dallas TV show.<br/><br/>Players take turns bidding on and buying companies on the board.  Larger networks of adjacent companies create higher payouts.  Players can also risk taking on debt to pay higher prices, hoping the resulting network pays for the liability of the debt.  A deck of random event cards adds a random element, &quot;Dallas Press Events,&quot; to each turn (making the game different from the original Cartel).<br/><br/>The winner is the player that acquires the highest net worth, adding together current cash plus the value of their network of companies, less the cost of repaying their debt.<br/><br/>While the game has a theme based on the popular TV shows, only the companies, e.g., Ewing Oil, appear in the game.  A very few of the characters are mentioned in flavor text that appears in the rulebook.  None of the stars of the show are pictured and the graphic design does not pick up on the TV shows look and feel either.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At its core, The Bermuda Crisis: Discovery Dawning is a free-form card game about skill acquisition and management. Players accomplish this by drawing resources they then spend to obtain various abilities.<br/><br/>Over time you'll use the various resources you've collected to build and upgrade base camps. These camps specialize in (1) defense &amp; resource efficiency, (2) game control &amp; magic, and (3) trading &amp; secret missions. Striking a balance between focus and diversification is the biggest challenge players will face.<br/><br/>You win the game by acquiring victory points, but there are two alternate endings. As the game progresses, an imaginary hourglass counts down the island's doom. If time runs out, a victor is chosen via the collection of &quot;nature points.&quot; The third way a game can end is if a player collects all three pieces of Brinehorn's Scroll, which are scattered randomly throughout the island and unlock the esoteric history of The Bermuda Triangle. Both alternate scenarios create palpable suspense as players race towards their preferred ending.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Bermuda Crisis: Discovery Dawning is easy to learn but challenging to master. It appeals to different personality types and finishes on an exhilarating note. You and your gaming comrades will want to explore the island time and time again!<br/><br/>",

If the handkets were a difficult dexterity game that requires skill, this is a highly accessible Dexterity game.<br/><br/>This game is a baseball game, and the key mechanic is a striking box.<br/><br/>There is a wooden box with a hole in the center and a bevel inside the box. If the cube ball dropped from the top and entered the bore-shaped hole correctly, the blow was successful.<br/><br/>If you drop it too low, it is likely to be a foul because there is not enough potential energy, so you have to fall as high as possible. It is the same principle as marbling when I was a child.<br/><br/>The higher the ball is dropped, the farther the ball goes. But the probability of passing through the hole will be that much.<br/>It is a high risk high return concept using gravity and position energy.<br/><br/>",

It may take radical forms that knock out any competition. No matter how powerful the &lsquo;Committee&rsquo; is, it is vulnerable to its own subdivision heads.<br/><br/>Victory in a World Domination Project, including the total neutralization of the &lsquo;Committee&rsquo; and all its structures, costs more and brings higher risks. Its reward is a clean slate... while sitting atop the world as its one and only ruler.<br/><br/>The Ultimate Deep State promo mini-expansion allows for instant victory when you reach Stage V in any Project, instead of winning with Influence. Each Stage V has higher requirements only experienced players can meet.<br/><br/>There is also a &quot;soft&quot; version &mdash; with less difficult requirements, Stage V grants more influence and no instant victory.<br/><br/>This expansion contains overlays for Stages V for the 4 base set Projects and the 6 Projects from the Global Conspiracy expansion. It is fully compatible with all modules and mini-expansions from the Deep State: Global Conspiracy expansion. It is designed for 1&ndash;5 player games. It comes packaged in its own zip-bag.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do in life is to connect all the locations where there are parties so that everyone can deliver gifts to each other...how fun is that? You know, of course, that people who build railroad companies are the most generous people in the world. They love to help out their competitors, with a motto of &ldquo;all for the greater good&rdquo; while having boatloads of fun. In this expansion, you&rsquo;ll share track with your opponents while they share track with you. And all it takes to share? A share!<br/><br/>Yes, you&rsquo;re still competing with other players to move all the gifts everyone has gotten for each other to the correct party, but you&rsquo;re doing it with a wink of your eye and a fun little skip to your step. Sure, there&rsquo;s still only one winner, but it&rsquo;s really about how many friends you make while playing...and doesn&rsquo;t that make everyone a winner?<br/><br/>Sharing is for 3 to 6 players who really care about other people.<br/><br/>If you find the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; Sharing rules for Ted Alspach&rsquo;s Sharing Steam/Age of Steam expansion too competitive for your tastes, try this softer, more pleasant expansion map (on the reverse side of &ldquo;Sharing&rdquo;). You&rsquo;ll be guaranteed to make more friends in Steam/Age of Steam than ever before!<br/><br/>What if Steam/Age of Steam was a truly cooperative game, like Shadows over Camelot with out a traitor? Or if no one had to die in Clue, so you could just mosey around that neat mansion talking to your friends? Or if there were no diseases in Pandemic, or no ghosts in Ghost Story? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun? Sure it would!<br/>Ted Alspach&rsquo;s *Really* Friendly Sharing is for 2 to 10 players who don&rsquo;t have some horribly recessive competitive gene.<br/><br/>In Ted Alspach&rsquo;s *Really* Friendly Sharing, you work as a team to build a railroad. Many of the aspects that cause unnecessary tension in Age of Steam have been removed, like money and the AoS auction, so you can focus on laying track, making deliveries, getting VPs and having fun!<br/><br/>The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 8 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double sided expansions. These maps can be preordered from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.beziergames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.beziergames.com</a> and will ship in October 2010. The &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; Sharing map is only available through preorders. Expansion #1: California Gold Rush &amp; Underground Railroad, Expansion #2: Amazon Rainforest and Sahara Desert and Expansion #3: Atlantis and Trisland have been previously announced.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It might be the most written about battle of all time&hellip; but tactically, it was one of Napoleon&rsquo;s worst efforts.<br/><br/>After Napoleon&rsquo;s return from Elba, he watched his peace efforts spurned and knew that four large armies would eventually invade France.  In a precarious position at home as well, he elected to move quickly, hoping for a powerful spoiling attack against the two closest armies that would rally some of his former allies and, even better, encourage the &ldquo;Seventh Coalition&rdquo; to negotiate.<br/><br/>His movements with the Arm&eacute;e du Nord shocked both Wellington and Blucher and hinted at the old brilliance of mind.  But when it came to the battles&hellip; it seemed the imagination was no longer there. Ligny was a bludgeoning match, Quatre Bras a lost opportunity and bad staff work and communications caused failure at both.  Dispensing a third of his army to &ldquo;chase Bl&uuml;cher&rdquo; (without Grouchy managing to find him), he took the rest to deal with &ldquo;the Sepoy General&rdquo; that he at least pretended to disdain.  Wellington expected a flanking attack (and 25% of his troops missed the actual battle in preparation for it). What he got was &ldquo;a pounding match.&rdquo;  Though he had claimed his troops made up &ldquo;an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff,&rdquo; they bore the brunt of the best Napoleon could throw at them for 8 hours and turned the tide.<br/><br/>And yet, it served as the completely final end to over 20 years of near-constant warfare, in one of the few periods in Western history defined by a single person&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;The Napoleonic Era.&rdquo;  And may be the most written-about battle in history.<br/><br/>Designer Ed Wimble has focused solely on the 24 hours of June 18th, 1815. Leadership and morale are key, while tactical ability and artillery bombardment are both highlighted. It is, after all, a pounding match. The game includes both basic and optional rules, with the opportunity to test some variables regarding smarter troop dispositions or operational planning, as well as giving the French the opportunity to begin the battle sooner (and deal with more severe mud).<br/><br/>The game offers a historical set-up scenario plus variants for both set up and reinforcements.  With the variants, it&rsquo;s possible that Grouchy may fully live up to Napoleon's order to pursue the Prussians and fatally delay their appearance on the battlefield!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As a wizard at the School of Sorcery, summon the powers of Orinitin, Sloankai, and Cranaj as you attempt to gain friends and influence at the school. Along with these pets come five new cards with unique powers.<br/><br/>The School of Sorcery Pet Pack includes one instruction card, three pet cards, and five new sorcery cards. The pet cards introduce a new mechanic into the game, while the five new sorcery cards--Slingshot, Icarus Stone, Flaming Sword, Curse, and Cloak--introduce new powers to the normal game.<br/><br/>To use the pet cards, place them face-up in the supply. If you play the &quot;cast no crystals&quot; card, you send a crystal to one of the pets.  If both players have a crystal on the pet card, the crystals are removed. If only one player has a crystal on a pet card, that player befriends the pet and may use the pet's power once per round. Orinitin allows you to take a crystal any time your opponent wins a card. With Sloankai, your score is increased by one for each crystal. Cranaj allows you to adjust a die up or down one pip.<br/><br/>To use the new sorcery cards, shuffle them into the deck and play normally. The three immediate use cards are Slingshot, Icarus Stone, and Flaming Sword. With Slingshot, you remove all crystals from one location (if you have fewer VPs). Icarus Stone allows you to remove one crystal from any location. After getting Flaming Sword, you flip the top card in the deck and use its power (but only if it is a one-time-use card). The two one-time-use cards include Curse and Cloak. Curse allows you to turn an opponent die to any result and Cloak allows you to remove an opponent crystal from the portal.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Both sides&rsquo; orders of battle are entirely historic within that context. Each of the eight game turns represents four days, and each large hex on the map equals 20 miles. The map runs from the Oder River on the west to the Riga-Pinsk line on the east. Units are German corps and Soviet armies. The turn sequence is I-Go-U-Go, but both players decide if their force will move and fight or fight and move. Playing time is about three hours, and is easily adapted for solitaire play. Complexity is low-medium. The German has to strike hard and fast at the beginning in order to weaken the inevitable Soviet counteroffensive.<br/><br/>World at War #82 February-March 2022<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Solo Camp Pocket is a small card game where you can enjoy a day and a half of solo camping. There are lots of activities such as using your favorite gear, cooking meals, bonfires and kayaking. Of course there is not enough time to do everything.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most fun (points) as you can while camping. You only have so much time to camp so you need to make good use of your time. All the while weather can change, accidents can occur, and things can waste away your time.<br/><br/>The game is played by dealing a 3 card hand. Activities require different amounts of time, food, and gear; all of which you must pay for from your hand. For more expensive activities, you can obtain more resources by discarding cards or carrying over cards to the next turn (where you are dealt 3 more cards). You do this until the cards run out, ending the round. 2 more rounds are played and a cumulative score is counted. Try to beat your high score!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hokm is an old trick-taking card game from Iran usually played with four players in fixed partnerships; however there are 2 and 3-player variants. It is part of the Whist family of card games and similar to spades, but there is no bidding, and trump is declared every hand.<br/><br/>The object of Hokm is to be the first team or player to win 7 points. It's the most popular card game in Iran. Deal and play are anticlockwise.<br/><br/>The word Hokm literally means &quot;command, order&quot; but in card game jargon, it's Persian for trump suit.<br/><br/>H&acirc;kem<br/>At the beginning of each hand, one of the players becomes H&acirc;kem. H&acirc;kem literally means &quot;ruler, governor&quot; and in card game jargon, it refers to a player having certain privileges in the game. In Hokm, these privileges are:<br/><br/>- To be the player who receives the first cards dealt. <br/>- To be the player who makes trump (i.e. chooses and declares what suit will be trump) for the current hand. <br/>- To be the player who leads to the first trick of the hand.<br/><br/>Players and Cards<br/>Hokm can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. If with four players, two players normally team up against the other two.<br/><br/>The game uses a standard 52-card deck. Within each suit, the cards are ranked from highest to lowest: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2<br/><br/>",

Man-Eating House is a trick taking game for 3-4 players with a theme of haunted house.<br/><br/>This game uses a deck of 44 cards, which consists of three suits (Green, Yellow, Red), and 14 ranks (1-14), plus Green 0 (Dog) and Red 15 (Old Man). Cards ranked 1-3 (with a child figure on the card), ranked 12-14 (ghost figure on the card), Dog, and Old Man are honor cards. You score points by taking these cards.<br/><br/>Each round, players play a card under trick-taking rules (must follow suit, no trumps). Basically, the player who played the highest rank, regardless of which suit, wins the trick. But there are several exceptions. One example is that if you and other player play a child of the same suit, both of you take that child card and score one point, instead of being taken by the winner of the trick.<br/><br/>In a four-player game, you win the game with your partner if your team takes honor cards more than your opponent team.<br/><br/>In a three-player game, the player who played Old Man (Red 15) competes against the other two. The Old Man wins if he captures three children of different rank or he takes 11 honor cards. Otherwise the other two players win the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>3~4人のプレイヤーがお化け屋敷の掟に従ってカードを出し合い<br/>子どもやお化けが描かれた得点札を集めるトリックテイキング・ゲーム。<br/><br/>ツタ・おふだ・骨の3スート。マストフォローでノートランプ。ランク（0～15）で決着。最も高い数字を出したプレイヤーの勝ち。※フォローできなくても<br/><br/>ただし、場に出たカードの組み合わせによっては「役」が成立し、例外的な処理が発生する。（子どもカードが2枚以上出る&rarr;「逃げる」，武器カードとお化けカードが出る&rarr;「戦う」）また、「特殊カード」が出たときは、カードのドラフトが行なわれたり、「役」の処理が打ち消されることも。<br/><br/>3人用は、骨の15のカードをプレイした1人対その他2人のチーム戦。正体隠匿要素あり。4人用は、2対2のペア戦。得点札を多く獲得したチームの勝ち。<br/><br/>",

Playing against a running clock, players move their playing pieces through the various rooms on the game board to uncover clues to who stole the precious gem. Along the way, talking animals help players solve the mystery of the stolen item with the help of a treasure chest that randomly supplies clues on behalf of the animals. Whenever players meet animals, they must feed them so the animals &mdash; that can be understood only by children &mdash; can provide the clues that advance gameplay. The clues supplied by the electronic treasure chest ensure that no two games are alike. All players must work together to find the stolen ring, and they win or lose as a group, depending on whether they can master an assigned task.<br/><br/>Wer war's?

        "description": "John Theissen&rsquo;s streamlined approach to operational warfare in the nineteenth century in games such as Hood&rsquo;s Last Gamble and Campaign of Nations has won him a number of admirers. Now he turns his attention to the last war of the Roman Republic, to the marching of Legions and the sailing of fleets, to the rise of Augustus and the fall of Marc Antony and the savvy Queen of Egypt, Cleopatra.<br/><br/>In &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; each player must raise troops and build ships, using these military forces to enact their will and conduct campaigns against the enemy. Along the way, they will face the challenges inherent in ancient warfare: the difficulty of keeping troops supplied, perilous storms at sea, the spreading of plagues, and the opportunistic assaults of Rome&rsquo;s external enemies. As the war wears on, both sides will attempt to chip away at the other&rsquo;s prestige and standing. If your prestige falls low enough, your troops and provinces might defect, tipping the balance. And should it fall to zero, you lose this high stakes battle. The winner shall rule over an empire. The loser? Well, as Octavian said before Cleopatra&rsquo;s son was strangled, two Caesars are one too many.<br/><br/>The spoils of victory and the consequences of defeat might not be quite as serious as all that when the troops are made of cardboard, but Antony and Cleopatra allows you to refight this epic contest for ultimate power in the relative safety of your home or gaming club.<br/><br/>Though somewhat more granular and detailed than Mr. Theissen&rsquo;s other games for Hollandspiele, this remains a quick, compelling, and accessible exploration of this fascinating subject.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Magenta, June 4, 1859, was the first major clash between France and Austria during the Second Italian War of Independence. Magenta 1859 recreates it using the same rules as Solferino 1859 and Reichshoffen 1870, as well as the same scale (one hour per turn, 600 meters per hex, brigades). Unlike its siblings, the game has almost no special rules.<br/><br/>Napoleon III commands the French and, though scarcely comparable to his uncle, well overmatches the Austrians' sluggish and late arriving Count Gyulai. Unfortunately for the French, Napoleon enters far away from the bulk of his forces and takes a long time to get within command range. Until then, formations may move effectively only when their commanders make successful initiative rolls, and the largest French corps suffers from an initiative penalty for the first several hours. (Its commander, General Mac Mahon, moved slowly while waiting for a Sardinian division to come up to cover his open flank. This caution did not, however, prevent him from becoming the hero of the day. The Emperor rewarded him with the title &quot;duc de Magenta&quot;.)<br/><br/>The battle starts at 10:00 a.m. and lasts 10 turns, with many brigades not arriving until the afternoon. The forces (and the map) are only about half the size of those in Solferino, and the victory conditions are simpler: Each side gets one Victory Point for each hex it holds in the town of Magenta (which has three) plus one for each demoralized enemy corps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The year 1990, the planet Earth: The world is very much like our own recent past, but with no perestroika, no glasnost, no relaxation. American presidents continue to refer to the Soviet Union as the &quot;evil empire&quot;, and the Cold War lingers on a thousand fronts throughout the world&mdash;from tiny tropical states to the headquarters of the intelligence agencies. Almost without warning, the next armed conflict erupts in the Arab East, at the center of the world's power depot. And this time, the fight is not only for how a small Persian Gulf country will live &ndash; as a socialist or capitalist state &ndash; but rather much more is at stake: control of the world's largest oil reserves!<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of The Hot War: Battle for Oil, a fascinating board game with miniatures based on Konstantin Krivenko's unique war gaming system Art of Tactic. This game puts you in command of modern troops and the powerful equipment of war in battles fought with state-of-the-art technology; it's also the first foray for the Art of Tactic system into a desert theater of operations, allowing players to explore any historical battle from the Africa campaign of Rommel to the Iraq War!<br/><br/>The Hot War: Battle for Oil starter set includes everything you need to create the first armed conflicts between the Soviet and American armies. Each side is represented by seven units: three motorized infantry platoons, two APCs, one tank, and one helicopter each. Motorized infantry units can be further customized and reinforced by machine guns, anti-tank missiles, and air defense systems. Before each battle, the commanders must choose where to position their reinforcements: Should you spread them out among your platoons, or attach everything together into one overstrengthed unit?<br/><br/>Like all Art of Tactic games, The Hot War: Battle for Oil uses specially-designed laminated cards for every unit. Each unique unit card displays all of the information a commander needs to use it in the field. The laminated coating allows players to write their orders directly on the unit card, easily cleaning them again before the next round. Players don't take turns, but instead simultaneously plot secret orders to their forces, then resolve them at the same time!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quin is an abstract tabletop strategy game, taking place in a sci-fi quantum realm.  Players control a variety of quark particles, 17 on each side, made of 9 types, each with distinct speed, powers and capture abilities.  The goal of Quin is to reach First Sight, Center, with your Light, or to capture your opponent's Light.<br/><br/>Your pieces are always faced away from your rival, making deception and memory two of the most important skills in play. Use a piece's special abilities - like Memory that swaps places with another piece, Time that can move an opposing piece backward, Peripherals that can circle the sides of the board, or Shadows that reach far and capture everything - and you risk revealing your strategy.  In Quin, your choices, and how well you know your rival, are what determine your fate.<br/><br/>The magnetic Quin board is based on a traditional grid, if you can imagine that grid warped into a circle by a black hole.  As such it is made of 5 Sight Lines, crossing the board at the center, 8 gold Rings, a Horizon Line, and the Iris.  The Iris is just 2 spaces around the center, where most pieces have to pass if they want to get to the other side, and it is a neutral zone, where powers don't work.  In the middle of it all is First Sight, Center, and the goal of the game.<br/><br/>It's only 5 moves to center, from the start, but you'll never take the same route twice.  Awaken your Memory, look out for the thief of Time, and beware the Shadows - they're far faster than Light.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Goblins are sneaky, cowardly, short-tempered creatures.  They are fearful to take up arms against anyone but can get vicious if their backs are against a wall.  They constantly feud with rival tribes for resources, land and title.  They are so devious and lazy that they would rather steal resources from a neighboring tribe than produce them on their own. They are so untrustworthy that they would rather stab someone in the back than look at them.  Welcome to the unpredictable world of King of the Goblins.<br/><br/>King of the Goblins is a game for 2-5 players in which each player represents the leader of a tribe of Goblins vying for the title, King of the Goblins.  To acquire this title, players must collect as much Gold as possible.  To collect Gold, players must do a number of things. New land must be opened up in order to build trade houses that produce different types of resources.  Resources are used to build more trade houses or traded for Gold.  In addition, powerful cards can be played to turn the tables on the other players. The tribe with the most Gold at the end of the game is the winner and the tribal leader is declared King of the Goblins.<br/><br/>",

At the height of the battle for control of New Georgia, and more specifically the reduction of the powerful Japanese airbase at Munda, the US Navy established a base for Patrol Torpedo (PT) Boats on Rendova island.  The Japanese, desperately intent on clinging to their position at Munda, were operating a steady line of supplies and troops that staged out of Rabaul.  Using barges, and Destroyers of the Tokyo Express, the Japanese poured troops and supplies down &ldquo;the Slot&rdquo;, first to Vila on Kolombangara, and then on to Munda in New Georgia.  It was the PT Boats at Rendova that were tasked the dangerous mission of patrolling each night in the Blackett Strait, where they tried to disrupt this Japanese supply line. One of the young PT-Boat skippers was 26 year old Lt. John F. Kennedy of PT 109.  This solitaire play game is based on his exploits in the South Pacific during the months of July and August 1943.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If they are unable to do so, and the demons get the upper hand, the demons will win.<br/><br/>How to play:  There are 2 main phases:<br/><br/>The Exploration phase: <br/>The starting player rolls the dice, and each player moves their character the number of spaces of the dice.  Reveal the token that you land on and resolve its effect.<br/><br/>The demon battle: <br/>Once players reach the area where the demons resides, the battle will begin.  Players choose the character they wish to fight with. Taking turns, each player attempt to battle the demon using their abilities (and sometimes dice), if they are successful they can fight the next demon.  If they are unsuccessful, the next player can attempt to defeat that demon.  Once all the demons are defeated the players win.<br/><br/>",

Roll dice, gather resources, and use the power of your character and your tableau to build a kingdom worthy of praise!<br/><br/>This game uses the same system as Magical Bakery: A Conglomerate from Today, but includes additional content in its box to allow for more variety in setups and different potential for tableau building. (Note that each game is separate, and the two games cannot be combined.) Over the course of the game, you will gather resources and use them to play cards to your tableau, earning yourself victory points and additional abilities. The game ends after one player has at least 20 VP in their tableau; the player with the most points wins the game!<br/><br/>On your turn, you will roll three dice (or four, for one character), with seven different types of actions available. Dice can be used to acquire cards from a common market to your hand or to generate resources in three different types (gold, influence, and magic). Resources and dice together can be used to play cards from your hand into your tableau, or to build a legendary card. Resources can be used on their own to refresh the market or be converted into the other resource types. And cards in your tableau can be used to generate special effects. Use a combination of luck and strategy to build an engine that will push you ahead of the other players in the game in order to bring the most renown to yourself and the kingdom.<br/><br/>Cards are Chimera size (58x90mm).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kurgill the Wizard has gone crazy. Watch out, as you and your fellow monkey climbers must escape his hazardous spells. Bananas, faeries and anvils, oh my! You never know what Kurgill will throw at you next. Only the Treetop is safe. Climb as quickly as you can, battle to knock each other down, dodge the traps, and above all, beware of the Gnome. It&rsquo;s a race to the top.<br/><br/>Monkey is a fast-paced, goofy card game where the odds are against you. It can be played with up to 4 players and even includes a solitaire mode. Each player is a monkey who starts at the bottom of the collective &ldquo;Tree.&rdquo; Four cards make up the &ldquo;Trunk&rdquo; of the Tree and three cards make up the &ldquo;Treetop.&rdquo; Each turn starts with you drawing a card into your hand from the draw pile, then flipping over the top card of the &ldquo;Spell Deck&rdquo; (usually this &ldquo;spell&rdquo; harms you, but you might get lucky!). Finally, you get two Action Points (APs) to spend during your turn. You can spend APs to draw cards, to attempt to climb up the Tree (ie. to the next position up), or to set traps to impede the progress of other players. Each Tree card (whether a Trunk or Treetop card) has a number (1-10, 15 or 20), which is colored (yellow, blue, green, red, black or multicolored). Each time a player attempts to climb a Tree card they combine cards from their hand until their sum exceeds the number on the Tree card. But there&rsquo;s a twist: color matters! If the Tree card is red, yellow, green or blue, then the player may use anything except that color in their attempt to climb. (For example, if the Tree card is a yellow 10, a player could combine a blue 6 and a green 5 to beat it. However, a player could not have used a yellow 15 to beat it since the Tree card itself was yellow and such &quot;color matching&quot; is not allowed). There are two exceptions: Black can only be beaten by black, and multicolored cards can be beaten by any cards.<br/><br/>Just when you think you have it, Kurgill the Wizard might prevent you from climbing, or even worse, might send you falling back down the Tree. The standard gameplay will keep you entertained, but in case you want to mix it up, Monkey also has three variations: &ldquo;Insane Mode,&rdquo; in which you remove the main good cards from the Spell Deck; &ldquo;Super-Tree,&rdquo; in which each player has their own Trunk to climb but a shared Treetop from which they can oust other players; and finally &ldquo;Krazy Kurgz,&rdquo; in which Kurgill the Wizard joins as an opponent to all players, to wreak havoc along with his birdie minions. Monkey is a great family game, quick to pick up, and always entertaining!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Schaumermal is a board game aimed at simulating a federation football (henceafter simply called football) match.  Each player manages a team of 11 players (10 players and a goalkeeper) on a rectangular board with the lines of a football pitch printed on it and overlaid with a grid.<br/><br/>In a regular game, the two players set up their teams (of 10 players and a goalkeeper) in their halves.  One side is nominated the home team (the other, the away team) and starts off the game.  The game is played in turns.  During each turn, the team in possession of the ball passes or kicks the ball, and moves 3 players.  The opposing team then moves 3 of its players to interfere with the other's play.  Different playing positions of the team (e.g. striker, dribblers, etc) move differently.<br/><br/>The aim of the team in possession of the ball is to put the ball into the net of the opposing team (thus scoring a goal), and its opponent aims to stop it from doing so by blocking the paths towards goal and tackling opposing players to gain possession of the ball.  Whether a ball is kicked accurately to its target location or how much it deviated off-course is determined by the roll of a die.  The results of tackles are determined by comparing dice rolls.<br/><br/>The game lasts until a pre-determined time elapses (in which case the team who has scored the most goals wins) or a team has scored a pre-determined number of goals (and wins).  The game includes rules for variants such as Hocus Pocus cards that allow players to change the events of play, customization of each individual player (introducing ability points and skills), and league play.<br/><br/>",

The puzzles are paintings of four different horses, with each in a similar setting, but in a different season.<br/><br/>The puzzle pieces are mixed and distributed facedown, with 40 pieces to each player. Each player sets up a partition to hide his pieces. The horse pictures are mixed facedown and one is dealt to each player. Each player places his picture in the holder slots of his partition; this is the puzzle that player must assemble.<br/><br/>To start the game, players turn over their pieces and begin assembling their puzzles. At any time and throughout the game, any player may offer to trade one to four puzzle pieces. When another player agrees to trade that number, they immediately trade those pieces facedown. At any time, a player may call out &ldquo;Hold Your Horses,&rdquo; and designate right, left, or across. All players must immediately pass one puzzle piece in the direction specified.<br/><br/>Trading continues until one player completes his puzzle. The game may be played by three players by removing one complete puzzle before beginning.<br/><br/>Note: This game was produced by the Springbok puzzle division of the Hallmark Card company. There is no date on either the box or the instruction sheet, so the production year is approximate. Naturally, there is no information regarding who designed the game. It was sold only through Hallmark Card dealers.<br/><br/>",

For this reason, the battle of Stalingrad in often referred to as the &quot;turning point&quot; of the World War II. But in this game, the German player has more options of command than Friedrich Paulus, the commander of German 6th Army. So the German player may conduct withdraw from Stalingrad with his troops as he chooses and may defend more effectively than the historical static situation.<br/><br/>(source: Six Angles webpage)<br/><br/>",

This series of streamlined card-assisted operational sandboxes builds on Mr. Theissen's work in titles such as More Aggressive Attitudes, Objective Shreveport, and Hood's Last Gamble. Those games had slightly different and not entirely compatible rulesets - each one needed to be learned from scratch. But titles in the new ACWOS share a common core ruleset: learn one game, and you'll know how to play the rest of them. This ruleset is flexible enough to allow each game to have its own geographic and temporal scale and Combat Results Table, as well as special event cards unique to that campaign.<br/><br/>Specific units and their strengths are hidden from your opponent as you perform a tense dance of cat-and-mouse maneuvers. When you attack your opponent, there's always a chance they might slip away - or, they might be able to concentrate additional forces, turning what you thought would be an easy victory into a near-run thing, especially if your own forces fail to coordinate. Knowing when to attack and when to hold back, when to run and when to make a stand, are paramount, and as ever, subject to the fortunes of war.<br/><br/>The subject of our first title in this series is Jackson's famous 1862 Valley Campaign, which saw him eluding and harassing three Union armies through a combination of boldness and deception. It is perhaps an ideal subject with which to debut this system with its emphasis on maneuver, bluff, and nerve.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Soccer replay/simulation game.<br/><br/>Brief outline of the game system<br/><br/>The Team Cards provide Attack and Defence Ratings, for home and away matches, for each team. Theses Ratings are based on the average number of goals scored and conceded in each match and are the built-in guarantee of accuracy of results. The respective Ratings for the two teams involved in a match are cross-referenced on a Chart to obtain a Goal Rating for each team. These Goal Ratings serve two purposes. Added together they indicate which Elapsed Time Card to use (this controls the average time lapse between potentially dangerous attacks and thus determines whether the match will be high or low scoring), and when cross-referenced against each other produce the number of the Match Card applicable, this Card providing, on average, the correct ratio of attacks between the home and away team. Five dice are used to re-create, with the help of the twenty Action Cards, the important moves in the match. No attempt has been made to simulate every pass and tackle, the game concentrates only on the decisive moves, the &lsquo;highlights&rsquo; of the game. This action is controlled on the Stadium Card which incorporates a playing pitch containing a Mid-Field and twenty lettered Attack Zones for each team and a Defence State Track on which is recorded the current &lsquo;tightness of each team&rsquo;s defence.<br/><br/>Each Action Card lists six attacking options and used in conjunction with the dice rolls determines the development or break down of each attack. The Goal Attempt Cards come into play when a scoring chance occurs but the result of such attempts depend to a large degree on the current state of the opponent&rsquo;s Defence which will need to be probed and confused by the build-up preceding the shot or header at goal.<br/><br/>The Team Cards also show the team&rsquo;s line-up and substitutes, and this is used to keep track of the player currently in possession, receiving or intercepting a pass, committing a foul, etc. etc. Finally, the Timing Chart is used to record the passage of time and to trigger off &lsquo;tactical options&rsquo; which can result in players being pushed forward or pulled back depending on the state of the game. The Referee&rsquo;s Card is consulted in the event of fouls to decide if disciplinary action is taken against the offender, and this also incorporates the Short handed Chart and Substitution Chart.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are leading a guild of adventuring wizards through the Infinite Forest on a quest to find the magical Crystals of Power. If you can collect all four crystals, your guild will be the mightiest in the land.<br/>The Infinite Forest is a dark and mysterious place. Suddenly you emerge into a sun-drenched clearing and your eyes fall upon a fantastical building. At Last... Crystal Hall.<br/>You approach with caution and the doors slowly creak open. Before you is a glittering chamber and the very air seems to shimmer with magic. You sigh with relief ... until you see a host of other figures wearing brightly coloured hats and you realise: The battle for the Crystals has begun!<br/><br/>Crystal Hall is the magical strategy game that encourages players to lead their wizard-shaped counters around the hall in a quest to uncover the four magical crystals that are hidden among the 36 face-down tiles. To win the game, you need to collect 4 Crystals of Power, each of a different color. To do so, you must position your wizards so that they are on a tile showing a Crystal of Power at the start of your turn.<br/><br/>Each turn is comprised of 4 phases: Gather, Magic, Discovery and Draw. In the Magic Phase, you are given 4 units of Magic Power which you can use to move your wizards and attack others. Certain magic tiles can increase or reduce this total.<br/><br/>During the game, wizards flip a multitude of magic tiles to discover curses, potions, spells, Crystals of Power and other surprises. During the Draw Phase, you get a spell card, which can help you with your quest.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to be the most powerful wizard in the Crystal Hall?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "信仰通貨 (The Faith Of Currencies) is a game from Japan, where players are currency traders trying to maximise their wealth. But the value of the currency depends on how much faith each trader has in the religions. Players are trying to promote the worship of one deity, whilst also preparing to switch allegiances if the deity falls from favour.<br/><br/>The game has a market board to show the relative exchange rates, and a track board to show how the faith is fluctuating, using small cubes for each religion (the rulebook is called Prayer's Guide).<br/><br/>There is a deck of cards which is used to calculate the player's score at the end of the game. At the start of the game, two cards are dealt up to move two prices. Then the deck is shuffled and players are dealt three cards. Four more cards are dealt up to form a draft.<br/><br/>The game has a huge stack of crisp bank notes, beautifully illustrated in the style of real banknotes, to represent each religion. The Esoteric Order Of Dagon is the US dollar, and the Euro (Zeus), Yen (Amariti) and Yuan (Communism) are also used, along with a Flying Spaghetti Monster coin (banknote). The backs of the notes are blanked, so players cannot know what anybody is holding. Players are dealt two notes of each of the five types at the start.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of rounds, one more than the number of players. In a round, a player may trade currencies with the bank, or change their faith, or adjust the market prices.<br/><br/>When a player trades currencies, they sell what they want from their supply and buy from the bank at the current rates. The number of banknotes exchanged then alters the faith in each currency.<br/><br/>For example, a player might sell 2 Communism at 12 each, and buy 3 Amariti at 8 each. This moves the Communism cube along the faith track two places, and the Amariti cube moves three places. The Communism cube is now on a +1 space, so the price rises to 13. The Amariti cube is now on a +/-2 space, so the player can move the price up or down two places, for example up to 10.<br/><br/>Moving these cubes triggers the round ending. When a faith cube has lapped and reached its starting point, the day's trading ends and a new round starts.<br/><br/>A player can change their faith by discarding and drawing cards from the open supply or the top of the deck. Each religious card shows an effect on the value, dependent on the number of cards held (1,2 or 3). The value of the religion is based upon different factors, such as how much the price is, or how much total currency is held, or for the FSM, how many sets of notes you can form.<br/><br/>The final action a player can take is simply to move a faith cube, and adjust the market price accordingly.<br/><br/>Players continue to take turns carrying out these actions, until the round ends, and after the final round ends, players calculate their scores. A player's score depends on how many of which faith card they hold, and the relative prices, and how many banknotes they hold. Once calculated, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>By the open trading of banknotes and open adjusting of prices, other player's might deduce what hidden faith cards a player holds. But a player could be bluffing and trying to manipulate the market whilst holding different faiths in their hand. As the market develops, a player will want to switch their faith to maximise their final score.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Although the object of the game is to be the only player left on the board, the game encourages players to conquer large areas, build empires, manipulate up to date military equipment, and enter into political conspiracies with each other that are similar to those going on in our present day world (1985).<br/><br/>The 32.00&rdquo; by 48.00&rdquo; plastic game board consists of 55 water areas and 50 countries divided into seven groups or &ldquo;regions.&rdquo; Each player is provided with plastic playing pieces consisting of 60 cities, 12 jet aircraft, 12 tanks, 6 nuclear plants with cooling towers, 9 oil derricks, 3 Trident submarines, 3 New Jersey Class battleships, 3 Nimitz Class Nuclear Aircraft Carriers, 5 small &ldquo;#2&rdquo; silver missiles, 4 large &ldquo;#5&rdquo; gold missiles, and one black &ldquo;Infinity Missile&rdquo; (looks like an old fashioned Atom Bomb).<br/><br/>Also provided are 9 custom made black dice, five &ldquo;Chopping Blocks&rdquo; (for keeping track of dice rolls), 56 colored and numbered chips (one for each country and six wild card), a chip value counter, 5 &ldquo;extra turn&rdquo; chips, 75 miniature plastic mushroom clouds (hydrogen bombs), 50 Act of God cards, and a rule book.<br/><br/>Turn order is determined by relative game position. Dice are used for resolving attacks and have symbols on them instead of numbers. Whenever you rolled mushroom clouds on all the dice you were rolling you draw an 'Act of God' card, which adds and destroys pieces and other factors. The most attractive part of the game is the custom made plaster mushroom clouds, 75 of which are included with the basic set, to keep the game&rsquo;s name true to meaning.<br/><br/>Available expansion kits include; Cruise Missiles, &ldquo;#8&rdquo; Missiles, Air Transports, Capitols, Spies, and Dictators. There are also custom made &ldquo;War Room&rdquo; sets, and &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; sets with standard cardboard counter pieces available. Pieces of the game and player part sets are all individually available, and customer specified (custom) colors for playing pieces are offered as well.<br/><br/>",

Prismatic cards are creatures of divine light; each card has two magical abilities.<br/><br/>The Prismatic Pack contains the cards of light, the healers and protectors of the Emberverse. The cards are all designed to protect play, to mitigate card effects and card loss. All the standard cards have two powers - a first in the Ember universe.<br/><br/>Three of the Prismatic cards provide 0 VP (Victory Points) on their own, but their VP are instead dependent on the cards you have in play.<br/><br/>Then you have Iridia, the Elemental Prismatic Dragon, whose powers focus on protection, of increasing your powers, and defending your forces against the powers of the Spectral. Each Elemental Dragon has an legendary power which can be used if you control all three parts of that dragon, in this case, Irridia's ability allows you to give a creature you control +1 VP whenever any other player modifies a creature with a +1 VP or -1VP token.

        "description": "Storm in the East: Operation Barbarossa depicts the largest and most dramatic military campaign in recorded history: the German invasion of Soviet Russia. Germany and its allies had almost five million men deployed in three army groups along the 800 miles of the Soviet border. As dawn broke on 22 June 1941, the first Axis formations crossed into the Soviet Union and smashed through units charged with defending the border. Taken completely by surprise, many were captured or killed while asleep in their barracks.  As the dawn bled into a new day, the Luftwaffe bombed airfields in western Russia destroying much of the Soviet air force on the ground, and German bombers attacked cities from Riga in the north to Odessa in the south.<br/> The invasion had achieved a total strategic surprise. At first, Stalin and the Soviet High Command were in a state of denial.  It was many hours before they accepted the reality of the situation and started issuing orders allowing local commanders to re-group and mount counterattacks.  Their paralysis only added to the chaos and confusion of the Soviet units at the front. It looked as though Hitler&rsquo;s confident prophesy to his generals was going to be realised: &ldquo;You have only to kick in the door, and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.&rdquo; <br/>​<br/>But it didn&rsquo;t. Four months later, the Soviets were still fighting tenaciously and the character of the war had changed. In sight of Moscow, the Axis blitzkrieg had run its course: a war of manoeuvre and mobility had become war of attrition; a bloody slog as autumnal rains heralded rasputitsa and roads became quagmires. The vision of a rapid victory envisaged by Hitler had vanished.  <br/>  <br/>The historical outcome of Operation Barbarossa was the consequence of fateful decisions and extraneous events which conspired to produce a campaign unsurpassed in drama or scale.  We hope Storm in the East: Operation Barbarossa does justice to History by presenting players with  difficult strategic problems and choices which faced the Axis and Soviet High Commands, and to Reality by demonstrating that the historical result was only one of a number of equally plausible outcomes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1846, the Donner Party got snowbound in the High Sierras. Only half survived the winter. Who will you eat to be one of them?<br/><br/>Each player has a family of settlers (color coded), and a few hirelings or settlers outside that family. While individually named, all of these actually represent several people (you are not playing all 81 settlers).<br/><br/>You get points for each settler you have alive at the end of the game, with bonus points for healthy settlers, oldest settler, youngest settler and an intact family. Things you do in the game cause you to accumulate &quot;Shame&quot;, which are cards with random values that you draw but do not look at, and whoever has the highest Shame at the end of the game loses, regardless of their score.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in rounds, moving through a chronologically stacked Forage deck that represents the winter of 1846. Each round a player has a personal forage step, and then there is a group forage step. In the latter, players bid to acquire extra food and the bid is how much Shame they are willing to draw to get that food. The number of group forage cards available in a turn is always less than the number of players, so someone gets left out every time. Additionally one of the group forage cards is dealt face-down, so you do not know what it is. Ties in bidding are broken by the party leader, a role which rotates around the table. Players who do not get a forage card in the group step get to draw an Action card instead.<br/><br/>Then, everyone feeds their settlers, with weakened settlers costing less food than healthy ones. But weakened ones also do not forage as well. Losses from hunger have to follow a few simple rules, like none of your settlers can starve to death until all of them are weakened.<br/><br/>In addition to forage, there are action cards that players can acquire through the foraging process. These are the nasty things like murder and grave robbing and such. These can be played at any time and generally give you food, but unlike Forage cards, have an inherent Shame cost to play them.<br/><br/>This process continues until either the Forage deck empties or the &quot;final rescue&quot; card is drawn during March 1847. Since some cards are randomly removed from each game before play, you never know exactly when the game will end or what the weather will be and thus cannot plan for it.<br/><br/>",

Make a perfect match of both number and color to feel the thrill and gain the rewards of an Ultimatch!<br/><br/>Ultimatch includes both public and private cards and requires the kind of clever decision making about when to use cards that seasoned card players enjoy. Silently trading 1 card facedown with 1 other player keeps all players engaged throughout, introduces a push-your-luck element, and calls on players to read each other. Will you risk trading a card with another player? If so, who is likely to know what you need? Is your card better to keep for later use? The thinking goes quickly as do the turns.

The rules simulate nearly all details of a soccer game including ball possession and passing, throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks.<br/><br/>The SuperFooty Classic Edition contains the cloth playing field, two complete teams (10 outfielders and 1 goalkeeper, each), two goals with nets, two balls, and instructions.  Figures are hand painted in the colors of Argentina, Brazil, England, or Italy.<br/><br/>From the game insert:<br/><br/>SuperFooty is a skillful and exciting table soccer game for two players.  Great technique, clever tactics and quick thinking make for the closest simulation of real soccer around!<br/><br/>SuperFooty is for friends, for families, and for the most passionate there are National and World Championships for boys, girls, men, and women.<br/><br/>Are you up to the challenge?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Objective Munich: 7 Days to the Rhine, Volume 2 is a two-player alternative history wargame intended to investigate the operational parameters that would have been in place during the first four days of fighting in that border area of West Germany had the Soviet Union decided to try to attack sometime in the early 1980s. It was during that timeframe the Warsaw Pact achieved a possible decisive &ldquo;correlation of forces&rdquo; between their militaries and those of the West.<br/><br/>This game is the second volume of the AFCENT (Allied Forces Central Europe) Series. Each single-volume game uses the same system and will be playable alone or mated to other games in the series. Each hexagon on the map represents 2.5 miles (four kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Warsaw Pact regiments, while the units of maneuver on the NATO side are battalions. Air power and electronic warfare counters and rules abstractly represent, the effects of one side or the other gaining temporary superiority within those sub-realms of conflict. Each day of real time consists of one nighttime and two daylight turns.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map on one sheet &amp; 280 counters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dead Apocalypse is one of the first fully cooperative deckbuilding games of strategic survival, set during a present day zombie apocalypse. Staying alive is your only goal in this game, and you must work with your allies to search for human survivors, abandoned locations, and lifesaving equipment to fend off the zombie horde.  Teamwork is the key to victory, for if you can't trust your fellow players none of you will reach the CDC... alive!<br/><br/>Dead Apocalypse is a fully cooperative deckbuilding game, meaning all players strive for the same goal and either win together or lose together. Players will begin the game with the same starting decks consisting of a handful of survivors, a base camp location and some equipment. Players will take turns playing their hand to gain damage, occupy locations, use abilities and cure infections. Gaining damage allows the player to defeat ghastly Zombies who are protecting invaluable equipment, or surrounding a location, or even trapping other survivors. Once a Zombie is defeated, add the resources to your personal deck to be used for another turn. Though don't think Zombies will go down without a fight. The Zombie stack of cards holds surprise attack events which will force a player to have to defeat Zombies that match the type of event. If a player does not have the sufficient resources to defeat all Zombies, other players have the opportunity to assist in combat to help even the odds!<br/><br/>Dead Apocalypse is  1-4 players so if there isn't someone in your company you still have the opportunity to try to fight for survival all alone. Don't fret though because there are other game variants for those seeking an easier game or a more competitive game.<br/><br/>",

Included on the mapsheet are: the Game Turn Track; Terrain Effects Chart; a 4-Part Impulse Track; the &quot;Mountain BOX&quot;; the &quot;Saltillo BOX&quot;; 2-Gun Fire Tables(Case &amp; Ball); a Small Arms Fire Table; a Fire Value Modifiers Table; and a Morale Modifiers Table.<br/><br/>The game Counters are GREEN with large WHITE Unit Symbols and BLACK print for the Mexicans &amp; BLUE with large WHITE Unit Symbols and BLACK print for the Americans. There are also informational counters in both GREEN &amp; BLUE colors as well as WHITE with BLACK print.<br/><br/>The scale of the game is 90 yards across for each hex, a Strength Point represents 25 Men or 1 Gun, and a Turn equals 20 Minutes split into (4)-5 minute impulses. A Game Turn Sequence consists of the following: 1.RAIN phase(only on Turns 27 through 31); 2.1st Impulse-a)Reinforcement phase, b)Command phase, c)Cavalry Charge Initiation phase, d)Tactical Movement phase, e)Charge phase, f)Simultaneous Fire phase, g)Shock phase followed by 3 MORE similar Impulses as the latter detailed previously. Once the 4 Impulses are completed, then there is a Strategic Movement phase, a Rally phase, and a Mountain Skirmish phase rounding out the Turn. It is during the Command phase that Players will write out and conduct activation of their Orders, which require a certain number of Impulses before they arrive at their intended destinations.<br/><br/>The Rules go into details such as Sighting, Force Marching, Multi-hex Units(line extension), Stacking, Facing, Formations, detaching Rifle Companies(U.S. only), Attacking in the Mountain &amp; Saltillo Boxes, Casualty marking, Ammunition depletion, Routing, Rallying, Special Rules such as RAIN, Mexican Units besieging Saltillo and their conditional release as well as the American's Forces there, Optional Units, and Resupplied Mexican Forces continuing the battle beyond the &quot;actual&quot; time limits. There are 2 Scenarios: 1.February 23, 1847 starting turn 10 to turn 40; &amp; 2.February 22 &amp; 23, 1847--40 turns long beginning with turn 1. An extensive Historical Notes is written up accompanying this with Bibliography &amp; designer's notes and an Example of play with commentary.<br/><br/>This appears to be another attempt at introducing a &quot;miniatures&quot; based concepts &amp; game mechanics into a conventional cardboard counters game. Although the thought processes involved are more adept at producing the desired effects of delayed Orders implementation than some previous games, only devoted wargamers could adequately appreciate this facet of play. This is definitely NOT for the casual wargamer, but more for the dedicated Historical &quot;feel&quot; for the era enthusiast.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Down with the Empire is a game that uses a common theme of science-fiction sagas: A Stellar Empire that has gone rotten, and a rebellion that rises to bring it down. It is primarily a two-player game, although it is possible to have more than one player per side by dividing forces or tasks. The game can also be played solitaire. The game system is inspired in the old Freedom in the Galaxy game from SPI.<br/><br/>There are two major factions in the game, each controlled by a player. The Stellar Empire owns everything at start, and strives to maintain the status quo through its military might. The Rebel Concordance player owns nothing but a few characters and spaceships at start, but by causing unrest and rebellion throughout the Empire, he hopes to get resources that will allow him or her eventually to meet the Empire on equal terms.<br/><br/>The game presents you with action at very different scopes. First, you have to administer 50+ planets on a grand-strategic scale, with social, economic and political aspects that are tightly intertwined and can be handled in very different styles.<br/><br/>Then you will be in charge of large military units; starfleets formed by individual starships ranging from tiny fighters to mammoth battlestars, and ground units (legions, brigades and divisions) to slug it out on planet surfaces. War in space is a very complex affair, since you can't establish battle lines or prevent the enemy from hyperjumping to any location on the map&hellip; He who defends everything defends nothing, goes the maxim, and quick response is the key to victory.<br/><br/>Finally, the heart and soul of DWTE are the individual characters. As in all great space adventures, the huge starships may bumble about, but they do not determine the fate of the rebellion saga as much as the astounding contributions of a handful of heroes. The characters perform missions through which they hope to sway the people to join and support their cause, undermine the plans of the enemy and further their own side's goals. During the missions characters face all sorts of dangers, including firefights with lasers blazing against enemy soldiers or monsters, cantina brawls with unruly civilians, getting lost in wormholes, or such everyday occurrences as meteorites falling on your head!<br/><br/>Key Points:<br/>A grand-scale science-fiction strategy game, which at the same time has a very detailed combat system with individual spaceships and ground military units, and a role-playing aspect with individual characters performing heroic deeds.<br/><br/>The wide variety of events in the game and the ramifications derived from players' choices and styles of play ensure that no two games will play alike.<br/><br/>It is a large game with a moderately high level of complexity, but once the rules are learned the game itself flows easily and the on-map counter density is not high.<br/><br/>Component List:<br/>Full-color Stellar map<br/>Full-color Rebel and Imperial Starfleet Displays<br/>Over 1,400 counters<br/>Over 200 Character, Item and Stellar Event cards<br/>4 sheets of Charts and Tables<br/>Campaign Scenario<br/>108 page Rules manual<br/>20-, 10- and 6-sided dice (not provided) are necessary for the PDF version of the game<br/><br/>Target Audience:<br/>DWTE appeals especially to SF-buffs with an interest in space adventures and sagas, although its fascinating game system will be interesting and challenging for any gamer. The rules are written in a clear language with extensive explanations and examples of play. They have a logical, easily-referenced order and should not present any special difficulty even for inexperienced players.<br/><br/>Game Formats:<br/>Virtual Tabletop<br/>PDF Download<br/><br/>What is a Virtual Tabletop Game? <br/>Our line of Virtual Tabletop games are powered by the Vassal Engine.<br/><br/>",

It is a turn-based boardgame that also can be played as a simple role playing game. The game takes place in a tavern where ten characters attempt to complete given objectives, usually to kill some other character. The game looks rather simple, it includes rules for combat and movement, but can often produce absurd and very entertaining situations.<br/><br/>The game was re-published in Roleplayer Independent (Volume 1, Issue 12 - Nov 1993).<br/><br/>The game can now be downloaded for free from Project Aon.<br/><br/>",

Each player also receives one of eight coded Assignments, which is decoded in the spy's Passport. The combination of the Secret Assignment with the Secret Identity determines how each player can win the game.<br/>Secret Assignments are to gather specific Secret Cards (ie. Missile Secrets, Political Secrets, Computer Secrets, Trade Secrets etc) and smuggle them out of each game by combining them with various Smuggle Cards (Dead Drop, Diplomatic Pouch, Radio Transmission). Assignments carry varying rewards based upon their difficulty.<br/>Depending on their Secret Identity traits, spies may also steal cards from each other, set bombs as traps, kill each other with Dagger Cards, expose other spies identities and/or assignments, or place them in detention in attempting to be the first spy to complete his or her Secret Mission.<br/>Due to the many various combinations of Identities with Assignments, the game is constantly presenting new and different possibilities for players and has great replay value.<br/>A player wins the game by being the first spy to complete his or her Secret Mission. Multiple hands can be played successively, constituting the Great Game.<br/>Source: Publisher Statement<br/><br/>",

Each loop you help to build will gain points for other players too, so some network blocking/redirecting strategy will be needed to make sure you come out on top.<br/><br/>Suggestions are included for team play and for family gaming.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this two player deduction, trick-taking card game players take it in turns to play Detective Graves and the Mysterious Mastermind who is planning to commit the crime of the century. Detective Graves must uncover the clues that will lead to the elimination of suspects and reveal the identity of the mastermind behind the plot.<br/><br/>Game play takes place over five locations, players take it in turns to play cards from five different suits and after a certain number of turns in a location the player with the highest score wins, either providing a clue towards the identity of the Mastermind (points for the Detective Player) or resulting in that particular piece of evidence being lost forever (Points for the Mastermind player).  Some cards may also be used for special abilities, but they often must be discarded to achieve this.<br/><br/>The game is played over two sets, each player taking one turn as Detective Graves and one as The Mastermind.  Points are scored for collecting/protecting evidence and correctly deducing who the Mastermind is. The player with the highest score at the end of the two sets is the winner!<br/><br/>All files are available in the file section.  There are tokens that can be printed out in the Gallery.<br/><br/>",

The game is played in five regular rounds plus a column round. Each regular round is divided in two phases.<br/><br/>In first phase, called &quot;assaig&quot; (something like &quot;erzatz&quot;), cards are dealed and traded until most players have assembled enought cards to build a human tower.<br/><br/>Then a new phase called &quot;a pla&ccedil;a&quot; (literally &quot;to the square&quot;, but it means performing), each player must perform the towers by using the dice : thay have to roll over difficulty of their tower to build the tower, and if the tower is succeful, they score a &quot;trial&quot; token and can try to &quot;unbuild&quot; the tower. The trial tokens earned in past rounds can be exchanged for rerolls. Each round has a scoring process : first player to complete a tower, succesful builds and unbuilds score points according with the difficulty of the tower. After the five regular rounds are played, players can try to build human columns (called &quot;pilars&quot;) with excess trial tokens and score points according to column difficulty.<br/><br/>The player that scores most points, adding score of all rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>",

You must tackle this fixer-upper before you can move in. Protect the historical features and cover up the worst of the blemishes to gain the most points.<br/><br/>One player rolls two dice. Play is simultaneous. Each<br/>player plays at the same time on their own scoresheet. Each player chooses how to use the two dice. Other players may make other decisions.<br/><br/>One die shows the location (area) for the construction while the other shows the shape of the area that can be renovated.<br/><br/>Each player fills in their chosen shape type within their selected area. Players should aim to cover the squares containing the triangles and leave the squares containing the circles uncovered.<br/><br/>If you can't draw a shape, you must cross off a 'no throw' box. The game ends when someone has crossed off all three of their 'no throw' boxes. The player who is furthest through their renovation wins.<br/><br/>You just need 2 dice and a pen. To play, you write directly onto the scoresheet.<br/><br/>Any number of players can play the game. Palatial is also ideal for playing online via videoconferencing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Using the dice pool we perform a number of actions: increase the amount of water and oxygen, raise the temperature, extract resources, build colonies, explore the planet and plan scientific discoveries. Very complex mechanics in very simple rules.<br/><br/>Each turn we roll a pool of D6 dice. We then use them to trigger various actions on the playing field.Each active area in the game requires the use of dice of a certain value (e.g. discovering an invention of dice 5 and 6) and sometimes additional elements. In the game we use 2 types of add-ons: inventions (that we have to discover) and raw materials that we have to extract on the game map (by drawing an appropriate shape). We can also build a base (which we also draw so that it doesn't occupy the same place with the mines) and explore the surface of the planet using the rover. The most expensive (but also bringing the most points) element is to build an observatory. After 8 game turns we count the points and the player with the highest sum.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In the process, they discover more and more animal characteristics and abilities. Players discover the different characteristics and abilities of the animals to figure out which animals are being searched for on the puzzle cards.<br/><br/>The puzzle cards in the game each depict four animals and four traits, with all traits always applying to only one of the animals depicted. At the beginning of the round, the traits are covered with a marker. A player can make a trait available to all or - once per game - to himself alone. Afterwards, players can make a guess as to which animal the already visible properties apply to. Once a player has guessed, the player is out for the round. After the fourth hint at the latest, everyone must have guessed. All players who have guessed correctly receive points according to the difficulty of the puzzle card and advance accordingly many spaces on a track. When a player has gone around the track once, the game ends and that player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Following Dewey's naval victory, US Officials negotiated with Spain over the surrender of the Philippine capital, Manila, while simultaneously negotiating Filipino independence with Aguinaldo. When US forces occupied Manila, Aguanildo's own larger, and initially better armed veteran force squared off with McKinley's expeditionary force. There followed four years of &quot;official hostilities&quot; (Guerrilla activities dragged on for more than a decade after McKinley declared end to the war). Hostilities raged across the central island of Luzon and several other major island. After Aguinaldo's capture, his regular forces melted into the bush and US troops faced its first major guerrilla war in the Pacific. As with later foreign adventures, it was not a popular war at home.<br/><br/>Amigos and Insurrectos is an area movement game for two players (a US and a Filipino player). Three scenarios will be offered: an eight turn - STAND UP FIGHT, represents the clash of regular forces; an eight turn - INTO THE BUSH, representing the guerrilla phase of the conflict, and a 15 turn CAMPAIGN GAME, combining both. Regular forces will be represented on the regimental level. Abstract jungle movement will be available through guerrilla movement boxes and movement between islands will be possible though trans-island boxes. Originally designed as a Card-Driven game, random historical events will occur based on objective and turn based triggers. Victory will be based on a point swing track that in the extreme, could see Filipino collapse or US withdrawal. This is a topic shown very little attention in the gaming hobby. Luckily, Olivier has seen fit to feature it in the upcoming issue #11 of BATTLES MAGAZINE.<br/><br/>",

Multiple climbing routes and ten different mountain sides result in over twenty million game combinations.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves players rolling dice to determine weather and climbing conditions, trading with other players to obtain climbing gear, and selling the climbing gear to purchase special upgrades. Upgrades can increase climbing efficiency, change climbing conditions, sabotage other players, and even pay for helicopter flights to another place on the mountain. As players climb, they mark where they have been, resulting in the mountain displaying their trail and potentially blocking other players from climbing in that area.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to finish all of the climbing routes and place as many route markers on the mountain as possible. This earns climbing points, with the player having the most climbing points winning the game.<br/><br/>",

These are fights that, had they concluded differently, might well have transformed a campaign, a reputation, or both. So, while the battles in Huzzah! were little more than a scrimmage when compared to, say, Gettysburg or Stones River, they were not insignificant, bearing weight well beyond what mere numbers suggest.<br/><br/>This game is the first installment of what will become a series of games using the Huzzah! system. The next installment in the series will be Wilderness, in quadri-game form but which will come together in one big campaign game.<br/><br/>Scale: Combat units are Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery. Each Infantry and Cavalry unit represents 3 or more companies of a given regiment. Each Artillery unit represents an Artillery Section of 1 or two guns. Leader units represent individual commanders. Each hex equals about 150-200 yards.<br/><br/>Stephenson's Depot was a prelude to the battle of Gettysburg. Richard Ewell enjoyed his finest day of the campaign when he smashed the isolated outpost of Robert Milroy at Winchester. This is a rock-em sock-em affair, with the Yankees throwing the first punch. The blue player must land his blows quick and hard, driving the Rebs off the railway.<br/><br/>Rosey and the Woodpecker, the battle of Iuka, was a meeting engagement of sorts; few units begin on map and both sides receive a steady stream of reinforcements. Grant, the Yankee commander had divided his army into wings, each to simultaneously converge upon the rebels at the small railhead of Iuka.<br/><br/>Old Burn at Newbern, the battle of Newbern, North Carolina. A promising young star of the Union, Ambrose Burnside (Old Burn to his equals) runs up against a scratch force of Confederate militia, artillery, and cavalry.<br/><br/>Smash 'Em Up! the battle of Belmont Missouri, was U.S. Grant's first significant encounter with the Confederate Army. He initially drove the Rebels across the Mississippi River capturing both their headquarters and Belmont, a minor ferry point to Kentucky.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>4 17x22 Full Color Maps<br/>560 Half-Inch Counters<br/>1 Rules Book<br/>2 Sheets of Charts &amp; Tables<br/>Dice<br/>Game Box<br/><br/>",

It was developed by Ian Richard for the 24 Hour Contest in November 2012.<br/><br/>Cards are divided into Cultists (numbered cards), Horrors (royal cards), and Planetary Alignments (aces). Each suit represents a different cult trying to summon an Elder God.<br/><br/>Each round of gameplay proceeds in two phases, drawing a card and placing it within its respective cult and engaging in combat with dice. Cultists may be defeated by corresponding numerical combinations of dice. Horrors must be resolved first and require special dice combinations. An additional card is drawn for each Planetary Alignment that comes into play. Defeated cards serve as trophies that may be traded for artifacts and spells that improve the chances of success.<br/><br/>The game ends if five Cultists of any suit come into play at the same time to summon an Elder God or you successfully play all cards in the deck while preventing this from happening.<br/><br/>",

Together, we can protect the ocean by defending the frontline.<br/><br/>Within a game, all players must work together to survive through 6 rounds, preventing the overwhelming amount of garbage from the city floating to the ocean. There are 4 phases in each round:<br/><br/>1. Setup Phase: At the beginning of each round, setup Garbage Tiles according to Round Cards.<br/><br/>2. Planning Phase: Players place all their meeples along the River or on faceup Enhancement Cards at the same time. Each card can only have one meeple on it.<br/><br/>3. Action Phase: After placing all the players&rsquo; meeples, perform the following actions in order:<br/><br/>a. Eco Movement: Each meeple placed on a faceup Enhancement Card can acquire the card. Enhancement Cards can be used during the Trash Cleanup period.<br/>b. Garbage Cleanup: Each meeple along the River will have a chance to clean up a Garbage Tile with a dice roll. Starting from River Section A, roll the die if there&rsquo;s a meeple, and choose a garbage to be fully cleaned  (cleared) or reduced (flip over). Retrieve the meeple after each cleanup.<br/>c. If there are any Ocean Vacuums activated, use their functions after Garbage Cleanup.<br/><br/>4. River Flow: All remaining Garbage Tiles from River Section A goes into the Garbage Island.

        "description": "Naval Wargames Rules Fleet Action 1000 B.C. to 500 A.D. are ancient naval wargaming rules that are simplified enough to allow for large fleet actions using model ships.<br/><br/>The ships range from small open galleys to large Hellenistic-era &quot;16s&quot; (sixteen men per oar--the dreadnoughts of their time). Ship models are organized in squadrons of varying size. Each ship is rated by speed, ramming factor, and boarding factor. Ship's speed is also affected by crew quality.<br/><br/>The game is played on an area marked off by hexagons or offset rectangles. Terrain can be added in the form of coastline or rocks (or perhaps a Scylla and Charybdis).<br/><br/>Movement can be by oar, sail, or boat-sail. Each type of propulsion has its own pluses and minuses. Moving by oars can tire your crews, but moving by sail makes you subject to the wind--also, having a sail aboard your boats can be a negative for taking reaction tests (have sail, will sail away).<br/><br/>The action is pretty fast when ships start crunching together. The rules for ramming are simple and deadly. Boarding actions can be affected by the use of towers or &quot;ferrea manus&quot; (grappling devices such as the Roman corvus). Some ships may have war engines that can kill crew and reduce an opponent's boarding factor.<br/><br/>Once a squadron starts losing ships, it may be forced to retire by a negative Reaction Test result.<br/><br/>There isn't much &quot;chrome&quot; in these rules. Players wanting more detail on ship handling and employing ancient naval tactics (like the deikplous), should use a different set of rules. However, for gaming an action that involves a large number of ships, these rules allow fast play and a game resolution in a reasonable amount of time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Polemos project sets out to create a series of rules sharing a basic structure, yet that are carefully tailored for specific historical periods. You do not wish to fight an American Civil War battle and be forced to use concepts designed for the English Civil War, and we don't want to produce bland mechanics devoid of any period flavor or distinction. Polemos rulebooks now include The Great Northern War, English Civil War, and War of Spanish Succession, in addition to the new Napoleonic rules.<br/><br/>If ever there is an historical period that can lay claim to be THE classic subject for wargamers, then surely it must be those early years of the nineteenth century when Europe was gripped by the power of Napoleon Bonaparte, self-crowned Emperor of France and her conquered territories. A sublime hero to some, a tyrannical despot to others, Napoleon is a man who can still inspire great passions and emotions amongst his supporters and detractors alike.<br/><br/>The Emperor of France demonstrated his mastery of warfare in a period where the infantry were armed with smooth bore muzzle-loading muskets and the mounted arm could indulge in dashing charges with cold steel in hand. The armies were vast and the scale of the battles epic.<br/><br/>There was a great deal of variety in the size of Napoleonic battles. the French army that fought at Wagram was ten times the size of that which fought at Vimiero. It is a lot to ask of any single;e set of rules to cope with such diversity.<br/><br/>Polemos Napoleonic Wars is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, General De Division will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Marechel de L'Empire will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period, so he can emulate Bonaparte at Borodino, Wellington at Waterloo or Blucher at Leipzig.<br/><br/>The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal; only the nominal scale will differ.<br/><br/>Polemos:Napoleonic Wars is aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Basing and Representation<br/><br/>The basic unit of maneuver in Polemos Napoleonic is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected. The 'official' base size is<br/><br/>In General De Division<br/><br/>A base of infantry represents an infantry battalion - about 4-800 men.<br/><br/>A base of cavalry represents a regiment or two to three squadrons.<br/><br/>An artillery base represents a company or battery of 6 &ndash; 8 guns.<br/><br/>In Part Two &ndash; Marechal de l&rsquo;Empire, square bases are used. These can be formed by using two General de Brigade bases, butted up one behind the other.<br/><br/>Generals are placed on bases 30mm square. The higher the status of the general, the more aides, hangers-on, lackeys, etc he can have on his base.<br/><br/>Messengers may be depicted by a single mounted figure on a small base<br/><br/>All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.<br/><br/>This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no re-basing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organized on this basis.<br/><br/>",

The players sit at the corner of the board showing their respective icon.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. At the start of each round players reveal 1 to 4 stones of their color simultaneously. The number of revealed stones decides the order in which both players place their stones on the board.<br/><br/>The player do not have a lot of choice when placing their stones since new stones must be placed in the current row - meaning: the row where the last stone was placed in the previous round. Only after the current row is filled completely the active player may select a new row by placing a stone at the edge of the board.<br/><br/>It is much more important to foresee the order in which stones are placed since the resulting patterns on the board will decide the number of points each player gets at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The special flavour of the game results from the fact, that the scoring takes place in the vertical and horizontal lines of the board - running in a 45 degree angle to the rows where the stones were placed.<br/><br/>Players earn points for each magic wand, meaning each combination of exactly three stones lying in line and adjacent to each other. The tricky part is, that a player will lose points for any magic wand that is too long - having more than three stones.<br/><br/>",

Can Earth's superpowers, wary and distrustful of each other for more than 300 years, unite in the face of a common enemy? Or has humanity already doomed itself to annihilation?<br/>In addition to extensive background material describing the Grumm Wars universe, this book contains thirty-five new starship designs representing the alien Grumm, the nomadic Boers, and Terra&rsquo;s three space faring powers: the Union of European States, Daitoua Kyoueiken, and Pan-Atlantic Commonwealth.

        "description": "Fantasy Rules! Tournament &amp; Campaign Edition is a simplified version of Fantasy Rules! Fast Play Rules for Miniature Wargames in the Worlds of Fantasy 3rd edition.  While the latter weighs in at over 130 pages, the TCE is less than 40 pages.  The goal of the game is to remove many of the more elaborate constructs such as burrowing creatures, battlewagons, high magic levels, and elaborate army lists, and allow players to focus on the core rules so that they can play quick games as part of a tournament and campaign.  The mechanics of the game is basically the same--it's just a much slimmed down version with a lot fewer options.<br/><br/>Although FR!TCE is designed to be compatible with FR!3, it is in some respects a very different game. All Chipco games rely on a balance between units, magic (in FR!), characters and missile fire. Every unit/character has its vulnerability. In simplifying the game for extremely fast play, we have abstracted or eliminated many of the high-level magic, capabilities, and units.<br/><br/>Features of FR!TCE include:<br/><br/>* A Grand tactical, historical-based system that rewards sound military tactics.<br/>    * Fast play; designed to play in an hour for easy compatiblity with your tournaments and campaigns.<br/>    * A Simplified but satisfying magic system; magic is not just an artillery hit.<br/>    * There are no restrictive army lists, but rather a system focusing on an army or nation's core strengths that you can use to ensure the army fits your concept.<br/>    * A campaign system that lets character/units level up with experience in battle.<br/>    * Based on Chipco's Fantasy Rules!; a vetted and well tested system.<br/><br/>Fantasy Rules! Tournament and Campaign Edition (FR!TCE) differs from the standard FR!3 ruleset in the following manner:<br/><br/>* The Morale Clock starts at 7.<br/>    * Capabilities diminish when the clock reaches 3.<br/>    * No unit RF/CF can be raised by magic or character bonuses by more than +2. Only rank and file units can have a magic or character RF/CF bonus, not Special units (except Large Monsters, when ridden).<br/>    * Large Monsters (including dragons and leviathans) and Spirits usually require a pip to move (unless ridden).<br/>    * There is only one simplified level of magic.<br/>    * The character system has also been simplified, with some differences from FR!3. Note: These new concepts are compatible with FR!3 (for example, you might wish to use the FR!3 TCE Witch Hunter capabilities instead of the original FR!3 ones).<br/>    * FR!3 optional rules are not part of FR!TCE, and unit/character lists have been streamlined.<br/>    * There are no specific army lists. Instead, we have sixteen Army Focuses; these are special character and unit core competencies in which an armies/races/civilizations might specialize. Each army picks 3-4. For example, if the Orcs in your world are noble knights or steppe riders, then you can set up the lists to accomodate.<br/>    * There is a hierarchy of units (raised, regular, veteran, and elite) to simulate campaign experience (for example, Mounted are raised, Heavy Cavalry are regular, and Knights, Light Cavalry, and Heavy Chariots are veteran).<br/><br/>FR!TCE is designed to be played in under an hour since fast, simple play is essential for conventions, campaigns and tournaments, evening play, or to just have a simplified game to introduce beginners to miniature wargame rules. In doing so, we have not sacrificed tactics, skill, or interesting variety; our players get to fight the battle, not the rules. FR!3 and FR!TCE are designed for use with 10mm, 15mm, or 25mm armies.<br/><br/>These rules are designed to be used in the fantasy or mythical world of your choice, not one that we have designed. All Chipco games emphasize playing with whatever armies or figures you have already, and FR!TCE is no exception.<br/><br/>",

In the middle Shōwa period, carrom was called &quot;fighting ball board&quot; or &quot;tossing ball board&quot; (闘球盤 or 投球盤, tōkyūban?) and was a popular board game throughout Japan. Carrom gradually lost popularity, but is still played in Hikone, Shiga. In Hikone, carrom is called karomu (カロム?) and many homes have their own carrom boards and use derivative rules.

        "description": "A devastating earthquake ravaged the island of The Raya Republic. The initial devastation crippled major cities and damaged most of the island's main infrastructure. The tsunami that followed caused thousands to lose their lives, including the government and most of the military. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the island is in a major state of emergency with no one to lead the people. The world is looking for someone to whom they can to send desperately needed resources. With such an opportunity, many have risen up to claim power. Will you rise to the challenge?<br/><br/>Aftermath: The Beginning is a game about gaining political influence by providing desperate provinces the resources they need. Players use their influence to acquire resources, use publicity to bolster their campaign or hinder their opponents, and make deals with each other to reach the final goal of becoming the next leader of the country.<br/><br/>Players customize the island at the beginning of each game, giving each game variance and loads of replay value. The objective of the game is to acquire the most population control through your influence. Every turn, an aid package - full of valuable resources - is sent to the island. Players bid for resources and spend them to gain influence in the different provinces. Each turn, each province has different resource needs. Each province has a population value. As players gain influence, they gain control of those provinces. The player at the end of the game with the most population control wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The DC Universe Miniature Game is a tabletop skirmish game, pitting teams of exquisitely detailed miniature superheroes and villains against each other in exciting contests of strategy and might! Based on the epic, bestselling DC Universe, this game includes many of the well-loved characters that have thrilled comic book fans for generations.These mighty <br/>heroes and their arch nemeses can now assemble at your call, ready to save the world&hellip; or destroy it.<br/><br/>In the DC Universe Miniature Game, you and your friends collect a set of beautiful miniatures of your favorite DC heroes and villains, bring them to life by painting them, and then use them as playing pieces in an exciting multi-faceted, three-dimensional tactical game. You will be weaving your own stories, worthy of the greatest comic book sagas. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned veteran of tabletop miniature games, or a new recruit to this rewarding hobby, you&rsquo;ll soon be controlling your own super-team, and battling for control of Metropolis, the Earth at large, or even the entire galaxy!<br/><br/>The DC Universe Miniature Game is designed for two or more players, with each taking control <br/>of a number of finely detailed miniatures, representing their faction, or team. The miniatures are in essence playing pieces, much like those you&rsquo;d find in a board game. But unlike most board games, a miniature game doesn&rsquo;t take place on a readily defined board, but rather the players take an active role in designing their own custom gaming area, usually on a tabletop <br/>populated by scratch-built scenery. The rules use a sophisticated system of power counters <br/>and unique character abilities, allowing you to move your models freely and utilize a large <br/>range of skills and powers to give you a tactical edge over your opponents.<br/><br/>The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/><br/>Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:<br/><br/>1.  Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually <br/>up to the character&rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.<br/><br/>2.  Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This <br/>stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &ndash; you might go first this round, but end up <br/>going last in the next.<br/><br/>3.  Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and <br/>resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single <br/>model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act <br/>have done so.<br/><br/>4.  Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &lsquo;tidying up&rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been <br/>removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.<br/><br/>Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.<br/><br/>About the starter set:<br/><br/>This is the incarnation of Batman, Superman &amp; Wonder Woman from the DC cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Now you can take to the streets of Gotham, Metropolis or even Themyscira with the DC Miniatures game. Take control of Henry Cavill's Superman, Ben Affleck's Batman or Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and take on DC villains or recreate the fight scenes from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.<br/><br/>This blister contains:<br/><br/>- 3 metal miniatures and stat cards for the miniatures.<br/><br/>1x Batman<br/>    1x Superman<br/>    1x Wonder Woman<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately for them, this particular vale is haunted by a malevolent spirit know as a Will o&rsquo; the Wisp, who is played by the fourth player. The wisp wields a ghostly lantern used to lure the living off their paths and into the treachery of darkness. Both spirit and the living have the power to cast charms or glamours which affects the movement and state of all the other players on the board.<br/><br/>If the villagers all reach their homes safely, then they have won the game &ndash; but if they should not, then the wisp has won the game by luring them into the shadows.<br/><br/>",

The Robotech Masters arrive to complete the mission that their Zentraedi armada began... to secure their empire by reclaiming the Protoculture matrix before it is located by the Invid. In their way stands the Army of the Southern Cross!<br/><br/>The exciting, stand-alone sequel to SolarFlare Games&rsquo; ROBOTECH: Force of Arms lets you take control of the epic conflict known as the Second Robotech War. One player takes the lead as the plotting, scheming, desperate Robotech Masters, while the other player commands the valiant and determined Army of the Southern Cross.<br/><br/>In this head-to-head card game, players are engaged in conflict for control of the Earth, each side pitting their varied infantry and mecha-based units against each other in an all-out war with only one victor. In addition to their mecha and weapons, players wield powerful command actions and amazing heroes to turn the tide of conflict and ensure victory.<br/><br/>ROBOTECH: Crisis Point is a two-player head-to-head card game. Strategy, tactics, area control, bluffing, and hand management all come into play in this dynamic and deep game of Alien vs Human in a battle of wits and courage. Will you save humanity or utterly destroy it?<br/><br/>+  + + +<br/><br/>Robotech: Crisis Point is a strategic game of unit movement and area control in which you take on the role of either the Army of the Southern Cross (AoSC) or the dreaded Robotech Masters. You and your opponent maneuver your units trying to defeat the enemy's forces. Using heroes and distinctive commands at the right time can turn the tide of the battle in your favor. Are you ready to defend Earth as the courageous Army of the Southern Cross or capture the flower of life as the Robotech Masters?<br/><br/>In more detail, players try to destroy their opponent's units while also successfully defending their own forces. Players take turns tactically deploying units, strategically placing their combat and support units to defend their own forces and destroy those of their enemy, while using their hero and command cards to win the day.<br/><br/>Once the players have finished the tactical, token, and command/hero phases, they tally up the victory points for the units and strategic locations successfully defended. They then add the victory points for the enemy units they were able to successfully destroy. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Use classic pancake flavors and toppings, as well as some ~special~ ingredients other chefs wouldn&rsquo;t dare to use!<br/><br/>The game begins by drawing 4 cards and a buttermilk pancake.  Begin your turn by choosing one of three options: draw 2 cards and play 2 cards from your hand, only draw 3 cards, or only play 3 cards.  Players create stacks of pancakes by playing Pancake and Topping cards from their hand.  Players can place positive cards on their own stacks, and play negative cards to sabotage other players' stacks.<br/><br/>In order for your beautiful (or disgusting) stack to earn a final score, you must top off the stack with a Finisher card.  These special cards are placed in the center of the table and are earned by completing the objective on each card. <br/> When a finisher is played, it's special effect triggers immediately and your stack's points are locked in which prevents the stack from being sabotaged by other players.  Any stacks that don't have finishers on them at the end of the game don't earn any points.  This includes stacks that have a negative total value!  The game ends when the deck runs out of cards.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, special Trophy cards are awarded to players for bonus points.  These cards are given to the player with the tallest, finished, pancake stack, the player with the fewest negative items on their stack, and the player who dealt the most damage in one turn.  The points are added up, and the player who earned the most points the end of the game, wins!<br/><br/>FAT STACKS works best with 3-6 players, takes about 40 minutes for a full game, and is recommended for ages 14+.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Playing 2-3 players, you&rsquo;re not only vying for control of areas of the map against your foes, but you are also fending off masses of zombies who will pick you off if left unchecked. Each card has two sides, and every card will be used twice per round (one on each side) before moving to the zombie phase - and the order in which the cards get used will determine how the zombies react and interact on the map.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>This 9-card game published by Button Shy pits you and one or two other players in an area control game against each other... and zombies. Lay out the three map cards in any formation, choose one of the three colors and begin play!<br/><br/>Play consists of three rounds with each including a Survivor Phase, Zombie Phase, and Scoring Phase. Players select an action card for their team, then the zombies act according to the back side of the selected cards, and then area control points are divvied.

The more ants you have, the bigger food items they can take.<br/><br/>Setup: each player receives an anthill card to store their food, and three cards from the deck. Cards have two parts: a grass part with a number of ants, and a tablecloth part with a food item with the number of ants required to take it. There are also special cards with additional rules.<br/><br/>Gameplay: in their turn, the active player plays one card from their hand and places it face up in front of them (the so called &quot;tablecloth-area&quot;). Once the card is played, the player may discard a number of ants in their tablecloth-area to steal a food item from other player's area which value matches the number of discarded ants. If so, the active player steals the food item and places it under their anthill. The active player then completes their hand of three cards, and turn passes to next player.<br/><br/>Play continues until deck and hand cards are exhausted. The food items are then scored with a number of stars related to their value (1-10: 1 star, 11-19: 2 stars, 20-25: 3 stars). Player with most stars wins.<br/><br/>",

Strategic options abound for both players; victory goes to the one best able to carry out the chosen strategy, while maintaining a reserve to contain sudden enemy action or exploit an opportunity. The map covers the eastern front from Leningrad to the Sea of Azov at 20 miles per hex. Turns cover one month each for most of the year, two months during winter. Most units are Soviet armies and German divisions, plus a few Axis satellite corps. The turn sequence is built around the random drawing of chits to determine which player moves. Each chit drawn allows a player to both move and attack, but with a twist. One side allows the player to move first, then attack, the other side flips the sequence. There are two twists to the mechanism. First, chits come in several varieties, with differing penalties or bonuses depending on the chit and the side chosen. Second, during certain turns, one player or the other gets bonuses, allowing selection of the first chit to open the action, and providing a different mix of chits reflecting the overall situation at that point in the war. Victory may occur at one of three times during the game; the end of the first German offensive, the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive, and finally the end of the game, after the final German summer offensive.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 or 2 months<br/>Hex: 20 miles / 33 kilometers<br/>Units: Division to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (352 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Zhukov&rsquo;s War rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-20<br/><br/>",

(Twilight Imperium Express.)<br/><br/>Planet Masters is a dicegame that contains all the excitement from boardgames about planetary control and war. It captures much of the core essence: clash of fleets, embittering politics and empire building. Planet Masters compiles cunning game mechanics into a very compact dicegame.<br/><br/>A set of only 4 dice per player is necessary to play. Each player starts with one planet dice to build expand his empire. Players roll planet dice for resources to build weapons (dice) and gain power. This power can be used to conquer planets from other players.<br/>Some free planets (dice) are in a common pool called &quot;Galaxy&quot;. When a player rolls a &quot;Transporter&quot; ship icon on his weapon dice, then she/he can capture a fresh planet to add to his empire. First player to reach a preset amount of victory points wins.<br/><br/>While playing other boardgames of space conquest can consume hours per game, this express version enables you to play a quick game that only lasts a couple of minutes. Now you can conquer galaxies during lunchtime! Invading planets and building a galactic empire has never been this fast.<br/><br/>",

The goal of providing faster play is in keeping with the desires and interests of the younger generation.<br/><br/>MicroGammon is not just an update to traditional backgammon but is also unique enough to have received a US patent.<br/><br/>An important feature of MicroGammon is that the rules are fundamentally the same as they are for the normal backgammon game.  <br/>If you know how to play backgammon, you already know how to play MicroGammon!<br/><br/>Another important and fun feature of MicroGammon is the novel dice that are used, which allow for game compression to speed things up as described below.<br/><br/>MicroGammon is basically 2/3 of a normal backgammon game having 16 points instead of 24 points, 10 checkers instead of the normal 15 and using 4 sided dice (shown below) rather than the traditional 6 sided dice. The result is a game that is much faster paced and more volatile with doubles occurring 50% more often (1 in 4 rolls compared with 1 in 6 roles for cubic dice).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players can cooperate with each other and start up many kinds of Magic-Combine. The wizard who wins the most has to join a War of Supreme Wizard with limited ability. If you pass the trial, then you can be the real Supreme Wizard!<br/><br/>How to paly:<br/>Wizard x Wizard is a Key word in this game. When you already choose the spell you want to cast, you need to put your spell in front of you and say : Wizard x Wizard, then wait for your opponent. When your opponent say Wizard x Wizard and get ready, then you can put the spells on your Caracter Board and then begin to judge the effect of spells.<br/><br/>Every wizard has 15 kinds of spell and 1 Exclusive Equipment. Spell Cards have Attack Spell and Support Spell, Attack Spell can divide into 2 kind, Magic and Physical Damage. Magic Damage is golden frame, and Physical Damage is silver frame. If the type of Damage is the same, the damage of each other will be canceled out. (The wizard with less damage will take damage.)<br/><br/>When you play team-up mode, only one wizard can cast spell, so you need to communicate with your teammate to decide what spell your team want to cast. But it&rsquo;s a guess game, so you can&rsquo;t let your opponent know what do you think. You can use our wands to communicate with your teammate. <br/>You can use different wizard&rsquo;s Exclusive Equipment to make different combo or use Magic-Combine to double the spell's effects. <br/>  The game will over when one team&rsquo;s Life become 0 or after 15 rounds, the team with more Life will win.<br/><br/>Another special rule of this game is : the wizard who win the most will become Quasi-Supreme and join the last Supreme Battle. You need to fight with other wizards by your own. If you win, you will be the real Supreme!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Likewise the armored units featuring in these scenarios. 31st Tank Brigade comprised two Battalions (7th and 9th R.T.R.) of highly trained and enthusiastic young men, keen to serve their country and attracted by the infantry tank units' emphasis on training and workmanship rather than the smartness and drill of the traditional cavalry.

        "description": "Operation Weser&uuml;bung: The Invasion of Norway covers the German invasion of Norway in 1940 during World War II. The game covers all aspects of the invasion, including land, naval, and air operations as well as the British and French involvement.<br/><br/>Operation Weser&uuml;bung is a two-player or three-player game, with one player taking the Germans and the other player or players taking Norway and Great Britain/France. The game is regimental scale with each hex representing approximately 20-25 kilometers with turns representing four days. The combat system is roll-to-hit and the entire game system is based on the system from World War II in the West. This game is also a preview of what the system for World War II in the West: Ultimate Edition will look like when it is published in late 2007. Turn phases include the Air Phase, the Naval Phase, the Combat Phase, the Movement Phase, and the End Phase. The game includes everything from air interception to naval-air combat, from parachute drops to amphibious assaults. While the game strives to be an accurate simulation, the level of enjoyment and ease of play is also a priority.<br/><br/>The game is a medium to low complexity and should be easy to learn relatively quickly. The game can take approximately 5-8 hours to complete.<br/><br/>Operation Weser&uuml;bung contains approximately 225 mounted counters in easy-to-cut strips. All historical land and naval units are represented in the game and individually identified. Divisional leaders are also included as well as an Admiral. All ships larger than a destroyer are individually identified and included, and air units are divided into counters representing a few squadrons of each type of aircraft. The Germans can call on the Messerschmitt Bf109 E, Messerschmitt Bf110 C, Junkers 87, Heinkel 111, and Junkers 52 during the game, while the Allies have a few Gloster Gladiators, Fairey Swordfish, Vickers Wellingtons, Capronis, and Hawker Hurricanes to try to stop the invasion. All air units have images of the aircraft on the counter while naval units have the historical profiles of the ship represented.<br/><br/>Counters are all two step and as shown in these pictures, have values on the top and bottom edge of the counter. Thus, the facing of the counter is important. This is similar to the system used in Distant Foreign Fields but a departure from the Second Edition of World War II in the West.

The theater of War is the Western Front and the territories of countries adjacent to that front.  The Object is to occupy ONE of two capital cities of the opponent.<br/><br/>On the map the principal towns are shown as red circles and connected together by thick red lines which represent the road and railway systems.  Towns with black centers are Corps garrison towns and the associated units are marked on the map.  The units (armoured, motorized and infantry corp) are represented by different shaped wooden pieces with Flags attached.<br/><br/>The Germans always go first and movement is governed by a roll of the dice.  The roll will be between 1 and 3 and the number thrown indicates the number of units which may be moved.  Armoured corps can move 3 spaces, Motorized 2 and Infantry 1 space.  Destruction of units is based on having units adjacent to the target enemy, 3 friendly units are required to kill an armoured unit, infantry and motorized are destroyed by two friendly units in adjacent towns.  For every enemy unit destroyed the player gets another roll.<br/><br/>",

Bred in the fire pits beneath the fortress of Isengard, they are stronger, braver and better armoured than any Orc could ever hope to be. With these armies fighting alongside those of Mordor, there is little hope for the Free People of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>This 48-page Sourcebook for The Lord of the Rings contains all the rules you'll need to field an army from The Fallen Realms (including the Uruk-hai, Haradrim, Easterlings and the Variags of Khand), as well as detailed background information and scenarios.<br/><br/>You must possess a copy of The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game in order to use the contents of this book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's summertime and that means it's garage sale season! It's time to get rid of your old junk and buy some new junk. In Garage Sale, players simultaneously put up items for sale and negotiate to buy them from each other. The goal is to collect sets of items while maintaining cash flow. The catch is that once you feel you are done collecting a particular set, you can't go back and add to it!<br/><br/>The game of Garage Sale is played over four rounds. In each round, there is one turn per player. On a turn, each player puts up a card from his hand for sale. Players then negotiate to buy those cards using coins and dollars (represented by face-down cards from a player's hand). Once all negotiations are done, one player is allowed to add cards to his storage pile. The cards stored will add to his income this turn (cards and coins) as well as adding to his final score at the end of the game. The scoring is based on the amount of stored cards, bonus stars, sets of colors, and remaining coins.<br/><br/>",

To do this, players can lay down melds of sets and runs; unlike other rummy games, however, you can't just lay down melds whenever you want. You must play a monster card first. Knowing when to play monsters is a key strategy, but you also have to figure out when to kill your opponent's monsters to prevent them from laying down their own melds.<br/><br/>The numbered blood cards come in two colors: odd numbers are black and have a skull in the right corner, while even numbers are red and have a heart in the right corner. You can kill your opponent's monsters with a Kill card or a three-of-a-kind of skulls. With a three-of-a-kind of hearts, you can bring one of your monsters back to life. Blood cards can also be played as melds for points, and deciding whether to play for points or to kill your opponents becomes a key strategy in the game.<br/><br/>The first player to play out his cards ends the hand, then everyone tallies his score. Whoever first reaches a preset point total wins!<br/><br/>",

After eons of hunting and gathering, feasts and famine, war and peace, your people have finally entered an age of innovation.<br/><br/>With the advent of horticulture, your tribe has settled into a sedentary way of life and through this change, idle minds have begun to develop new ways of understanding and manipulating the world around them. Great advancements are being made in subsistence, government, technology, culture, commerce, diplomacy, and warfare.<br/><br/>This sea change has inspired a need for guidance and through careful consideration your people have elected you to lead them into the future.<br/><br/>Civicus is a civilization themed, tile placement and area control game in which players compete for territories, resources and exotic goods. These essential elements of the game are earned, maintained, and developed through sound logic, thoughtful tile placement, and strategic planning.<br/><br/>Each round the players will take turns placing new terrain tiles. Strategic tile placement is crucial for a player&rsquo;s success, as this aspect of the game determines the geographical matrix for game play and dictates resource and action point generation. Resources and action points are required for nearly every aspect of the game, including settlement and temple construction, attribute development, and wealth generation.<br/><br/>Throughout four ages, the players will compete for territory control, by building and developing settlements. In turn, these territories will provide the players with the raw materials required for cultivating a great and powerful nation. The greatness of your nation is determined, in part, by a preset scoring system which focuses heavily on settlement construction, exotic good control, as well as, fortune and fame.<br/><br/>The nation with the most victory points at the end of the fourth age wins!<br/>          [Crowds cheer&hellip; fireworks erupt&hellip; enemies conspire]<br/><br/>",

The players must guide the aliens through the farm, collecting cows and returning them to their own ships.

The Mutineer's goal: to survive while the others attempt to discover you.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of one of the 8 crew members on the ship: Chaplain, Boatswain, Quartermaster, Surgeon, Navigator, First Mate, Master Gunner, or Cabin Boy. Roles are public knowledge, but the identity of the mutineer remains hidden. Over the course of two rounds, players try to discover the mutineer through discussion, accusation, denial, and special actions. The game ends with a vote to convict one player guilty of mutiny. If the mutineer is voted guilty, all the other players win. Otherwise, the mutineer wins.<br/><br/>Each role has unique abilities that may help reveal the mutineer or allow them to exert control over the the voting. Since any player could be the mutineer, an accusation could be helpful, or a clever attempt to re-direct suspicion elsewhere. Mutiny is a social game with a minimal rule set. The game instead relies on player discussion and interaction to drive the game.<br/><br/>",

Find the set that&rsquo;s right for you... or mix together characters from different sets to customize your own game!<br/><br/>A Trickster set has 49 cards with seven heroes, each with their own simple effect on play. A hero appears in seven different suits, each a color of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Each hero and suit combination appears once in a set.<br/><br/>The first player of each round may play any card from her hand. The second player in the round is called The Trickster, who may also pay any card from her hand. Any subsequent player that round must play a card that follows the pattern set by the Trickster. (If the first two cards are Yellow, then everyone must play a Yellow card.)<br/><br/>If you cannot follow the pattern, you must collect cards played this round into your personal scoring area. If everyone was able to play one card, then the Trickster collects the cards.<br/><br/>The goal of Trickster is to have the fewest cards by the time any player has emptied her hand. Whoever has the fewest cards is the winner... with one exception! If you have more cards of a suit than any other player, you may ignore those cards when scoring.<br/><br/>'Trickster: Symbiosis' is a highly strategic set featuring characters from the biopunk setting Symbiosis by Steven Sanders.<br/><br/>",

Each player then takes turns choosing a tile from the supply (or one of their own tiles, which are also endgame points) and placing it next to tiles in the playing area.<br/><br/>If the tile you place matches one or more adjacent colors, you score points. For each point scored, take any one tile from the supply and place it face up in front of you. These are your tiles, and each is worth +1 point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game immediately ends when the last tile is taken from the table and placed. Count your tiles and add any endgame points. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>KIKA includes a rule sheet and seven rules cards. (Most of the rule cards are optional as the recommended minimum age for the game is 2 + the number of cards used.) You can choose 972 different combinations, with elements of deduction, memory, area enclosure, push your luck, and more. Try them all to discover your gamer DNA!<br/><br/>",

In your hand it is considered to be a card with black, white, green, red, yellow, and blue colors. It can be played onto any family tree, and must immediately receive an inheritance marker after being played. Until it leaves play it counts as a black card and a white card in addition to the color of that inheritance marker. The inheritance marker may not be removed until the Ghost Legend is dismissed.<br/><br/>The Fae Legend behaves similarly to the Ghost Legend, except for the differences between Ghost and Fae cards. When the Fae Legend is played onto a player's family tree, that player must then swap it per normal Fae rules.<br/><br/>The new Wanderer Guardians and Fae Watcher can be shuffled into the deck of Immortals to provide additional variety.<br/>The Wanderer Guardians have more flexible unlock tracks, allowing you to unlock them in either 2 or 3 steps. While on top of a hero on your tree, the Guardian's traits are used.<br/><br/>The Fae Heirloom can be shuffled into the deck of Heirlooms to provide additional variety.<br/>Do not use this card if you are not playing with Fae and Skalds. Once the Heirloom is restored, your youngest Hero gains the Fae's Lost trait. This does not cause any additional swapping to occur when playing to that spot on your family tree.<br/><br/>The Skald Watcher has a flexible unlock track that requires you to have a Ghost or Fae on your tree, followed by a Skald. Do not use this card if you are not playing with Ghosts/Fae and Skalds. Once unlocked, the Skald Watcher allows you to use any of the four basic 1st-generation embellishments.<br/><br/>",

Players bid how many of the thirteen tricks their partnership can win (or, unlike Bridge, lose). Also, players can communication information about their hands through their bids (and, unlike Bridge, the cards they can exchange) with a system of conventions. Here are the main differences:<br/><br/><br/>     Players get to exchange cards with each other. There are two ways of playing Skruuvi depending on how players exchange cards: Kitty games and No-kitty games.<br/><br/><br/>- In a Kitty game, players receive 12 cards; the four undealt cards is the kitty. The highest bidder adds the kitty to their hand, then gives any four cards to their partner. The partner adds these cards to their hand, then gives one card to each of the other three players.<br/><br/>- In a No-kitty game, players receive 13 cards. The highest bidder gives any four cards to their partner. The partner adds these cards to their hand, then returns any four cards back to the highest bidder.<br/><br/><br/>     Players optionally play several rounds of Bolshevik, where one player attempts to win or lose all 13 tricks (without a partner).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Players can bid misere, which is a bid of how many tricks a partnership will lose (without a trump suit).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     As mentioned, there is no dummy!<br/><br/><br/><br/>     As in Bridge, the lowest bid is to win 7 out of the 13 tricks. However, the lowest bid you can win the auction round is 11 tricks! (Or for misere bids, to lose 11 tricks!) In No-kitty games, the lowest bid is to win 12 out of the 13 tricks. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     A game of Skruuvi lasts 24 rounds. Each player plays with a different partner for 8 rounds each.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Animal Realms is a card game that is played over 5 rounds and whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, every player draws randomly seven animal cards. Each player chooses one of their cards as their goal card that shows how many animals they have to catch during a round to score points. The person who resembles an animal the most becomes the starting player.<br/>In a player's turn they have to put one card from their hand face-up in front of them. Each of the seven different animal card has a different card effect so players need to use the cards in their hand cleverly to catch animals of other players or interfere with them. <br/>As an example the tiger can catch all the sheep that has been played before it or if 3 players in a row play a mouse they all get to keep the mouse they've played face down in front of them.<br/>Each animal card has also a point value that is checked during scoring.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dicetris is a roll'n'write game based on Tetris for 1-4 players.<br/><br/>Each round starting player rolls 5 coloured dice(1 green, 1 yellow, 1 blue, and 2 white) and draws a block shape card. Each player in turn places selected die on the card. There are only 4 space available on each card.<br/><br/>Next, players try to fit the dice shape onto their scoring sheets. Shapes can be rotated like in Tetris. New shapes have to touch the bottom of the scoring field or any previously placed shape.<br/><br/>Spaces on the scoring sheets give VPs if they have a matching colour with dice (white is not a colour) or matching value. Values of the dice can be modified, but will cost you VP. Perfectly matching shapes (scoring all 4 fields) let you score one additional field for free.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players get points for: <br/><br/>     the number of scoring fields in 2x2 squares, <br/>     the number of scoring coloured field, <br/>     fully filed rows,<br/>     unused dice modifiers.<br/><br/><br/>The game is played over 10 rounds. The player with the most VP wins.<br/><br/>Tha game was an add-on in the croudfunding campaign of Adam Kwapiński's book &quot;Głowa pełna gier&quot;<br/><br/>",

Except this storm ain&rsquo;t one of wind and rain, but bullets and blood.<br/><br/>King of the West is a weird west themed area control card game. Three different sets of characters will be available at launch. One set can be played as a 2-3 player 18-card area control game, but multiple sets will allow for up to 9 players with the modified rules variant.<br/><br/>For the area control variant setup, nine building cards are randomly played on a 3x3 grid to make up the town. Six buildings are generic locations and the other three are the unique target locations. Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.<br/><br/>Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and outthink them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.<br/><br/>With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone elses. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/><br/>King of the West card game set 1: The Vigilant, including The Drifter, The Gambler, The Baron, and their locations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tixel is a combinatorial game for two players. The name comes from the playing pieces, which are basically pixels (squares) with a curved indentation on one of their edges. Tixels are &quot;directional&quot;, meaning that their orientation is relevant.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can either place a new tixel or move one of her own tixels already on the board. A tixel can be &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;; only active tixels, which are at a 45&ordm; angle, may be moved. Making tixels inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active tixel.<br/><br/>Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks three additional move types (aside from placing or moving a piece). If a tixel that is moved is made inactive at its end position &mdash; i.e., it's sacrificed &mdash; a player can take an extra move if she so chooses; aside from placing or moving a tixel, she can now remove a tixel from the board, activate an inactive tixel, or pivot an active tixel to reorient its hollow side.<br/><br/>Tixel: Tix Expansion Pieces consists of four extra pieces for each player. These expansion pieces are different from regular pieces in that they are completely square instead of being hollow on one side. For each expansion piece used, remove one tixel from the game. The expansion pieces can be used to add variety to games, but they can also be used to handicap a stronger player. Simply give the stronger player more expansion pieces compared to the weaker player. With two expansion sets, the original Tix game can also be played on the Tixel board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After successfully raiding a commercial galleon, it's time to split the loot! As one of the pirates, you want to get the most valuable treasures. But the whole crew must agree how to divide the booty. Convince your companions that your share is really not so big...<br/><br/>Split the Loot is a card game in which during each round players divide treasures (16-18 cards each round) using an unique &quot;reversed bidding&quot; mechanic. The active player makes an offer stating which cards he would like to take and places bid markers on them. The other players in clockwise turn order either accept the offer or make an counteroffer by removing the markers from the cards; as you can only remove markers the counteroffer will be a subset of the initial offer. Once all players agree to an offer the bidding player gathers the cards with markers on them and drops out off the round while the other players continue to divide in the same manner the cards available in this round .<br/><br/>Besides gathering treasures player may gain action cards that provide a one time bonus during the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when players divide among themselves the whole Treasure Deck, which depending on the number of players will take between 5 and 7 rounds. The players count up the points from their gained cards. Different cards score in different ways - while you want as much Rum as you can gather, if you found a couple Cannon balls you really should look around for a Cannon...<br/><br/>While the card titles are printed in Polish the game is totally language independent and the rules are printed in both English and Polish.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forlorn Struggles is a DualPak game. It comes with two separate games in one package.<br/><br/>Operation S&uuml;dwind is a two-player/solitaire game recreating the mid-February 1945 German offensive against the Soviet Bridgehead across the Garam River, in what is now southwestern Slovakia. It commenced on the morning of February 17. The German attack spearheads included a total of 44 formidable Tiger II tanks. Subsidiary attacks from across the Danube helped weaken the Soviet positions. 7th Guard Army defended stubbornly but was barely reinforced and by February 24th the Germans cleared the bridgehead. The Germans won a clear-cut operational victory but they incurred hard-to-replace losses. In the grand scheme of things Operation S&uuml;dwind was a localized, and only temporary setback ,for the Soviets.<br/><br/>Operation Gemse is a two-player/solitaire game recreating the fierce early March German offensive in Oberlausitz and lower Siliesia against the unsuspecting Soviet 3rd Guard Tank Army commanded by General Rybalko. Securing Lauban and the surrounding area was deemed critical for a possible relief of encircled Breslau. However the planned grand encirclement anchored on Naumburg soon proved too ambitious. Instead on March 5 the F&uuml;hrer-Grenadier and F&uuml;hrer-Begleit Panzer divisions completed their reduced pincer movement and met up in S&auml;chsisch-Haugsdorf. By March 7th, the encircled Soviet 7th Guard Tank Corps was almost completely destroyed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "April 1863<br/>Union General Ulysses S. Grant embarks on another attempt to wrest control of the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River from the rebels; the fortress city of Vicksburg. Numerous other attempts have failed miserably. The ill-fated campaign from the north, short circuited by that devil Forrest's raid on Grant's supply lines. The jinxed canal, dug through the swamps in an attempt to bypass the city's guns. Now another plan is in motion. Grant will march his Army of the Tennessee through the Louisiana swamps, sneak his ships past the rebel fortress in a daring run of the gauntlet, conduct the largest amphibious invasion in U.S. history, separate himself from his supply base, wedge himself in between two rebel armies, and seize control of the city from the east! All the while battling politicians and public opinion as much as the Confederate armies. Somehow, his daring plan worked, and the Mississippi once again flowed unvexed to the sea.<br/><br/>But things could have been different. Find out how....<br/><br/>This operational level game uses the block unit system to re-create the limited intelligence of the actual campaign. Players maneuver their forces without adequate knowledge of their opponents strengths or even location. The game board spans the campaign topography, from the swamps of eastern Louisiana to the mountainous terrain around Jackson Mississippi. A point to point movement system is employed on a 20 x 24 playing map. Limited command abilities and critical supply wagons are key to managing your armies and achieving victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hard Furry Pets is a card game in which players become little anthropomorphic animals who try to charm sweet girls of wavering morality. You can choose from two roles: a Hard Furry Pet (HFP) or a Moralizer. The former will try to drive the object of their desire down the road of damnation and dissoluteness, while the latter will pursue the route of light and purity (or something like that).<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-6 players. Due to the sensitive subject matter, it is not recommended for children.<br/><br/>Objective of the Game<br/><br/>You must embrace your role as a Hard Furry Pet or Moralizer. You will be given an obsession: a particular kind of girl, eager for your attentive charm. Your goal is to subdue your obsession by satisfying her every need in three different categories: romance, morality, and will.<br/><br/>Your requirements in each category are represented by the numbers and symbols on the bottom of every card. You will use a stunning variety of objects, costumes, romantic locations, and humorous events to wear down her resistance until you achieve the goal of every Hard Furry Pet: the conquest! Because of their inherently different natures, Hard Furry Pets and Moralizers must use different numbers and abilities.<br/><br/>The first player to fully satisfy the needs of his obsession and complete his conquest is the winner!<br/><br/>",

This continues until the endgame is triggered for the round by a player who declared &quot;Gin&quot; during their turn. All players reveal their hand and any words are challenged (if needed).

Most of the times, you have to match several tile sets (and move your mole) until your mole finally reaches to a hole you are to connect.<br/><br/>On your turn, you select one of the face-down flower tiles adjacent to your mole pawn and flip it to the flower side, and then select another face-down flower tile from anywhere on the board. If the two tiles match, move your mole next to one of the holes adjacent to the second tile.<br/><br/>You keep having your turn until you fail to find two matching tiles. And in anytime during your turn, if your mole gets to a hole indicated on your mission card, you flip that card and continue your turn.<br/><br/>When you fail, you reset the game board by flipping all the opened tile and pass your turn.

Against heavy odds and in a tensely contested battle, Colonel General Erwin Rommel defeated the British and recaptured Tobruk, earning himself a Field Marshal&rsquo;s baton in the process.<br/><br/>Rommel At Gazala is the 2nd Edition of Jim Werbaneth&rsquo;s simulation of the daring offensive of Panzerarmee Afrika against the British Eighth Army&rsquo;s fortified line near Gazala, Libya, in May and June 1941.<br/><br/>Rommel at Gazala is a quick-playing, accessible game. It is sufficiently easy for new players to enter into board wargaming, but with enough possibilities to offer significant replay value to newcomer and veteran player alike. Counter density is low, letting the players concentrate on strategy more than minutiae, and the pace is fast. There are also special rules to evoke the special flavor of the battle; armor superiority, the dreaded &ldquo;88,&rdquo; fortifications, and of course the special capabilities of Erwin Rommel himself.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 3 miles / 4.8 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 11 x 17.5&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>One dual-side printed countersheets (72 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Rommel at Gazala rules booklet<br/>Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Complexity: Low<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-2 Hours<br/><br/>",

In the Hike phase, they will advance to a new campsite on the map, on their way to the final Mount Humbaba space. They will make camp during the Pitch phase, manipulating their dice as they prepare for the coming night. During the Sleep phase they decide whether to dream alone or together, and will then spend dice to overcome Dream cards, gaining Insight or giving in to Worry. In the morning, they will Break camp, depleting supplies and foraging for dice. All along, players will be managing their dice through character abilities and Insights, as they try to keep the mounting Worry level at bay. Players win if they reach the Mount Humbaba space of the map and meet the dice values of the final challenge.<br/><br/>Played with a combination of dice and cards, the Epic of Gil &amp; Ennis was originally an entry into the 2019 9 Card Design Contest.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game of the Generals is an educational war game released in the Philippines in the 1970s. Its Filipino name is Salpakan. It is designed for two players, each controlling an army, and a neutral arbiter (sometimes called a referee or an adjutant) to decide the results of &quot;challenges&quot; between opposing playing pieces that like playing cards have their identities hidden from the opponent.<br/><br/>The game simulates armies at war trying to overpower, misinform, outflank, outmaneuver, and destroy each other. It optimizes the use of logic, memory, and spatial skills. It simulates the &quot;fog of war&quot; because the identities of the opposing pieces are hidden from each player and can only be guessed at by their location, movements, or from the results of challenges. The game allows only one side's plan to succeed, although a player may change plans during the course of the game. In addition, there are two different ways of winning the game. Certain strategies and tactics, however, allow both sides the chance of securing a better idea of the other's plan as the game progresses. Players can also speak or gesture to their opponents during matches, hoping to create a false impression about the identity of their pieces or their overall strategy.<br/><br/>--Information collected in July 2020 from Wikipedia article <a target='_blank' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Generals\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Generals</a><br/><br/>",

Your objective is to finish the day (after playing 2 matches, morning and afternoon) as the most decorated gladiator school of Rome, and winner of the day! Players can achieve this in 2 ways: either capture an opponent's Eagle (and receive Medal of Eagle), or by having the most denarii (GladiGala's coins) in your Treasury as a match ends (receive Medal of Coin). In GladiGala all the results of what happens in the arena are translated into coins, by which players can also manage their gladiator team during the match (upgrade a hurt gladiator, create advanced maneuvers, or enter the arena's &quot;Safe Zone&quot;).<br/><br/>As a Gladiator School Leader it is up to you to gain coins and fill your Treasury for marvelous tactical performances and for making accurate strategic choices. Outwit your opponents, make the most of your gladiators' formation, manage your Treasury wisely, and get the crowds on your side chanting GladiGala's mantra: &quot;Always aim for an eagle &ndash; always stand guard!&quot;<br/><br/>GladiGala is a simultaneous game played in multiple rounds. First, players use magnetic panels/cards to give movements, maneuvering, and action orders to all gladiators. Each game players enter the arena with a different gladiator formation, made from GladiGala's 4 gladiator types: Sword, Spear, Dagger, and Club, each has a different set of abilities. After giving movements orders, players place their attacks trying to anticipate their opponent's moves. Finally, cards are revealed and all gladiators perform accordingly. A gladiator moving to an attacked area is marked as &quot;Hit&quot;. A gladiator hit twice is out of the arena!<br/><br/>Welcome to Rome, 101 A.D.<br/><br/>The city's center stage is set up and ready for GladiGala, the year's greatest show of skill in the arena.

The teams all gear up, final preparations are made, last instructions are given. Your gladiator formation for the morning match is set and ready to head out the gate. Your gladiators are holding to their eagle, your house symbol of honor and respect.

Two watering holes start in play.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, they play two organisms from their hand next to either watering hole, each of which can have eight organism cards around it. When an organism is played next to a watering hole, its instinct is always used, granting the player a special ability. Then, if the played organism is the only organism of that name at that watering hole, the player may use its adaptation power, which can trigger a number of combos and additional effects.<br/><br/>After playing an organism and carrying out its effects, any watering hole surrounded by eight organisms is resolved and awarded to one of the players.

With this module, players can accelerate the development of their bonsai tree by acquiring new special tiles.<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn, you may discard as many cards as indicated on one of the triple tiles still available in order to obtain that tile. Turn the tile over and place it in your bonsai immediately, making sure that at least one of the four wooden sides of the tile touches a bonsai wood tile, then take the rest of your turn as usual.<br/><br/>The cards you discard must all be of different types. The types of cards are Growth, Tool, Helper, Master, and Parchment. You may discard cards from your play area and your deck. Discarded cards are removed from play and no longer provide their effects or any victory points at game end. Each player may obtain only one triple tile per game. Once obtained, a triple tile is no longer available.<br/><br/>The 'Specialists' module consists of a game board and four declaration tokens. With this module, players can proclaim themselves cultivation specialists...but will they actually be able to prove it?<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn and only once per game, you can declare that you will be the player with the most tiles of a certain type in your bonsai at game's end.<br/><br/>To do this, choose a type of tile (wood, leaf, flower, or fruit) and a space not occupied by any tokens on the specialists' board. Stack a number of tiles of your chosen type from your personal supply on that space equal to the number shown on that space, then place your declaration token on top of the stack so that the type of the tiles beneath it remains visible. Once placed, a declaration token (and the tiles under it) cannot be moved or used. You may choose a type of tile that has already been previously chosen by another player.<br/><br/>Note: This module is not compatible with solo mode.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Evolve is a 'build-your-own animal' card game for 2-6 players based on scientific principles -- perfect for gamers, families, and classrooms.<br/><br/>Each epoch you'll mutate your creature to face one of 15 Biomes and 21 unique Challenges in your quest for dominance over your competitors.<br/><br/>What if a meteor strikes, or an ice age overtakes the planet? Can you successfully build a nest to impress your mate, or convince those strange 2-legged creatures that you'd make a good candidate for domestication?<br/><br/>Based on the cards you play, creatures are rated on 4 attributes (aggression, resilience, allure, &amp; gathering), and can also have over a dozen different special abilities (flying, swimming, climbing, desert survival, etc.).<br/><br/>Evolutionary pressure will determine how fast you can change -- a creature less well suited to its environment has all the more reason to change! And who knows how long favorable conditions will prevail? You need to strike a fine balance between dominating your competition now, and preparing for the future.<br/><br/>Evolve is a fast-paced card game taking 1 hour or less to play. It is fun and suitable for adults who like &quot;euro-style&quot; games or card games. Who doesn't want to build animals? It's also educational, and suitable as a classroom or family-style game (kids aged ~10 or younger may require guidance).<br/><br/>",

Schools of salmon swim upstream, wildflowers and lush ferns dot the mossy floor, and a gray wolf looks for its next meal. In Canopy: Evergreen, players compete to grow the tallest trees, collect sets of wild plants, and create bountiful habitats to help native animals thrive.<br/><br/>In the game, players take turns selecting new cards for their forest from three growth piles. Each time you look at a pile, you may select it and add those cards to your rainforest tableau, or return the pile face down, adding one additional card to it. As the piles grow, you must search for the plants and animals that will benefit your forest the most &mdash; but choose carefully as mingled in with the flora and fauna are dangers in the form of fire, disease, and drought. After three seasons, the player who has grown the most bountiful rainforest wins!<br/><br/>Canopy: Evergreen is a standalone game featuring card drafting and set collection similar to the original Canopy game, with new rules for collecting food, growing trees on your forest board to gain permanent bonuses, and nourishing interactive wildlife. Get lost in the evergreen forest with new plants, animals, and environmentally-friendly 3D tree tokens that grow while you play the game!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Play: All players simultaneously lay face down in front of them one card from their hand. Cards in front of a player are not turned face up unless cards played during the game state otherwise. Players may look at their own face down cards at any time. Once all players have placed a card, each player beginning with the Start Player, may, in turn, use the &lsquo;reveal&rsquo; action of one card. When players each have 2 cards left in their hand they will play one card and discard the other and the game will end.<br/><br/>2. Pass: All players then pass the rest of their hand clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the Start Player&rsquo;s choice. The player to the Start Player&rsquo;s left is the next round&rsquo;s Start Player.<br/><br/>Some cards allow you to keep a card(s) or your whole hand. Those cards always supercede the Pass rules. Players may never take an eL, aheM, NO! or Peeking card from another player.<br/><br/>Once all cards have been played, all players turn over all remaining face down cards, add up victory points and adjust scores with bonus modifiers.

The highest card played in a non-lead suit will win the trick, with the tie going to the later card.  The winner collects all cards played to the trick.<br/><br/>The cards won go towards increasing the size of that player's &quot;slime&quot;.  However, at the end of a hand, players will score points for the size of their slime (sum of the collected ranks) in relation to 100.  Points earned can be 0, 1, 2, 4 or 6.  For instance, if the sum of the player's cards won is larger than 100, the slime has collapsed and a player only receives 1 point.  If multiple players have a size less than 100, then the smallest of these is declared the Worst of the Small Slime and earns 0 points.<br/><br/>The game lasts 3 hands and the player with the highest cumulative points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules:<br/><br/>&quot;Dog Fight very closely approaches an actual combat between fighting planes, bombers and anti-aircraft guns. The play takes place on a vertical board which allows the important consideration of altitude to become a part of the play. The planes against the sunset sky make a most realistic picture.<br/><br/>&quot;By making use of the allowable moves of the planes and of the spinner which controls 'Hits' it is the purpose of each contestant to silence the anti-aircraft fire of his opponents and to disable and put out of play his opponent's aircraft. Players accomplish this by obtaining proper position with their planes and diving on or shooting down opponents and bombing anti-aircraft guns.&quot;<br/><br/>The game board is a vertical piece of cardboard in which the wings of miniature aircraft are inserted to give a feel of the current layout of aircraft.<br/><br/>(Note that this is different from the 1963 game of the same name.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This fine game was published in 1972 in Panzerfaust magazine, with an unmounted map in four sections, unstapled rulebook in two sheets, and unmounted two-sided counters -- one of the very first (if not the first) wargames to use two-sided counters for step reduction. Fortunately, a mounted die-cut set of counters was available for like $1 additional, so we were spared the nightmare of trying to hand-mount two-sided counters &lt;shudder&gt;.<br/><br/>The Mapsheet consists of four sections (mine are hand-glued into one map) showing the island of Sicily, in light and dark blue and light and dark brown on white paper, 19&quot; x 27&quot; assembled. The Combat Results table (from 1-4 to 7-1), Terrain Effects chart (six types), Time Record track (12 four-day turns), Unit Designations Within Divisions chart (initial Axis), German Order Of Battle chart (reinforcements and &quot;What If?&quot; units), and Allied Order of Battle chart (initial and reinforcements) are all printed on the mapsheet. The starting Axis locations for the historical scenario are printed on the map, as are the historical and alternate Allied landing sites.<br/><br/>The Rulebook assembles into 8 pages. Front is picture, title and credits. Second page is historical info (&quot;Introduction&quot;). The next four pages are rules and victory conditions. Then 1/2-page of (six) alternate scenarios, 1/2 page of designer's notes, and 1/2-page of bibliography (on the last page, with instructions for assembling the mapsheet).<br/><br/>Units are mostly regiments and brigades (or similarly-sized kampfgruppen), with some battalions, some Italian divisions, and an Army HQ for each army (4). There are 120 of the 1/2&quot; counters -- 22 Americans (olive green, 3 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 18 British and Canadians (dark olive green, 1 is Army HQ), 39 Italians (yellow, 3 are divisions, 11 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 25 Germans (tan, 1 battalion, 1 Army HQ), and 16 blanks, some of each color. The mounted counters are unique in that the full-strength side is printed on what is normally considered the back of the counter. While it doesn't look as nice, it does actually facilitate handling the counters - they are easier to pick up. Another idea that never caught on.<br/><br/>This is not a complex game, more along the lines of the old Conflict games. The game sequence is 1. Allied airdrops; 2. Allies move; 3. Allied combat and post-combat moves; 4. Axis airdrops; 5. Axis moves; 6. Axis combat and post-combat moves. ZOCs are fluid for movement and rigid for combat. Combat is odds-based, with step losses, retreats and advances indicated for both attacker and defender. For example, at 1-1 odds, the results are: 1. Att 1 step retr 1, Def adv 1; 2. Att 2 steps retr 2, Def adv 1; 3. Att 1 step, Def 1 step retr 1; 4. no effect; 5. Def retr 1; 6. Def 1 step, retr 2. Stacking is 3 regt/brig. Rules for invasions, airdrops, supply, evacuations, and naval support fire are all simple and non-cluttered.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect is Italian desertion. On turn one, the Axis player must roll for every Italian non-infantry unit, losing it to desertion on a 3-6 on 1D6. The Italian infantry are sturdier, and will not desert unless attacked at 3-1 or more with no German unit within three hexes.<br/><br/>Victory conditions are based on three elements: Italian desertion, casualties, and cities held. Levels of victory are: Axis wins if he has more than 3/4 of Allied points, decisively if equal or more; game is drawn if Axis has less than 3/4 but at least 2/3 of Allies points; otherwise Allies win. Also, the Axis win immediately if they destroy both the US 7th Army and UK 8th Army HQs (not bloody likely).<br/><br/>I can't believe no one ever listed this game before. It is one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>",

During strategic rounds (representing one quarter of a year) the hacendados bid on investments, construct enterprises, bribe troops, plot revolutions, and spy on each other.  During tactical rounds (each a single day) the players move their troops, indians, bandidos, railguns and policia around the map to harass (tax, kidnap, arrest, burn) one another and to protect their own enterprises.<br/><br/>The hex map covers a large swath of northern mexico and the southwest US... ranging from El Fuerte Sinaloa in the South, to Florence, Arizona to the North, to Yuma, Arizona in the West and El Paso, Texas in the East.  Each hex is 10 miles.  Players moving units in tactical rounds must contend with all of the hazards the wild west has to offer via an event table.<br/><br/>Semi-cooperative play is often rewarded, as there are no rules regarding transactions and deals that can be made, and many enterprises are highly dangerous and the risk is often best distributed among multiple players.  There can, however, only be one winner... and deals are only as good as your ability to enforce them with strength of arms.  Welcome to Mexico.<br/><br/>Players can run for office, lead revolutions, or become bandit leaders, but the hacendado with the most gold (ill-gotten or otherwise) at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Lords of the Sierra Madre (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

Six hexes, located along the outer edge of the board, are labelled with a letter. Players, on their turn, add a path of their colour that connects two adjacent hexes and a wall that blocks a path from being built there. In addition, players may convert a path to a wall and a wall into a path. Eventually, the six lettered hexes will be connected by a network of paths. At this point, the game ends. There will be three scoring routes on the board. Each scoring route connects a pair of letters and usually contains paths owned by more than one player. Players score one point for each path they own along each route. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>To assemble the print-and-play version, simply print the board, insert it into a plastic sheet protector, and use dry erase markers to draw paths and walls. Alternatively, print one of the other boards, which have smaller dimensions but larger hexes, and use Settlers of Catan roads as paths and small counters as walls.<br/><br/>",

Now everyone is either dead, green or heading for the hills, leaving you as the only eligible edible brain for 100 miles. Your only hope is to fix up an old broken down jeep and high tail it out of there before the wormsuits mob you. If you can dig up enough spare parts, ammo and courage, you just might make it out alive. So get out there, start scroungin' and don't stop shootin'! Or, throw in with the zombies and race to shut down all the escape routes before the human can make his getaway. Just keep jamming corpses in there until you dogpile your dinner - then open up the brain buffet! Either way, pick a side and get a move on, because if it's one thing you can say about these rampaging, ravenous undead, they're... RELENTLESS!<br/><br/>Relentless is a 2 (or more) player card game simulating a zombie uprising in the remote rural town of Pittsville, AZ. The Human Player controls the sole survivor of the uprising and attempts to escape the zombie-infested town by repairing a broken down jeep and burning rubber out of there. The zombies, controlled by the Zombie Player, attempt to stop him by cutting off the three escape routes that lead safely out of town.<br/><br/>The game is quick to learn, easy to play, fast-paced and action packed.  It's loaded with cool artwork and witty banter and is great for beginners or veterans. It also features multiple modes of play, including co-op, team, solo and even scenarios.<br/><br/>",

But beneath the calm fa&ccedil;ade the council is locked in a deadly battle for mastery. Your reputation for resourcefulness has seen you hired to help elevate one of the councilors by acts of charity, bribery, or violence. The only problem is that the agent who hired you was recently found stabbed under a hedge, and hadn't yet got around to mentioning which of the three councilors is paying you. Can you use your wits to deduce who your patron is and elevate him or her to rule the city?<br/><br/>The Council of Colbridge is based on a unique combination of imperfect information, deduction and constrained action. Each player knows the patron of at least one other player, but not their own. Each turn players select actions (charity, bribery or violence) and how these balance with the previous actions of the other players determines which councillor advances in power. By watching and analysing the actions of others, players may deduce who their patron is and push them to power. But what if someone was bluffing? The resulting atmosphere of calculation and suspicion is reminiscent of a political thriller.<br/><br/>",

First off the players determine initiative with a unique dice-off system in which ties award the initiative to whomever lacked it the previous turn and applying the Commander's Focus to the roll might tilt the odds in your favor. Next, players will draw a scenario-designated  number (usually just one) of Action Cards that may be used for anything from artillery strikes, through rally assists, to negating the opponent's just-played card. Then it is time to rally disrupted units with a simple 1d6 roll against a nationality or scenario-designated morale. Action Cards, in addition to the special Aid chit, may be used to improve a unit's chances of preparing for combat.<br/><br/>And then all hell breaks lose...<br/><br/>It's the Fire Phase and players alternate firing with individual units or stacks of units against in-range and in-sight enemy units. When firing on the enemy tanks, the target's Armor Factor is subtracted from the firing unit's Armor Piercing Factor, two dice are rolled, and the results checked on the appropriate column on the Fire Results Table, yielding a number of potential hits. The target rolls a die for each potential hit and compares it to his or her morale. Pass the morale check, that hit is negated. Of course all these columns and die rolls can be modified by the target's terrain, flanking fire, the Focus marker (represents the commander's presence), and most importantly Action Cards, which can call for supporting fire (artillery, airstrike), grant column shifts or even allow the same unit to fire again, adding a delicious uncertainty that makes the game thrilling to play. Players continue to alternate attacks until neither wishes to attack.<br/><br/>Next comes the Movement Phase. Unlike the preceding Fire Phase, one player moves ALL his eligible units before the opposition gets to move. Certain units can move and fire or vice versa (with a penalty), unfired opposing units can opportunity fire on enemies moving within their line of sight. As in many other facets of the game, the insightful play of Action Cards during the movement phase is critical, allowing additional movement or opportunity fire conducted by units that have already fired. No PanzerBush tactics here, you never know when a unit will be able to fire on you. Exciting stuff.<br/><br/>Finally we reach the Aid and Focus Phase. Platoon Commander eschews the use of HQs that can be unrealistically targeted. Instead both players have Aid and Focus markers, representing where the commander intends to place emphasis or send additional assets (ammunition, weapons, etc) or first aid. The placement of these markers provides combat and morale bonuses to the units underneath them. Additionally, if the player chooses, the Focus marker can be used to influence the initiative roll.<br/><br/>And that's a turn of Platoon Commander.<br/><br/>Platoon Commander: Poland Strikes comes with three scenarios, 18 Action Cards, 88 counters and a 17&quot; x 11&quot; playing map gorgeously illustrated by Ilya Kudryashov, representing the Poland-Hungary border. The scenarios range from Polish Motor Rifle units, led by BMPs, OT-64, Infantry and Sagger teams, assaulting border crossings to massive armor battles pitting dozens of Polish T-72s against aging Hungarian T-55s and T-34/85s and even a handful of T-72s. It's a cold-war-goes-hot tactical combat blast from our Madonna-rich past. If you like tanks, dice, and fun, you'll love Poland Strikes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Windhoek is a wargame of the campaign in which British Empire forces, mainly from the Union of South Africa, conquered the German colony of Southwest Africa. In the original campaign, the British won within ten months, but the campaign could have gone differently, as von Lettow-Vorbeck demonstrated in German East Africa. This is a two-player game, in which one side commands the Germans, and the other Allied forces (including South Africa, British and Portuguese colonial). The Allied player must win the game quickly, while the Germans win by delaying the Allies beyond the historical time frame. The central game mechanism is Action Points (AP). These are a quantification of each side's command and logistical capabilities. Players expend AP to recruit units and conduct various military operations. The game has two levels: The Standard Rules, which give a quick wargame, and the Advanced Rules, which give more realism and complexity. Windhoek includes 176 5/8 inch counters and a 22 x 34&rdquo; map with each hex representing approximately 25 miles .<br/><br/>S&amp;T #313, Nov-Dec 2018<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

Carnivores eat other Dinos and score from the rising body count while Herbivores grow the Herd, and earn points by defending it against the Carnivore's onslaught.

Or, you can play a Viking card on an enemy squad to kill enemy warrior (to discard this card). At the end of round, players will summ the strengths of their squads of warriors and player who creates strongest squad will receive victory point(s). The game is played up to 5 victory points.<br/><br/>Instead of play a Viking card you can sacrifice your warriors to summon ancient gods with powerful game-changing abilities.<br/><br/>The game consists of series of rounds, as result of which one of the players scores 5 victory points and ends the game, so it is important to correctly calculate strength of your cards in each round.<br/><br/>Wolves of Odin has simple rules, but serious dilemmas arise every turn. Multiple layers of strategies create a wealth of tactical possibilities. There is also unusual passing system in the game: when a player passes, he draws new 4 cards into his hand from the deck, and every time his turn reaches him, he again draws 1 card into his hand and then discard 1 card from his hand. Thus, while other players are depleting their strength in the current round, passing player is building up power for the next round...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players. When you attack, if you're outside Tokyo, you hit whoever is in Tokyo; if you're in Tokyo, you hit everyone else! If someone's health drops to 0, they're out of the game. (You can't heal damage while in Tokyo, and the only way to leave town is to have someone attack you...which might put you at death's door.)<br/><br/>When you gain energy, you store it in cubes, which you can use to purchase power cards, which have a permanent or temporary effect.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gone Bunkers is a strategy card game. Players take turns building the ultimate hand until someone draws a war card and cannot defeat it. The deck is made up of all types of cards such as; troops, zombies, landmines and of course nukes! Even though your goal is to survive and fight off the war cards, it doesn't mean you can't nuke the player sitting next to you and destroy half their hand.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>Players take turns by drawing and playing cards until a WAR card is drawn from the deck. Once a WAR card is drawn, that player must defeat that WAR card. Be diplomatic to avoid the WAR, try to fight or be destroyed.<br/><br/>Taking your turn:<br/>Gather all your cards into your hand and look at them. Do one of the following:<br/>1. Draw from the draw pile. If it is a WAR card you can either play Diplomacy card and avoid the WAR or go to WAR and use your troops to defeat the WAR card. You must have the same or greater attack value (attack values are on troop cards) to win the WAR. If you cannot beat the WAR card's value, you lose.<br/>2.Play a card FACE UP on the discard pile and follow the instructions on the card. Note: Zombie cards are placed in front of players not on the discard pile.<br/><br/>Winning the game:<br/>Players will take turns drawing cards, builing their armies and surviving wars. Once one person loses all their cards then the person with the highest attack value (count up your troops attack values) left wins.<br/><br/>Gameplay variations:<br/>Fight to the Death<br/>Play until there is only one player left<br/><br/>15 Round Limit<br/>Play 15 rounds and whomever has the highest attack value left wins<br/><br/>Gameplay Modes:<br/>2 Player Mode<br/>Start with 7 cards each. Each time a WAR card is drawn and a player wins at WAR or plays Diplomacy, put that WAR card back into the deck at random. This will ensure a player loses without the going through the entire deck.<br/><br/>Safe Haven Mode (Fan Favorite)<br/>Do the same initial &quot;Game Setup&quot; except before putting the WAR cards back in the deck, place two cards, per player, face down on the side. Then, complete the regualar game setup and put those extra cards, per player, on top of the deck. This will ensure that each player gets two &quot;safe&quot; turns before a WAR card can be drawn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost Bible is a take on the game Lost Legacy with the story and characters from the game Bible Hunter. It contains two sets of 16 cards: The Dead Seas Scrolls and The Last Supper. It also contains a promo card for the latter, Crucified Christ.<br/><br/>It plays the same way as the previous games in the Lost Legacy family. However, unlike the other sets, the cards in this game may not be mixed and matched with any of the previous sets as they have a different card back bearing the Lost Bible title.<br/><br/>Rules Summary<br/><br/>Lost Bible is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.<br/>     Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.<br/>     Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.<br/>     End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Bible&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the &quot;Lost Bible&quot; card, then everybody loses.<br/><br/><br/>",

It details a ship that is about to set sail, the amount of cargo it carries, and the price you must pay for this information.<br/><br/>Starting with a limited amount of cargo you must first recruit help from an untrustworthy bunch of smugglers. Each smuggler has a unique ability, some bad habits, and a limit to the amount of cargo they can carry.<br/><br/>Together you must then attempt to lure a ship onto the treacherous rocks, known as The Devil&rsquo;s Teeth, in the hope that you can salvage more cargo.

Tiny Battle Publishing's game has new art, refined rules, die-cut counters.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>AMERICAN TROOPS ADVANCE ON MONTREAL<br/><br/>MARINE LANDINGS THREATEN HALIFAX, COUNTERED BY ROYAL NAVY<br/><br/>MONTREAL, September 1, 1939 (Roto-Reuters News Service, Earl Dixon reporting):<br/><br/>American President-for-Life Hugh Johnson's threats over securing unfettered access to the St. Lawrence River became deeds yesterday as troops of the American 1st and 27th Divisions lurched across the border into Canada. Elements of a United States Marine Corps brigade are reported to have landed at the small town of French Village, west of Halifax, and are advancing on the city.<br/><br/>Canadians were summoned to defend their homeland by the newly-appointed Defence Minister, John E. Mitchell.<br/><br/>&quot;We will not permit these American scoundrels to pave our paradise and put up a parking lot,&quot; Mitchell warned. &quot;All true Canadians will rise to defend our unique culture and way of life in this, our country's hour of need.&quot; (Mitchell was shortly thereafter the subject of a Vote of Censure by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for having failed to make his remarks in French.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, all units of the Non-Permanent Active Militia in all Militia Districts have received mobilization orders, though transport and equipment are lacking. Volunteer battalions have spontaneously formed in Montreal and Halifax as university students, local police, townsmen and farmers band together to resist the invasion. And the majesty of the British Empire has begun to make itself felt: a battalion of British troops are reported to have arrived at Quebec City; even more encouraging are sightings of Royal Navy and American ships engaged in heavy exchanges of fire off Halifax.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>WAR PLAN CRIMSON is a simulation game of a hypothetical invasion of Canada by the United States some time between 1935 and 1939. The game is for two players, one representing the leader of the armed forces of the United States that could be deployed against Canada (the US player) and the other representing the commander of the Canadian and British forces that would defend against a foreign invasion (the Commonwealth or CW player).<br/><br/>In reality, both countries have enjoyed cordial relations but it is also historical fact that the United States Army did make plans to invade Canada, in the context of the &lsquo;Rainbow&rsquo; war plans where potential enemy countries were referenced by colours (Japan was orange, Britain red, and Canada crimson - whence the title of the game).  In most cases these plans were created, studied and maintained in order to keep staff officers sharp, but the strategic priorities of an actual plan submitted for consideration in 1935 (seizing Halifax and Montreal in a quick campaign before Britain could intervene decisively) are the obvious ones and have been used as the basic framework for the action in this game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ambition is a trick taking standard deck playing card game. It was invented by Indie designer Mike Church whose stated goal was to create a trick game where the role of chance (&quot;hand-luck&quot;) was as small as possible.<br/><br/>The usual object is to avoid taking the most points in a round and, secondarily, to score as many as possible up to that. (That is, if the 120 points split 42-34-25-19, it's best to be the '34' and worst to be the '42'.) Bonuses, known as Nil and Slam, are given respectively for taking no points or for taking 75+. Thus, almost any hand dealt has some strategy: few terrible hands exist.<br/><br/>Ambition is as much a game of players, and the interactions of their varying strategic objectives, as of cards.<br/><br/>For improvement's sake, the inventor has updated the game several times since its first publication in November 2003. The most recent rules were published in July 2012.<br/><br/>",

This game is a turn based in which each player will take turns moving, firing and charging.  There are multiple ways to win according to what style of game you are playing.  There are &quot;take and hold&quot; battles where you must capture key objectives around the battlefield in a specified amount of turns or simply play a &quot;total destruction&quot; game where you must destroy the enemy and run them from the tabletop!<br/><br/>The miniatures are 10mm in scale and pre-painted and are ready for battle right out of the box.  The Severed Union Rulebook is free to download from our the Gordon &amp; Hague website.  There is an advanced 40 page rulebook for veteran war-gamers and there is also a 4 page quick-start rulebook for newcomers and children.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are based mainly around dice rolling and measuring.  Maneuvering your units is also very important as you receive bonuses for being on high-ground and in or behind protective cover such as fences, buildings and forests.<br/><br/>",

Some of my goals:<br/><br/>Spread the board a little and improve a handful of the &quot;bottleneck&quot; and &quot;bypass&quot; areas with a bit more grid-like access, particularly useful for playing with 4-5 players<br/>    Significantly add to the set of routes, making the game play a little more like the 1910 expansion to the original Ticket to Ride U.S. map.<br/>    Improve on the already well-done aesthetics if I could, while we were at it.<br/><br/>Armed with Adobe tools and an extended family of ravenous Ticket to Ride fanatics who would test play the revised board and ticket sets in their various drafts, I went to work.  After a number of months, we settled on an updated board layout and a ticket set that makes for a lot of fun - and a lot of ticket gathering!<br/><br/>",

The game has a good setting and simple mechanics.<br/><br/>In RIOT, the player has to choose a side (Police or Rioters) and attempt to rule the streets of the city by maintaining control of different areas in a situation that seems out of any control.<br/><br/>The game is one of factions that have different powers. The four factions portrayed in the game are: Autonomous, Anarchists, Nationalists and Police. The game is turn-based and ends when a faction reaches its goal. The four factions have their own specific markers, powers, and goals.<br/><br/>RIOT is a card-driven game of area control and worker placement. The clashes between the various forces occur on the streets of the city with the aim of occupying buildings.<br/><br/>In summary, the Rioters struggle for control of the district of the city, while the Police try to block them. On the Rioter's turn, the faction of troublemakers can pursue various actions based on the buildings they control. The Police instead follow different rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An entertaining dice game about addition and substraction in a number range between +20 and -20 for 2 to 4 players from age 8.<br/>Each player selects 2 cards and puts them down before him. Each card shows 5 fields with dice printed in them. Some fields offer chances to gain points, others are traps and have to be avoided. Players score by being fast in putting down a line of 10 dice in 10 different colurs by placing them cleverly under theeir two cards.<br/>To start the game, the 66 coloured dice are cast. Then the players play simultaneously. Each player grabs 10 dice one by one and forms his line of 10 dice in 10 different colours. As speed is a decisive factor players tend to make mistakes when arranging their dice and get trapped by the trap fields. This, of course, is part of the fun and motivates to do less mistakes in the next playthrough.<br/>There are 2 versions of the game: an easier one with two levels for players from age 8 ++, which is called &quot;Farbenspiel&quot;, and a version and an even more challenging version with 4 levels for players from age 12 ++ (called &quot;Etappenspiel&quot;).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Story:<br/>the 17th century, Ottoman Turk Empire, one of the most powerful states at that time, marched west to Austria and because of that, Arabs began to bring coffee into Europe. From that moment on, coffee has become one of the most popular drinks in the world. Then hundreds of years have passed, and even though travel between universes has become a daily routine like taking buses, coffee has spread from Earth to different Space Cities, the colonial satellites in outer space. Enjoying a cup of high-quality coffee every day has become the most anticipated thing for residents of Space Cities every day.<br/><br/>After hundreds of years passed, a space expedition led by Dr. Brent Tully discovered an organic material called &quot;Stardust&quot;. By adding only a small amount of this magic ingredient, the flavors and aroma of any coffee are greatly enhanced. Moreover, the more freshly picked Stardust, the more it can improve the quality of coffee. This triggered a coffee revolution! In pursuit of the ultimate flavors, many new expeditions have been established on different Space Cities with the goal of &quot;seeking the freshest Stardust and ingredients for the first time and delivering the most delicious coffee&quot;. Beside the danger of sailing the spaceship across the galaxy, there is a robber called &quot;Galaxy Pirates&quot;, which is more threatening to them...<br/><br/>Game Aim:<br/>In Stardust Coffee, you control a space expedition and sail your spaceships across the Galaxy. You collect different ingredients for coffee making and score by delivering the coffee back to your Starbase. Collecting Stardust and adding them to your coffee is another way to boost your Victory Points (VPs). By upgrading your spaceships, you could also speed up your collection of ingredients or Stardust.<br/>When the game goes on, the Galaxy Pirates will attack your Spaceships and rob your ingredients. By fighting back the Galaxy Pirates, you get Honor points and it will be another source of scoring. Only the player who could manage the Spaceships the best would gain most VPs to win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ASG Baseball is a tabletop baseball simulation which uses individual batter and pitcher cards and dice to accurately recreate games between Major League Baseball teams. The game's distinctivie design feature is that batter-pitcher encounters are resolved by rolling the dice and consulting the pitcher's card. In some cases the outcome of the play is determined directly from the pitcher's card. In other cases the pitcher's card may direct you to a specific column (one of six) on the batter's card for the play result. The columns on the batter's card are organized to reflect the batter's normal, above-normal, and below normal batting average and slugging percentage.  Advocates of the game argue that dominant pitchers are more realistically simulated by this play design in that they exert more control over the outcome of each at bat than is the case for better-known baseball boardgames such as APBA and Strat-O-Matic.<br/><br/>ASG also includes clutch hitting, errors, fielders' range, fielders' arm strength, infielders' double play ability, catchers' pitch calling, balks, wild pitches, stolen bases, stamina and unusual plays.<br/><br/>The game was introduced in 1973 with player cards based upon the 1972 major league season.  The following year the company issued player cards based upon the 1973 season.  Afterward, faced with demands from the Major League Players Association for royalty payments for the use of player and team names, the game creator ceased production until the game was resurrected by 3W Games in the late 1980's.  Later, the board game was adapted to the personal computer and the software was sold under the name Diamond Dreams.  As of 2011 neither the boardgame nor the computer version is being produced and marketed.<br/><br/>",

Players have three rolls to catch a fish by rolling a head, a tail (worth 10 points together), and various sized bodies that add to the score of the fish.  The goal is to catch and score the largest fish possible.  Players have to choose which dice to keep and which dice to re-roll on their second and third rolls. One side of the dice contains a small panfish, which is worth only one point, and cannot be re-rolled.  However, if a player manages to roll all 5 panfish, the player proclaims a FISHFRY! and the other players have to &quot;FRY-UP&quot; their fish. Players often have the choice to push their luck, and try for larger fish.  <br/>   The game plays well as a quick pass-time or as a gambling game with a little more strategy than other simple gambling dice games.  Included are rules for one-round games, as well as multiple round fishing tournaments.<br/><br/>",

These numerals indicate the valences. Three of the stones are worth a point. <br/>Two count respectively for two points. Two stones are worth minus one point.<br/><br/>Each player receives the 10 magicians of his color and sets them on the appropriate colored start fields. The marking stones are set on the scoring section on the side. The wisemen are alternately placed. Red begins. The red player sets his own wiseman on an arbitrary free field. <br/>Flame fields may not be occupied.<br/><br/>It is inserted concealed. The opponent may not see, which stone is placed. Also after the stone is set, it remains concealed for the remainder of the game. Neither may examine any of the stones, either his own or the opponents, after the placement phase.<br/><br/>Variant<br/><br/>The game placement can also occur openly. The valences of the wisdoms are revealed as they are placed. Afterwards, they remain concealed for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>Movement<br/><br/>After all game stones in the game are inserted, the contest of the magicians begins. Alternately each player moves. Red begins. He can only move his magicians.<br/><br/>The magicians have three movement possibilities. In each round a movement can occur in only one of these three ways.<br/><br/>1. He may move his magician one square in any neighboring direction, pushing opponents figures accordingly, including the wisdom pieces, most desirably into the flame fields.<br/><br/>2. With his own magician he may jump over an adjacent game stone, whether it is his own or his opponents, or a magician or a wisdom. <br/>Multiple jumps are allowed. Also one can change direction during such a jump.<br/><br/>3. The magician moves between Space and Time. If one's magician stands at the board's edge, so one can move out from the square and emerge on the opposite side of the board again. A player can push another piece over the edge to the other side.<br/><br/>It is not allowed, to move figures off the edge of the board and back to their old places.<br/><br/>One can move magicians through fire spaces and they may also stand there. One's own wisdoms may not be pushed in the fire. Foreign wisdoms are burnt immediately, taken from the game and immediately scored.<br/><br/>Scoring is determined by the opponents wisdoms, which are pushed in the flame fields. The points are indicated on the scales at the board edge.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has burnt wisdoms of the adversary that are worth five points, the game is finished and the appropriate player is victorious.

He then turned around and force-marched back to the south of England to fight the Normans at Hastings. Unfortunately, after trudging 250 miles in nine days, his soldiers spent the night before the battle singing and drinking instead of resting. Senlac Hill is Norman Smith's nicely done desktop published simulation of the 1066 Battle of Hastings. Emphasis is on disordering the enemy. Good rules covering archers and feigned cavalry attacks. Scenarios include the historical set up with the Saxons waiting on Senlac Ridge and the Normans formed up in the valley below, an alternative scenario that allows the Normans more freedom in deploying their army and one that gives Harold the option of moving down onto the valley floor to force the Normans to fight across boggy ground.

        "description": "4th Street Baseball is a baseball simulation game using individual ratings to recreate big league baseball action.  Ratings are printed in booklet format on perforated cardstock.  They measure 3.5&quot; x 2.5&quot; (the same size as a bubble-gum card).<br/>   The game starts with the pitcher.  Each pitcher is rated for his ability to get the ball over the plate, the likelihood of him giving up the long ball, walk to strikeout ratio, hits allowed, etc.<br/>   Each hitter has been rated for average, extra-base potential, strikeouts and walks, base running, stealing, bunting, and lefty-righty hitting. In addition, pitchers and hitters are rated for defensive range, error frequency, outfielder-catcher arms, and infielders ability to turn the double play.<br/>   Five dice are employed in 4th Street Baseball...one twenty-sided (d20), two ten-sided (d10), and two six-sided (d6). <br/>   Play starts by determining the count.  The two d10 are rolled and the count is determined by looking at the pitcher's count column.  If the pitcher gets ahead in the count, his ratings, along with all of the defensive players behind him, increase.  If he falls behind, then the increase is instead given to the hitter.  The defense is allowed to position its players and selects a strategy card (fastball, breaking ball, pitchout, etc.).  The offense, likewise, selects a strategy card (hit and run, steal, etc.).  All five dice are rolled, the strategy cards are revealed, and the play continues by finding a &quot;matchup&quot; on the pitcher's card.  Matchups vary from balls hit to a specific fielder, to batter-pitcher battles, to ballpark and defensive positioning effects.  Once a matchup has been determined, the defender's rating is subtracted from the hitter's rating and the result is compared to the d20.  If the result is less than or equal to the d20, the hitter wins the matchup and the final result of the play is read off the hitter by adding the two d6 and referring to the appropriate column.  If the d20 result is higher, then the play result is found similarly on the defensive player.<br/><br/>The game comes with a book (or two books, depending upon the season) full of baseball player ratings which are perforated to 2.5&quot; x 3.5&quot; (the same size as a bubble-gum card), baseball fields (printed on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; card stock, for each team), dice, strategy cards, an easy-to-read results chart, and score sheets.  All players are rated for the 2005 season, except those with less than 25 at bats or innings pitched, or pitchers who had 2 or less starts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Don't Get Mad is an exciting, fast moving game where all players must stake points from the cards in their 'hand' on the outcome of general knowledge questions - or - on a unique variety of dice rolls. There are over 1,000 great questions from 70 wide ranging categories where most questions offer multiple choices. But before a player stakes any points, all they will know on any question, is its subject and how many possible choices there are! The most unusual (mischievous) quirk allows players to choose whether they wish to Play or to Pass (to an opponent) or to make challenges. Whatever the 'in-player' decides to do, they will always decide on the number of points that are to be staked. Unlike; with most other board game 'classics'; no player can ever go 'OUT' of the game until the game is fully over!<br/><br/>Players: 2-6 or teams.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from publishers website<br/><br/>Noble Blood is a game of vampire herd management and minion acquisition. Players take on the roles of vampire lords vying for control of their city. In order to win the game, players will compete to accrue the most bountiful herd of humans to feed on and create a team of vampire minions capable of earning you the power and influence you will need to come out on top.<br/><br/>Play centers around vampires taking turns drafting humans from a central 'City' area consisting of 6 or 8 cards. Once taken, humans become part of your herd and can be fed on (feeding on humans does not kill them) or turned into vampire minions(each card has a human side and a vampire side). Every action in the game requires the expenditure of blood, so it is important to have plenty of big humans to feed on. But it is also important to turn members of your herd into vampire minions that might have a good turn order, the right influence symbol, or a power that you need.<br/><br/>Each vampire gets its own turn and its own specific place in the turn order so every time a player makes a new vampire, he or she gets another turn every round. Each vampire is unique and most have some kind of special power that can be used to a players advantage.<br/><br/>At the end of the game players receive points for the number of vampires under their control, the amount of blood in their possession, and the amount of influence they have acquired.<br/><br/><br/>",

In the East, however, conflicts between rival factions regularly erupt into open warfare. In India, the British Raj faces the machinations of rebellious maharajahs, Russian agents and a resurgent Thuggee cult. In China, the Celestial Court weaves a complex web of plots and alliances to counter both the external threat of the Great Powers and the internal menaces of mutinous warlords and an ancient power that has arisen and seeks to return to the Jade Throne. Across the pirate-infested South China Sea, Japan has established itself as a new Great Power and is starting to forge its own empire despite unrest from rebels and insurgents at home. Throughout the entire region treasure-seekers, mercenaries and adventurers of all stripes take advantage of the chaos to seek glory and riches.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Four Wizards is a new version of a classic card-shedding game. Players draw and discard their way to an empty hand, laying down a variety of cards designed around a medieval theme. Each deck comes with 72 cards and supports a game of 2-4 players. Included are 48 Medieval Unit Cards (4 Colored Factions: Blue Cross, Green Star, Red &amp; Gold, and Purple Chevron).<br/><br/>In addition to the 48 Unit cards, there are 16 Wizards (4 different classes for each colored faction), and 6 Plague Cards. Plague Cards do not belong to any color; therefore, they cannot be discarded, ONLY PURGED. Plague Cards were created to prevent you from getting rid of all your cards. There are several ways to remove these cards from your hand (see Wizard Cards). Part of the fun is discovering these various methods of &quot;purging&quot; the Plague.<br/><br/>Wizard Cards are played in the same manner as the other Colored Units. For example, a Blue Wizard can be played on top of any Blue Unit or on top of any other Wizard. There are four types of Wizard Cards, each with their own unique action.<br/><br/>Swap-A-Hand Wizard - When you play this Wizard, swap your hand with the hand of another player. The choice of which player to Swap-A- Hand with is yours. Once the &ldquo;swap&rdquo; has occurred, play continues to the next player in turn.<br/><br/>Draw Two Wizard - When you play this Wizard, the next player must draw 2 cards. The player who draws the additional cards will still be able to play their turn. If they do not have a playable card after Drawing Two, they must continue to Draw until they draw a card that can be played. A turn is determined complete when a card has been played.<br/><br/>Purge-A-Card Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ANY card of your choice from your hand. Place the card of your choice facedown on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. The card has now been PURGED.<br/><br/>Purge-The-Plague Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ONLY Plague Cards from your hand. However there is no limit to how many Plague Cards you can discard. Place the Plague Card(s) face up on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. *The two &quot;Purge&quot; Wizard cards are the ONLY cards that can remove Plague Cards from your hand and therefore the game. Also important is the ability of the &quot;Purge-A-Card&quot; Wizard to remove ANY card from the game. The ability to remove Any card allows various opportunities to develop. In fact, sometimes the best play might not be to PURGE a Plague card. The choice is yours...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kendo Duel is a strategy card game that can be played in two game modes: the &ldquo;Duel&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Competition&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In &ldquo;Duel&rdquo; game mode 2-4 players can play together. They fight each other without drawing new cards during the game. The winner is the last player who has a card in one&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>In the game mode &ldquo;Competition&rdquo; only 2 players can play and it is similar to a real kendo competition: the players can get ippons (points) and hansokus (penalty points), and the winner is the one who receives the second ippon (point) first.<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/><br/>Attacking cards: MEN, KOTE, DO, TSUKI<br/>(4&times;3: 12 cards) &ndash; in a brown frame<br/>Counterattacking cards: the combinations of the basic attacks above (4&times;4: 16 cards)- in a brown frame<br/>Reinforcing cards: JODAN, SEME (2&times;2: 4 cards) &ndash; in a red frame<br/>Cards against reinforcing cards: MUSHIN, SEIGAN (2&times;2: 4 cards) &ndash; in a purple frame<br/>Cards to defelct an attack: TAI SABAKI, KAMAE, FUDOSHIN (3&times;2: 6 cards) &ndash; in a blue frame<br/>Cards to parry an attack: TSUBAZERIAI, BOGYO (2&times;3: 6 cards) &ndash; in a green frame<br/>Alternative attacking cards: TAIATARI, MAKI AGE &ndash; (2&times;2:4 cards) &ndash; in a yellow frame<br/>Ippon marks on one card (1 card): the marks to show the points must be cut out before the start<br/>Penalty marks on one card (HANSOKU, 1 card): it must be also cut out before the start<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I. RULES OF THE GAME MODE DUEL<br/>- Cards needed: the whole deck except JIKAN DESU, HANSOKU marks, IPPON marks<br/>- Number of players: 2-4<br/>- Duration: 4-5 min. with 2 players<br/><br/>Starting the game<br/>1. Before the start the following cards should be discarded from the deck: JIKAN DESU, HANSOKU marks, IPPON marks. The other cards should be divided into 3 subdecks:<br/>a. Basic attacks (Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki)<br/>b. Counterattacks<br/>c. All other cards<br/><br/>These subdecks should be shuffled and placed to the marks on the gameboard face-down.<br/><br/>2. Deal 3x basic attacks (Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki), 4x counterattacks and 5x from the other cards to each player.<br/>3. At the beginning, players can switch any 2 of their cards to other cards, each from its own subdeck. The new card should be drawn from the top of the subdeck and your switched card should be put under it. Switching a card is not compulsory.<br/>4. Add the numbers on your basic attack cards: the player with a higher result starts the first attack. If more players got the same total, switch the card with the lowest number on it to a new one from its own subdeck. Examine your totals again.<br/>5. You can start a new or first attack with the following cards and combinations:<br/>    - Men, Kote, Do, Tsuki attacks: a) alone or b) together with one reinforcing card (Jodan or Seme)<br/>    - Other attacking cards (Taiatari, Maki age). These two can only be played alone without reinforcing cards.<br/>6. An attack aiming a certain part of the body can always be countered with a same attacking card or an appropriate counterattack card. For example, a single MEN attack can be countered with the same MEN card, or a counterattack, which answers, so starts with MEN. A counterattack can also be answered with another appropriate counterattack or single attack card, and so on.<br/><br/>However, if you answer a counterattack with a basic attack card, your opponent can then start a new attack and does not need to answer your card.<br/><br/>7. If you are attacked with a single attack with a MEN, KOTE&hellip; etc. or a counterattack; OR a basic attack reinforced with a JODAN or SEME card, you must always react to it.<br/><br/>- If you are attacked with a basic attack with a reinforcing card, you must react to the reinforcing one first. You can try to neutralize it, deflect or reflect it. If you can&rsquo;t do any of these, your opponent pulls one card from you and can use it as one&rsquo;s own.<br/>- After reacting to a reinforcing card, you must react to the basic attack, too.<br/>- If you can&rsquo;t react to a MEN, KOTE, DO, TSUKI attack / counterattack, you lose two cards to your attacker.<br/>- If you are attacked with a TAIATARI or MAKI AGE card, and you have no valid card against it, you lose one card to your opponent, which he or she may choose without seeing your cards.<br/><br/>8. If you lose a card to another player:<br/>    - in case of 2-3 players: it&rsquo;s your turn to start a new attack against any of the other players;<br/>    - in case of 4 players: the player, who got your card can start a new attack, attacking anyone except you.<br/>9. If you cannot react to an incoming attack, and have no cards to give away or to start with when it&rsquo;s your turn, you lose the game. In case of 3-4 players playing, you drop out.<br/><br/>After you dropped out, your last attacker can draw one card from any of the subdecks as a bonus and can start a new attack.<br/>When 3 players are in the game, the player who did not receive a bonus card starts the next attack.<br/><br/>10. If it is your turn to start an attack, but you don&rsquo;t have any valid cards, you should discard one of your cards and draw a new one from the basic attacks subdeck and use that.<br/>11. In case of 2-3 players: if you can react to an attack with a valid card, you are free to choose whom you would like to attack with your used card.<br/><br/>In case of 4 players: you cannot attack your attacker with a single basic or counterattack, except when you use a card that deflects or reflects an attack directly.<br/><br/>Hikiwake (draw): when 2 players play, the game ends in a draw if the last applied valid card of any of the players is a TSUBAZERIAI or a BOGYO. When more than 2 players play, in this case this player simply drops out.<br/><br/><br/>II. RULES OF THE GAME VERSION &ndash; COMPETITION<br/>Cards needed: all the cards<br/>Number of players: only 2<br/>Duration: 10-20 mins<br/><br/>Aim of the game:<br/>The winner is the one who gets the second Ippon (point) first, or successfully plays the JIKAN DESU (Time&rsquo;s over!) card.<br/>It is considered as an IPPON (point) if a player cannot react to a basic or counterattack with a valid card OR has no more cards at all OR gets one&rsquo;s second Hansoku or penalty points.<br/>After an IPPON is awarded, all players draw as many new cards from any of the subdecks, that they have at least 6 cards in their hands. If you have more than 6, you can keep them but cannot draw more.<br/><br/>HANSOKU or penalty point must be given when:<br/>1. &lsquo;Stepping out of the court&rsquo;: you couldn&rsquo;t react to a TAIATARI card.<br/>2. &lsquo;Losing the sword&rsquo;: you couldn&rsquo;t react to a MAKI AGE card.<br/>The second hansoku you suffer means an IPPON to your opponent, and this is marked with a &bdquo;H&rdquo; as an ippon for hansoku.<br/>If it is your turn to start an attack but you have no valid card to do so, draw one card from the basic attacks subdeck and play that card.<br/>After an IPPON is awarded or a HANSOKU is given, always the &bdquo;unlucky&rdquo; player starts a new attack.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Rule to switch cards: Always before you play a card, you must switch one of your cards to a new one from any of the sub-decks (without showing). Put your old card under its own subdeck.<br/><br/>AND you must draw a new card from the Counterattacks or the Other Cards sub-deck. You cannot draw this new one from the basic attacks subdeck.<br/><br/>Exception to the rule: if you play a BOGYO or a TSUBAZERIAI card, an IPPON is awarded or a HANSOKU is given, you are not allowed to switch and draw again one after another. However, after an Ippon you can still draw cards until you have 6, as mentioned above. It means that if you get a HANSOKU or your opponent receives an IPPON because you have already switched and drawn, but still could not react, you are not allowed to switch and draw again. You must play a card directly from your actual hand.<br/><br/>Starting the game<br/>At the beginning deal 2 cards from the basic attacks subdeck, 3 cards from the counterattacks, and 3 cards from the other cards subdeck to each player. During the game players play cards in turns according to the rules of the Duel mode and as well as the information written on the cards.<br/><br/>The first attacker is decided exactly the same way as in the Duel mode.<br/>The differences between the Duel and the Competition:<br/>The Competition is played with less cards in hand, and players switch and draw cards during the game, which is not possible during the Duel.<br/>When you attack successfully during the Duel, you get cards from your opponent. During the Competition, you are awarded an Ippon or your opponent gets a penalty.<br/>Gameboard: the divided subdecks must be placed on the marked places on the gameboard. The already played cards can be placed to the competition court.<br/>In the Competition, the Ippon marks can be placed on the marked area &rsquo;Scores&rsquo; to show the points awarded.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>BroWars is fast, simple and exciting drinking game that can be played at home or in the pub.<br/><br/>There are TWO different games inside the tube (the game comes in a cardboard tube!) with different set of rules and components. There are called Brewery Variant and Pub Variant.<br/><br/>In Brewery Variant players will compete in numerous quests to gather brewery tiles from the table. Each brewery tile has its color, logotype, cost and arrows in the bottom.<br/><br/>First player chooses one of available brewery tiles and has to pay its cost which he does by placing enough quest cards from his hand on the table. Then according to arrows on the tile he, his opponent or all players chose one of just placed quest cards. Players then compete in that quest and the winner gets to take the tile they competed over. The looser has to drink. Cards can be also played as special actions that will change conditions for the round.<br/><br/>At the end of the game players score points. 1 point for each collected brewery tile and bonus points for collected sets with similar color or logotype.<br/><br/>Pub variant is a bit more tactical. Each player gets 3 pub tiles and places them in front of him. Then everyone uses coin cards (with different values) and places them face-down below his pub tiles. Players have to defend those coins and steal other players' coins. In order to defend them each player puts 6 quest cards face down in front of their pubs.<br/><br/>During the game, a player chooses one of opponents' pubs that he wants to attack and has to initiate a  quest duel depending on the cards that defends the pub. If successful, he then initiate another duel that protects that pub. Otherwise the defender takes up a turn. After beating all quest cards, attacker claims the defender's pub and all coins below. The game ends when one players is left with no pubs. Whoever has the most coins, wins.<br/><br/>",

Seemingly an insane proposition, the fleet had a very real purpose: to secure the lower reaches of the Baltic Sea in the event of a war between Poland and the Soviet Union in which Germany remained neutral while Britain and France provided materiel and supplies but did not commit their own naval forces to keeping the sea lanes open. That seemed the most likely scenario for a future war, and a strong Polish Navy would be vital to victory.<br/><br/>There are 20 one-inch-long Polish ship pieces included. And you even get a couple of scenarios for Second World War at Sea: Sea of Iron to study this Polish war plan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Furioso is a set of wargames rules that covers European warfare in the sixteenth century. The rules allow players to fight large scale land battles with a simple to use and enjoyable gaming system.<br/><br/>Already the nature of pike &amp; shot warfare that would dominate the seventeenth century was already beginning to take shape by the end of this period. Furioso is designed to re-create large scale battles such as those fought at Fornovo, Cerignola, Bicocca, Dreux, Moncontour, Clontibret, Yellow Ford, Ivry.<br/><br/>Players will find themselves commanding (or at least trying to command) the armies of the period. Players will quickly realise that some of their forces have minds of their own. Gendarmes are likely to charge off at the earliest opportunity - even if this means an entirely unsuitable enemy in terrain not exactly suited to the fully armoured knight.<br/><br/>Players may wish to try and soften up an enemy before unleashing their Swiss pike squares but they will rarely get the opportunity. Impatient Swiss units are likely to have closed with the enemy before a cannon shot is fired - even if that means charging across terrain that is likely to disorder their densely packed ranks. More defensive minded players can protect their armies with extensive earthworks that will disrupt the enemies attack and provide valuable cover from enemy fire. However, players may find that the enemy are not happy to wait for these constructions to be completed and will launch surprise attacks before such works are finished. And of course, in a time when increasing numbers of mercenaries where employed, players will need to make sure that sufficient care is taken to avoid last minute pay disputes, strikes, mutiny&rsquo;s and all of the other trials that would complicate the lives of sixteenth century commanders.<br/><br/>Furioso can be fought using any scale figures from 6mm to 28mm. The rules themselves have a very simple system at their heart. If you want to do anything you need to roll a d6, a score of five or more will achieve success, a score of four or lower means failure. Modifiers are applied but this is to the number of dice rolled to achieve success and not the score required. Success will therefore be measured by the number of successful scores achieved. At the start of a turn, players will roll one Initiative die for each unit, better quality and motivated units will receive a bonus to this score, poor quality unit&rsquo;s a deduction. Units will be activated in sequence with the highest scoring unit going first followed buy lower scoring units - and units that score zero or less won&rsquo;t be doing anything! This means that play will pass from unit to unit rather than one side activating all of their units and then the opposing side activating all of theirs. The result of this kind of mechanic means that players will have less control over their overall force and may find it difficult to execute a strategic plan - but in a period when many commanders would be personally leading their troops in to battle and fighting sword in hand in the front rank - that seems like an entirely realistic ambition for the period.<br/><br/>Also included in the rules is a series of random events of Hazards that cover such situations as Swiss troops striking over pay, raiding cavalry stealing an armies baggage and a whole host of other misfortunes that commonly befell armies of the period. To the rear of the rules are a number of army lists for all of the major armies of the period. Also included are unit cards for all of these units which you can copy for use. These will be used during the deployment phase of the battle so that opposing armies will have only a limited idea of their opponents composition and dispositions. And finally, we hope you enjoy playing these rules. Our intention with this game is to provide a fun and entertaining way to explore the tactical changes and challenges of the period with a healthy dose of &lsquo;period-feel&rsquo; thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>",

A &quot;kunoichi&quot; is a female ninja, and &quot;kunoichi ni chikai&quot; means &quot;almost a kunoichi&quot; - but you could also read it as &quot;close to the ku&quot;. But what's &quot;ku&quot;? It's a little pink token in the box! Use the powers of your kunoichi trainees to move them around in the grid and get closer to the &quot;ku&quot;!<br/><br/>At the start of the game sixteen cards, one for each character, are laid out in a four by four grid. The players are dealt an equal number of cards, each corresponding to one of the ninjas. Each card has a different ability to move cards around, like &quot;swap any card and the one two to the right and one down from it&quot; or &quot;slide any column up, wrapping around&quot;. After each player has used all but one of their cards, the last card determines which ninja they get points for, with more points going to ninjas closer to the &quot;ku&quot;.<br/><br/>In order to win you'll have to use your powers to rearrange the grid while balancing that with holding on a character in a good position, even if they have good powers. You also have to be careful not to favor any character too obviously as other players can interrupt your plans.<br/><br/>Can you get close to the &quot;ku&quot; and finally become a full kunoichi?<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pawikan Patrol is an action-selection, light deduction strategy game set in a coastal community where players send Characters to the Beach to find the location of Pawikan (sea turtles) and their nests, while keeping the Poacher away from them. Along the way, players must also clean up Trash and make sure that the natural Predator of the sea turtles is kept safe from harm.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, they will choose a Character card from their hand and move it to one of the five face-down Beach cards on the Beach; in response, the Poacher card will also move to a new Beach card based on the number of arrows indicated on the Character. After moving, Beach cards in the same column as your Character and the Poacher are turned face-up at the same time: if they have the matching icon on the Beach card, they are collected; cards collected by Characters are put into their player's collection area; meanwhile, cards collected by the Poacher are discarded. If they do not have the matching icon, the cards are returned face-down.<br/><br/>Characters have special abilities that allow the player to gather information from the Beach or the Beach Deck, manipulate the position of cards in different zones, or negate the Poacher's ability to collect cards before you do. Players must be careful with their choice of Character to send on any particular turn, because once they move to the Beach, they have to wait they only have one Character in hand to regain the use of all their other Characters; timing their movement can be very important.<br/><br/>The player with the most number of points at the end of the game wins and is declared the Pawikan Patrol Leader; however, if they are they are careless enough to allow the Poacher to take away a certain number of turtles or eggs, ALL players can lose the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players will choose a tribe, find an opponent, then draw a hand of 5 cards each. Players take turns drawing a card, playing up to one card from their hand, and making up to one character exchange per turn. This process is called a &quot;swap&quot; and it &quot;levels up&quot; your cards from rank 1 all the way to rank 4.<br/><br/>To win, earn 20 &quot;CHEER&quot; points by challenging your opponent's cards to Trick Battles that appeal to each tribe's fan base. CHEER is earned whenever you challenge your opponent but they fail to defend. They can defend their turf by matching up their own Tricks against yours, but the lowest scoring Trick will be removed from the game and placed into the discard pile.<br/><br/>Strategic play involves knowing when to challenge and when to defend. It also requires smart swapping to maximize the Ranks of your characters while preparing for counter play. There are 3 types of cards: Tricks that score points, Assists that boost Tricks, and Disses that remove other cards from play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

This person is distracted at the beginning of their meditation, and your goal is to help them focus. Once focus has been achieved, you will have succeeded in bringing them into the joy of the present moment!<br/><br/>A game is played over a series of rounds, where you will move a pawn around a 3 x 3 grid of mandala cards removing distraction using frame of mind actions and mandala abilities. Before each game, you will choose a scenario to play, which provides a unique puzzle to solve. Each scenario has two phases that have different goals for you to complete. You win the game by achieving optimal focus at scenario-specific mandala cards in the warm-up (first) phase and by removing all distraction from every mandala in the meditation (second) phase.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wild Island - My Father's Dragon is a family board game based on the film My Father's Dragon. Each player represents a team of boy Elmer and dragon Boris. The island on which they find themselves is sinking, shaking, and changing shape all the time. But there is still time to save the island by smartly moving around the island visiting different animals and finding the right energy source. The first one to do so is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>The island consists of 16 tiles, randomly placed in a 4x4 grid. Each tile has nine spaces with trees and paths. Players move around the island by rolling a special die trying to reach their objectives. From the second round, the island starts to shake intensely and the tiles are shifted and moved by the players. There are multiple icons that can help players reach their objectives faster: Elmer and dragon Boris can go into the caves and come out in any other cave on the island, fly icons allow dragon Boris to fly to any other adjacent tile, and courage icons represent their bravery when trying to save the island. With them, they get courage tiles to be even more flexible when moving around and shaking the island. Some of them have to be used immediately and some can be saved in Elmer's backpack and used in one of the later turns.<br/><br/>The objective tiles each player has, are in the shape of jigsaw puzzle pieces. When the player visits their objective, they are turned around and when all four objectives are reached the image of a saved island is assembled as a small jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Waddle Waddle is a unique strategy game that features the designer's own photographs of penguins in the wild, taken in Antarctica, and a game board made from a map of the regions around Antarctica. Waddle Waddle's blend of open drafting, set collection, area of control, and push-your-luck is as fun to play as it is beautiful to watch, and you'll learn something about penguins along the way too. Game play is lightning fast, with minimal downtime. Whether you're playing two or six players, it's your turn before you know it.<br/><br/>In Waddle Waddle, you play the role of a Penguin Hero, specializing in a particular Penguin Species. Each Penguin Hero is based on a real-life Penguin Hero who works to conserve penguins! They will help you to study penguins as they leave the Ice Floe and travel to their nesting grounds in the Antarctic region, called Rookeries. There&rsquo;s safety in numbers, so penguins travel in groups called Waddles. As a Penguin Hero, you tag Waddles, scoring Conservation Points for each Waddle.<br/><br/>Waddles that contain Mating Pairs make Nests. Score extra Conservation Points at the end of each Breeding Season if you tag the most Nests in a Rookery. You also get player-specific bonuses when you tag the Nests of the Penguin Species your Penguin Hero specializes in.<br/><br/>Each penguin is represented by a Penguin Card with a number indicating its pecking order in the penguin social hierarchy. Only compatible penguins will travel together. There are six different Penguin Species that each like to nest in different places. You&rsquo;ll need to carefully choose the Penguin Cards from the Ice Floe to score the most Conservation Points.<br/><br/>Food is scarce! There is a limited fish supply at each Rookery. It costs one fish to play each Waddle. You might need to send penguins on a Fishing Trip to find more fish. And finally, beware of Threats, both natural and manmade, that appear each Breeding Season and make it harder for Waddles to land at each Rookery. The player with the most Conservation Points at the end of the game earns the title Top Conservator.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Inspired by traditional card games like War and Slap-Jack, Card Castle adds several new twists including battling armies, tricky look-alikes, powerful Wizards, and fiery dragons.<br/><br/>In more detail, the goal in Card Castle is to out-slap your opponents, win all their cards, and become ruler of the castle. Players take turns flipping cards blindly from the top of their army decks onto the center of the table or playmat. When slappable opportunities present themselves (doubles, doors, or wizards), the first player to slap the pile of cards wins the battle and all the cards in the pile.<br/><br/>But be sure you don't slap the dragon!<br/><br/>",

However this is a hard challenge because the game offers several options to obstruct or threaten the enemy&rsquo;s vessels. Planting sharp mines in the route of the ships is one of them, or you may choose to bluff and plant fake mines that look exactly like real ones...<br/><br/>How does it play?<br/><br/>- Every turn the active player rolls a die. The die shows how many actions you have to take in your round: 1, 2 or 3. <br/> - After you roll, you can plant mines on empty fields if you want.<br/> - Now choose a ship and spend your actions. Turn, move or shoot. Every ship type has its unique weapons, and specific role in the battle.<br/> - The first player who hits their opponent's Command Ship is the winner.<br/><br/>What this game offers:<br/><br/>- short, simple, easy-to-understand rules,<br/>- quick set up, no more than 5 minutes after the second game,<br/>- relatively short rounds (30-45 minutes), no time to get bored.<br/><br/>",

The game was launched at November 2017, after intensive testing with different kinds of audiences and revisions.<br/><br/>The pack consists of a deck with 75 cards (60 of countries with contents and stats, 12 special cards, a card with 60 country flags, 2 cards with shortened game rules), a rulebook and a world map. Each country card has the flag, location and capital, as well as stats like population, life expectancy or gdp. The game mechanics is &quot;turn-based&quot; and the goal is to get all the opponents' cards, which are initially distributed to everyone, forming a stack for each player (upside down).<br/><br/>Each turn consists of 4 phases. In the first phase, each player places 5 cards in his hand and can play special cards that change the course of the game, such as stealing the opponent's turn, double the winning prize, exchange all hand cards between 2 players or cancel any of these effects. In the next phase, the turn owner chooses a card from his hand, puts it upside down on the table and will have to decide between asking a question about the card to an opponent of his choice (flag/location/capital) or choose a statistic that will have to beat all opponents cards. For the latter, after the turn owner announces the statistic he chose, each opponent will have to pick a card from his hand and put it upside down on the table, to win the duel. This adds suspense, bluff and fun on each turn, forcing the player to carefully choose his plays. At the end of the turn, the winner receives as prize x cards from the opponents hands, depending on the special cards played, the duel type (question or statistic battle) and player count.<br/><br/>Many educational/general knowledge board games lack the fun and socialization offered by CardsLab. It's an 8-80 trivia &amp; strategy game designed with a simple mechanics that can easily put 3 different generations playing at the same table. Also, without noticing, we are learning much faster than by reading a book.<br/><br/>CardsLab - Improving Knowledge Through Gamification.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Make deals to secure top-of-the-line upgrades for your crew, and score the most rep by the end of three cycles.<br/><br/>Any time your marker is the one on the card closest to the deck, you will take the following actions:<br/>1: Add the card that is currently underneath your marker to position 1 of your assembly line. You may add it either action side or scoring side up.<br/>2. Choose a card in the new row by placing your marker on it.<br/>3. Activate your assembly line and update your upgrade trackers accordingly. Discard the card in position THREE of your assembly line and slide the 2 remaining cards down to open up position ONE once again. If the card was on its action side, then it is discarded, if it was on its scoring side then add it to your score pile.<br/>4. The player whose marker is now closest to the deck takes their turn.<br/><br/>Once the final player has taken their actions, form a new row of cards and a new round can start with the player whose marker is placed on the card closest to the deck. When a Cycle deck runs out, move on to the next Cycle deck in sequence until all cards have been chosen.<br/><br/>Once the Cycle 3 deck is empty and all cards have been chosen, continue activating your assembly line until all cards have left your assembly line. (i.e. the final card you chose will activate a full 3 times) Then move on to scoring.<br/><br/>-description from artist<br/><br/>",

In the corner of the room, a record player fills the room with warm, soothing tunes from classic holiday albums. The crate of albums is positioned near, holding onto the many memories connected of years past. Family members take turns getting up and selecting an album, studying the cover, and sliding the album out of the jacket to load onto the player. As the needle pops and crackles, the wonderful music enchants the room and seems to synchronize with the twinkle of the lights on the Christmas Tree. It is another Vinyl: Holiday!<br/><br/>In Vinyl: Holiday, players will work towards building Christmas trees out of albums. Each album features a sub-genre (Classical, Traditional, and Contemporary), one of four decades (the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s), one of five spirits (Joy, Love, Peace, Hope, and Faith). These album trees are being built by the players to your left and right in the true holiday spirit. Some of the points you gain are entirely in your control with the matches you make with previously played albums. Other points come from the combined efforts of you and the players to your left and right. To further increase the scoring opportunities, each player can sacrifice their hand size to complete attributes printed on each album's gift tags. Vinyl: Holiday Edition will be a game that you will want to play all year round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Born of Titans is a game of heroism in the world of ancient Greek mythology. Two to four may play . Each player portrays a hero from legend who undertakes quests to battle with fierce monsters and retrieve epic artifacts.<br/><br/>Each player controls the actions of one Hero selected at the start of the game. Hero counters are moved on the map along from Sites to linked Points, Points to linked Points, and Points to linked Sites. A Hero's Ally, if she has one, and Crew remaining sit aboard the Hero's Ship and lend their skills to the Hero as needed.<br/><br/>Heroes, Allies, and Crew have three attributes: Battle, Navigation, and Wits. During the game, players must make die rolls against the combined attributes of their respective Hero, Ally, and Crew. Monsters and other game effects can kill Crew. A Hero begins with six Crew. Players record the current number of Crew by placing the Crew marker on the corresponding shield number. As a player's Crew are killed by monsters and other game effects, the owning player moves the marker to a shield with the appropriate lower number.<br/><br/>A Hero with no remaining Crew is essentially alone on a raft. Her crew is dead or has run off. If a Hero's Crew counter is on the &quot;0&quot; Shield on her Ship mat, the Hero may not add the Crew's skill numbers, and may only take one Action each turn. Also, when a Hero's Crew reaches the &quot;0&quot; Shield, she loses any Gear or Ally counters she had. Turn those counters face down and shuffle them back into their respective piles.<br/><br/>In the fashion of good mythology, BoT relies on a generous amount of Prophesy. The amount of Prophesy collected by a Hero is represented by a track on her Ship. A player may have no more than six Prophesy points at any time. Prophesy has two primary uses. A player may spend a Prophesy point during her turn to look at all counters at any Site on the map. This is important so a player can know what sort of challenge she faces on her next Quest or what a particular Sea Monster is. A player may dedicate Prophesy markers to provide bonus die rolls, if needed, during a Challenge. Each Prophesy committed allows the player to roll an additional die during the Challenge roll. Any Prophesy committed are lost at the end of the Challenge, whether used or not. Neither of these uses costs the player an Action.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a randomly drawn Quest Marker. The first player to gain a third Completed Quest wins the game!<br/><br/>",

The art is by Szymek Dmitruk.<br/><br/>Setting: &quot;Welcome to The Future, stranger! Yep, that&rsquo;s what they named this galaxy eons ago. Today, trade hubs and hull dealers are everywhere, jump lines connect all of the major systems, and the Rogue invasion has finally begun - Yeehaw! It's time to make some lux.<br/><br/>You, Sir, can run my trade fleets, if you are interested. I won&rsquo;t be dealing in smelly ass-teroid anymore. Careful though - you won&rsquo;t stand a chance against the Rogue without protection or something to pay them with. They'll turn y&rsquo;all back into stardust in no time. Here is what you need to do: Get rich hauling teratons of freight, then pay security to take care of the Rogue.<br/><br/>But if you want to get rich and famous, and get your hands dirty, then gear up for space combat. Oh yeah. I&rsquo;m gonna blast some Rogue intruders with my battleship, Dolores. I&rsquo;ve been saving her for the invasion. So long, Sir. If we meet again, I will be glad to lend a hand.&quot;<br/><br/>Summary: You guessed it. It&rsquo;s the year 4040. You&rsquo;ve just arrived in a galaxy called The Future and have been promoted to direct a trade fleet. Your goal is to make lots of lux by hauling freight and trading resources, to then develop your technology and eliminate the Rogue, before your spacefaring adventure comes to an end. You might build space stations, explore anomalies, compete missions, and attack the Rogue yourself with the powerful fleets you have acquired. The galaxy is yours for the taking.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     Players control up to 4 fleets that can hold ships, crew, science, relics, cargo, and freight cards.<br/>     The galaxy is made of innovative chevron tiles that create different trading and traveling opportunities in every game.<br/>     The simple AI grows gradually and provides opportunities for scoring points.<br/>     Players can choose from a variety of ways to score points, from base building, the combat, anomaly exploration, missions, etc.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These points can be spent to move or attack other gladiators. Attacks are resolved by a simple roll-off between the attacker and defender, with the attacker getting bonuses for position. The defender gets a save roll to avoid wounds. Play continues until a gladiator loses all of their wounds.<br/><br/>Rules for a wide range of weapons are included,and all major historical gladiator types can be depicted with little problem.<br/><br/>",

There are two boxes for the cards, and cardboard coins, as well as dice.<br/><br/>There are 30 different question categories on the board, which uses a circular track with a hub layout. The question categories some are more traditional like &quot;Ancient History&quot;, &quot;Royalty&quot; and &quot;American Civil War&quot;, others are of a quirky nature such as &quot;Famous Exits&quot;, &quot;Cockney English&quot; and &quot;Submarines&quot;. Players draw a card which will have a choice between two categories from which to answer, all questions are multiple choice with three possible answers. If the player gets a question right they can roll again, if the question is the same category as the space the player is on they also receive a coin. The four special Double Trouble space on the board give the player a coin if they can answer both questions on the card. The player with five coins who then returns to the center of the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each sexual space has a sexual act. Acts range from foreplay fun to hardcore intercourse. Whenever your partner lands on a sexual space you own, they perform that specific sexual act on you. You can either perform the sexual act, or pay a fine to get out of it. The game is that simple.<br/><br/>Giving someone an orgasm is just as pleasureable as having one yourself. thats why XXXopoly includes Hot and Heavy and Erotic Chest cards. These cards range from object play, to role play, to kama sutra positions to bring you to new sexual realms.<br/><br/>Finger someone, tongue someone, tease someone, longer and harder by purchasing time chips from the bank.

If they can't find space for a piece, they must build on the next level in height so that both ends of the piece rest on top of two pieces of its same colour.<br/><br/>When players are forced to build on new levels, they can begin with a smaller piece, but they must then play again in ascending order of length and they cannot play in lower levels anymore.<br/><br/>The game ends when players cannot place any more pieces on the board. The winner is the player with less points still in hand. In case of a tie, the winner is the player with less points at the highest level on the board.<br/><br/>",

Tao of Peg is designed to use a combination of luck and strategy to win in a variety of ways. Tao of Peg is the perfect game for family fun or for more serious gaming nights.<br/><br/>The board and pegs are made of wood, and the board design is printed on a vinyl sheet and applied directly to a wooden base. The entire board is lightly coated with a protective varnish. Felt buttons are then added to the bottom corners to protect playing surfaces.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt four cards. A player begins by discarding a card from their hand. The player then places a game piece in any space with the corresponding color on the board. The turns ends by the player drawing a new card from the pile.<br/><br/>In addition to the 100 colored playing cards (25 per colored quadrant), each set also has two types of wild cards. Players may play a wild card instead of a colored card. Red wild cards allow the player to remove any game piece in play and black wild cards allow the player to place a game piece anywhere on the board.<br/><br/>There are four different ways to win;<br/><br/>    make a row of 5 pegs anywhere on the board<br/>    make a row of 4 pegs in a single quadrant<br/>    place a peg in each corner of a single quadrant<br/>    place a peg in each corner of the game board<br/><br/><br/>",

A village populated by indomitable Gauls never ceases to resist intruders. Take the role of a great leader and lead your people to victory not only through Gaul, but across the entire Roman Empire. Each nation has its own skills which greatly influence the game and from which tactical strategies can be developed.<br/><br/>Complete secret missions to get victory points and decide the game for you. But beware! The magic potion will also surprise you in the game and bring you benefits or maybe steal your points. With sesterces you can buy new missions and units that strengthen you in the game and bring you closer to your goal of becoming the ruler of the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>So, will you be able to use your skills victoriously or will another leader emerge as a glorious winner?<br/><br/>Get ready and brace yourself for the fight of a lifetime. With 2-5 players, ages 13 and up, you can muster your troops and join the defence of the conquests of Gaul or Caesar. You can choose from 2 different game modes. Distribute area cards evenly among all players and place your warriors on the field according to your cards. On your turn, you can attack neighbouring areas and, thanks to the various ports, even occupy coastal areas by sea. Roll the black dice to attack your opponents and use the red dice to defend yourself. If you manage to lead your attack profitably with the highest number of eyes, you can decide whether you want to keep fighting until you've taken out all enemy warriors or if you want to retreat first. This way, try to control as many areas as possible. 6 regions of different colours with a total of 45 areas must be conquered. Gaul with the largest land ownership wins the game. Potion Cards and Reinforcements provide special fun.<br/><br/>So arm your troops and go with RISK Asterix in the battle for the Roman Empire and become a respected leader.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a deduction party game for 3-5 persons, offering  30-45 minutes playing time.<br/><br/>A group of novice detectives are deployed to a condominium where every tenant is likely to be a crook. Each detective receives a description of a certain suspect, and their task is to find their target person in one of the apartments. The player who is first to succeed wins the game.<br/><br/>One of the players takes the role of the Game Master, acting for the tenants. The rest of the players compete with each other in the investigation, which must be done by questioning the tenants. However, as they all have something to hide, they may be willing to give some bits of information on their neighbors only, and never about themselves.<br/><br/>All the detectives receive a police file with a suspect&rsquo;s description, a dozen question cards, a player aid used for deduction, and some cash which might come in useful to make people talk. In their turn, the detectives knock on a door of their choice and ask a few selected questions by playing their question cards. Their ultimate goal is to locate the suspect by deduction, based on the answers they get during the game.<br/><br/>When a player asks a question about the occupant of a certain apartment, the Game Master checks the back of the relevant door card (visible only to him/her), and tells the answer based on the 12 data found there. But as the answer will be heard by all the players, everyone can note it down and use it for their own progress! Door cards are placed on the table randomly. Not knowing which tenants the detectives will be looking for, the Game Master is not in the position to give hints. But his or her spirited answers can make this party game great fun for everyone!<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t============Description in Hungarian:<br/><br/>A T&aacute;rsash&aacute;z 3-5 szem&eacute;ly sz&aacute;m&aacute;ra aj&aacute;nlott dedukci&oacute;s partij&aacute;t&eacute;k, mely kb. 30-45 percig tart.<br/><br/>A rendőrfőn&ouml;k egy csapat kezdő nyomoz&oacute;t r&aacute;&aacute;ll&iacute;t egy t&aacute;rsash&aacute;zra, ahol csupa gyan&uacute;s alak &eacute;s k&ouml;r&ouml;z&ouml;tt bűn&ouml;ző &eacute;l.

The concept being that the track has 3 lanes (the white line, middle, and round the boards), with bikes only able to play cards in either unblocked lanes, or with a value lower than a bike already occupying a lane that turn.  Since the leading bike gets first play the next turn, there is plenty of opportunity for blocking and jockeying for position before the end of the final lap.<br/><br/>Added to this are the chance of falls, injuries, start line infringements or even mechanical failures, to give a wide variety of race outcomes.<br/><br/>",

After the first contact with the enemy on 14 October, a cavalry battle near Liebertwolkwitz, which ended with much luck in favor of the Allies, Bonaparte now seeks the decisive battle. With the guards and eight corps, he has 210,000 men at his disposal, including 14,000 horsemen and 700 guns.<br/><br/>In the two-person game Battle of the Nations 1813, you take over the role of Napol&eacute;on and his opponent Prince Schwarzenberg. The aim of the game for Napol&eacute;on's French army is to occupy and successfully defend several towns around Leipzig. The allied troops under Prince Schwarzenberg try to prevent this in return.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, Napol&eacute;on receives face-down mission cards from different districts. These cards show him which towns he has to occupy. Depending on the level of difficulty, Napol&eacute;on receives different numbers of victory points for completed mission cards. The mission cards also show Napol&eacute;on how many points Prince Schwarzenberg wins if he does not complete the missions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Some histories pass over this battle as merely the second of Montgomery's failed attempts to capture the key city of Caen. Increasingly. however historians are &bull; recognizing the true meaning of the Epsom Offensive. This was the battle which ended German dreams of driving the invaders back Into the sea. Hitler gathered the best of his remaining Panzer Divisions and broke them against the resistance encountered. The beginning of Epsom caught the enemy off balance and kept the Germans off balance until Hitler's counter-stroke in Normandy was doomed to failure. Most important, this was a battle in which enthusiastic but untried British troops stood toe-to-toe with some of the best equipped. best led and most experienced combat formations of the Third Reich. The Battle of Epsom was to set a pattern that was to continue for the rest of the campaign in Northwest Europe, from Normandy to the Baltic: the grinding-down of Hitler's elite troops by dominance in the air and by excellence of artillery support.<br/><br/>SCOTLAND THE BRAVE includes a well-researched historical game map of the battlefield, special rules, nine new scenarios and a Platoon leader 2.1 campaign game. You will also receive a comprehensive scenario tactics and designer's notes booklet.

It's origins are lost in the mists of time but it is still played on almost all ships, submarines and naval bases to this day.<br/><br/>The game is played on a ludo board with two dice.  Players play as pairs on opposite corners of the board, the aim being to get all your pieces home before the opposing pair do.<br/><br/>The main difference from ludo is that all the players' pieces can be out at once and stacked up, blocking your opponents movement.<br/><br/>",

Instead of fighting wars with their own conventional forces, nations found it easier to pass the burden of conflict along to private contractors. They could be expensive, but a mercenary force was less politically liable than a country and more expendable. The best survived, and went on to glory and profit. The most famous and sought after are the mercenary pilots.<br/><br/>The leader of a Mercenary Air Squadron has many responsibilities. The fortunes of his or her firm depend on taking the right jobs for his pilots, outfitting with the right equipment, and keeping those birds flying. One month a mercenary squadron could be flying combat operations over the Pacific Ocean for Japan, and turn around and join the highest bidder against their former employer. Nothing is personal, except for rivalries amongst mercenary squadrons, which tend to lead to heated exchanges beyond that specified in a contract. Your prestige and fortune are at stake. Pilots, man your planes and your pocketbooks!<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Mercenary Air Squadron World War II: Mediterranean Theater of Operations<br/><br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s a game of dogs and cats, bears and humans, where one is always trying to outdo the other. Who is going to come out on top? Will the Good Boys cause trouble for the Bears? Or will Cats woo over Cookie? Only a game of Dogo Dash will tell!<br/><br/>Components<br/>1 rule sheet<br/>60 cards<br/>&bull;    22 Cats<br/>&bull;    18 Dogs<br/>&bull;    12 Bears<br/>&bull;    4 Cookies<br/>&bull;    4 Good Boys<br/><br/><b><i>Setup</i></b><br/>1.    Shuffle the deck of cards face down.<br/>2.    Deal four cards to each player. This forms your hand. Keep your cards secret!<br/>3.    Place the deck face down in reach of all players. This is the draw deck.<br/>4.    Now you&rsquo;re ready to play. It&rsquo;s that easy!<br/><br/><b><i>Gameplay</b></i><br/>Dogo Dash is played over multiple rounds. At the end of each round, players determine the winner of the round and score points. Then, everyone draws more cards. Once the draw deck is empty, one final round occurs and then the game ends. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><b><i>Round</b></i><br/>Each round, players follow the same order of play.<br/>1.    All players secretly choose a card from their hand they want to play.<br/>2.    Place it face down in front of you and don&rsquo;t show it to anyone.<br/>3.    When everyone has chosen a card, someone yells out DO-GO DAAAAASH!<br/>4.    All players reveal their cards simultaneously.<br/>5.    Now it&rsquo;s time to see who won!<br/><br/><b><i>Round Winner</b></i><br/>To determine the winner, check the played cards to see who played the strongest one:<br/><br/>Dog is stronger than Cat<br/>Bear is stronger than Dog and Cat<br/>Cookie is stronger than Dog and Bear<br/>Cat is stronger than Cookie<br/><br/>Whoever played the strongest card takes all of the played cards and keeps them in a score pile in front of them. Each card counts as a point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>If there is a tie between two or more players for the strongest card, the tied players play another round between themselves but do not draw any additional cards. They continue playing until someone wins or they have played all of their cards. If no one wins, then the players split the points as evenly as possible, discarding the extra card if it&rsquo;s an odd amount.<br/><br/>Watch out! If there is a Good Boy on the table, things get tricky.<br/>Good Boys force a tie, no matter what cards are on the table. Play another round as detailed above.<br/><br/>Once the winner has been determined, all players draw cards until they have four cards in hand.<br/><br/><b><i>Last Round</b></i><br/>The Last Round happens when there are no more cards to draw from the draw deck. Players now play one more round only using the cards they have left in hand.<br/><br/>1.    All players secretly choose a card and place it face down in front of you.<br/>2.    All players take all of their unplayed cards in their hands and put them face down in the middle of the table. This makes the Super Pot!<br/>3.    Someone yells out DO-GO DAAAAASH! and all players reveal their cards simultaneously.<br/>4.    The winner takes all of the cards in the Super Pot!<br/>o    If there is a tie, the tied players split the Super Pot as evenly as possible.<br/><br/><b><i>Scoring</b></i><br/>Once the Last Round has been played, count the cards you have collected.<br/>Whoever has collected the most cards wins.<br/>If there is a tie, then all tied players win!<br/><br/><b><i>Keep Your Eyes Open</b></i><br/>If you pay attention to what cards have been played, then you can stay ahead of everyone else. Try and remember the number of different cards there are and use it in your favor to choose the right card at the<br/>right time.<br/><br/>For instance: if you paid attention to how many Cookies were played, you can win the Super Pot with a cat, which is the character beaten by most cards, but wins against Cookie.<br/>Combos<br/><br/><b><i>The Catnip Variant</b></i><br/>When you get comfortable with the basics, here&rsquo;s an extra move to add to the game.<br/>If you have four cats in your hand, you can choose to play a Catnip:<br/>1.    Instead of playing one card, you put down all four cards and say &lsquo;catnip.&rsquo;<br/>2.    You then put all four of your played cards onto your own score pile. You didn&rsquo;t win the round, but you keep the points for yourself.<br/>3.    3. Everyone else continues the round as normal.<br/><br/><b><i>The Dogo Dash!</b></i><br/>If you played a Dog and didn&rsquo;t win the round, but you have another Dog in your hand, then you can make a Dogo Dash! Before the winner takes the cards, reveal your second Dog card. You now get to keep the Dog you just played and the Dog you just rescued from the winner. Put both cards in your score pile.<br/><br/><b>Credits</b><br/>Author &amp; Game Designer: Talita Rhein<br/>Illustrator &amp; Co-Designer: Margherita Barrera<br/>Co-Designer: Johanna Janiszewski<br/>Production Support &amp; QA: Philipp Keydel<br/>Rules Editing: Travis D.

Players act as mercenary commanders taking on contracts for the Great Houses. Defeating the enemies set to stop them earns C-bills to spend on the equipment needed to keep their unit afloat.

A parchment manuscript has just been discovered, revealing the location of its gates. The city&rsquo;s immense riches described in the manuscript have inspired much desire and greed.<br/><br/>As the head of a team of explorers and mercenaries, you have set up camp in the Paleo Archipelago. But other teams have also arrived at the scene.<br/>Protected by your mercenaries, your explorers are ready to launch a search for the keys that will give access to the city. It is up to you to take advantage of the archipelago&rsquo;s many reefs in order to stay ahead of your competitors.<br/>---<br/>In the basic two-player version of Paleo, players set up the 65 x 65 cm board with four central reefs, two sanctuaries for each player in the corners of the board, and five supplemental reefs placed according to various rules. Each player controls a team of five explorers and three mercenaries; you move these pieces by flicking them with your finger as in Crokinole. If your mercenary hits an opponent&rsquo;s piece, that piece is removed from the board; remove all of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces, and you win the round and score one point.<br/><br/>The explorers are used to enter the opponent&rsquo;s sanctuaries and recover two keys that then allow the player to enter the gate of Paleo in the center of the board. (Any of your pieces that enters a sanctuary can be exchanged for another piece already captured by the opponent.) This victory is worth two points, and a complete game requires a player to earn four points to win.<br/><br/>Rules are included to accommodate three or four players, in addition to rules for ten other games for 2-4 players such as hockey, a kayak race, and Capture the King.<br/><br/>",

Each player begins the game with their own deck from which they deal themselves a down-pile and four draw cards. They hold onto the rest of the deck to flip over one at a time in order to find more cards to play.<br/><br/>Cards are played in the common area on piles that are started with a &quot;1&quot;. These card piles can be built up or down on with cards of the same color. Wild cards can be played on a pile to change its top number, color, or both. The first player to use all of the cards from their down-pile shouts &quot;NAY-JAY!&quot; and the round ends. The game lasts 6 rounds, and at the end the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>- designer summary.<br/><br/>",

The rules for each game are written on its board.<br/><br/>The final round is played with the Bonus Dice. The Bonus Dice have money amounts from $50 to $200 written on eleven of the twelve faces; the twelfth face contains a spade. Each player makes a secret guess how much money the Bonus Dice will accumulate before the spade is rolled. Those who come closest without going over get their holdings doubled.

The Swedish units are much better than their opponents but there are few of them. The fight is therefore fairly evenly matched.<br/>The Rules use a standard sequence of play of Move, Defender fires, Attacker fires, Melee and then Rally. Losses are taken to attack strength necessitating the use of loss markers but stacking is limited so the stacks do not get too high.<br/>Special rules include Leaders, Pontoon Bridges, Surprise, extra reinforcements etc.<br/>Same rules as Peter the Great by the same Designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This scenario pack covers actions that involved airborne and paratroopers units.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules is required.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>Sola Airfield, Norway, 9 April 1940: The Germans&rsquo; plan for the invasion of Norway and Denmark was code named &quot;Operation Weser Exercise&quot; and was under the command of General von Falkenhorst; it would be the first major combined air-land-sea effort in history. In a bold and daring plan the First Battalion of Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment 1, under the command of Major Erich Walther, would attempt to capture four objectives; Aalborg airfield and the Vordingborg Bridge in Denmark and Norwegian airfields at Sola and Fornebu... <br/>  <br/>Gorki, Russia, 14 October 1941: Early in October 1941, the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s Army Group Centre drove 200 miles in five days, its panzers crossing the Berezina and Dnepr Rivers. However, these panzer spearheads had also outraced their supply lines; forcing some 300 panzers of Heinz Guderian&rsquo;s 2nd Panzer Group to hold while their supplies caught up. Seizing upon this opportunity to destroy the German panzer force while it sat with its fuel tanks dry, the Soviet Western Front Headquarters ordered its IV Airborne Corps to detach a brigade for a special operation...<br/> <br/>Northeast of Gela, Sicily, 11 July 1943: Just over a year after its activation, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under the capable leadership of Colonel James M. &quot;Jumping Jim&quot; Gavin, made its first regimental size combat parachute attack as part of the Allied Invasion of Sicily known as &quot;Operation Husky.&quot;  The 505th&rsquo;s objective was to drop behind enemy lines around Gela, close off roads leading to beaches and secure the drop zone for further use...<br/><br/><br/>South of St. Come-du-Mont, France, 7 June 1944: Shortly after midnight on June 6, paratroopers of General Maxwell D. Taylor's 101st Airborne Division became the first Allied soldiers to touch French soil during the Invasion of Normandy. The 101st had been assigned the initial mission of securing Exits 1 and 2 from Utah Beach and having secured them on D-Day, Taylor immediately dispatched the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment southwest to conduct a reconnaissance towards the road junction south of St. Come-du-Mont...<br/><br/><br/>Bois de Bavent, France, 29 June 1944: By late June, the British 6th Airborne Division had settled into a defence role east of the Orne River; despite this role, the division continued to patrol aggressively, seeking and wreaking havoc upon the enemy wherever possible. At no place was this havoc more evident than in the forested area called Bois de Bavent, where a cat and mouse game was taking place between the division&rsquo;s patrols and the German&rsquo;s outposts...<br/><br/><br/>North of Heelsum, Holland, 18 September 1944: As Operation Market-Garden commenced, ad-hoc German defences were asked to oppose some of the initial paratroop landings.  One such case occurred west of Arnhem, where NCOs from an SS-Officer Cadet school, personnel from a Kriegsmarine unit and Luftwaffe ground crews attacked the 1st Airborne Airlanding Brigade...<br/><br/>",

Weeks ago, military authorities at (the new) Fort Bent sent out a small party of six cavalry soldiers to punish raiders for stealing sheep, kidnapping women and children, and murdering men from American settlements. But it's been too long, and the cavalry soldiers have not returned. It is your job to find them, or at least find out what happened to them.<br/><br/>Your first stop is the Smith settlement, one of the victims of the raiders. There you will meet Mrs. Smith and her four children and garner whatever information available.<br/><br/>It is now October 15, and by November 30th, you must be passing back southward through the Smith settlement to escape the raging blizzards of winter. It has already snowed in the highest mountain passes, and travel may soon be curtailed, if not shut down completely. You must move quickly, before it is too late.<br/><br/>Beginner: 32 point characters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shax is a traditional game from the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the Morris family. Like other games from that family, its origins date back to antiquity. The game is played by nomadic shepherds and city dwellers where a class of professional players has emerged.<br/><br/>Shax is played on the same board as Nine Men's Morris, but with twelve pieces for each player. Play consists of two phases: the setup phase and the movement phase. In the setup phase, players take turns putting one piece on the board. Unlike in Nine Men's Morris, no pieces are removed when a jare (three-in-a-row, mill, literally: &quot;cut&quot;) is formed during the setup. It is only noted who formed the first jare.<br/><br/>In the movement phase, the player who formed the first jare moves first (if no jare was formed in the setup phase, the second player starts). He does so by removing one arbitrary piece of the opponent in order to create space for movement. The opponent does the same. Then players take turns moving their stones as in the other Morris games.<br/><br/>If a jare is formed in the movement phase, the player removes a piece of the opponent. Note that - again unlike other Morris games - pieces in a jare are never protected against capture. Another important difference is that blocking does not constitute a win. If a player is locked in, he may demand that the opponent moves his stones until the blockade is removed. No advantage may be taken from these extra moves. In particular, if a jare is formed during these moves, then no capture is performed. There is no &quot;flying phase&quot; when a player is reduced to three pieces or less. The player who loses all his pieces loses the game.<br/><br/>Numerous references to Shax exist in proverbs and Somalian literature. Favorable patterns of stones have got their own names.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>Forty-Fives (also known as Forty-Five, Forte Fives, Auction Forty-Fives, Auction 120s, 120, Growl, Spoil Five, Maw and Strong Fives) is a trick-taking card game that is played in Ireland, and in some parts of New England, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia where it is known as Forte Fives. It is closely related to the game One-hundred and ten (110) also described below.<br/><br/>The game may have got its name from &quot;forte&quot; which is Latin for strong which describes the 5's in the deck. The origin of this game is thought to be Ireland.[citation needed] In the 1920s, the game became Forte Fives when it moved South into the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts and New Hampshire with French Canadian immigrants. Today, Forty-fives continues to be very popular in the Merrimack Valley. It is played with a standard deck of 52 cards (sometimes with jokers).<br/><br/><br/>Taken from the Article: 45s - Merrimack Valley&rsquo;s Original Card Game - as published in Merrimack Valley Magazine:<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>So much about the card game forty-fives doesn&rsquo;t add up.<br/><br/>If in the right suit, the 5 is the best card, a jack beats a king, and a 2 can be better than a 10 &hellip; but only when it wears black. For the uninitiated, it just gets more confusing from there.<br/><br/>Even the name of the game is ambiguous. Some say the name forty-fives refers to the four 5s in the deck, others say it has to do with a Canadian version of the game, in which the goal is to reach 45 points (the Canadians call our version &ldquo;120&rdquo;). Then there&rsquo;s the theory that forty-fives is derived from &ldquo;forte&rdquo; &mdash; meaning strong &mdash; the 5 being the &ldquo;mightiest&rdquo; card. And is it written &ldquo;45s,&rdquo; or &ldquo;forty-fives&rdquo;?<br/><br/>Through all the confusion, however, it all makes sense to legions of forty-fives players around the Merrimack Valley. A game rooted in 19th century Ireland, forty-fives is as popular as ever across the Valley in 2012, whether it&rsquo;s played for fun, in a league, at a fundraiser or even on a computer.<br/><br/>The following rules summary was taken from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.the45scardgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.the45scardgame.com</a> <br/><br/>Rules (Merrimack Valley Style)<br/><br/>Objective: Partners try to win tricks and prevent their opponents from doing so. The first team to reach 120 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Scoring: Each trick counts for 5 points, and the highest trump in play is an additional 5. After the hand, each team counts what they have taken. If the bidder's team has taken at least the amount of their bid, they score all they have won. If this team fails, the amount of their bid is deducted from their score. The other team in either case always scores what it has won in tricks.<br/><br/>Winning the Game: The team to first reach a total of 120 points wins the game. If both teams reach 120 in the same hand, the bidding team wins the game.<br/><br/>Players: This game can be played with anywhere from 2 to 10 players, but in this version it's 2 vs. 2 (partners).<br/><br/>Cards: A regular deck of 52. The highest trump is the 5, then the Jack, then and Ace of Hearts (no matter what suit is trump). After that it goes Ace of suit, King, Queen, and then it black it goes 2 through 10 and in red 10 through 2 (both<br/>cases skipping the 5).<br/><br/>The Full rank in the trump suit is the following; <br/>From highest to lowest:<br/><br/>Hearts:<br/>5, J, A, K, Q, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2<br/><br/>Diamonds:<br/>5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2<br/><br/>Clubs:<br/>5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br/><br/>Spades:<br/>5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br/><br/>The Full rank in off suit is as follows: (the Ace of Hearts is not shown since it is always a trump and always the third highest card);<br/><br/>From highest to lowest:<br/><br/>Hearts:<br/>K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2<br/><br/>Diamonds:<br/>K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A<br/><br/>Clubs:<br/>K, Q, J, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br/><br/>Spades:<br/>K, Q, J, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br/> Dealing: Each player is dealt 5 cards in batches of 3 then 2. After the initial 3 cards to each player, 3 are dealt to a kitty followed by 2 more to each player.<br/><br/>Bidding: The bidding starts with the player to the left of the deal and continues clockwise. Each player in turn may either <br/>bid or pass. Bids are made in multiples of 5 up to 30, with the minimum opening bid being 15. No suit is mentioned during <br/>the bidding process until all bids have been made. The highest bidder names the trump suit.<br/><br/>Drawing: Each player discards as many cards (up to 4) as he wishes from his hand. The dealer then restores each player's<br/>hand to 5 cards, starting with the player to his left. Cards are dealt all at once to each player (no 3-2 method).<br/><br/>Playing: The bidder makes the opening lead. The hand is played out in 5 tricks. If a trump is lead and you have any trump <br/>cards, you must follow suit.* If an off-suit card is led, any card may be played. A trick is won by the highest trump or the highest card of the suit led if no trump are played.<br/><br/><br/>    Reneging exception: The three highest trumps (5, J, Ace of Hearts) have the privilege of reneging when a lower trump is led. For example, if the trump 6 is led, a player holding any of these three top trumps without lower trumps may throw off-suit instead of following suit (if he has lower trump also, then he must play a trump). But there is no reneging a higher trump. For example, if the trump Jack is played, the holder of the 5 may renege, but not the holder of the Ace of Hearts.<br/><br/><br/>",

The rich reward and eternal glory certainly are good motivations. Unfortunately you are not the only detective who's after the card. This makes the investigation difficult at least. <br/>The answers you get from your fellow detectives are ambiguous and enigmatic. So... it's up to you to find the missing card first.<br/><br/>This is the first Decktet deduction game. All 2-9 cards but one have been dealt out. The cards in this game all show at least 4 characteristics: one rank, two suits and one type (location, personality or event). On your turn choose two characteristics you would like to know more about. Ask the other players how many times these characteristics appear on their cards. As a detective, you will find it's just a matter of elimination. It's all quite logical...<br/><br/>",

So if they start on a black square, they must land on a white square. Promoted pieces, called masters, may land anywhere along their line. Pieces cannot jump each other, and they capture by landing on an enemy-occupied square.<br/><br/>Promotion occurs, when a minion piece lands on a corner space.<br/><br/>The game ends, when all minions are gone.

The publisher was closed so it is hard to get the exact date.<br/><br/>Bao Zheng(包拯)(999-1062, also named Bao Qing Tian 包青天) was a much-praised official who served during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Northern Song Dynasty in ancient China. He was respected as a fair justice. His stories are popular in Chinese people.<br/><br/>In each turn, a player plays a card facedown and draw a card. Players in this game would play different roles. The First player who play the Emperor become Emperor (play Emperor faceup). Then Emperor have to call out Bao Qing Tian. Other players who have Bao Qing Tian card can play it to become Bao Qing Tian. The Bao Qing Tian have to decide which player(s) are the police, Wang Zhao(王朝) and Ma Han(馬漢), depending on their cards. AS soon as the officers are decided, The Emperor says which kind of criminals he want to get rid of (there are 4 kinds of offenders). Then the police can look at one player's hand when his turn is or catch other players' cards when they discard. Bao Qing Tian have to count the times when the police searches, but the limit is 10 searches. If the police arrests the criminal, Bao Qing Tian decides how to punish the player who holds the criminal. Otherwise, the police is punished. For example, a punishment may require player to sing a song, make a funny face, etc. At this time, if players have the mathematical symbols (add, plus, subtract, minus), they can help or afflict the criminal. Sometimes the criminal would have those symbolic cards and he can help himself. If the criminal is the Emperor, he can cancel his punishment (this is the dark side of this game).<br/><br/>",

The new features include variable turn order and variable player powers. The existing features, area control, action selection and trading are also improved. The deterministic combat system is replaced by a more attractive tactical combat system.<br/><br/>The setting of the game is the Middle Ages of Europe. The players take the role of kings ruling over expanding nations fighting for dominance. Each player will develop his country's technologies, engage in trade, build forts, and raise armies to conquer his neighbors in his attempt to forge an empire.<br/><br/>Warriors &amp; Traders: Middle Ages can be combined with the Warriors &amp; Traders: Italia expansion and with any other map expansion that has been or will be released.

        "description": "Black Diamonds is a game for two to four players that covers over one hundred years of Northeastern Pennsylvania coal mining. Players take the role of mine owners who are attempting to mine anthracite, or, &quot;black diamonds&quot; from the rich coal fields of this region to become the most profitable mine.<br/><br/>During the game, players must hire miners, improve their mine and its safety, extract the coal, then ship it down a unique canal system to the market that simulates the manner in which coal was actually shipped during this era. The coal is then sold at a limited market which creates fierce competition for the most profit as multiple mine owners try to ship and sell their coal.<br/><br/>All of this economic and transportation activity is set against a backdrop of historical events which can influence the course of the game. These include the development of the railroad as an alternate means of transportation, the great flood which nearly destroyed the Lehigh Canal, the rise of Bethlehem Iron and Steel as a major national industry that must be supplied with coal, and the rise of labor unions. During the game, mine owners walk the fine line between profit and safety, payroll, graft, and layoffs which can cause worker discontent to rise to the point that a union is formed. If the union comes to their mine, mine owners must negotiate with their workers to continue operations. The player who best manages their mine and their labor force to make the most profit will become the King of Black Diamonds!<br/><br/>The game is an original design by Geof Gambill with original artwork by Chris Cassidy.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or force the opponent in a situation where he has no more available moves. Each turn, a player has one or two actions:<br/><br/><br/>    First, he must move with one of his pieces or stack of pieces. If a piece jumps over an opponent's piece that piece is captured and stacked beneath the jumping figure, forming a stack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Optionally he can move one of the board's hexagonal tiles, thus rearranging the game board.<br/><br/><br/>",

Use espionage, investment, and your loyal armies to expand your kingdom and achieve ultimate glory in this portable, quick, and easy-to-learn war based card game -- the only card game of its kind. Get it now and travel back in time ... to the Age of War!<br/><br/>Age of War card game from Battle Born Games is a medieval era, war-based card game that plays like a board game. Conquering land is the name of the game, and you can do this through battle and espionage. Along the way, enhancing your empire with cities and castles will help you accomplish your goals. You only have three actions to use per turn though, so you must carefully decide how best to use those actions with the cards available to you at that time. Here's briefly how it works:<br/><br/>(1) The player draws cards to start the turn.<br/>(2) The player then takes action!  This is when you play a card to the table, wage battle, and/or upgrade a city or castle.<br/>(3) After the player completes his actions, one army card may be moved from any territory to any territory within his empire.<br/>The cards:<br/>(a) Territory cards are central to the game. You want land above all else, and you'll do anything to get it!<br/>(b) Building cards can be added to any kingdom in your empire, and there are two types of building cards -- castle or city.<br/>(c) Army cards can be added to any territory or group of territories in your empire, and they attack and defend in battle.<br/>(d) Money cards will pay for upgrades to buildings, buying elite army units, and paying off enemy agents.<br/>(e) Mission cards have various purposes, all designed to help you win the game.<br/>Once you've amassed enough land to prove your dominance over every other king in the world, you win the game!<br/><br/>",

It shows how politics in Latin America works.<br/><br/>Each player controls a cabinet of political lizards, with a dominant political ideology (right wing, left wing or center). Depending on its current ideology, a player will be able to hire certain politicians (ties of colors red, blue, grey) in the main board by auctioning in the different media (Tv, radio, internet and press). This auction will determine order of turn as well as which politicians he can acquire. A player can also auction for tamales that will give the player points and money.<br/><br/>Players will try to match the symbols in the ties of the lizards with the union cards to acquire them. Unions will give the players money to the lizards of th same ideology and bills that the cabinet must pass by spending coins and politicians.<br/><br/>Finally, players can send some of their politicians to the president board to do lobby. The player at the end of the game with more tie cards in the president board will gain points by a mayority mechanic.<br/><br/>In the game, player's will try to acquire Unions by bidding on the media (TV, Radio, Internet, Press), while trying to get &quot;tamales&quot; (a tipical Colombian food) to give to the people and buy votes. The Unions will ask for a set of political ideologies in the player's cabinet, so, the player will have to hire politicians of the proper ideologies to get their support.

To place a piece next to two or more other pieces on the board, a player must place a piece a piece with the same number as the first digit of the sum of the pieces already on the board.<br/><br/>The game demands that players do a lot of addition to find the pieces that can be placed and to understand the strategy behind it.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>足し算ガ決め手の算数パズル的ゲームです。<br/>数字1～10が書かれたの10個の駒をボードに配置して最後に残った駒の数<br/>が大きい方が勝ちとなります。ただし途中で合法手が無く置けなければ負け<br/>となります。<br/>ボード上の駒に接するように配置して、接した駒が1個ならそれより<br/>も大きな数字（偶数奇数の区別有り）、2個以上なら接した駒の合計数の一の<br/>位と同じ数字の駒が置けます。<br/>配置出来る駒を見つけゲームの戦略を考えるには一度に沢山の足し算が必要なゲームです。<br/><br/>Not to be confused with Beehive<br/><br/>",

Every ingredient has a unique scoring condition, and quantities of each are extremely limited &mdash; the servers never seem to refill the salad bar &mdash; so you've got to hurry and snag the ones that will make your salad the best of all!<br/><br/>In more detail, using a rondel-based mechanism, you move your meeple on your turn to one of the three salad bar stations in front of you, perform the action that corresponds to that station, then take the ingredient available there. If another player's meeple is currently located at the station you want to visit, you can bump them &mdash; but doing so allows them to leave the line and move to any unoccupied station, giving them a free ingredient and action.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>The First Great War ended in December 1916 with Wilson&rsquo;s Peace, a negotiated settlement that left all parties vaguely dissatisfied (except those no longer called on to die by the millions). The Second Great War erupted in August 1940, with Serbian, Russian, French and Italian armies attacking the Central Powers in a naked grab for territory and power.<br/><br/>Armies and fleets were not the only forces the aggressors deployed. Along the broad Danube River, the Austrian flotilla fought to keep their Serbian enemies from pushing upstream into the heart of the Monarchy. The armored riverine warships, known as monitors, featured heavy guns and thick armor, in effect small battleships maximized for the river environment. But Serbia had built its own fleet of river vessels, as had their ally, Romania.<br/><br/>River Fleets introduces these armored warships to Panzer Grenadier. It&rsquo;s part of our Second Great War setting. There are 68 new playing pieces: 20 double-sized river monitors, and 48 standard-sized ones for smaller craft plus troops and leaders. There are also two new 11x17-inch maps showing the beautiful blue Danube in its full watery glory. Plus you get a set of 10 scenarios to use them (that&rsquo;s as many as some publishers will give you in what they call a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; boxed game). River Fleets is a pretty-much self-contained Panzer Grenadier supplement. You'll need a rulebook, charts and markers from any Panzer Grenadier game.<br/><br/>",

It was a place where, oddly enough, two armies confronted each other for FIVE days with almost no fighting, and Athenian democracy was put to the test as the Greek forces debated (and voted) whether or not to attack the Persians, finally reaching the affirmative only after seeing most of the Persian cavalry reloaded onto ships for use&hellip;somewhere probably unpleasant for Athens.<br/><br/><br/>As to the battle itself, numbers are uncertain but we know the Greeks were heavily outnumbered. We know also that the two armies&rsquo; fighting style and equipment were near opposites, with Greeks depending on shields, armor, and close-quarter fighting and Persians depending on missile weapons and skirmishing. It seems pretty clear that the Greek army ran (or advanced at speed) as soon as they got within bow range, to reduce the time they would endure arrows without being able to retaliate. And it seems pretty clear that, once the Greek army closed with the Persians (who had no room to withdraw and maintain a firing distance) that the battle would be a slaughter. It was.<br/><br/>At under two hours of play time, you can make your own explorations into this battle without scheduling &ldquo;marathon game sessions&rdquo; in order to play.  You&rsquo;ll be able to quickly try various strategies and see what differences you can make on the outcome.  Units active by chit-pull per formations and combat includes both melee and ranged fire. Leadership and morale matter (in several ways) and combat results use step reduction and several levels of unit deterioration.<br/><br/>The game offers a historical set-up scenario plus variants for both set up and reinforcements.

        "description": "I love minions. They are indispensable cogs in the machine of my villainous ambitions &mdash; but they aren't too smart. You have to watch the minions all the time  because otherwise they would screw up everything. I got sick and tired of this. I wish I had loyal assistants able to chasten the minions, twist the asteroids' tails, and bring me coffee in bed... Well, perhaps, that's not necessary.<br/><br/>But in our galaxy, everybody with a head on their shoulders fancies themselves a villain. Where to find quick-witted servants? Luckily, the League of Villains has come to aid just in time. They have assembled a portal to another dimension inhabited by best henchmen in the universe and vowed to open it once per season. I hope they are not lying. So all I can do now is wait! And rig the portal with explosives, of course, to prevent other villains from laying hands on what is rightfully mine!<br/><br/>The Henchmen Expansion for Supervillain: This Galaxy Is Mine! gives you figures that are head and shoulders above ordinary minions. In the hands of a skilled villain, each henchman is able to reverse the course of the intergalactic battle!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you shuffle the &quot;Unstable Portal&quot; card in the domination deck along with &quot;Secret Facilities&quot;. Sooner or later, some player draws &quot;Unstable Portal&quot; , and when this happens, each villain takes a henchman card, which includes three abilities from which to choose. You can play any one of those abilities, then you place the henchman card in the discard pile.<br/><br/>The two upper abilities of a henchman card are played strictly in accordance with the minion ops rules. Furthermore, using a henchman is considered playing minion ops. Therefore, during your turn, you may either play one of the two upper henchman's abilities or a regular minion ops (along with any number of swift minion ops). As for the lower ability on a henchman card, it is played as swift minion ops. It's much weaker than any of the two upper abilities, yet comes in handy sometimes!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is also steeped in parody--both through artwork and flavor text--concerning the EU Referendum. Whether you supported Leave, Remain, or just like to see political figures taken to task, there&rsquo;s something here for you to laugh about. (There&rsquo;s also fact cards, with actual facts relevant to the issues of the EU Referendum&hellip;ones neither campaign seemed to actually use.)<br/><br/>In a Nutshell:<br/>Each player chooses a campaign (Leave or Remain) then cooperates with that campaign to defeat the other campaign. There are two primary game mechanics: (1) rolling dice to match symbols on cards that provide effects, and (2) using those effects to strategically place campaign tokens on a map (or remove your opponents). The campaign that claims a majority of the map first, wins. Players can also use effects to sabotage the opposing campaign.<br/><br/>A Player's Turn:<br/>A player rolls argument dice and tries to match the symbols on the dice (representing arguments relevant to the EU Referendum) with the symbols on headline cards. Matching all the symbols on a headline card grants the player various effects--from advancing the player's side on the map (and thus winning over voters) to sabotaging another player (by blocking that player from rerolling, using wilds, or advancing that player's side on the map).<br/><br/>The campaign that flips three of the five voting regions first--by placing three tokens on a region or through other game effects--wins the vote and the game.<br/><br/>Brexit: The Board Game of Second Chances provides humorous content with accessible, quick-to-learn, but dynamic gameplay. It's perfect for a mix of skilled and new gamers, or as a fun distraction on an otherwise long and serious gaming session.<br/><br/>",
