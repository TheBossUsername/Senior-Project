        "description": "During setup, each player is dealt a 'Capo' card with a special ability. Then, each player is dealt three cards that represent three kinds of basic workers. The game has four basic workers and two 'specialist workers' (one of then works like a 'joker' that you can use as any of the basec one, and the other specialist is you 'right-hand' who help you with some kind of special ability)<br/><br/>During the game, which is played in rounds, each player play his own turn. In his turn, a player can play cards; those cards usually are 'bussines cards', but each of then need two workers. If you don't have the correct worker you can hire to other players, then you have to negociate the cost.<br/><br/>Others cards are 'special cards' that allow several efects (steal, kill on worker, police, anticipate news, get the money just now, and so on...) some of them can be played in any moment, but few of them can be played only in your turn. Of course, you can negociate the use and the target of that cards.<br/><br/>When you end your turn, you draw or discard until you have seven cards.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, there are revealed two cards from the 'news' deck, which are some special effects in the game like one worker goes to the jail, or one kind of bussines are not working.<br/><br/>Then you get the money from your bussines cards and pay the agreements you had done (the agreements are mandatory).<br/><br/>The richer player at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>All the name of the workers are 'spanish-word-joke'.<br/><br/>The people in the bank-notes are friends and family of the designer.<br/><br/><br/>&quot;V&iacute;stete para la ocasi&oacute;n, ten el maletero de tu coche a punto y un buen pu&ntilde;ado de balas...<br/><br/>Sum&eacute;rgete en los bajos fondos de la ciudad para controlar los negocios de la familia, ordena a tus secuaces que extorsionen en los barrios, influye sobre las leyes y g&aacute;nate a la polic&iacute;a.

Lo importante es que ganes m&aacute;s que nadie al final de la partida y te levantes de la mesa como un digno &iexcl;capo de la mafia!<br/><br/>Mafia es un juego donde se priman los acuerdos y se recompensa al buen negociador. El comercio es lo m&aacute;s importante: demanda secuaces a otras familias si te hacen falta para llevar a cabo los negocios, vende estos negocios o alqu&iacute;lalos si es que te sobran.<br/><br/>Adem&aacute;s, puedes extorsionar amenazando con atacar a otro capo y pedir dinero a cambio para no hacerlo u ofrecerlo si t&uacute; eres el objetivo. Espera para dar un pelotazo, una jugada puede doblar tus ganancias en cualquier momento. &Eacute;chate faroles cuando puedas con las cartas de tu mano, se retorcido y despiadado, &iexcl;esa es la clave de un aut&eacute;ntico capo!<br/><br/>",

Players must husband their resources to maintain their field armies, build and re-equip units, fortify cities and wage war through leaders who command chariots, phalanxes and militia.<br/><br/>Two to five players attempt to achieve their victory conditions (control of cities).  The game is 7 turns, each with 5 separate sections. Four of the sections play very quickly (Initiative Determination, Diplomacy, Drawing Phase Chits, and determining if victory conditions have been met.  The fifth section, Phases, has 12 Actions.  Each Action consists of one specific type, movement/combat, obtaining resources, obtaining food, army maintenance and building, etc. The 12 Actions are chosen randomly with the first six shown face up, allowing the players to know the order.  The remaining six are displayed face down, providing some uncertainty as to the next Action to occur.  As there are 15 Action chits from which to choose, players never know exactly what will occur the second half of the Phase sections. Players must husband their resources and food to maintain their field armies, build and re-equip units, improve fortified cities, and wage battle.<br/><br/>Play is balanced, with each nation's victory conditions tailored to its historical situation. Game duration ranges from 3 hours for a two-player game up to 5-6 hours for a five-player game.<br/><br/>Will Judeah expand its territory under the direction of a great king?

Your zombies will dig up and loot valuables from graves, and while they're there, they can also grab fresh body parts so you can make MORE zombies to dig up MORE graves. Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, it's so good that other Necromancers are now competing with you for the choice cemeteries!<br/><br/>Players start with zombies of varying values.  They take turns placing zombies in specific location to &quot;dig&quot; up graves, steal from opposing laboratories and vaults, and to attack other player's zombies to try and prevent them from digging or stealing (and possibly dismember the opposing zombie beyond further use).<br/><br/>Once all the zombies have been placed, zombies still in position will steal body parts or treasure from opponents, and those set to dig will dig the row, column, or specific space of the graveyard they are assigned to.  If you are competing for spaces in the graveyard (which is the norm), players compare the combined brainpower of their digging zombies, and the higher value gets to the contents of the grave first.<br/><br/>Then you may use your new-found corpse pieces and equipment to assemble new zombies to do your bidding!<br/><br/>The goal is to have the highest total in treasure and unused body parts at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Too Many Cooks is a co-operative hidden information card game about fussy chefs cooking soups together. It is played in 3 rounds of 5 minutes. You can play in one of 3 difficulty settings; easy, moderate &amp; hard, or you can play through all of them in an hour long session.<br/><br/>You are chefs working together on a delicious soup that satisfies shared culinary tastes. The catch is, each chef has secret personal tastes which must also be sated!<br/><br/>The game starts with a soup base of 16 vegetable card ingredients laid out on the table. Rising to the challenge, players take it in turns to change or move the soup ingredients to satisfy as many tastes as possible before the time runs out.<br/><br/>On your turn you may either: <br/>Change just one aspect of a card - ie its vegetable or colour, by swapping it out for a spare card.<br/>or <br/>Rotate a row or column of vegetables 1 card in either direction.<br/>or <br/>Pass - if your personal tastes and all shared tastes are satisfied.<br/><br/>Of course changes to the soup may upset or satisfy other chef&rsquo;s secret taste sensibilities too! So, players vocalise their satisfaction or dissatisfaction and rotate their taste cards in hand to indicate how happy or unhappy they are after each change to the soup. But they cannot say exactly why. Eg &ldquo;Ewwww, that&rsquo;s disgusting!&rdquo; is fine, but not &ldquo;Ewww, I hate mushrooms!&rdquo; Watch what other chefs seem to be working towards, and try to make changes that make everyone as happy as possible.<br/><br/>Play fast to get your soup kitchen up to a 5 star rating over 3 rounds at your chosen difficulty level.

Apparently they were common on the Continent and are still used in places where lift doors would be unsafe, such as nuclear power stations. Anyway, this game has 9 thick cards showing various odd looking passengers going up or down in the lift, with some only partially shown. Each player has a deck of cards showing the same people, in different poses. The cabin cards are shuffled and laid out face-down in two columns of 5, with a gap and a pawn is placed next to the gap. First player to grab the die rolls it and moves the pawn clockwise to face a cabin. Players call out which person they think is in the cabin and the cabin card is turned up. If you're correct, you dump the matching card from your hand; if not, you keep it. But the cabin card is replaced face-down in the original empty space, not where it was previously. In this way, the cabin cards will be moved around as you play, and you'll have to use your memory to clear your hand to win.<br/><br/>There are also tempo chips you can draw for correctly guessing a card you've already dumped. You can use the chips to move the pawn fore or back from the numbered rolled (so it goes to a cabin you remember and want to dump). But get it wrong and you pick the card back to your hand.<br/><br/>",

The scale for the system will be 10 miles a hex and weekly turns, with Divisions as the primary maneuver unit.<br/><br/>Using at its heart a system that is from an older but wonderfully conceived game called &ldquo;Road to the Rhine&rdquo;, players will be able to move all their units once but can, if they can afford the supply cost, move the still unmoved units impulse after impulse. The opposing player will have to maintain adequate reserves to counter this.<br/>The grand campaign game covers the first year of the war.<br/><br/>Using a moderately complex rule set, players will be able to concentrate on the play and not the rules. Keeping your units well supplied will be the key to victory &ndash; but as you advance, you&rsquo;ll see your supply situation deteriorate. Detection will also be a key to victory as finding your enemy is vital to defeating him. Also covered are the epic F-86 versus MiG-15 battles, political limitations of surrogate wars, possible Soviet intervention, possible nuclear weapons, and of course, the United States Navy &ndash; for both support and invasions.<br/><br/>There will be scenarios covering various sized battles and campaigns (with a play time of 2 to 20 hours), as well as a grand campaign game for players that want it all.<br/><br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: 1 week per turn<br/>Map Scale: 7 miles a hex<br/>Players: 1-4<br/>Playing Time: 2-60 hours<br/>Designer: Adam Starkweather<br/>Artist: Ilya Kudryashov<br/><br/>Components:<br/>One 48 page rulebook<br/>One 24 page scenario book<br/>Three 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo; maps<br/>Five Displays and Charts<br/>Two 9/16ths Countersheets<br/>4 Dice<br/>Game Box<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Red Poppies Campaigns: Volume 2 - Last Laurels at Limanowa (LLL), simulates Austria-Hungary's last independent victory against the Russian Empire in World War I.  In November 1914, Russia's 3rd Army pressed on Krakow, the center of Austrian Poland, while the Russian 8th Army threatened to break through the Carpathian passes into Hungary.  Desperate to relieve the pressure, Franz Conrad von H&ouml;tzendorf, Chief of the General Staff for Austria-Hungary, gambled on a counter attack about 25 miles southwest of Krakow.<br/><br/>Conrad launched his 4th Army into the thinly held, 20-mile wide gap between the Russian 3rd and 8th Armies on December 3.  Austro-Hungarian forces rolled forward about 12 miles in just three days along a front from Lipanow in the north to Limanowa in the south.  Russian resistance stiffened on the 6th with fierce fighting erupting around the village of Limanowa.  Several days of see-saw action ensued until the lines crystallized on December 11.<br/><br/>For once, Conrad's daring paid off.  In response to his gains, the Russians scrambled to secure their front and so abandoned plans to drive on Krakow and Hungary.  Conrad, however, paid a heavy price by suffering 12,000 casualties and expending the last of his elite 14th &quot;Innsbruck&quot; infantry corps to stop the Russians who easily absorbed and replaced their 30,000 losses.  Never again would the Austro-Hungarian Army win an independent victory; from now on, all progress depended on German participation.<br/><br/>LLL is the second volume in the Red Poppies Campaign (RPC) system for gaming World War I battles.  Ownership of volume one, The Battles for Ypres, is NOT required to play LLL; everything you need to play LLL is in this box.  LLL offers the same rules as The Battles for Ypres except that section 12, the Ypres scenarios and campaigns, is intentionally left blank while section 13, the Limanowa scenarios and campaigns, has been added.<br/><br/>LLL offers a map of the Limanowa battlefield scaled at 200 meters per hex.  Game play proceeds in interactive turns representing 10 minutes of real time each as players maneuver opposing cavalry and infantry companies across a rugged rural landscape typical of the Carpathian foothills.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/><br/>&bull; Complexity:                 6 out of 10<br/><br/>&bull; Solitaire suitability:      8 out of 10<br/><br/>&bull; Time Scale:                 10 minutes per turn<br/><br/>&bull; Map Scale:                  200 yards per hex<br/><br/>&bull; Unit Scale:                 Companies, squadrons, sections<br/><br/><br/>",

The game covers the Axis assault on the south-west Soviet Union, which began with the attack by Army Group South with 41 divisions (plus allied divisions) against a Soviet force of 60 divisions.  The game concludes in mid-August 1941, at which time, historically, 20 Soviet divions surrendered in the &quot;Uman Encirclement.&quot;<br/><br/>The game contains a wealth of different unit types - including bridging units, motorcycle infantry, an armored train, a Soviet river flotilla, combat engineers, rocket artillery, anti-aricraft units, et., etc. - as well as the more standard armored, mechanized, and infantry units.  Supply, weather, and terrain all play their part, as do fortifications, strongpoints (these can be built each turn), air power, artillery, reinforcements and replacements, headquarters units, and reserves.  The game sequence includes &quot;reaction movement&quot; by units in reserve status, as well as separate motorized movement phases.  A particularly eleqant piece of design has the Axis motorized movement following standard movement and combat - thus facilitating armored breakthrough; for the Soviets the order is reversed, leading to poorer coordination between tanks and infantry...<br/><br/>There are 4 scenarios - The Siege of Kiev is an introductory scenario lasting 7 turns, and using only Map B.  Rundstedt Attacks depicts the German assault on perhaps the strongest portion of the Soviet frontier; it last 5 turns and uses only Map A.  Secenario 3, &quot;Optional Deployment,&quot; is a variant of #2.  The Campaign Game lasts 27 turns and uses all 3 maps.  Victory is judged both in terms of combat losses, and the Axis capture of key geographical objectives.<br/><br/>Historically accurate, fast paced, and playable - Blitzkrieg in the South is a worthy first entry in what will surely become the definitive East Front Series.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Three 22 x 34&quot; maps<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 20-page rules booklet<br/>One 1-page Turn Record Track<br/>Four 1-page scenario set-up cards (two Soviet &amp; 2 Axis)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The International Space Station (ISS) is a joint project in which sixteen countries are currently involved. The ISS is a symbol of what people can achieve by working together. Boundaries that seem so important on Earth take a back seat on the space station; what matters is a perfectly coordinated collaboration between the astronauts.<br/><br/>Mission ISS begins in 1998 when the first module of the ISS was built. From your control center, you give instructions to the astronauts in space. At first only a few crew members are on the station, but over time you bring more astronauts to the station to add new modules, carry out various research assignments, or just drift in weightlessness. As on the real space station, the co-operation between the players and the co-ordination of the astronauts determine the success of the ISS mission. Only together will you be able to master the challenge of space.<br/><br/>In more detail, the mechanism at the heart of the game requires deep co-operative play. To give instructions to astronauts, you combine two command cards: one of yours and one of your teammates. After you have performed the command effects, you place both cards on your own discard pile, which means that your turns always have an impact on the options of the other players. When you run out of cards, you take all cards from your discard pile to re-fill your display &mdash; but doing so brings the end of the game closer.<br/><br/>Up to six astronauts can be on the ISS.

Pick up precious artifacts while you sail up and down the Nile river, offer them to the monuments currently being built, and the Gods shall bless your travel!<br/><br/>Each turn in Nile Artifacts, you move your ship forward, stopping at one of the nine ports and picking up one of the artifact cards available there. You may also pick up gold, which can be used to obtain more artifacts or to turn your ship around and sail the Nile in the opposite direction. Once every ship has arrived at one end of the Nile, players can make their offerings to the monuments currently in construction, each of them requiring a different type or combination of artifacts. Whenever a monument is completed, players receive victory points depending on the amount of donations they have made towards this particular monument.<br/><br/>When offerings are done, the ships go back on the Nile to travel in the other direction and pick up more artifacts. Once the monument deck is empty, the player with the most victory points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

From these, players can choose between two face-down crescendo cards, face up note cards that are free to take, and the ghost note: a wild card that may be played as any letter! Players also might be able to purchase an Ovation card if they have enough roses!<br/><br/>Once all available cards are selected, players conduct a performance (spell a word). Players resolve abilities on cards, earn roses and potentially Awards, and a new round begins!<br/><br/>Sometimes players will uncover tomato cards that can mix the game up, so be sure to read them aloud and make sure their effects aren't getting thrown at you! Some cards also have symbols, which when paired with identical symbols earn the player bonus roses or letter cards.<br/><br/>As players earn Ovation cards, more note cards are revealed in the draft, leading to bigger words and more chaos!<br/><br/>",

The game is played over four nerve-wrecking diving expeditions.<br/><br/>For each expedition, players have to plan the amount of oxygen they want to share, the depth they want to dive to, and the duration they will spend scavenging for treasure. The deeper the player dives, the more treasure the player can scavenge, but the more perilous the expedition. As each player descends into the dark murky waters, they will have to watch out for nasty sharks, earthquakes and worst of all, the other Divers!<br/><br/>D3 puts a new twist on push-your-luck games, because like a co-op game, your planning and actions determine each others' success, but unlike a co-op game, all players scheme to get more treasure than the rest. This coupled with the very interactive Event Cards will create an engaging playing atmosphere that will keep everyone on their toes. It has shown to be a good game for families, girlfriends and wives.<br/><br/>As the dive unfolds and the oxygen drains away with every gasping breath, will you remain as just another Lara Croft wannabe, or will you return with rich sunken treasures and maybe even the fabled Lost Jewel of Zakarra? It is all in your hands, or fins.<br/><br/>",

When pedestrians put coins into these machines, surprises await them as they open the packages.<br/><br/>Strange Vending Machine is a fast-paced and light family game. Players choose which vending machines to buy food from in order to score points. If a player has no cash in hand, they can shake money out from a vending machine, so watch carefully and observe which vending machines have the most money! Strange Vending Machine comes with two rule sets: &quot;Muscle Man's Purchase Challenge&quot; and &quot;Ingredients and Recipes of the Mysterious Wizard&quot;. The two games have independent rule sets and cannot be combined in play.<br/><br/>In &quot;Muscle Mans Purchase Challenge&quot;, each player has a vending machine full of food cards. During the player's turn, every one choose one of following actions to perform simultaneously: Buy a food card, stock a food card and take coins, take one coin from the supply. If the end condition is satisfied, the game ends. Score food cards in front of the players, and the total coins owned. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>In &quot;Ingredients and Recipes of the Mysterious Wizard', there are six vending machines placing on the game box. During a player's turn, the active player either buys a food card from one of the vending machines, or takes all the coins from one of the machines. Each food card is contained of an ingredient and a recipe. The recipes provide victory points in the end of the game, as the required ingredients are satisfied. Once a player purchases their fifth food card, all other players take one more action, and a Final Coin Shake occurs. Score the recipe points at the bottom of the food cards. Each ingredient may be scored multiple times. Each fake coin is worth negative 1 point. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each horse has a handicap rating and the higher the better basically. Each horse's stamina is adjusted once the going has been determined by spinning the going adjuster.<br/><br/>The going is important as it dictates the amount of speed points each horse gets. For example, if the going is firm all get 64; if heavy 54. The horses handicap mark is added to however many spaces a player chooses to move their horse per go of a player. So, again, the higher the handicap, the more likely you are to win.<br/><br/>There are times when you will land on a fence and so an appropriate card is drawn and it must be acted upon immediately. There are also horseshoe spaces that can bring good and bad luck.<br/><br/>More than just a dice throw and race game, each player must ensure that each of their horses has enough speed points to go two circuits around the lovely board. There are 24 hand painted horses and it all just looks nice.<br/><br/>",

Each enemy card shows a combination of one (e.g. Orc patrol) to four (e.g. Balrog) symbols, with six different symbols total in the game: sword, axe, spear, bow, fist, and shield. The symbols are not evenly distributed; some are associated with magic, and thus rarer than those associated with mundane weaponry.<br/><br/>In order to beat the enemies, the players collect &quot;fellowships&quot; (groups) of companion cards (which also show some subset of the six symbols) in front of them. Once the symbols of a group match one or more enemy cards, the player can send this group to battle to win them. The group is then discarded.<br/><br/>On their turn a player can either:<br/><br/><br/>    Play one companion card to one of their groups and, if possible, attack.<br/>    Start a new group and, if possible, attack.<br/>    Draw one card from the deck. If it's a Mordor card, it is placed on the table and the card draw repeated; this continues until a companion is drawn, which is added to the player's hand.<br/><br/><br/>When the third Mordor card hits the table, all players suffer a counterattack and lose a card from their hand, a card from one of their groups, or an already vanquished enemy, depending on the text of the Mordor card.  Then one of the enemies is discarded, and play continues with the triggering player drawing another card from the deck.<br/><br/>When no enemies remain, the game ends. Each enemy card is worth 1-10 victory points, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An eternal conflict for the land of Ironwood is raging between two factions: the stalwart and hard-working Ironclad, settlers of the iron mountains; and the ferocious Woodwalkers, swift and deadly shadows of the forests. Both factions struggle for the ultimate control over the land for its greatest treasure: the Larimor Crystals, a mysterious substance holding immense energy within. It can be found both inside the colossal mountains and scattered across the dense forests.<br/><br/>The Ironclad extract the essence of the crystals and process their energy to fuel their machines and mechanical inventions. If they succeed, their giant forges will swarm the land with endless armies, and establish ultimate dominance over Ironwood.<br/><br/>The Woodwalkers use the crystals&rsquo; raw magical power to discover and retrieve three ancient totems from secret ritual sites, hidden in the mountains. Once retrieved, the combined power of these totems will summon the Guardian, the ancient protector of the woods, to wipe out the Ironclad once and for all.<br/><br/>One way or another, the eternal conflict is finally coming to an end.<br/><br/>Ironwood is a rules-light, highly asymmetric, card-driven tactical game for 1-2 players. Each round, you and your opponent alternate playing a total of 3 of your faction-specific cards for their action effects. These effects include positioning your warbands, initiating combat, extracting crystals, bestowing temporary passive effects, and many more. When combat occurs, you will use the same cards for their combat values instead, in a simultaneous bid to gain combat bonuses, inflict and fend off casualties, and augment the Dominance value of your warbands to win the combat.<br/><br/>The two factions are completely asymmetric in their play styles, decks, victory conditions - even in which parts of the map they can access.<br/><br/>As the Commander of the Ironclad, your primary goal is to lay down the foundations of your forges in the outer mountains, and once you have collected enough crystals, build forges on the foundations. As the Chieftain of the Woodwalkers, your mission is to locate your people&rsquo;s ancient totems through Vision cards, clear the path to them by defeating Ironclad warbands, and finally securing them in the outer forests, beyond the Ironclads&rsquo; reach. Once you have retrieved the third totem as the Chieftain, or built the third Forge as the Commander, you immediately win the game.<br/><br/>Ironwood also features a low-upkeep solo mode against the Ironclad or the Woodwalkers. Although both solo opponents work on the same main principles, each of them bears its faction&rsquo;s unique aspects and features.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Modern War #15, Jan-Feb 2015<br/><br/>Red Tide West: The Cold War &amp; World War III in Europe is a wargame that simulates a hypothetical Warsaw Pact invasion of West Germany in the late-1980&rsquo;s. Red Tide West also presumes a wider conflict beyond the scope of the game, but postulates West Germany to be the so-called &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; for the entire war. In other words, regardless of what is happening in, say, Scandinavia, or the Balkans, or the Middle East, etc., the presumption here is that the war will be won or lost in central Europe. To wit, if the Red Army cripples NATO and overruns West Germany, it is assumed that diplomatic negotiations will then suddenly become advantageous to both sides. For the Soviets, they would be satisfied to end the war with their substantial gains, not to mention the distinction of being regarded by the world as having won the war, especially if a nuclear exchange had not yet occurred. NATO, on the other hand (and especially the French) would want to end the war before the Red Army rolled into France proper, and certainly before a full-blown nuclear war erupted (or escalated further, if a limited nuclear exchange had already occurred).<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin, if the Red Army&rsquo;s drive into West Germany is halted or thrown back, the war will have run its course then and there, regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the world. Negotiations would be underway, regardless, but the Soviets would have very little to gain (and actually much to lose) by perpetuating a war that is then being perceived as the ultimate reproach of the Soviet state and Communist ideology. Indeed, before Soviet battlefield defeats became prolific and pronounced, and especially before NATO units began to push across the borders of East Bloc countries, the Soviets would be confronted with a choice of trying to negotiate an end to the war before the Warsaw Pact alliance collapsed (or worse, defected&hellip;as if a widespread repeat of the Hungarian Uprising of &lsquo;56), or resort to nuclear strikes to avoid a total defeat (a decidedly undesirable solution when considering NATO&rsquo;s predictable response).<br/><br/>In any case, Red Tide West presumes a short war whereby the final dispositions will be known within a matter of weeks. The Soviet timetables expected the Red Army to reach the French border within 15 days, and therefore the game excludes Soviet &ldquo;Category C&rdquo; and &ldquo;Category D&rdquo; reserves, which could not have been mobilized within the timeframe of the game&hellip; whether or not the Soviet timetables were realistic in the first place.<br/><br/>The game includes two maps (22&quot;x34&rdquo;) and 560 counters.<br/><br/>Design &amp; Development: Eric R.

        "description": "Help save endangered butterflies! Construction projects in your city are disrupting the natural butterfly habitat. Capture  butterflies and deliver them to protected butterfly gardens in local zoos, botanical gardens, and museums.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds. Players start each round by playing a card from their hands to determine the round's turn order. Cards are numbered from 0 to 59, and lower numbered cards go first. On a turn, a player captures butterflies from the field and adds them to the jar. When possible, players &quot;deliver butterflies&quot; from their jars to the different butterfly gardens to score victory points (VPs). Which butterflies can be delivered is indicated on the face-up &quot;delivery cards&quot; and players are often in a race to deliver butterflies to take the cards and score points. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>During the game, players must carefully decide which butterfly cards to play. By playing lowered numbered cards, players not only get a better pick of butterflies in the field, but they also get first chance at delivering butterflies. However, lower numbered butterfly cards usually have fewer butterflies on them, so players cannot add as many to their jars. Also, butterfly cards with special powers usually have high numbers, so you often must sacrifice turn order in order to use one of these special powers.<br/><br/>In this second edition, the artwork and components have been upgraded. A major rule change is a new set-collection aspect of the delivery cards. There are now 4 types of delivery cards and players score a bonus for having a variety. Also, there are some minor rule changes with scoring butterflies in one's hand and jar at game end. Another small change is in the special powers on some of the cards.<br/>  <br/>The maximum number of players in the second edition was lowered to 5 from 6.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gruntz is a dedicated 15mm fast play wargame designed for skirmish level play with between 10 to 40 figures per side using combined arms. It is based around a generic platoon level battle, not restricted to a set genre or background setting. Vehicle and artillery rules are included for a combined arms gaming experience with statistics provided for all manufacturers of 15mm sci-fi and modern figures.<br/><br/>The rules and statistics in Gruntz cover modern and futuristic technology, allowing for low tech and high tech mixed battles. The system includes statistics for alien technology and weird war style creatures like zombies and werewolves, so most modern and futuristic settings can be played.<br/><br/>Gruntz only uses D6 die for all rolling and the core mechanic is based around a 2D6 roll adding a number from the models statistics and to succeed at a task you must beat a certain target number. For example if you wanted a unit of Gruntz to shoot at another unit, you add the Shoot statistic of the Gruntz firing to your 2D6 roll and must equal or exceed the ToHit statistic of the target model. For most actions you modify the roll depending on certain conditions.<br/><br/>Initiative is based on a standard turn sequence or playing card base initiative which adds a series of special conditions for any Ace cards drawn and assigned to units.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, each player receives five number cards at random along with a zero card.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, lay out one row of number cards for each player, with two cards in each row. Each turn, all players secretly choose a card in their hand, then reveal them simultaneously. Whoever played a number card chooses all of the cards in one row and adds them to his hand, discarding the card used for bidding. Whoever played a zero card adds a card from the top of the deck to a remaining row, then reclaims the zero card. All players who played zero cards then repeat this process. If a row reaches five cards in length, add the top card from the Bull deck to this row; if all rows end in Bull cards, then players must play number cards.<br/><br/>Whenever a player picks up a row, they must then immediately reduce their hand to five number cards (not counting their zero card, which they keep throughout), playing any excess cards in hand onto one or more stacks in front of them, with cards being played in ascending order. Bull cards are placed separately.<br/><br/>After the last row has been picked up, the round ends. Players then create new rows and play another round. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards to finish the round, after which the game ends. Players then score positive points for Bull cards and for the bullheads in the pile with the most bullheads; all other bullheads are negative points. The player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

Watch as your ball comes perilously close to each hazard. Did you plan the shot well enough to keep your ball on course?<br/><br/>Each hole is created using a series of modular game cards. Hazards and features can be set up at random or arranged to resemble any hole from any golf course in the world.<br/><br/>Once the hole is assembled, players must choose the right club, aim carefully (taking wind into account) and hit the ball with the right swing tempo. Too fast and you'll lose control of the ball. Too slow and your ball won't go far enough.<br/><br/>The core of the game uses a clever movement mechanic that combines loss of control with distance. You use a number of dice to represent swing tempo (one two or three for slow, moderate and fast). Doubles and triples represent the effects of wind and slope, causing your ball to make semi-random deviations from a straight shot. Roll more dice and you're more likely to lose control and have your ball drift off course!<br/><br/>",

The squirrels' nut storehouse is empty and must be refilled quickly &ndash; and before the thieving raccoon David comes along and steals it.<br/><br/>In the family game Auf die N&uuml;sse!, players slip into the role of small squirrels, who roll the dice and skillfully place their characters on the board to collect as many nuts as they can and sort them in their storehouse by variety. Each player has a set of cards with differently-sized nut storehouses and 15 squirrels of one color. On a player's turn he rolls the dice and must combine a white with a green die and place a squirrel on the appropiate field. You can repeat this several times, but if you roll a field with a squirrel, your turn ends.<br/><br/>If you think you have placed enough squirrels, you send them into the forest; if you have two or more squirrels in one of the lower forest areas you may take the nut card from the display and put it into your storehouse. Other player's squirrels move up in the forest. In the upper fields you need three or four squirrels, but there's also a wider range of nuts. On a special field the thieving raccoon David awaits; he helps steal nuts from other players' storehouses.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck of nuts is exhausted. The player who has collected most victory points in his storehouse wins.<br/><br/>",

This is called &quot;bumping&quot; and it's a key part of the game, allowing player with high cards to still win very few tricks if they play well. And that is the key to the game, it is about how you play, not what cards you get.<br/><br/>It is playable with 3-5, but it is recommended for 4.<br/><br/>",

It depicts the attack by the German 57th Panzerekorps to open a corridor to the 6th Army, trapped in the Stalingrad Kessel. The fierce battle, that took place between December 12-23, 1942, was not a foregone conclusion. The fate of 20 German divisions hung in the balance&mdash;and the loss of 6th Army would turn the tide in the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>The German player must use his initial advantage to open a corridor to 6th Army. The Soviet player will react quickly, but must first withstand a powerful enemy attack before he can bring powerful reinforcements to bear.<br/><br/>The game scale is two miles per hex. Each turn represents 12 hours. Units vary in size from Companies to Army (headquarters only). Designer Mark Stille performed intensive research during the design. The German OOB is drawn from the actual War Diary of the 4th Panzerarmee and from the incomparable &quot;Stalingrad&quot; by Manfred Kehrig, a detailed German-language book on the subject. The USSR OOB is drawn from a superb 1943 Soviet General Staff study, and the Kehrig work.<br/><br/>Soviet units vary from half-strength Rifle Divisions of 51st Army to the powerful formations of 2nd Guards Army. German units are depicted in a range of unit-sizes. This is a detailed OOB with plenty of counters&mdash;and myriad options&mdash;for both combatants.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    One hex: Two miles per hex<br/>    One Game Turn: 12 hours of real time<br/>    Units are: Companies, Battalions, Kampfgruppes, Regiments, Divisions, and aircraft units representing between 30 and 90 aircraft<br/><br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34 inch color game map<br/>    Two counter sheets (560 full color 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    Campaign Study book with very extensive designer's and historical notes from the designer and a number of other notable contributors<br/>    One 20 page rulebook<br/>    Two Play Aid Cards<br/>    One ten-sided die<br/><br/><br/>",

Featuring all your favorite Marvel Super Heroes (and Villains!), and mixing deckbuilding strategy with just a dash of luck, SHSCG is simple enough for kids to enjoy but offers a depth of play that adults will enjoy as well.<br/><br/>In the &quot;Foundation&quot; base set, fans can pick up intro packs themed around Spider-Man, Iron Man, Wolverine and Hulk. Each includes one super-rare foil card and a collectible coin per intro pack. A two-player intro pack is also available, pitting The Avengers against the X-Men, and features the collectible coin plus two exclusive play mats! Additionally, booster packs consisting of six common cards, three uncommon cards and one rare foil card are available, with one ultra-rare Loot card per box!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game takes place at a playground where the players, while controlling groups of kids try to collect as many &quot;happines​s points&quot; as they can in 9 rounds by building sandcastles or taking nice pictures of the flowers and insects with their mobile phones. But the cat prowling around the ground can spoil their plans. The players have to take into consideration their opponents' moves to compete with them or even to avoid conflicts. They have to accomplish the special missions too, better than their opponents.<br/><br/>In Grund, each player controls a bunch of kids at the playground. At the beginning of each round the cat has to be moved to another tile on the board by randomly drawing a movement card (it will affect the tile where it stays). After that, the players have to move all their kids to an adjacent tile (or even further if consuming energy points), one after another in turn. There are special tiles where only a limited number of kids can stay at the same time.<br/><br/>Once all the kids have been moved, it comes to &quot;conflict&quot; on the tiles with kids belonging to different players to decide who rules the tile. The competing players have to bid energy cards, the one who offers the most will rule the tile (the bidden energy cards have to be exchanged). The winner performs the tile action. The actions can be as follows: get an additional sandcastle part, get a photo of a flower/insect, get an energy card, draw a chance card, call an additional kid onto the ground for 10 energy points, get &quot;happiness points&quot;, etc.<br/><br/>At the end of the ninth round it comes to the evaluation. The players get &quot;happiness points&quot; for their sandcastles, photo collections, energy points and accomplished missions.<br/><br/>Grund is a smart combination of a worker placement and an area influence game where your situation awareness, tactical, strategic and trouble solving skills are challenged.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the all-too-distant future, a bunch of people play a dangerous sport called Fightball, and James Ernest wrote a game about it.<br/><br/>The setting is the streets of the future &mdash; not the real future, but the crazy apocalyptic future we all know and love. In this particular future, gangs of street thugs have (again) become enamored of the world of modern professional sports. Unfortunately, they have no real idea of how these modern sports were played, besides what they can guess from old photographs and what they know about the sports of their day. If all future sports use multiple balls, surely so did the sports of the twentieth century, right? And even if they didn't, they should have.<br/><br/>Thus was born Fightball, a weird version of basketball with at least three balls &mdash; maybe more, we're not sure &mdash; two goals, and extremely violent gameplay. The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.<br/><br/>Basically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a &quot;court&quot; out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the &quot;BUZZ&quot; card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>Fightball was released as three sets of double decks, and any two decks can be played against one another.<br/><br/>",

Each player is given an identity card, with the two remaining identity cards placed in the middle of the table. Each player looks at their role card and then closes their eyes to represent falling asleep at night.  The Moderator calls out the roles in a specific order for them to take their nighttime actions.<br/><br/>Roles:<br/>GJ Hunter - may hunt in the graveyard cards during the night phase.  Even if the Villager team loses, it can still win if the GJ Hunter manages to hunt a werewolf card.<br/><br/>Zombie - During the night phase may take a card from the graveyard to use as its new body to participate in the game.<br/><br/>Hanged Man - Simply wishes to be hanged and doesn't belong to either the Villager or Werewolf team.<br/><br/>Magical Girl - May use magical skills to view other cards (Similar to Sorcerer mechanics)<br/><br/>Vampire - May exchange his card for another card (Similar to Phantom Thief mechanics)<br/><br/>Big Werewolf - With more power can remember the cards in the graveyard that it raided last night.<br/><br/>After all roles have had their action, players open their eyes representing waking up for the daytime phase. Players now discuss who they believe are the werewolves(or if there are any in play) and vote for a player.  Player with the most votes is killed; killing a werewolf causes humans to win, killing a human causes werewolves to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seven Years War is a simulation of the war between Prussia and a Coalition of European states, 1756-1764, published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #163 (Sep 1993). While militarily a stalemate, the war consolidated Prussia's dominance of central Europe until its defeat at Jena and Auerstadt in 1806.<br/><br/>The game is designed for two players or two teams. The Prussian Allied side, opposes the Coalition side. The objective is to gain control of as many central european fortress cities as possible without losing control of your own. The rules consist of a Standard Game that gives a relatively simple but historically valid game, and an Advanced Game providing a more complete historical simulation. Play centers around the operational activity of moving armies, fighting battles and besieging fortresses. However, this operational activity is heavily influenced by, and is intertwined with, the ever changing strategic choices and actions the players take as the game proceeds. This game is falling through the cracks in recent years. There is a reasonably good Cyberboard gamebox but it would be nice if someone would create a Vassal module as well.<br/><br/>Operational aspects include leaders, a variable movement table, discipline classes for units, logistics with supply wagons and foraging, and limited intelligence. Forces are comprised of infantry, cavalry, light troops, pioneers and artillery. Combat is modified by battleplan chits, selected before the die is rolled, that allow a player to emphasize line infantry, or more elite units, or cavalry achieving strength bonuses or die roll modifiers. The combat table produces percentage loss and moral checks for one or both sides. One learns that strength is not always the deciding factor. Leadership, high discipline, moral and making use of unit specialization play a big roll. Fortresses can also be captured by siege combat.<br/><br/>Strategically, the game makes use of random events, diplomacy, (the various European states get pushed in and out of neutrality and switch sides). Winning battles can give a player diplomatic options. As the game proceeds the progress of both sides is recorded on the Balance of Power track which can also modify victory. It is possible for both sides to achieve a victory. The two are then compared to give a final victory. Also, both sides can lose if the Balance of Power track moves too far toward one of the players. Restraint is part of a player's strategic considerations.<br/><br/>The game is complete by magazine game standards. The errata is light. It is not a simple game and it requires players to be willing to roleplay the point of view of the leaders from that period. There is a four turn short scenario covering the first year of the conflict. A full campaign game can last as long as 28 turns if things are drawn out. It is a highly replayable game.<br/><br/>Errata and Q&amp;A for 7YW were published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #s 165, 166, 167, and 169.<br/>Additional counters for 7YW were included in Strategy &amp; Tactics #s 170 and 171. <br/>7YW also received extensive coverage in Moves #79.<br/><br/>",

The winner in this competition will ensure happiness and well-being for their tribe members, and he or she will be praised as the arch leader of all the tribes!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most Happiness Points at the end of the sixth round (season). There are several different ways to score points, but the most important activity in the game is to send your tribe members (called here &quot;tribers&quot;) to various spaces on the main board and take actions corresponding to them.<br/><br/>Uluk mostly makes use of the classic worker placement mechanics. The players send their tribers to spaces on the main board to build monuments and gather raw resources. The resources gathered are stored on each player's tribe board and  may then be processed into food. Feeding your tribers brings you HPs and lets you win the game after the sixth season. A single season is divided into six phases in which the players take their actions in a clockwise order:<br/><br/>Errand phase - place your tribers on the main board<br/>Harvest phase - gather resources from the main board<br/>Processing phase - process raw resources from your tribe board into food<br/>Feeding phase - spend food on feeding your tribers<br/>Ecology phase - adjust the harvest levels (quantity of resources available) on the main board<br/>Clean-up phase - build monuments and prepare for the next season<br/><br/>Developing inventions (in the form of invention cards with different symbols) enhances the effectiveness of your food processing, and collecting sets of different symbols brings extra points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

In the ambitious family game Skogen (&quot;The Forest&quot;), developed over many years by experienced biologist Daniel Thorell, it's your job to fill the forest with life by alternating species and element tiles on the board. The game is an eye opener for the diversity of species and environments that surround us (and we promise: a much more fun than the dusty encyclopedia found in your grandparents attic). Place old trees, meadows and other elements to makes your woods flourish - the player creates the best forest wins. Or to put it in other words, you reap what you sow!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cartagena: Escape Diaries is based on the classic game Cartagena and features multiple ways to play.<br/><br/>In the original game, now dubbed the &quot;First Escape&quot;, each player has a group of six animal pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.<br/><br/>To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols, and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.<br/><br/>When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!<br/><br/>In the &quot;Second Escape&quot;, called &quot;Follow the Captain&quot;, you get to place a captain hat on one of your pirates and use the powers of this leader. In the &quot;Third Escape&quot;, &quot;Risky Rafts&quot;, you can take a chance to escape the fortress more quickly on a leaky raft &mdash; and risk sinking in the attempt. By combining the Second and Third Escapes, you have the &quot;Fourth Escape&quot; &mdash; &quot;All Together Now!&quot;<br/><br/>",

One player will function as Mister X, with the other players being detectives searching for him throughout Switzerland.<br/><br/>The starting station cards are shuffled and everyone draws one to determine where they will start the game. Every move is either by bus, train, or airplane. Mister X moves first and writes his move in his travel log, indicating what method of transportation he used but not where he moved. Then, each detective makes their move, cooperating with the other detectives in an effort to close in on Mister X. Mister X only reveals where he is at certain points in the game, and the chase continues until one of the detectives moves to the place where Mister X is. In this case, the team of detectives has won the game. But, if Mister X makes 24 moves without being caught, he himself wins!<br/><br/>Thanks to some added features and a new map, this localized version modernizes Ravensburger's classic game Scotland Yard and transfers the manhunt from London to Switzerland.<br/>Ski areas and boat routes help Mister X to escape...<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Scotland Yard<br/><br/><br/>",

To win, eliminate your opponents, or have the most shards when Zodraz appears.<br/><br/>Each player is a Citadel (city-state) of Fantos. They must hire mercenaries (called Legacies) using Shards from their Citadel Bank. Once hired, Legacies can be tasked to harvest more shards, go to war with a neighboring Citadel or be nominated as the savior of Fantos for Tribute. Legacy may also play Labor cards from the Citadel's hand using their own shard currency.<br/><br/>Every time a player chooses to harvest shards from the Trove, they must reveal a new card from the Trials Deck. Life on Fantos becomes increasingly difficult as Zodraz unleashes plagues, summons cosmic creatures and forces dissent among the Citadels. Resolve them together, as a planet, or watch as rival Citadels struggle to survive. Plan wisely and make every turn matter because Zodraz is lurking in the Trials deck. When the Cosmic Warden is drawn, judgement is passed (scores are tallied) and the game is over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On November 6th, 1861, rebels in Columbus, Kentucky, celebrated the election of President Jefferson Davis. That same day, General Ulysses S. Grant moved against General Polk on the opposite side of the Mississippi. This was to be Grant's first aggressive action of the war. Grant landed 3,000 men, supported by artillery and cavalry two miles southeast of the Confederate Camp Johnson and the tiny village of Belmont. Correctly identifying the gathering smoke from Grant&rsquo;s little fleet, Polk still vacillated before dispatching General Pillow and four Tennessee Regiments to reinforce General Tappan&rsquo;s Arkansans on the Missouri side of the river. U.S. Commander Walke led his gunboats into a brief artillery battle with the Iron Banks batteries but soon withdrew his battered vessels. By 8;30 a.m. Grant marched on the rebel Camp. By 10:00 am the battle commenced.<br/><br/>Soldiers fought across heavy woods, clear fields and cornfields. Pillow showed poor judgement. In short order his demoralized men retreated north and south of their camp while the Yankees celebrated their victory. Grant briefly lost control. His officers and men ignored him as they looted the abandoned camp. General McClernand even took time to mount a stump and give a political speech. Finally roused to action, Polk ordered his Iron banks batteries to fire on Camp Johnson as General Cheatham and five additional regiments shuttled across the river. Exposed Union companies were decimated by the re-energized confederates. Many Northerners had their retreat cut off. The fight continued all the way back to the ships. Grant found himself the last man aboard.<br/><br/>Belmont&rsquo;s butcher bill left 320 Union dead, 400 wounded &ndash; 100 of whom were captured along with another 100 healthy men. The confederates lost 105 killed, 419 wounded and 117 missing. Despite the casualties the battle was ultimately inconclusive and both sides claimed victory. Grant captured and destroyed an enemy camp but at a horrendous cost. On the other hand, Polk and Pillow showed hesitation and poor judgement something Grant would use against them in later battles. The rebels had forced Grant and his Yankees to quit the field only after he had created a core of skilled veterans displaying the courage and determination eventually to earn him command of all the Union forces.<br/><br/>Belmont is to be a COMPASS, PAPER WARS Magazine game based on John Poniske's Ball's Bluff design &hellip; significantly expanded. This is a two player, hex-based game on the company level. It offers a 22&quot; x 34&quot; Map (Created by Rick Barber), 226 9/16&quot; counters (Featuring the artistry of Bill Morgal, 1 Rulebook and Player Aids. It is a chit-draw system with a unique see-saw Confused Orders mechanic which simulates the confusion of ACW battle. The game employs infantry, artillery, cavalry and gunboat rules. Players involve their troops in three types of battle, Volley Fire, Passing Fire and Melee. To enhance battlefield confusion, advancing into melee may cause loss of control and further advance than a player wishes. Grant's aggressive nature is simulated by a limited number of rerolls within his leadership range.<br/><br/>From Compass Games Website (<a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.compassgames.com/paperwars/issue-87-magazine-game-belmont.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.compassgames.com/paperwars/issue-87-magazine-gam...</a>):<br/><br/>Paper Wars Issue #87 (Fall 2017 issue) (Magazine &amp; Game)<br/><br/>&quot;Belmont &ndash; Grant's [Baptism of Command], November 7, 1861&quot;, by John Poniske<br/><br/>&quot;Ulysses Grant &ndash; who is he? Prior to the battle of Belmont at Belmont on November 7, 1861, this was a valid question. General Grant&rsquo;s Belmont offensive was his first action in the war, providing him and his green mid-western troops much-needed experience. Having overrun a rebel camp, he claimed victory. But later, Confederate general Polk would claim victory for forcing Grant and his troops to quit the battlefield and chasing them aboard their transports.&quot;<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/><br/>Solitaire suitability: High<br/><br/>Map scale: 225 yards/hex<br/><br/>Unit scale: Company<br/><br/>1 Map and 1 Countersheet<br/><br/>",

Each hand has three phases: &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Poker&quot;, and &quot;Michigan Rummy&quot;.  All cards are dealt out, including one extra hand which remains unseen.  Players place chips in the spaces for the special combinations on the playing mat/board, the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the &quot;Kitty&quot;.  The first phase pays off for holding certain cards or combinations (that match the combinations on the playing layout/board).  The second phase is a hand of poker; each player selecting five cards from his hand to play.  A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the &quot;Poker&quot; pot, and the winner wins the &quot;Poker&quot; pot.  In the third phase, players play a slight variation of the game of Michigan (similar to Fan Tan), and the first to go out wins the chips in the &quot;Kitty&quot;.<br/><br/>The book Games We Play pictures a version of Poch published in ~1830 in Nuremberg by Verlag Fr Scharrer.  From this illustration we can see the evolution of Pope Joan to Poch, which was further refined into the Tripoley we see today.<br/><br/>This game is a Public Domain game known as Michigan Rummy.  This name comes from the third phase where the standard deck playing card game of Michigan (&quot;Stops Family&quot;) is played.

Upon arriving at the Imperial compound, however, the servants are chagrined to discover Raiders from the North climbing the walls, hastening to harvest the fabled fruit for themselves.<br/><br/>In Imperial Harvest, players build a modular board replete with moats and hedges then take turns drafting a unique trio of fantastic champions who will either raid or protect the imperial strawberry patch. To be successful, each player must master the powers of their respective characters, navigate the Imperial Gardens, evade enemy attacks, and collect the majority of the realm&rsquo;s mysterious, magical fruit.<br/><br/>Imperial Harvest takes place over 7 rounds (less, if all strawberries are plucked before game-end) and takes roughly 20 minutes to play. A cloth play mat is included in the game box for players that prefer not to create their own modular board or who prefer a quicker game setup. Each character in Imperial Harvest features a basic side (for novice/casual players) and an advanced side (for experienced/competitive players). Additionally, all components (garden tiles, character cards, etc.) are 100% compatible with Royal Strawberries (both games are stand-alone but also expand each other).<br/><br/>IMPERIAL HARVEST: TAG TEAM (allows 2 additional players per additional copy of Imperial Harvest):<br/>Grab another copy of Imperial Harvest, expand your board, and bring a new group of players to the table!

As always, only the craftiest team will win &mdash; and watch out for those hydras!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the MicroDesign Group Website.<br/><br/>THE GREAT IDEA<br/><br/>World War I (1914-1918) left both Greece and T&uuml;rkey near ruin. By 1920, Greece was emerging from what amounted to a civil war between supporters and opponents of the visionary but reckless prime minister, Elefth&eacute;rios Veniz&eacute;los. T&uuml;rkey's civil war was still in progress, fought between the last, heartbroken Ottoman Sultan and the dynamic new insurgent, Mustapha Kemal (later called Atat&uuml;rk).<br/><br/>Each side in the wider struggle pursued its own vision of national rebirth. For Veniz&eacute;los and Greece the dream was called &quot;The Great Idea&quot; and promised the renaissance of Greece as a great power through a restoration of the Byzantine Empire, the reconquest of Constantinople (lost to the T&uuml;rks in 1453) and the reunion of all ethnic Greeks under the rule of Athens. For Kemal's T&uuml;rks, their own &quot;great idea&quot; was the forging of a new, compact T&uuml;rkish Republic united not by the outdated creed of Islam but by a new T&uuml;rkish nationalism, modernized and empowered by Western culture and commerce.<br/><br/>These two visions of national rebirth fought bitterly over the plains, deserts, and mountains of Anatolia for three long years. Western Anatolia was ethnically mixed, and neither side had an exclusive claim. The great prize was Smyrna, taken by Greece in 1919: a city which was home to more Greeks than Athens itself. The war had profound implications for the entire region. Greek victory would cement Greece as a regional power, and act as a beacon of hope to Orthodox Russians seeking to topple Lenin's Communists in the ongoing Russian Civil War. T&uuml;rkish defeat would mean the collapse of Kemal's vision of a secular, democratic T&uuml;rkey and would block the spread of Western values in the Near East, leaving T&uuml;rkey battered and backward, and the rest of the Moslem world feeling victimized and enraged.<br/><br/>As it happened, T&uuml;rkey won and Greece lost. Kemal's vision prevailed; T&uuml;rkey emerged victorious, united and profoundly westernized. Women gave up the veil and went to school. The Roman alphabet replaced the Arabic, and Islam was evicted from politics. For the Greeks, the end came in September of 1922 when the T&uuml;rks captured Smyrna and burned the city to the ground. A million and a half Greeks fled or were expelled, and nearly 2,900 years of Hellenic civilization in Asia came to an abrupt and humiliating end. Greece, overwhelmed by refugees, collapsed into a series of coups and revolutions punctuated by all sorts of autocracy and spectacular misrule, from which, arguably, it has only recently recovered.<br/><br/>Whose &quot;great idea&quot; will shape the modern Near East? Now you can make the decision by playing Byzantium Reborn!<br/><br/>Byzantium Reborn is a simulation game on the Greek-T&uuml;rkish War of 1920-22. The game is for two players, one representing the Kingdom of Greece and its allies (the Greek player), and the other the insurgent nationalist forces of Mustapha Kemal who opposed the Greek invasion (the T&uuml;rkish player). The 11 x 17&quot; map of Anatolia (Asia Minor) depicts the areas where the war took place. The scale is about 40 miles to the inch. The 280 counters represent the military formations including Turks, Greeks, French, Italians and many others.<br/><br/>",

Hidden perils confront the Imperial player, who will face traps and ambushes, as they search for the Warmaster.  As the game progresses, the Emperor's dwindling forces will face greater numbers of Traitors as they, the traitors, receive reinforcements.  The Emperor is in a race against time to defeat Horus or die trying.<br/><br/>The Traitor player wins by killing the Emperor and the Imperial player wins by killing Horus, if both are killed at the same time, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All Things Zombie: Final Fade Out is a miniature skirmish game set in a post-apocalyptic future where the world is filled with hordes of Zombies, leaving humans to fight for survival each day. The rulesystem is designed for 28mm miniatures but can also be used with 15mm models. Two Hour Wargames's popular Reaction System allows for cross-game compatibility and recreates a sense of chaos and uncertainty in the bleak future; player will never know how each encounter will end as characters act like real humans would in a tense situation, as opposed to how you would like them to act! Each model has only a few stats to keep track of. A typical scenario might see a small band of Stars (the player's models) and Grunts (their fellow survivors) search a town for supplies like food, gas, or ammunition; What they encounter on the streets and in each building is determined randomly and ranges from friendly survivors willling to trade or join the team to hostile Gangers or a horde of hungry Zombies. Where ATZ:FFO really shines though, is the comprehensive campaign system, allowing for character development similar to a role-playing game. The game can be played solo, cooperatively, or against each other.<br/><br/>From the publisher's product page:<br/><br/>&ldquo;BETTER TO BURN OUT THAN TO FADE AWAY.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Mankind has had a good run. Mankind has burned brightly over the centuries meeting every challenge head on and conquering each one. Even the self-inflicted challenges, conquered them all&hellip;until now.<br/><br/>ZOMBIES. YOU KNOW WHAT WE&rsquo;RE TALKING ABOUT.<br/><br/>Everyone knew about Zombies. The fun new boogie man you couldn&rsquo;t get away from. They were everywhere. On the Web, on your television screen, everywhere you looked. Yep, nothing but fun and brains for all! Right up until they became real.<br/><br/>HOW&rsquo;D IT HAPPEN? WHAT STARTED THE OUTBREAK?<br/><br/>Who knows and who cares? When you meet your first Zombie or see your first Zombie Feast all those questions disappear. All you care about is staying alive. And that&rsquo;s what All Things Zombie &ndash; Final Fade Out is all about, staying alive. All Things Zombie - Final Fade Out picks you up and sticks you right in the middle of a catastrophic zombie outbreak. Where you are, is just as important as who you are, when the outbreak occurs. Because unlike other zombie games, where the zombies have been around for a while, you won&rsquo;t be able to tell the survivors from the zombies until maybe it&rsquo;s too late. Hell, they could even be a relative! Because it&rsquo;s all happening to you just like it would on Z Day - 1. Confusion, chaos, and lack of information are just some of the challenges you&rsquo;ll face when the world starts to crumble. Will you have what it takes to survive the first 30 days? After that it&rsquo;s all up to you. Maybe you want to rebuild the world, as you knew it; except maybe this time with you in charge.<br/><br/>All Things Zombie - Final Fade Out!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Blenheim 1704 AD&quot; is a tactical wargame from &quot;Turning Point Simulations&quot; which focuses on the battlefield area itself, with each side having two distinct commands and forces. Players will command the varied forces of each side, with British, Dutch, Austrians, Prussians, Danes, and various German allies on one side and French, Bavarians, and even Irish fighting for Louis. Each unit in the game represents one brigade with each combat strength point around 400 men or 200 horses. One hex on the map equals 400 meters. A turn represents around one hour of action and the game can last up to 7 turns.<br/><br/>&ldquo;But &lsquo;twas a famous victory!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Many wars have been fought to tip or maintain that illusive &ldquo;balance of power&rdquo; between nations, while including other objectives. The War of Spanish Succession might be the poster child for &ldquo;balance&rdquo; efforts, as demonstrated by the British&hellip; who allied with the Hapsburgs to stop a union between France and Spain&hellip;then left the war when it looked like the Hapsburgs could win (since Britain also feared a union of Spain and Austria!). Over the course of a 12-year war, there was much coming and going (along with secret negotiations and betrayals). The war included battlefields as far apart as Quebec and the Papal States, from the Netherlands to Hungary, and to various spots all over the German states. Including a small village on the Danube named Blindheim&hellip; which the British would garble as &ldquo;Blenheim.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Up to that point, things had been going well for the French and their armies looked to capture Vienna and take the Habsburgs out of the equation. Marlborough changed all that, but only after lying to his Dutch allies and virtually &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; the army he marched 250 miles away from the Low Countries he was expected to protect. After days of marching, countermarching, probes and parrying, the Allies attacked a foe of slightly larger size and in good positions, while the French were expecting them to retreat.  Their cavalry was somewhat dispersed and too much of their infantry was in the towns of the area.  And, up to that point, the French Army was considered &ldquo;unbeatable.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The battle went back and forth, with each side having opportunities for success but seeing confusion and heavy losses confound good plans.  Certainly Marlborough and Eugene worked together marvelously well, especially for allies, which may have been the key difference. Tallard and Marsin and the Bavarians had their chances but missed them, needing infantry where they had cavalry and cavalry where they had infantry. When the British attacked the &ldquo;seam&rdquo; between the two forces, Marsin&rsquo;s regiments fell back and Tallard&rsquo;s collapsed.  French losses were heavy, and their army&rsquo;s aura of invincibility was gone forever.<br/><br/>Though the war would continue for over 10 more years, Blenheim rates as &ldquo;decisive&rdquo; because this cost Louis the chance to knock the Habsburgs out of the war early. Instead, it would be his Bavarian allies who would lose out and become vassals to Vienna. In the end, the war would end as countries spun into exhaustion and a number of rulers died from age or sickness, making separate treaties that were finally consolidated under the Treat of Utrecht. France would not dominate the continent and, the most visible effect to us today, Britain still possesses Gibraltar.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Encounter cards take effect immediately, but the effect on Location cards only takes place if there's a location with the same name in the discard pile. Each location is worth a number of Exploration Points, and the goal of the game is to make it out of the manor with the maximum number of Exploration points. But be careful!

One plays black, the other white.<br/>The Bits:<br/><br/>     16 pawns, 8 black and 8 white.<br/>     32 &quot;Othello&quot; disks, i.e. black one side and white on the other.<br/>     A board made up of a 6&times;6 square grid of octagons. <br/><br/><br/>The game: Although the spaces on the board are octagonal, the main playing pieces ( the pawns ) are placed and played in the squares that are formed where the corners of the octagons meet.<br/>On his/her turn, the player may move one of their 8 pawns.<br/>A move may consist of leaping diagonally over an octagon, or a simple move between one octagon and the next in a straight line, or finally a pawn may capture an opponents` pawn by jumping over it a la checkers/draughts.<br/><br/>In the first case, if a pawn makes the diagonal jump one of two actions may take place: if the octagon is empty, one of the disks is played inside it, with the players` colour uppermost. Alternatively, if the octagon is occupied by an opponents` disk, this disk is flipped over to show the opposite side (and therefore colour). <br/>The winner is the first player to link two specific diagonally opposed corners ( black must link top left to bottom right and white top right to bottom left), with a continuous chain of their colour disks. Only orthogonal links count, not diagonal.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Knitting - The Card Game is oozing with fun knitting terminology, beautiful photos from fiber artists and game mechanics that mirror knit life.<br/><br/>Players start the game with pattern cards and yarn cards. Turn order consists of 1. Knitting (advancing time card) 2. Drawing Yarn Cards from the Yarn Store or Choosing additional Pattern Cards 3. Casting-On (only one pattern per turn) 4. Restock the Yarn Store. *Community Cards cost 5 Yarn Cards and can be bought or spent at any time during a players turn. The Community deck is filled with action cards and secret points.<br/><br/>Pattern cards have both yarn and time requirements. Collect Yarn Cards from the Yarn Store and when you have the right yarn for a pattern, 'Cast-On' by placing the Pattern Card and required Yarn Card(s) on the table along with the Cast-On (time) Card. Each round thereafter advances your project by one week. When the time requirement is met, discard the yarn cards and move the pattern card to the 'Blocking Mat' as a way to keep track of your FO (finished object) points. Each player starts with 4 Cast-On cards and can have up to 4 active projects in-progress at any given time.<br/><br/>No previous knitting knowledge required to play. But if you are a knitter you can play this with your non-knitter friends and family to give them a peek into your fiber-y world or play with other knitters and meta game while knitting on matching patterns irl to earn extra points.<br/><br/>",

After all, each player receives a secret valuation card, ranging from +30 to -30, and the gemstones matching the color of his screen will have this value at the end of the game. (Gold nuggets are always +10 points.) Do you need to sell or buy your initial holdings? And how do you find out the value of everything else?!<br/><br/>Each player also starts the game with three transaction cards. Each transaction lists a minimum offer that a seller must make on his turn, e.g., at least two gems of his own color or one gem of his color and two gems of a neighbor's color.<br/><br/>The game lasts three rounds, labeled morning, midday and night. In each round, each player will be the seller once. The player chooses one of his transaction cards, then places an offer onto the table that at least matches the minimum offer required. If the transaction is labeled &quot;simultaneous&quot;, each other player must simultaneously reveal an offer of his own, which must include at least one stone/nugget and must not match the seller's offer; if the transaction is &quot;successively&quot;, each opponent reveals his offer in clockwise order. After seeing all of the offers, the seller either trades goods with an opponent or pays 2-4 nuggets to the bank in order to drop his offer into the bank bag (along with his nuggets), then draw that many items from the bag. (The bank bag starts with the same items as each player.)<br/><br/>In games with at least four players, the seller can pay 2-4 gold nuggets to the bank in order to look at the secret valuation card held by any opponent.<br/><br/>Once each player has been seller three times, the game ends and everyone reveals their valuation cards. Players then tally their scores, and the player with the highest total wins, with gold nuggets in hand breaking ties.<br/><br/>",

The better you roll, the more difficult it is to collect more coins. Successful rolls are rewarded with gold, but unsuccessful rolls will earn you a skull token.<br/><br/>Each turn the player rolls 5 dice and tries to match a certain set of symbols on the game boards. He can reroll any number of dice twice. Depending on the final result, he can pick up 1 coin in a row that matches a set of symbols on his dice. When picking up a coin, a new symbol becomes visible, making the current row harder, but also more rewarding as the value of the coins increase.<br/><br/>If the player fails to roll any set of symbols, he has to pick up a skull coin, which gives him -1 points for each coin at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when all gold coins are picked up or when a player takes the last skull coin. Count the value of all your gold coins and substract any skull coins. The player who has the most points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Only a tenacious German defense-in-depth and an equally devastating counterattack employing the new, then-secret infiltration tactics, prevented the British from making a decisive breakthrough.  Despite this setback, Cambrai was the forerunner of the mobile warfare of the Second World War.<br/><br/>Now, THE FIRST BLITZKRIEG: CAMBRAI, 1917 allows you to recreate this battle, one of the most significant in military history.  Two players, each taking on the role of one of the historical commanders, use the Mapboard, 72 unit counters, and complete rules of play, to either change or recreate the historical results.&quot;<br/><br/>Description of Game Components:<br/><br/>Game Consist of a two color map, 72 (3/4&quot;) counters and rules of play.  No indication of scale is given in the rules.  Map is 17 hexes from West to East and 16 hexes from North to South.  Cambrai is located in north-east (upper right) corner of map  and the town of Sorel-Le-Grand is located in the south-west (lower left) corner of map.  Game is 17 turns in length.<br/><br/>Rules are printed on both sides of single 18&quot; x 16&quot; sheet of paper.  Rules include 13 &quot;Variable Historical Options&quot; that can be used singly or in combination to offer a &quot;virtually limitless amount of scenarios.&quot;  Each option changes a historical factor in the game and include: &quot;British Develop Infiltration Tactics&quot;, &quot;General Harper Fragged&quot;, &quot;Improved Tanks&quot;, &quot;Germans Forewarned&quot;, &quot;French Participation&quot;, &quot;Cavalryman's Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Free Setup.&quot;<br/><br/>Hex Movement system, IGO-UGO sequence of play (with addition of tank attrition phase for British player.<br/><br/>Combat Results Table is Odds Based and consists of a separate table for each type of attack (Standard, Mobile, Probing or Surprise).  A 3-1 attack on the &quot;Standard Attack&quot; table results in a 33% (1,2) chance of a Defender Eliminated result, a 33% (3,4) chance of a &quot;counterattack&quot; result in which the defender has the chose of retreating 1 hex or counterattacking one of the hexes the attack was launched from, and a 33% (5,6) chance of a an Exchange result.<br/><br/>From the Game Notes:<br/><br/>&quot;CAMBRAI, 1917 is a see-saw battle.  The British have the advantage for the first three turns, but then it begins to slip away.  The German commander than has the opportunity to stabilize the situation and seize the initiative with his counterattack.  Therefore, the German should not give up if things look bad after the first few turns.  The situation can change drastically every turn until the end of the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a parallel universe, a cryptic world called &ldquo;Maatatahay&rdquo; contains mysterious crystals that provide powerful energy for the living creatures there. However, after experiencing the beauty of the crystal power, the creatures also became fierce and warlike. To continue mining and using this mysterious force, different species formed tribes, divided, and occupied the land. Among dozens of tribes, the two most representative but also most incompatible ones - Wazu and Balan - once again triggered a war for a newly discovered land.<br/><br/>Now, lead your tribe, arrange and assign warriors to fight, and win this war!<br/><br/>&larr; Overview &rarr;<br/>Maatatahay is a two-player-only strategy game, playing up to 12 rounds on a 5x5 suedette&nbsp;game map. You and your opponent play as the leaders of Balan and Wazu, sending your fearless warriors to the field to fight for the glory. Surrounding your opponent's warriors to defeat them while allocating your valuable unit in a safe spot is the key to victory. You can also collect crystal powers to enhance your warrior's strength or visit the Shrines to seize more strategy opportunities. When the endgame condition is met, the player with the most victory points from their surviving warriors, Spirit Crystals, and relics bonus wins!<br/><br/>&larr;What's special&rarr;<br/><br/>        Pick one from three + the weak one&rsquo;s choice: Every turn, the active player chooses a pair of warriors from the tile stream. However, the player with lower strength(fangs around the neck) in that pair decides whether to join the battlefield first or later.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>        Arrow support + the sequence: Place your warriors in formation, and gain energy from the environment or your allies with a corresponding arrow to increase their survivability. But remember, only the warrior who enters the battlefield earlier can grant energy to the latter one, for they&rsquo;ve immersed in the land and let the power of crystal go through their body.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>        Get &ldquo;Surrounded&rdquo; + collective attack, sole defense: A warrior is &ldquo;surrounded&rdquo; when there are no vacancies around orthogonally. In this situation, the surrounded warrior has to face the collective strength of the opponents on its own.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>And more(various shrine setup and scoring, randomness from the deck, Hot stamping + Suedette game map, &hellip;etc.)<br/>In sum, this is a highly strategic and in-depth thoughts game. Enjoy it!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The only safe house you could find was a storage facility for some of the worlds worst diseases. During the explosion all containment vials were broken, and it is only a matter of time before the diseases set in. Help is on the way, but they have to wait for the radiation levels to drop. Due to the level of risk, the rescue team is unable to release any diseases from the safe house, so all diseases have to be cured in order to attempt the rescue.<br/><br/>Use elements and bonds to create compounds to cure all of the diseases that your team is infected with.<br/><br/>Win the game by completing all of the diseases that are in play. If you can't solve them before the resources run out, then you lose the game and everyone dies a slow and painful death, locked in the shelter.<br/><br/>Each turn every player will have the chance to complete three actions: Place an element, play a bond card (to bond elements), give a card to another player's hand, or discard/skip. Make sure to bond, or get your team to bond, your elements before the start of your next turn, or you will loose your elements to the discard pile! Make sure you don't hold too many cards, because at the end of your turn you will have to discard down to your card limit! Every resource is vital!<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of Rome's richest families, seeking to gain the Emperor's favor by creating a network of roads linking the Eternal City to the rest of the world!<br/><br/>Each turn, players place road sections onto the map, starting from Rome and moving from city to city. Players gain points each time a new road is built based on how many steps away from Rome they are &mdash; the longer the section of road, the more points they score! If the road back to Rome contains a section placed by another player, that player also scores points. Forcing other players to use your roads is one of the most direct ways to win the game, but not the only one.<br/><br/>The cities themselves also have a value, which will score players points at the end of the game. Players compete to secure the trade routes to the richest, most crucial settlements and metropolises in each region, sorting them by color and value.<br/><br/>These cities offer up precious resources to Rome's industrious families! Collecting valuable trade goods like wine, oil, gems, and gold, players score points at the end of the game depending on the variety of different treasures they bring back to Rome.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of the cities on the map have been claimed, and the player with the most points after final scoring wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By the winter of 1942, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants had contained the German attacks of the previous summer and fall. Now came the time for a whole series of counter-offensive of its own, designed to cut off and destroy the weakened Nazi armies.<br/><br/>The northernmost of these would be Operation &quot;Mars&quot;, aimed at the German Ninth Army around the city of Rzhev, west of Moscow in the winter of 1942. The Soviet plan, the work of the brilliant Marshal Georgi Zhukov, called for smashing the already-weakened Germans with a heavy commitment of tanks and fresh troops. When this first objective had been reached, a second operation, code-named Jupiter, would encircle and destroy the German 3rd Panzer Army to the south.<br/><br/>Despite horrible weather and very rough forested terrain, the initial Soviet attacks went very well. But German resistance stiffened, and as the Red Army failed to make further progress Zhukov reacted by committing more and more men and tanks. Suicidal courage only added to the Soviet casualty lists, and by the time the offensive sputtered to a halt Soviet losses topped 335,000 men and 1,600 tanks.<br/>Little known thanks to Soviet government silence for 50 years, the offensive was designed as a companion to the &quot;Saturn&quot; offensive around Stalingrad. The fact that the offensive was repulsed with heavy losses meant it was not discussed in Soviet accounts of the Great Patriotic War. While the offensive failed to accomplish what the Soviet High Command and General Georgi Zhukov wished, it did provide what the Soviets needed most, a means of keeping German forces of Army Group Center in place while the Saturn offensive in the south ran its course.<br/><br/>Red God of War covers Operation Mars using the same game system as Alsace 1945 and America Triumphant. Game pieces represent regiments, brigades and divisions. Headquarters are vital to activate units and send them into action; supply is also important to keeping your units at full efficiency and players must choose how to allocate their resources. There will never be enough of them to accomplish everything at once.<br/><br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 5 miles (8 kilometers) <br/>Units: Battalion to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>    One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 16-page Red God of War rulebook<br/>    One 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Good<br/>Complexity Level: 1,5 out of 5<br/>Players: 2<br/>Playing Time: 60 to 120 minutes<br/><br/>(Source: Avalanche Press website and game rulebook)<br/><br/>",

Oh, and they'll need to search quickly, too, or else the giants will wake from the sleeping spell cast on them and run the searchers out of the forest. Who can combine speed, control and a good memory to find the imps where they hide?<br/><br/>To set up, players place the 16 imp tokens in the holes on the game board, cover these imps with the 85 cardboard leaves included in the game, then place one large wooden giant on each corner of the board. On a turn, the active player reveals a search card showing one of the imps. An opponent flips the sand timer, then the player uses her magic wand to push the leaves aside and (fingers crossed!) find the imp on the search card. She can use her wand to move the giants as well, but if they fall off the game board &ndash; or even so much as a single leaf falls &ndash; the giants awaken and chase the player away empty-handed. If the player reveals the target imp, though, she keeps the search card to record her find. After each search, players cover the board again and return the giants to their places. In the end, whoever has collected the most search cards wins!<br/><br/>Die verzauberten Rumpelriesen includes rules for cooperative play, with the players using their wands together to search for the imps one by one as they're revealed by the search cards. If the players find more than eight imps without the giants awakening, they win.<br/><br/>",

Each card has a single digit (0-9) on it, and the starting player has three cards in hand. After looking at those cards, she presents a three-digit number to the other players; all the digits in this number must go from high to low, so 873 is okay but 783 is not. She then passes those cards to the next player, who can discard any number of cards from his hand, replace those cards with new ones from the deck, then present players with a larger three-digit number &ndash; a number that matches the cards he has in hand, of course. This continues until someone refuses to accept the cards being passed and calls out the previous player as a liar. Reveal the cards, and see who is correct. Whoever is wrong loses points equal to the number of symbols on the cards that were passed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sheep in Disguise is a vibrant and strategic card game about protecting adorably-helpless Sheep from being devoured by the many outrageous and dangerous predators of the world. Collect Flocks of Sheep, keep them safe from Attacks, and use Action cards to destroy anyone that gets in your way!<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards to collect matching sets of disguised Sheep and a variety of powerful Action cards. When a player has collected 3 Sheep of a kind, they must be placed face up on the table immediately. This set of 3 Sheep is called a Flock. In a 4 player game, the first person to collect 4 unique Flocks is the winner.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player may use as many Action cards as they like by playing them to the Discard. They may also make one trade with the Field per turn. The Field is a constantly changing group of cards in the middle of the table that players can exchange cards with to help them build a strong hand. The Field guarantees that the game isn&rsquo;t completely luck of the draw and allows the player to strategize and build combo moves in order to progress their game.<br/><br/>Players can also target an opponent's Flock by placing an Expose card on top of it. This Action exposes the Flock's disguise, leaving them vulnerable to an Attack! Players must choose to take the risk of leaving their Flock exposed or pay to remove the Expose card, ensuring the Flock's identity remains a secret. When an Attack card is drawn, all Exposed Flocks are destroyed!<br/><br/>Be strategic and be devious. If you play your cards right, you can turn the Attack card into an extremely powerful tool to help you get ahead... otherwise, you may end up as the victim.<br/><br/>If you find yourself falling behind, don't worry! All players are in it until the very end and one big move is all it takes to flip the whole game on its head!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ENG<br/><br/>From one of the most hidden laboratories in the Atomic Biochemistry Brave Academy (ABBA), a shout rises to the skies: &ldquo;&iexcl;Eureka!&rdquo;.  After years of research, Professor R&ouml;ntgen has invented a new thingamajig that apparently is capable of modifying the atomic composition of objects, to the point it can make them shrink and grow at will.  But the underworld of science is horrifying and his &ldquo;colleague&rdquo;, archrival and former student, Professor Stern, wants to steal his idea.  In the next few days, the Academy is going to decide which department will get funds to continue their research, so lab safety has become a secondary concern.  Both professors must use their scientists and students wisely, to get the most astonishing test results, while discretely trying to sabotage your rival.<br/><br/>To get the best experimental samples, you must use the ray to manipulate the value and size of your dice, while you sabotage your opponent, by modifying his.  The higher the visible value on the die, and the smaller the die is, the more points you will get.   To win the game (and get the funds!), you will have to get the most points with this method.<br/><br/>During your turn, you can perform one or more actions (without repeating any).  The available actions are represented on the control panel board, and you will use scientists and students to trigger them.  Each turn is played in three consecutive steps.  Once you're finished, it&rsquo;s your opponent's turn, and so on until the end of the game.  These are the three steps:<br/><br/>Action Selection: Choose the actions you want to perform this turn.  First, pick a student from your hand and place in in the control panel, covering the action it&rsquo;s going to perform. Then, use your available scientists to select one or more actions, as explained below.  Note:  you can&rsquo;t repeat the action on a student card.<br/>Action resolution: In whatever order you choose, perform your selected actions, taking back the corresponding scientists and students as you do. Student cards go straight to the discard pile, but you get your scientist team back for next turn.  If you haven&rsquo;t shot the ray this turn, take the extra scientist, aside from your two regular ones.  This additional scientist will help you during your next turn.  If it is already in your possession, and you have shot the ray this turn, put it back, next to the testing room board.<br/>Hiring a new student: Once you have solved all the actions, draw a new student card from the deck.  You will continue drawing cards every turn until the deck is over.  Once the deck is depleted, keep playing your cards from your hand normally.  Once all students have been used (players don&rsquo;t have available student cards in their hands), shuffle the student cards deck to form a new face down pile on the table.  Both players draw two new student cards and continue playing normally.<br/><br/>SPA<br/><br/>De uno de los laboratorios m&aacute;s perdidos de la Atomic Biochemistry Brave Academy (ABBA), surge un grito que clama al cielo: &ldquo;&iexcl;Eureka!&rdquo;.  Tras a&ntilde;os de investigaci&oacute;n, el profesor R&ouml;ntgen ha inventado un nuevo cachivache que parece ser capaz de modificar la composici&oacute;n at&oacute;mica de los objetos, hasta el punto de poder reducirlos y aumentarlos a su antojo.  Pero los bajos fondos del mundo cient&iacute;fico son repugnantes y su &quot;colega&quot;, archienemigo y antiguo alumno suyo, el profesor Stern, est&aacute; decidido a robarle la idea. Y es que en los pr&oacute;ximos d&iacute;as se determina qu&eacute; departamento obtiene la subvenci&oacute;n de la academia para continuar con su trabajo, as&iacute; que la seguridad de los experimentos se ha convertido en algo secundario.  Ambos profesores deben emplear a sus estudiantes eficientemente para tratar de obtener los resultados m&aacute;s espectaculares posibles, mientras tratan de sabotear discretamente a su rival.<br/><br/>Para conseguir las mejores muestras experimentales, debes utilizar el rayo para manipular el valor y el tama&ntilde;o de los dados de tu color, a la vez que saboteas a tu oponente modificando los suyos.  Contra mayor sea el valor de un dado y menor sea su tama&ntilde;o, m&aacute;s puntos otorga al jugador de ese color. Para ganar la partida (&iexcl;y hacerte con la subvenci&oacute;n!), tendr&aacute;s que ser t&uacute; el que consiga m&aacute;s puntos de este modo.<br/><br/>Durante tu turno puedes realizar una o m&aacute;s acciones (sin repetir ninguna). Las acciones disponibles est&aacute;n representadas en el tablero a modo de cuadro de mandos, y para realizarlas necesitas emplear cient&iacute;ficos y estudiantes.  Los turnos se juegan en tres pasos consecutivos. Cuando los termines, le toca jugar a tu oponente y os ir&eacute;is turnando as&iacute; hasta que acabe la partida. Los pasos son los siguientes:<br/><br/>1.       Selecci&oacute;n de acciones: Selecciona las acciones a realizar. Elige un estudiante de tu mano y ponlo en el cuadro de mandos, de forma que tape la acci&oacute;n correspondiente. A continuaci&oacute;n, emplea a tus cient&iacute;ficos para seleccionar una o m&aacute;s acciones, seg&uacute;n el caso, como se explica m&aacute;s abajo. Nota:  no puedes repetir la acci&oacute;n de la carta de estudiante.<br/>2.       Resoluci&oacute;n de acciones: En el orden que desees, resuelve cada una de las acciones seleccionadas, retirando al hacerlo al estudiante o cient&iacute;ficos correspondientes. Las cartas de estudiante retiradas van a al mazo de descarte, pero los cient&iacute;ficos los recuperas para tu siguiente turno. Si no has disparado en este turno, adem&aacute;s de tus 2 cient&iacute;ficos, coge tambi&eacute;n al cient&iacute;fico extra, que te ayudar&aacute; durante el turno siguiente. Si ya lo ten&iacute;as y en este turno has disparado, devu&eacute;lvelo.<br/>3.       Reclutar un nuevo estudiante: Una vez resueltas las acciones, roba una nueva carta. Deber&aacute;s seguir robando al final de cada turno hasta que se acabe el mazo de robo.  Una vez se acabe el mazo de robo, seguir&aacute;s jugando con las cartas que te queden en la mano. Cuando se haya empleado a todos los estudiantes (no tengas cartas en la mano), vuelve a barajar los estudiantes para formar un nuevo mazo de robo y robad dos cartas cada uno, para continuar normalmente.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Game of Politics about the Game of Politics.<br/><br/>You control one of the aspiring leaders of Humerica and gradually assemble a powerful coalition of factions to help you gain votes, wealth, and power. Each faction gives you a unique exploit that helps you or harms your opponents. Survive unexpected events, strive to win elections, fundraise from your wealthiest factions and, if you like, abscond with the money and purchase investments. The player with the most power wins!<br/><br/>The game features satirical artwork that satirizes American interest groups, voting blocks, and political candidates.<br/><br/>Each player receives a leader card at the start of the game and 5 faction cards. Each turn, a player can <br/>1. campaign (varies with leader, but usually is draw 1 card) or embezzle (get $2)<br/>2. sneak (play 2 cards face down), exploit (play 1 faction card and use the ability listed on the card), or fundraise (get money equal to your total wealth.)<br/>3. use their leader superpower (this costs money, and some superpowers can be used even when it is not your turn.)<br/><br/>There are 10 rounds. At the end of each round there is an event. Events can have positive or negative effects on players, usually negative. 3 of those events are elections, with the very last event being a presidential election.<br/><br/>Faction cards have three stats: votes, wealth, and power. They also have either an exploit ability (used when &quot;exploiting&quot;) or a surprise ability (an effect you get if you discard the card, usually in response to another player doing something).<br/><br/>Money (called MegaBucks) can also be used to purchase investments (there are 4 face up at any time) that vary in how many influence points they give you at the end of the game. Some also let you draw cards immediately or affect vote totals.<br/><br/>Each player develops their board over the ten rounds, adding factions to their coalition of supporters, purchasing investments, trying to win elections, and using the exploit and surprise abilities listed on their faction cards, as well as the superpower listed on their leader, to interfere with opponents or improve their own position.<br/><br/>Designed by Brandon Patton and Andre Pereira.

In this game you need to hide your rabbit cards into the farmyard and find out other players' rabbits. However, every turn you need to place a card to the farmyard. Then you can execute two actions. If you use too much actions to trace rabbits, your hand will reduce quickly, but catch others' rabbits is the only way to win.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://embedded.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~mellow/rabbithunt/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://embedded.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~mellow/rabbithunt/</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>Captain Dice (キャプテンダイス) is a dice and action card game, combining speed and cunning. Swiftly place dice to secure treasure cards. Then replace your dice with action cards to attack the other players. Then collect treasure if your cards survive the attacks.<br/><br/>The playing area is a grid of treasure cards and a bell in the centre. The bell is rung, and each player rolls and rerolls their own six dice entirely at will, trying to make combos to place on treasure cards. As soon as there are any three pairs in any line, any player may ring the bell to force a stop (and becomes the start player). It helps to secure treasure cards in sections; if you succeed, you collect all treasures you have linked up.<br/><br/>Each player has nine cards, numbered 0 to 5 (four 5 cards each). Each card attacks neighbouring locations in different directions, except the 0 card which is a shield, and the 5 cards on which you are becalmed. Depending on which locations you grabbed, you take turns placing cards face down, taking back your dice. The actions are revealed and resolved, going from 0 to 5 (tied numbers are won closest to the start player).<br/><br/>Here the tactical element appears. The cards 1 to 4 attack each other in set patterns, and in rank order from low to high. Since you cannot pick up cards spent in previous rounds until you clear your hand, you must choose carefully which cards you place where. If you think a spot is safe from any attack, you can safely spend a 5 card and help clear your hand.<br/><br/>If you think a spot is certain to be attacked, place your 0 and it survives. If you have claimed places on straight lines, you'll collect all the empty treasure cards lying between them, so often you want to be secure. If you know what cards the others have spent, you might get your attack in first with a low numbered attack.<br/><br/>After a couple of rounds, the tactical choices become very clear and frustrating. Using the wrong action cards is a costly waste. Failing to get dice down means you get fewer chances to collect treasure and it takes longer to clear your hand and pick up your discard.<br/><br/>Once the action cards have been resolved, any left standing take the treasure cards below them or linked in straight lines, and the action cards go to a personal discard face-down. Empty treasure spots are refilled, and the bell is rung! The game ends when there is not enough treasure on the table. At the finish, most treasure cards wins.<br/><br/>The game is fast and the theme fits the game play. The game is language free. The second edition simply revised the artwork on the box and cards to a more cartoon/manga style and added a strategic variant. Otherwise, components and gameplay are identical between the first and second editions.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>Roll the dice to your heart&rsquo;s content! Ring up a storm with the bells! Speed and strategies are both important for this analog game, which offers real-time domination + mind games, appealing to all 5 senses.<br/><br/>Secure territories pre-emptively by placing a pair of dice on the treasure cards as fast as possible, then take time to think about how to protect the territories with attack cards, so that other players cannot foil your plans.<br/><br/>If you are successful in holding your territory on the treasure cards, then SUCCESS! The treasure cards are rewarded to you and the process is repeated again. In the end, the player with the most treasure cards wins.<br/><br/>サイコロ振りまくり！ベル鳴らしまくり！<br/>スピードも心理戦も両方大事な、リアルタイム陣取り&times;心理戦を五感で楽しめるアナログゲームです。<br/><br/>ひとことで言うとどんなゲーム？<br/><br/>場にある財宝カードをダイスの早置き勝負で自分の陣地として仮確保し、その後はじっくり考えながら攻撃カードを使って他プレイヤーに邪魔されないように陣地を守ります。<br/>守りきった陣地の財宝カードをGET！という流れを繰り返します。<br/><br/>最終的に、財宝カードを一番多く獲得したプレイヤーの勝利というゲームです。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The xXxenophile collectable card game is a game based on introducing different people, places, and things and hope they &quot;pop.&quot; Based on the erotic comic of the same name by Phil Foglio, the game retains the humor of the comic, but the images are less explicit. Where the comic is definitely rated &quot;X&quot;, the card game's pictures would receive a soft &quot;R&quot; rating.<br/><br/>The basic mechanic of the game is laying out the cards in a certain pattern face down, flipping one of the cards, and then attempting to match the edges of the cards with edges of the same color. Each card has a different point total, and the first player to 100 points wins.<br/><br/>Each player brings his or her own deck to play, and the decks get hopelessly intermingled during play. Half the fun of the xXxenophile game is gaining cards that you did not originally have.<br/><br/>The cards are not painted in an insulting way, are no more demeaning to women than they are to men, and there is material for people of all sexual preferences within the artwork. The game is still not appropriate for children by the standards of its country of origin (the United States).<br/><br/>Cheapass Games&rsquo;s James Ernest, the game designer who designed Kill Doctor Lucky and Button Men, created the design for play of the game.<br/><br/>",

The game follows the story of Harkon, a newly trained Viking warrior as he faces the invading demon hordes.

Players invest resources to build traps between combat phases to prepare for the incoming waves of enemies. The game also features a story-based exploration system that allows players to follow Harkon's journey and unlock additional lore as well as new gameplay elements as they progress. The campaign and all scenarios are fully replayable, with different classes, skills, events and varying enemy setup.<br/><br/>",

The special feature here is that, by using an app via tablet or smartphone, questions and tasks adapt to the age and level of knowledge of the respective player. So it is a rare trivia game that can be played with adults and kids.<br/><br/>The board consists of a circular track with spaces in nine different colors, corresponding to different question categories. Players roll their two dices and choose one of them to move around the track. When a player stops on a color they get a multiple choice question (or sometimes a mini game) of the appropriate category, delivered via app. If the player answers a question correctly two times in a row, they get a knowledge cup of that color (assuming they don't already have it). If they already have this colors cup, a correct answer allows the player to roll again and move on around the board.<br/><br/>If a player stops at a space with an opponents pawn that owns this spaces color, he will challenge him in head to head questions to get the knowledge cup from him.<br/><br/>Once a player has assembled all 9 knowledge cups or moved around the board three times, he is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Alesia is a two-player game of the epic battle between Roman and Gallic forces in 52 BC. The battle pitted two of the great Leaders of that era against each other: Julius Caesar and Vercingetorix. This began as a Roman siege of the Gallic fortress at Alesia, and concluded with a decisive battle. The game system emphasizes command control. Players pick command markers to generate actions, modeling the chaos of the original battle. The Gallic objective is to break out of Alesia and link up with the relief army coming in from off the map. The Roman&rsquo;s (caught in the middle) objective is to defeat the Gauls and eliminate Vercingetorix. There are two players in the game: Roman and Gauls. The game consists of three Days of Battle. Within each day, there will be several turns based on the command markers. There are 176 5/8in counters, with a 22x34 inch map depicting the area around the fortified village of Alesia and the Roman fortifications and towers surrounding the village.<br/><br/>Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #312<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warzone Resurrection is a 32mm scale tabletop skirmish wargame for two or more players, each fielding units of warriors drawn from one of the mighty MegaCorporations of Mankind, the Brotherhood or its vile enemy, the Dark Legion. Warzone Resurrection is a fast paced, exciting and tactical miniature game created by Prodos Games Ltd. and Paraodox Entertainment.<br/><br/>The Warzone Resurrection project brings the tabletop game well and truly into the 21st century. Lovingly, we have taken essence and best bits from the game, art and prose of previous editions to produce all new miniatures, a background re-imagining (by Warzone mega-fan and writing genius, Andy Hoare) and an exciting innovative gaming system.<br/><br/>The gaming system involves both miniatures and cards. The minis are your skirmish force and the cards represent game resources, additional wargear, global and local effects on the battlefield etc.. In a real battle it is likely that a soldier wouldn't know his opponents wargear, whether they have grenades or a laser-sight for example. Both sides might be surprised by a Martian earthquake or Mercurian solar flare. The Venusian jungle cover you are in might be better (or worse) than you thought! War is rarely predictable, especially when it takes place on the planets, planetoids and asteroids of the solar system! All these and many more variables are represented by the cards you and your opponent play. Making Warzone Resurrection a truly novel, realistic and exciting tabletop miniature skirmish game!<br/><br/>The game brings 7 factions among the Bauhaus, Capital, Cybertronic, Mishima, Imperial, The Brotherhood and the Dark Legion<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Warzone <br/>    Warzone (Second Edition)  <br/><br/><br/>",

It is a beautiful book in its own right with hundreds of colour photo of the most exquisitely painted model soldiers taken from the world s foremost collections. The rule book's intention is to inspire a collector to play gentlemanly games with their collections of soldiers with friends where the emphasis is on the spirit of the period, not the letter of the rule. It is a hearty publication and not for nitpickers or miseries. There are some good gags in it, but it also plays well and enables players to conduct a very big battle in a reasonable period of time, leaving them more time to chat about the highs and lows and what ifs...&quot;<br/><br/>Pike &amp; Shotte closes the gap that Warlord Games left between the &quot;Hail Caesar&quot; and the &quot;Black Powder&quot; rulebooks. Using the hallmark Warlord Games orders system (a player must state what his units are about to do, then make a leadership roll dice to check the efficiency with whom of the order given is received), with a 3-phases turn modality that clearly brings the Rick Priestley firm, the game is very smooth, fast and less detailed and mechanic than its stronger competitor, the Field of Glory Renaissance system.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Head-to-Head Poker is a 2-player game that gives a good, fun introduction to Poker without the stress of betting or bluffing. The rules give 5 variations of play, such as simply drawing one card and playing it, or drawing two, choosing one to play on your side and giving your opponent the other and so on. A die is rolled to determine how each hand will be played. The game is played in 3 rounds, and 3-5 cards are turned up at the start of each round and get $200 in chips placed on them. Players take turns to lay up to 4 more cards on their side, to make the best 5 card hand they can. In this way, the original face-up card on each row is shared by the players, and you can easily see what you need to play to beat your opponent's hand.<br/><br/>When the rows are complete, the player who has the winning hand on each row takes the chips in the middle. After playing the simple version, players can then use the betting rules, which let them raise the betting on the center cards. This makes the game more tense and more fun as the stakes are raised. Can you play the right card to beat your opponent and win $100s?<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Head-to-Head Poker Game Parker Brothers and Hasbro Games.<br/>Build the best hand in this poker duel! Six different games in one!<br/><br/>Experience hand-to-hand combat- poker style! You and your opponent duel it out as you play cards on your respective sides of the board, sharing the common cards between you. But watch out! Each game has its own surprises and you could end up empty-handed. Build the strongest combinations on the board and take the chips to win!<br/>2 adult players.<br/><br/>",

Unlike chess, the board for Smess has various types of arrows printed on each square of the &quot;chess&quot; board.  Movement is determined by the direction of the arrow or arrows in the square.  The pieces are similar to chess in that the Brain is like a king in chess, Ninnies are like pawns, and Numskulls are like rooks or bishops.  This is a fun game that is much simpler than chess at first glance. However, the game will vary in difficulty depending on the skill of the opponent.  The goal is to capture your opponent's Brain.  The fact that both players can &quot;see&quot; all possible moves to and from a square can make the game harder than you'd think!

The Big Game with rival Lowe Valley was lost by the Roley Rollers 24 - 21, the first ever loss to the Lowe Riders. Homecoming was also marred by the tragic death of Becky Sue Lamour, a student at Roley High who was killed near midnight after the Homecoming dance, when the car in which she was a passenger stalled on the railroad tracks at Back Road Crossing and was struck by a freight train. The driver, Rock N. Roley, escaped without injury. Reunion activities will commence at 9:00 a.m. Saturday with a tour of the new gymnasium, after which Principal R.

        "description": "War &amp; Write is a light, strategic, &quot;pen &amp; paper&quot;, World War II wargame, simulating not only the European and Pacific theaters but also an alternate-history North and South American theater! 2 to 5 players lead Allied and Axis factions on 6 map configurations including an epic world map, where players play all the theaters at once!<br/><br/>Each of the 6 rounds represents a year in the war. Players secretly write down commands for their faction and then simultaneously reveal their plans. Did they reinforce more units, form diplomatic ties with neural countries, or move to a decisive battleground? While factions can fight over any territory, each game offers players decisive historical battlegrounds where the victor can win not only more units but more influence in the League of Nations.<br/><br/>Key locations have flags (such as Berlin, Tokyo, San Francisco, and London). Control a territory with flags and gain influence in the League of Nations. At the end of each round, the faction with the most influence in the League of Nations can swing victory in their favor.<br/><br/>Can the Allies survive the heavy assault of the Axis, push back hard enough in the last two years, and gain enough influence in the League of Nations to secure a victory for the Allies? Or can the Axis players alter history and lead their forces to global domination?<br/><br/>Advanced play includes unique technologies for each faction to explore. Use your Soviet spy network to assassinate diplomats. Unleash the wrath of V-rockets upon your enemies. Fly your squadron of Spitfires to victory. Or drop the bomb on a territory, wiping out all units and flags from the area.<br/><br/>Choose your tech. Write your orders. Prepare for war.<br/><br/>",

You can't afford to be the weak link in this chain!<br/><br/>McJohny's is an action-packed party game for 3 to 6 players that takes about 20 minutes. The game is comprised of different mini-games. Each shift, one player is the manager and decides who has to do what. Together they try to satisfy some of the four customers that come to the restaurant. Employees are allowed to work only one minute because of very strong unions. Also due to the low budget, there aren't always wages for everyone, so not all of the staff wants to cooperate.<br/><br/>In the end you count up your acquired little crabs &mdash; the only currency usable at McJohny's &mdash; and trade them in at the restaurant gift shop. Maybe you'll earn enough to go on holidays to Crab Island!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HIR&THORN; (pronounced hirth) is a two-player abstract strategy game in which two leaders (Viking kings) fight over control of a piece of land. The first to either control the five middle spaces or push the other player's king off the board wins. Although it has a relatively small board (eleven squares), the ability to use moves to build stronger units makes the gameplay quite intricate. The game is designed in recent times but with the ambition of resembling a game that could potentially have been found in a Viking grave.<br/><br/>In the game, the players start on each short end of the board and take turns. Each turn they can make five moves. For a move, a player either moves one piece (Hird or King) one step, moves a Hird into or off a Karve (boat), or moves a Karve and all Hirds on it one step. A Karve may have at most four Hirds on it. Pieces entering empty spaces have to stop. Pieces entering enemy-controlled spaces stop on the line between the spaces. After a player's five moves, any conflicts (pieces on lines) are resolved. All pieces except empty Karve are worth 1. The King is tiebreaker. In case of a loss, solitary Hirds are removed from the game, Karves and Hirds in Karves are removed from play, and Kings have to retreat to an adjacent empty or friendly space. If there are no possible squares for the King to move to, the player loses. If after their turn a player controls all five middle spaces, that player wins.<br/><br/>There is also a doubling coin in the game affecting points received if several games are played. Normally a game is won after receiving five points.<br/><br/>",

Sourcing the freshest ingredients and using innovative cooking techniques is how you stand out from the pack. Show everyone that you've got the chops to be the best roving restaurant on the block. You know what they say: if you can't stand the heat...<br/><br/>In &agrave; la food cart, players are racing to complete their selected Goal card first. Goals are completed by accumulating sets of ingredients each round, with players having the flexibility to choose different sets at any given time based on which areas of the card they wish to complete and which special abilities they seek to unlock.<br/><br/>During a round, both players will send their &quot;workers&quot; to the market by placing face-down cards covering the ingredients or actions they want to secure. By mixing their gains from the market with the Bonus effects active on their Goal card, players can create potent combos and advance toward victory.<br/><br/>",

Each player secretly creates a word from some number of those letter cards and lays the cards face down in order, returning any excess cards to the box.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must reveal a letter in his word, and he may choose to guess an opponent's word. To guess, he must hand over a token to that player. (Each player starts the game with three tokens, and if a player runs out of tokens, he cannot guess until someone else gives him one.) If the player is correct, he claims any letters not revealed in that player's word, while the wordmaker claims all revealed letters; if the player gets any letter wrong in his guess, the word remains as is. If a player ever reveals all letters in his word, he claims all of those letter cards.<br/><br/>After all letters cards have been claimed, the round ends and players score one point for each card collected.

As Attila&rsquo;s Huns and their Germanic barbarian allies moved into Western Europe, leaving a trail of pillage and destruction behind and threats of more violence to come, the remnants of the Western Roman Empire joined with their former enemies, the mighty Visigoth tribe, to stop the deadly invasion.<br/><br/>The two coalitions squared off in battle in the summer of 451 A.D. in what is now central France. The result entered both history and mythic folklore, as one of the last armies of the Roman Empire stood in common cause with their bitter Gothic rivals to defend their lands and their peoples from the marauding terror of the Huns.<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>What's In The Box?:<br/><br/>&bull; One 20-page full color Rules booklet<br/>&bull; Two 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; paper game maps<br/>&bull; 96 counters<br/>&bull; 16 Opportunity cards<br/>&bull; One player aid<br/>&bull; One ten-sided die<br/>&bull; One bright red, 9 1/4&quot; x 5 7/8&quot; Standard cardboard VPG game box<br/>&bull; One beautiful box cover sleeve<br/>&bull; One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin<br/>&bull; One charcoal desiccant packet<br/><br/>",

Most cards involve moving a specific Slime a specific number of spaces, but several special cards apply to Slimes in certain race positions (e.g. The Slime in first place may double the distance between it and the Slime in second). Some Slimes have a better set of movement cards than others, and therefore receive lower odds on the betting chart.<br/><br/>Players each get a hand of 7 cards. Depending on what cards a player has, they can form a strategy for which Slimes they think they can push into first and second place at the finish line. The players bet on which Slimes they think will win. Players then take turns playing cards to move the Slimes until there is a first and second place winner. Players tally up their score and advance their score marker. First player to reach 50 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players assume the role of security employees that spend their office hours hacking into their employer's own mainframe.

The first players to have 14 Secrets wins the game.<br/><br/>Every turn, players have the choice to spend one of their Secrets to start a new hack (rerolling the dice pool), or simply scavenge for remains from the previous hack.

Players constantly have to weigh up their needs: which option to take yourself vs. which option not to leave for others, and creating new options for yourself vs. not creating new options for others.<br/><br/>This game was originally created for Randall's Dice Or No Dice contest, which ran in January 2014 on BoardGameGeek.<br/><br/>",

Each turn you have five actions to distribute between your on-field figures. The game takes place on field overlaid with a hex grid.  The aim is to throw the ball for a score into one of three score zones in your opponent's half. After scoring, your turn ends and the ball is launched back onto the field. At the core of the game are the actions. Each of your figures can have up to two of your five allowance spent on him. Players need to plan ahead, especially if they score, since the board does not reset afterwards. Available actions include move, slam (tackle), steal the ball, throw the ball, pick up the ball, and stand up. The actions all have the same basic mechanisms, so learning and remembering them is easy. Seven points or more, or, failing that, the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>KickOff is a simple new format that features a pocket-sized rulebook, game board, 2 basic starter teams and all the counters and dice needed to play.  It simplifies Dreadball by removing most valuable players, RefBot, fouls and league play. In the box you will find no cards, ref, roster pad or hex bases.  There are also two fewer models per team.<br/><br/>",

US and ARVN brigades/regiments and police battle VC battalions, NVA regiments, and subversive Political Cadres for Provincial control throughout the country.<br/><br/>It is early 1965. The South Vietnamese government and army (ARVN) are collapsing in the face of growing Vietcong attacks. President Johnson feels he MUST act. On March 8, 1965, the 9th Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, lands at Danang to take over the large base&rsquo;s defense from ARVN forces who are presumably now free to conduct offensive operations against the VC. US Army units shortly deploy to Bien Hoa and other strategic areas. By fall 1965, the 1st Cavalry Division is engaged in a full-scale offensive in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam&rsquo;s Central Highlands. &quot;Americanization&rdquo; of the war has begun. Before it's over 10 years later, Cambodia and Laos are dragged into the struggle. US forces leave Vietnam in 1973 having never lost a sizable battle, but South Vietnam quickly falls nonetheless, in early 1975.<br/><br/>Welcome back to 1965, now YOU are in command! The ARVN has basically collapsed and the North Vietnamese Army is infiltrating the south in large numbers even as local VC forces grow in strength. If you can hold Saigon until Summer 1977 (50 quarterly turns), the communists will be totally spent - Victory! Or will you, like Johnson and Nixon, find the VC and NVA impossible to completely defeat?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is a strategic-level World War I game covering the entire war, from the opening shots in Serbia and Belgium to the final defeat -- or victory! -- of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1918. The game includes a map stretching from the Pyrenees to Moscow, and from Norway to the Sudan, covering every square inch of territory in Europe and the Near East which saw combat from 1914 to 1918, in a manageable 34x22&quot; format. An additional map shows the German colonies<br/><br/>The game also features 400 beautifully-illustrated counters depicting the national armies that fought in the war -- from the Germans, French, British and Russians all the way down to the Persians, Montenegrins, Armenians, South Africans, and a host of other specialized units (French Foreign Legion, Gurkhas, Italian &quot;Arditi&quot;, Cossacks, Tyrolean Kaiserjaeger, Zionists, Bavarians, &quot;Dunsterforce&quot;... even the Chinese may send a small expeditionary force).<br/><br/>DEATH IN THE TRENCHES includes a deceptively simple twelve pages of rules (and an additional twelve pages of random events) detailing the game's unique combat system (no CRT!) which portrays the grinding nature of World War I combat in a realistic way that still gives players plenty of options to pursue. Using army-level units (which contain numbers of divisional level formations, represented off-map), players use numerous special military abilities to drive back the enemy.<br/><br/>Detailed random events rules give you more gory details about World War I than you've ever seen before in a game, while helping keep play simple and straightforward. Lenin, the Senussi revolt, intrigue in the Romanian court, the Cruise of the Emden, the Armenian Massacre, the Sinai Pipeline, the Ukrainian Reactionary Hetmanate, Rasputin, Mata Hari, the Russian shell shortage, the murder of Edith Cavell, Wilhelm Wassmuss (the &quot;German Lawrence&quot;), Lawrence of Arabia, the Nestorian resistance, Pancho Villa, the Grand Duke Nicholas, Thomas Masaryk, the Red Baron, Czech Legion, Irish Rising, Berber Revolt, air raids, typhus, influenza... they're all here.<br/><br/>For the World War I buff, &quot;DITT&quot; has everything: Tanks, Alpenkorps, artillery barrages, flamethrowers, poison gas, Krupp guns, Mustapha Kemal, the Royal Air Force, French elan... while the great wartime leaders all leave their mark (good or bad!) on history: Bruchmuller, Haig, Hoffmann, Mackensen, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Rennenkampf and Samsonov, Sarrail, Von Francois, Foch, Brusilov, Nivelle, Plehve, Putnik, Yudenich... they're all here. Players command the armed forces of nearly forty nations, in a game that still manages to be small enough to fit on your table!<br/><br/>It sounds like a massive game, but it isn't. DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is designed to be played--easy to play, hard to master. You'll learn things about World War I you never knew before, and you'll have to face the same crises the leaders of the Entente and Central Powers did. Think you can do better than Douglas Haig and Robert Nivelle? Now it's your turn.<br/><br/>Death in the Trenches won the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.<br/><br/>",

After a construction phase, trip-tests verify the best and quickest lines.<br/><br/>The mechanism is easy: during his turn, a player puts 3 line counters on the board. If his line meets another line, a station is built where the two connect. The subway network is developed through this process. Because the grid on the board and the line counters are triangular, players have some real placement questions.<br/><br/>The game is very interactive, with players sometimes trying to cooperate and sometimes trying to stop other lines. They also choose, during the construction phase, the start and the end of the final trip-tests. But it's never the same player who places both start and end, so a player must anticipate and guess carefully.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Railroads was designed to be a game about table talk.  It's about making deals with other players, riding the rise and fall of various authentic nineteenth century railroad companies.  In most railroad board games, one player is one company, and is engaged in pure competition with the other players.  That doesn't make for a very social experience.  Since players are investors in Railroads, they have the opportunity to benefit from semi-cooperative ventures, while hedging out their allies with other investments.<br/><br/>Additionally, Railroads is not a game about budgets and check books.  Money functions as points and are never spent.  Stock tokens are played and moved in a simplified fashion that means strategy is emphasized and budgeting is eliminated.  Stocks are merely methods of earning money (scoring points) so players can focus on their larger plans.<br/><br/>Players who play alone in Railroads will not do very well.  Railroads only gain as much track per turn as there are players in the company.  If there is only one player in the company, they only lay one track per turn and will not make a lot of money.  However, if you can get one or two people to join your venture, you can double or triple the speed that your railroads grow, turning your fledgling railroad into a geopolitical force to be reckoned with. Just make sure that when the money dries up, you are the first one out.<br/><br/>A small number of handmade wooden versions were sold and are available on the second hand market.<br/><br/>",

Taking turns, the players thread their pieces over any of the 12 columns on the board without leaving gaps underneath.  <br/> The playing pieces are of two basic types: 'roundels' (disk-shaped beads) and 'blockers' (square-sectioned pieces).  Roundels are used to score points by capping the columns, and are the only pieces that can score. - But the blockers prevent an opponent from placing a roundel above them, and so may be cleverly used to reserve places for your roundels on the top!<br/><br/>",

Hailed by many as of the premier games covering The Korean War, this two-player operational level simulation covers the first year of the Korean conflict, from June 1950 to May 1951.<br/><br/>During this period, the United States found itself involved in a bitter struggle in a remote Asian land that many Americans had not even heard of. Amid the debacles and stunning victories of the first year of war, the very foundation of the American military system &mdash; so recently triumphant in the Second World War &mdash; was severely shaken. In a war that few Americans understood and which historians have tended to ignore, the foundation of future American diplomacy in the face of communism was laid.<br/><br/>The players control ground and air forces of the United Nations, North Korea, and Communist China. Each player's force consists of a wide variety of units, including infantry, marines, paratroopers, armor, and aircraft. The map is a 1:750,000 representation of the Korean peninsula from Pusan in the south to the Yalu River in the north. In addition to controlling military forces, the players must make a number of political decisions that have an important effect on the game. Above all, the UN player must strive to keep international tensions at a minimum for the purpose of preventing World War Three. Intense escalation and mobilization could have disastrous consequences for the militarily-unprepared United States. On the other hand, insufficient force applied to Korea could lead to the conquest of South Korea by North Korean communists.<br/><br/>This edition of The Korean War features a super-sized map and larger counters and is another Classic Reborn! by Compass.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature edition of the classic Joseph Balkoski game goes beyond merely incorporating errata found from the original edition; it includes enhancements that include:<br/><br/>     Larger and easier-to-read 9/16&rdquo; counters and three game maps<br/>     Game map information is updated and includes all-new map artwork<br/>     Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts<br/>     Restrictions on UN build-up and breakdown so UN player cannot perpetually continue Action Phase by reorganizing units<br/>     Modified amphibious assault system that allows UN player to more effectively recreate September 1950 Inchon invasion<br/>     Modified victory conditions that lessen impact of Global Tension<br/>     New random events to make the operation a bit more unpredictable<br/>     Updated rules treatment backed by many illustrations, an index, and clarifications and examples of play to reduce potential questions.<br/>     Updated historical notes<br/><br/><br/>Complexity: 7 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 6 out of 10 (landing options; no hidden units)<br/><br/>Time Scale: one month per turn<br/>Map Scale: 7.5 miles per hex<br/>Unit Scale: battalions, regiments, brigades and divisions<br/><br/>Players: one to two, best with two or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-8 hours depending upon scenario, 20+ hours for campaign<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    Four map sheets (42.5&quot; x 71&quot;overall map dimension)<br/>    Three countersheets (9/16&quot; size)<br/>    Rules booklet with updated Historical Notes<br/>    Two charts and tables booklets<br/>    One ten-sided die<br/>    Box and Lid<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

That war was fought primarily between two coalitions of European powers, but it also involved fighting in the Americas, India and the East Indies, as well as on the high seas. It was also a time of expansion for the Manchu Empire, which could have put China on a collision course with the Europeans. Historically, the Seven Years War resulted in the domination of central Europe by Prussia and of North America and India by Great Britain.<br/><br/>Seven Years World War can be played by two, three, or four, each representing a different coalition of powers. Each player has a variety of military, diplomatic and economic instruments with which he can attempt to dominate the world.<br/><br/>The Major Powers includes: Austrian Empire, France, Great Britain, Maratha Confederation (India), Manchu Empire (China), Ottoman Empire, Prussia, Russian Empire, Spanish Empire, and United Provinces (Netherlands).<br/><br/>The game map shows the world as it was during the mid-18th century. A square grid has been superimposed on the map to regularize the position and movement of the playing pieces.  Players should note the actual geographic boundaries of the various empires and powers are slightly distorted to clarify their position on the map.<br/><br/>The game is won by gaining control of strategic objectives that can then be translated into success at the peace table.<br/><br/>",

Each building can only be activated by a certain die value, and will provide money, construction material, soldiers, or victory points. If you erect buildings with different dice values, you will be able to utilize your dice most efficiently. Also, you can customize your buildings according to your needs by upgrading them with different combinations of cards, increasing or changing their production, or changing their required dice value.

Each round the players roll their dice and distribute them on the different cards. They can hold back dice for the next round, rolling them again then. The sum on a player's dice placed on a card must always be lower or the same as the card's value.<br/><br/>After three rounds, all dice must be placed. Dice which cannot be placed go to &quot;Vulture Valley&quot;, where at the end of each round you can win an additional card &ndash; or lose one of the cards you already collected. The pack cards are then resolved as follows: Each pack card is given to the player whose dice match the card's value or who has the highest total on this card. If players are tied on a pack card, they compete in &quot;dice combat&quot; using only the dice on this card, with the highest total winning the card. Thus, dice combat might take place between one die and three dice, both matching the card's value.<br/><br/>Special cards allow a player to collect more than one card at once, e.g., all cards which could not be won by matching dice in the previous round.<br/><br/>Aside from a numerical value, each pack card shows a number of paws, and these are the real victory points. The player who holds the most paws at the end of the game is declared leader of the savanna.<br/><br/>",

The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.<br/><br/>J&eacute;na, fought on 14 October 1806, is the turning point of the 1806 campaign against Prussia.

While starting outnumbered, the French are at the top of their military value and the masterful&nbsp;concentration of the army during the day makes J&eacute;na&nbsp;the epitome of victories.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Auerstaedt, was fought on the same day, opposing Davout and his Third corps to the main Prussian army under Brunswick and the King of Prussia. An unexpected battle, as more troops enter the battlefield on both sides, a masterpiece where Davout earned his title of Duke of Auerstaedt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of that day, the two Prussian armies, both beaten in this double battle, join in a common rout, followed by a legendary pursuit lead by Murat to the destruction of the arrogant Prussian army in a few weeks. &nbsp;<br/> Both battles comes with many what-ifs and a total of 15 scenarios, using troops from both armies not historically engaged. Several scenarios give finally a real chance to the unlucky Prussians.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Le si&egrave;ge de Danzig,&nbsp;simulates the siege of the great fortress of Danzig between March and May 1807, between the Eylau part of the campaign of Poland and its conclusion at Friedland. It is played on two maps, an operational map of the region of Danzig, using the regular Vive l&rsquo;Empereur rules, and a siege map where the French player will build a siege network to get closer to the mighty walls to breach them. A lot happens on both maps, sorties, relief Russian forces under Kamenski, the Danzig morale that conditions victory goes up and down depending on the progress of the siege works and other events. The players will have to be patient, the siege can be won or lost on the last turn of play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When resources are scored players get points for having men delivering wood and iron to their warriors.

It is the time of Prohibition. 4 opposing gangs, each with 9 gangsters want to bring the city under their control. By playing out rows, each of which consist of 6 gangsters, players try to gain a majority through their most valuable gangsters. But careful! To gain powerful positions, sometimes sharpshooting is needed. The goal of the game is to become the most powerful of all, Al Capone. Tactics, strategy and cold-bloodedness will be required if you want to be celebrated as the boss of bosses in this game.<br/><br/>What gives the game its flair, apart from the real metal munitions, is the deft touch of the illustrator as well as court artist Robert Nippoldt. From corrupt mayor William Hale &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson to Boss of Bosses Al &quot;Scarface&quot; Capone, all of the major gangsters of this lead-filled time are represented. The well-known portraits are taken from the eponymous book &quot;Gangster. The Bosses of Chicago&quot; by Robert Nippoldt, and give the game a sheen of authenticity. The book has received awards from the German Designer Club, Buchkunst Fund as well as the Red Dot Design Award 2006.<br/><br/>Expanded by: Gangster: Der Clou.<br/><br/>",

Second (or first), buy the right to place it in a row or column labeled with a particular letter.  There's an auction on each player's turn where one choice in both these possibilities goes on sale at the same time.  So, perhaps the auction is for B, or a blue pearl.  If you win the auction and you've already got a pearl, you immediately have to choose a spot for it somewhere in row or column B; if you've already got your letter bought, you get the blue pearl and immediately choose a spot for it; if you've got neither, you can take either one and await getting the other in a later auction.<br/><br/>Ultimately your scores are determined by how many pearls of the same color are clustered together and the number of empty spaces surrounding the cluster, and whether you have more pearls than anyone else in the cluster.<br/><br/>Tahiti is an excellent choice if you enjoy auctions, area majorities, and that &quot;Acquire&quot; kind of feeling you get from watching squares fill in and grow into scoring groups.<br/><br/>",

It can be played by any group size, from 2 players to as many as you can fit around a table.<br/><br/>You start the game by laying out a 4x4 grid of word cards. Cards have a point value from 1 to 3. Teams take turns trying to capture one of the cards by asking the speaker a single question, without using any form of the word on the card. If the speaker says the word in its response, the team captures that card and scores the points.<br/><br/>Whenever a team misses with their question, they must add a bonus point token to the card, increasing its value. Whenever a team captures a card, they add a bonus point token to any of the cards next to the captured card. The first team to score 16 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Hey Robot rewards general knowledge, linguistic dexterity, and the ability to reverse-engineer the algorithms that power the smart devices we've brought into our homes.

A full life&ndash;full of virtues and vices&ndash;is coming to an end and the inevitable judgment weights on your conscience.<br/><br/>During the game you&rsquo;ll try to gain the best score possible by collecting the various types of Deadly Sins, in form of cards. The game mixes the classic rules of a set collection with an intriguing memory twist, because you can't look further in your deck after each turn. Try not to be seduced by excess, nor by complete indifference. Once in a while you should also feed the Abyss of Souls to influence the ending of the game and to gain the Stones of Forgiveness, which are really useful during the final scoring.<br/><br/>Bow your heads while waiting for the verdict, sinners, and face the last journey of your miserable lives.<br/><br/>",

The game comes with multilingual rules (english, spanish, italian, german and french) and instructions to build 10 different F1 circuits.<br/>Each player must set the gear and roll an appropriate number of special dice, that determine the speed of the car and the fuel consuption. The game is turn based and the phasing player, after moving his car, must set the gear for next turn. The box strategy is the most important decision to take. You can decide to complete all the 3 laps without stopping or making one or two pitstops.<br/>The game is not a &quot;simulation&quot;, but to win you need a good amount of skill. Even if the speed of your car is determined by dice, you have to choose carefully the &quot;braking point&quot; in order to enter the curves at the best speed. If you exceed the curve's speed limit, you lose &quot;tyres points&quot;. Of course, you can simulate a championship playing different circuits. What's interesting is that the game strategy changes from circuit to circuit and if you design your own circuit you need all your &quot;driving skill&quot; to be competitive. Rookies can win, but they will find very hard to beat a skilled player.<br/>Game components: 65 tiles to build the circuits (an avarege of 25 tiles are needed for each circuit), 6 plastic sport cars, 12 special dice, 6 &quot;dashboards&quot;, 40 speed limit tokens, 24 plastic pawns, one rules booklet.<br/><br/>",

To accomplish this, you have time until closing, which comes after the deck runs out. And watch out, if the guests are discontent, you can lose the game earlier!<br/><br/>Players take turns one after the other, and their turn consists of three phases. In the Activation phase, a row or column of tables are activated based on the top card of the deck. The activated guests may advance to their next state or their stress levels can increase. The second phase is the Action phase, where the player can take various actions: seat new guests, take orders, prepare and serve meals, and buy ingredients. The player has to play a card for each action, and based on the type of the card, the interaction can decrease or increase the stress level of the guest. In the Ending phase, the player discards the ingredients exceeding the storage limit, and draws new cards. The most interesting part is the preparation of meals, where other players can also play cards and pay ingredients to help the current player.<br/><br/>",

Each card has a special effect, but only the effect of the card that wins the trick is activated.  Some of the effects include reversing the order, such that the lowest card will win future tricks; passing the lead to another player; or giving a trick won to another player.  The lowest ranked cards also have abilities that trigger when the highest value cards are present in the same trick which increase their rank.<br/><br/>At the end of a hand, the player with the most trophies will earn that many points, with most tricks being worth 1 trophy.  All other players will earn points equal to the difference between the winning player's trophy count and their own.  Play continues until players reach a specified victory point count, and the player with the least points wins.<br/><br/>",

Soon merchants were sent to earth to trade their intergalactic goods. Their ships landed in the beautiful city of Vienna.

These merchant cards build your game board for the first of two rounds.<br/><br/>You will use your six dice, which represent your trading goods, to negotiate with the different merchants. The higher your result, the better is your argument. The players take their turns clockwise and once all players have used their dice, the round is over. Players reach their deals and collect their rewards. Sounds easy, right? HA-HA, there's always a catch!<br/><br/>During your turn you try to manipulate your opponents dice, or your own, to either outplay them or get yourself in a better position.

The playing pieces represent divisions and brigades on both sides, as well as artillery units and various informational markers.

Each village will sing of this glory to impress the other villagers for years to come.<br/>In this 2-6 player game, every bear village must maximize these deeds and actions each season before winter hiBEARnation. As the bear elder, you must instruct the bears in your village on these deeds!<br/><br/>Each season consists of three turns that elders take simultaneously. First, roll your bear dice behind your village screen &ndash; keeping your bear plans secret from the other villages. Then give your bears their assignments using the different spaces on your village board, but be careful because only bears with matching skills can be assigned to the same space. Finally, in the order they appear on the village mat, each bear goes out to face their particular task!<br/><br/>Glory is earned in many ways, most of which require gathering resources like honey and ore. Bears can also draft new bears into their village to gain more bear dice or hire mercenary bears for a single turn. Bears can raid nearby villages or defend their own home if they think the other villages may try and attack! Bears also love to adventure &ndash; but they have to beware of rival bears beating them to the punch!<br/>Once winter ends, the game ends, and the village that has accumulated the most glory is the victor of Tales of BarBEARia! Thanks for BEARing with me and PAWSing to read this, even if this summary is quite emBEARassing! Grab this game FURiously and forgive these unBEARable jokes.

Players pick a character background card (ex:  Ogre Slayer, Swindler King, etc.) and add special power cards to them (ex: Fireball, Backstab, etc.) they then draw a Flaw card which gives them a unique attribute (ex: chronic liar, Impatient, etc.) and a personal goal card (in secret) which they must complete in addition to the main quest to win the game (ex:  Outsmart an enemy, Betray a party member, etc.).<br/><br/>During combat the game is played on modular map cards with heroes and monsters acting in sequence; the storyteller controls all the monsters. Heroes obtain loot cards at the end of combat in addition to leveling their characters stats. To win the game, each player must complete the main quest developed by the storyteller (through the use of the quest cards) as well as their own personal quest cards (which are kept hidden until completed).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1830 Cardgame is an economic slugfest by the designer of railroad games like Lokomotive Werks and Union vs. Central, and your goal is to have the most money on hand at game's end. Each turn you draw a card from one of three face-up cards, then perform one of four actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Buy a share, paying the cost.<br/>    Buy a train, which (strangely) costs nothing.<br/>    Build a station.<br/>    Pay dividends.<br/><br/><br/>Each share is worth the number of stations a company has that have trains to service them. As in 1830: Railways &amp; Robber Barons, an inspiration for this design, trains must be purchased in order; players are limited in the number of trains they can own. The game ends after all shares have been purchased, all &quot;8&quot; trains have been acquired, or twelve dividend payouts have been made.<br/><br/>Released as part of the 2012 Essen package from Winsome.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All was peaceful in the idyllic land of Indines until a powerful artifact, the Belt of Beatdown, was discovered by the villainous Wardlaw O'Brien. With the belt, O'Brien was able to absorb the bar-fighting powers of the greatest fist-fighters across the world. O'Brien scheduled a world-wide pub crawl and invited all the greatest fighters in the land to take part. Can you become the greatest fist-fighter in the World of Indines by fighting your way through seven rounds, punching and gouging your way to supremacy?<br/><br/>At the start of 7-Card Slugfest, each player chooses one of eleven characters and takes a set of seven cards associated with that character. In each set, four cards are simple punches &ndash; doing a variable amount of damage &ndash; while three also have special effects. At the beginning of each round of the game, players shuffle their deck and place it face down in front of them. A stage card is flipped over to show the rewards for first, second and third most KO points earned this round.<br/><br/>When someone yells fight, the players simultaneously start picking up cards from their decks, looking at them, then playing them on another character. Whenever a player runs out of cards, they take a drink token from a common supply. Their character's stamina is ten, plus or minus the value of that drink token. When everyone has played his cards, the next step is to resolve the stacks of cards played on characters, applying damage in the order it was dealt. If a character's stamina is equalled or exceeded, the character who achieved the knockout earns a KO point. If a character survives all the punches aimed at him, then he receives the KO point. Players can also score two KO points for knocking out Boris, a non-player character. KO points are turned into gold according to each round's stage card, and the player with the most gold at the end of seven rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Will they feed their nestlings for more immediate points, or take a different resource to complete a section of their resource ring, thus earning a bonus and triggering a powerful chain reaction? Will they use in-game currency to activate another end-of-game nest goal or save it for victory points?

Well, everybody, that is, except for you.<br/><br/>You, a simple peasant, have just received a most unexpected visitor: the princess' fairy godmother! She has warned you that all is not as it seems. The woman that Prince Micah is about to marry is not his one and only Princess Abigail, but is really an impostor who hopes to take over the kingdom for her own evil plans! She has placed an enchantment over the real princess, who now lies fast asleep in a cottage deep in the forest.<br/><br/>The fairy godmother has explained to you that the only way to save the kingdom from a terrible fate is to awaken the princess with a rose and get her back to the castle in time to stop the wedding. Many dangers await, but the fairy godmother is willing to help you out on your perilous quest...for a small price (hey, even fairy godmothers need to eat!).<br/><br/>Will you save the kingdom and live happily ever after? There's no time to lose if you wish to succeed. The sun is already beginning to set....<br/><br/>Fairy Tale in my Pocket is a spinoff of Zombie in My Pocket that can be played solo or cooperatively with kids. In the game, you must explore the forest and the kingdom, creating the tile board and resolving event cards as you go. Some of these events allow you to buy helpful items from peddlers or to earn gold by spending time helping famous fairy tale characters. However, saving a kingdom is hard and dangerous work, and other events have you meeting up with robbers, dragons, and other unsavory characters who are hazardous to your health. Not only must you survive these encounters, but you must find the rose, awaken the princess, and return to the castle before the sun sets (three times through the event deck) in order to succeed.<br/><br/>A number of scenarios have also been created to vary the gameplay.<br/><br/>",

There were more than 24 satrapies around that period and the Satraps followed direct orders from Xerxes himself.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/> In this resource management game, each player assumes the role of one Satrap, each with his own area, special ability and characteristics. Every turn the players are trying to collect resources for taxes, construct buildings or launch campaigns.The player has a number of Tax and Campaign cards to resolve in order to satisfy Xerxes and earn his favor (counted as Victory Points).<br/><br/>Every round of the game has the following phases:  <br/>- Resource Phase.   <br/>- Annual Event Phase.  <br/>- Campaign Phase.  <br/>- Build Phase.  <br/>- Taxation Phase.  <br/>- Turn Change Phase.<br/><br/>The player that reaches 25 Victory Points earns the favor of Xerxes and wins the game; alternatively, the one with the most Victory Points at the end of the 7th round.<br/>   <br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Super Circles: The Radical Ring Race! Players race to play all their cards by matching colored rings on the previously played card. Quick minds and fast fingers will triumph!&quot;<br/><br/>Part of the publisher's Fun to Go card game series, this tin contains 72 cards, each picturing 4 concentric rings. The rings are blue, magenta, purple and green, in varying orders. All the cards are dealt out with one put on the center of the table. Players draw cards one at a time from their pile, forming a hand, and without taking turns begin adding to the central stack. To place a card on top of the stack it must match one of the rings in both position and color. The card must also match a different ring from the previous match (outer, larger center, smaller center, or bulls-eye position). The first player to play all cards from their hand and draw pile wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Welcome Battle Commanders! The future of your faction's survival is depending on you! Gain influence and expand your forces to strategically defeat the opposing faction. You win the battle when you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s health to zero. However, a Battle Commander must be cautious if their opponent is off-initiative. Since Battle for Sularia is a round-based card game, if your opponent is off-initiative, they have the chance to strike back and reduce your health total below theirs and thereby defeating you and winning the game!<br/><br/>FEATURES/GAME PLAY INCLUDES:<br/><br/>Multiple Play Modes<br/>With one box, you and your friend can play with the preconstructed 60 card play decks in a head-to-head 2 player game. The two players can then play in our &quot;60/90&quot; constructed format by customizing their play decks with the additional 60 cards provided in the box! If draft play is more your style, one box also supports 2-4 player draft play! An 8 player draft simply requires one additional box. Of course, the game is fully expandable for a variety of casual play modes &ndash; one box supports up to 2 players in casual mode, but there is simply no limit on how many players and formats are available with additional boxes.<br/><br/>Construction Point Values<br/>Unique &quot;60/90&quot; deck construction system. Each card has a construction point value of 1 to 4 points. Each deck must have a minimum of 60 cards and a deck cannot exceed a total construction value of 90 points. This system pushes the envelope on deck construction and maintains value and interests for all cards within the set &ndash; not just a few select overpowered options.<br/><br/>Two-resource System<br/>Engaging two-resource system which includes influence and sularium. Influence increases once per round, while each player uses their influence to establish sites on their turn to help build their sularium stockpiles. Sularium is used to deploy combatants, which are used to attack your opponent's sites. The two-resource system in turn provides additional strategies for repeatable game play.<br/><br/>Round-based Game<br/>Simultaneous combat. The game runs on a round-based system, which allows each player to complete their turn before the round is over.<br/><br/>",

Turenne operated in the northeast of France to join the troops of the Duc de Lorraine and the Spanish with hopes of regaining control of all the fortresses acquired in Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s cause.<br/>Sensing the danger of having such a great captain against him, Mazarin entrusted the command of the armies of Flanders and Champagne to the Comte de Plessis-Praslin (meanwhile beginning secret negotiations with the other camp). Plessis-Praslin lay siege to Rethel and, despite having given his word, the governor of Rethel surrendered a few days before Turenne&rsquo;s arrival. The commander of the Frondeur army was therefore required to combat the entire Royalist army.<br/>After his defeat (which would be the last one), Turenne joined the king&rsquo;s camp in exchange for amnesty, a few titles and, most importantly, the command of the French armies. He would be a loyal servant of the king until his death on the battlefield 25 years later.<br/><br/>&bull; The Dunes 1658 &ndash; 14 June 1658, The alliances had evolved since the end of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. The Lorraine soldiers had gone over to the French camp after their duke was imprisoned by the Spanish. Mazarin convinced King Louis XIV to sign a military alliance with Cromwell who sent a strong English contingency to the continent, thereby forcing King Charles II and Princes James and Henry to join the Spanish with their meagre troops. Exiled with those loyal to him for nearly six years, Cond&eacute; was also on the side of Juan of Austria, the commander in chief of the Spanish forces.<br/>When Turenne lay siege to the fortress of Dunkirk, Juan of Austria decided to give battle right away. Cond&eacute; declared to James &ldquo;Sir, today you will see how to lose a battle&rdquo;.<br/>As a result of this French victory, the Treaty of the Pyrenees and other related agreements were signed, putting an end to the Franco-Spanish War, to some extent the Fronde, and the English Civil War .

(SL) is a low-to-intermediate complexity, two-player, operational simulation (with important tactical undertones) of riverine combat the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. There are two players: the Free World, including US, South Vietnamese and other allies; and the Communists, including Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army forces. The objective of the Communist player is to infiltrate men and supplies via the Mekong Delta's many waterways, while also attacking critical Free World bases and towns across the region. The Free World player is attempting to prevent that infiltration while also conducting an offensive against Communist formations and bases.<br/><br/>Each player has available several types of riverine and ground units, as well as air units for the Free World player. The Communist player can make use of special rules representing that side's advantage in intelligence and local guerrillas. The system uses an 'operational impulse' system. That is, a player moves and fights with one of his forces, followed by his opponent doing the same with a force of the other side. Every operation requires the expenditure of command points.<br/><br/>SL has several different scenarios, each covering a critical period of operations: Game Warden (the early years), Tet (the Communist general offensive of 1968), and SEALORDS (the Free World counteroffensive of 1969-70).<br/><br/>Each map grid square equals 6.21 miles (10 km) across, and each full game turn represents a month. Units of maneuver are mostly battalions and battalion equivalents.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Shiloh is a tactical level simulation of the largest single battle in US military history up to that date.  Before the two-day battle was ended, elements of of three complete armies totalling 100,000 men had participated, as well as elements of the US Navy.  At the end of the second day, over 23,000 men were casualties.  The battle ws launched by the South, hoping that the newly-created Army of the Mississippi could decisively defeat the Union Army of the Tennessee before it could link up with the Army of the Ohio.  Tactically, the battle was a Marginal victory for Union forces, although its strategic implications wee much more far-reaching.  Had the South succeeded in its attpempt, the state of Tennessee would have been recaptured by the Confederacy, and Union offensive power broken in the Western Theatre for at least a year.  A Confederate thrust into the North would have been by no means improbable.  The Union victory at Shiloh, more than any other battle, sealed the Confederacy's fate in the West.&quot; (from the Shiloh rules folder.)<br/><br/>Shiloh is one of four games included in the Blue &amp; Gray Quadrigame set.  The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder.  A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.<br/><br/>Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn.  Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control.  Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.<br/><br/>A new concept, &quot;Attack Effectiveness&quot; is introduced in this set of games.  Essentially, attacking units that receive an &quot;Attacker Retreat&quot; result in combat are rendered &quot;ineffective&quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day.  This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs.  This makes &quot;what the heck&quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &quot;ineffective&quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Shiloh: Grant Surprised<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is set in the old days, when Gaul tribes &ndash; and Romans, too &ndash; were engaged into some special sport: Hinkel &amp; Stein.<br/><br/>Two to four players place stones out of four types of (artificial) stones onto a see-saw scale. The &quot;Chief&quot; player (a &quot;job&quot; that rotates each round) determines whether the lighter or the heavier side of the scale will be declared the winning side at the end of this round.<br/><br/>During a round, each player places one of their stones onto one of four spaces at the ends of the see-saw. The order of the players is determined by the Chief. Before placing a stone, each player may raise the prize to be won (the currency in this game are wooden discs - &quot;wheels&quot;) in the middle of the game or take one disc. Taking a disc automatically excludes you from winning any discs at the end of the round. Special abilities of the different kinds of stones and the fact that all players play each type of stone over several matches makes this a rather heavy tactical wagering game.<br/><br/>English rules for 2-4 players will soon be available on the Chili Spiele website as well as here on BGG.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the short summer of the Southern Alps, animals live in a corral. In Peter's Two Sheep Dogs, players act as two sheep dogs, calling the animals with a loud voice and chasing off the wolf. Compete to be Peter's best sheep dog by herding the animals from the grassland, into the fence, and finally to the hut.<br/><br/>The player aims to become a sheep dog and collect many animals into their navery. Three livestock animals &mdash; sheep, pig, cow &mdash; score points, while the wolf eats the livestock and eliminates points. As a result, players balance moving the wolves to threaten the opponent while also gathering livestock for themselves.<br/><br/>However, because both trick-taking and mancala rules are mixed together, it will not be easy. Basically winning a trick allows players to collect animals in their grasslands. The player who loses the trick picks one of their grasslands and performs the movement action. If you can chase animals perfectly toward your or your opponent's goal fence, you can gain additional action opportunities and an even better score.<br/><br/>During the game you have opportunities for scorings in spring and summer, and if the score obtained in summer is lower than the score obtained in spring, the summer score becomes 0 points. However, if the score obtained in summer is more than twice the score of spring, your spring score is doubled.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gun and Gun is an anime-themed card game from Japanese design studio Keepdry that features competitive one-versus-one battles, a distinct two-deck draft system, and gorgeous Japanese sci-fi art!<br/><br/>In Gun and Gun, players assume the role of one of the game's many Gunners and equip their character with two guns available to them. Once selections have been made, it&rsquo;s a frenetic race to kill each other by reducing either their opponent&rsquo;s life points or their deck size to zero.<br/><br/>A single copy of Gun and Gun is enough for two players to get right into the gun-wielding action; however, some may wish to use more than one set. Playing with one copy provides a more traditional board game experience with a surprising amount of strategy involved in choosing characters and guns.<br/><br/>Playing with two sets, however, ups the intensity and overall competitive nature of the game, allowing for an experience that is closer to that of a constructed card game, where players construct their own decks. Either playstyle is a blast, but we would recommend playing with one set first in order to get used to the gameplay and to learn about the strengths and limitations of each character and gun, before moving into the more competitive side of the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Nexus Infernum, each player assumes the role of a power-hungry Necromancer seeking to become the most blasphemous in the realm. Through command of their skeletal minions gathered in the Nexus, players will battle against one another in a struggle to control six portals and channel the energy that manifests within them. As players channel the four different strains of dark arcana from the portals, they will enhance their powers through invoking and forging unholy pacts with demons gathered beyond the breach. Each demonic pact moves a player towards victory through accumulation of points of blasphemy.<br/><br/>     Roll dice to see which portal (which is marked by different symbols) gets resources. Your dice determine the color of resources as well as the portal. <br/>     Roll dice to see where your first skeleton will travel to. Initially this move means nothing, but as more of your skeletons invade the board you'll have to roll a higher number on the threshold to allow a new skeleton to enter the arena. <br/>     Once your skeleton is on the board they can move to any other portal they choose. Later on in the game when multiple skeletons are in play players can spend a blue resource to move an additional skeleton.<br/>     If two players have a skeleton on the same spot, a player can roll dice and see if they can kill the opposing skeleton. The attacker will need to roll a 4 or higher on a six-sided die to defeat the opposing skeleton, and the defender will roll a D4. If the defender rolls a 4, they will kill the attacking skeleton. In later rounds, players can use a black resource to attack more skeletons.<br/>     Player will then roll a D4 to determine how many resources they can pluck from their portal. <br/>     Player can then choose to bank their resources and hold them until their next turn, or spend it on a demon in the pool. Each demon has different values and purchasing a demon will eventually allow you to unlock pacts which grant you points as well as additional abilities throughout the game. Pacts are only unlocked when a player successfully gains a pair of demons from the same color scheme.<br/>     Next player moves...<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If totally forgotten, they will cease to exist. No more sunrises, no more seasons, no more rains, no more harvests. Earth is doomed.<br/><br/>In the year 2319, Zeus calls together The Council, made up of 12 powerful gods, to discuss the dire situation. Aphrodite, Ares, Artemis, Athena, Apollo, Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hermes, Hephaestus,  Poseidon, and Zeus. However, their interpersonal conflicts make finding agreement impossible.<br/><br/>Finally, one decision is made. A competition of epic proportion, the first of its kind, will be held to identify which of them will lead them to a brighter future. They will call their champions Invictus&ndash;meaning invincible&ndash;a title reserved for Kings. With advancements in technology, the playing field is even. All will unite under this new order no matter who wins. With Invictus in place and the Gods united, they can begin to restore mankind&rsquo;s faith and ensure earth&rsquo;s future.<br/><br/>As a team, defeat the opposition and get them to recognize you as Invictus. Invictus is a deck-building game. During the game, players will customize their decks by purchasing more artifacts, boosts, and reinforcements. As a person&rsquo;s deck runs out, the used cards are reshuffled and placed face down. Thus, your purchased cards will be used many times throughout the game.<br/><br/>How you customize your card depends on your strategy and your character. Each player will assume the role of a Greek god and each one has special abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. You&rsquo;ll need to use your cards strategically to defeat your opponents before they defeat you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each team from 1894 up to the present (2006 season) is available and includes every pitcher with 29.3 IP or hitter/position player with a significant contribution to the team's performance.<br/><br/>The game is played according to the rules of baseball. The action of the game is based upon random numbers between 1 and 50. Numbers 1 through 25 determine the strength of the batter; numbers 26 through 50 provide the capability of the pitcher. Batters have ratings for arm (catchers/outfielders), fielding (by position) and running (catchers have and additional rating for handling pitchers). Pitchers have ratings for fielding and holding runners on base.<br/><br/>The game also has very detailed (and essential to game play) unique ball park charts (capturing the dimensions and effect of each field) for several historic baseball stadiums.<br/><br/>Each card and ball park chart is based on actual statistic performances of the players.<br/><br/>",

Mark has taken his love and study of politics to create a game of power struggles, back door deals, and unscrupulous actions.<br/><br/>You play an activist, a power broker, or the leader of a political party &ndash; in any case, someone who organizes campaigns, games the system and wins elections. Your job is to make compromises, yet always stand by your principles, form coalitions yet still achieve your agenda. To succeed you must herd cats, spin facts into a web of deception, and speak truth to power.<br/><br/>Enter a world of mudslinging, dirty tricks and the crooks and liars who manipulate the masses, juke the system and corrupt the true believers in order to throw out the tyrants, make the world a better place, and save us all from ourselves. A canny and calculating political operative, you are battling to take over a country in crisis. The old-line political parties are weak and divided, primed for being taken over from within or pushed out of the way. Your movement has captured the imagination of a small but loyal few and now it's your job to grow it into a national force. The goal is to put your handpicked candidate into high office, lead the country, and put your mark on history.<br/><br/>Democracy: Majority Rules is focused on the retail work of politics at every scale: making friends, forging alliances, outmaneuvering rivals, deceiving enemies, building consensus, selling your point of view, creating a coalition, hiding resentment, feigning weakness, blindsiding foes, and turning doubters into believers. It's all in the game.<br/><br/>While the game plays 3-5, there is a Party Expansion pack that adds extra components, super supporters worth five normal supporters, and enough materials for up to 15 people. Currently, the Party Expansion is available only on the Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>",

Some of the players are werewolves, many are plain, simple villagers, but many players have special abilities, such as being able to tell who is a werewolf and who isn't, and the Magician, who can save or kill any other player instantly. Each night the werewolves eat a villager. Each day, the village convenes and attempts to lynch one of their own, trying to find the werewolves that are secretly living among them.<br/><br/>The Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition package from Bezier Games makes this game easier to play than ever before, and supports up to 31 players! Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition includes a number of components to make your games faster, more intriguing, and more fun than ever before:<br/><br/>31 Sleeved Player Cards: These lavishly illustrated full-color cards contain the name of the role and a short description of that role's abilities. There's no confusion as to what each card is and what that role does. Each player card comes in a plastic sleeve with a sliding insert that covers the card face. There's no chance of accidentally flipped, dropped, or otherwise revealed cards.<br/><br/>Getting Started with Ultimate Werewolf Guide: This handy guide provides information and advice about everything related to setting up and moderating an Ultimate Werewolf game, from how to set up the chairs for the players to how to keep the game moving along.<br/><br/>Player Reference Cards: 30 full-size reference cards with a complete role listing and explanation on one side, and a detailed walk-through of the gameplay on the other.<br/><br/>Moderator Reference Cards: Reference cards for the Moderator with a detailed walk-through (including what to say at each step of the game) on one side, and role identity charts to fill out during the first night - never get confused over who is the hunter or any other role!<br/><br/>Role Suggestion Card: A handy reference card that suggests the right mix of werewolves, villagers, and special roles for players in any number from 7-31.<br/><br/>Name Card Tents: Included are 30 name card tents so all players can address each other by name; great for large groups, visitors, and team-building events.<br/><br/>The Amulet of Protection: One player secretly has an Amulet of Protection that will prevent him from dying one time. At night he may pass the Amulet to another player. Any role may have the Amulet, which is a smaller card that is inserted between the role card and the sliding insert.<br/><br/>Custom Cards: If you're an experienced player who likes to play with a certain role not included in the base set, you can select an additional role from a list, or even have custom cards made and enclosed with your order.<br/><br/>Unique custom roles found only in Ultimate Werewolf: Whitebox Edition: The Village Idiot, Wolf Cub, Aura Seer and Spellcaster.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Werewolf<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition<br/><br/><br/>",

The color of the dice dictates what resource it is and the number in which row &amp; column of your District Sheet you're able to draw it. When you complete full rows and columns, you'll unlock different Bonuses allowing for neat combos!<br/><br/>As soon as a player has completed 4 rows/columns or maxed out 3 Black Market resources it signals the end of the game, and game proceeds until everyone has been the first player an equal amount of times (if playing the traditional mode, the players will just play one final round).<br/><br/>Players will then score points for the Mission Cards, their row/column Bonuses and from the Black Market! The player with the most Victory Points wins the game!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1914 is a traditional hex and counter wargame that attempts to simulate the opening phases of WW I on the Western Front.  This was James Dunnigan&rsquo;s second game for Avalon Hill. Like many wargames combat is resolved through the use of dice and a Combat results table (CRT).<br/><br/>The players accumulate victory points by occupying 24 key areas at the game end as well as points for enemy units destroyed.  The Eastern Front with Russia is abstracted and the German player may receive victory points for deploying part of his initial forces there, and will lose points for invading Belgium, Luxembourg or Holland.  The player who most effectively wears down his opponent and holds geographical objectives will win the game.<br/><br/>This game is particularly complex in comparison to other Avalon Hill games at the time.  Not only does it have a 34 page rulebook, use unit facing, supply line limitations, and a CRT,  there are also multiple options for fog of war (counters turned upside down or dummy counters), and step losses for units.   There is a short and long version of the game as well as cards for several variants.  Several options such as simultaneous movement and delayed commands require a third player as a referee.  The long version of the game may take multiple sittings to accomplish.<br/><br/>While not an easy 'game' to play, 1914 is a rewarding simulation both innovative for its day and enjoyable to play. While this game is very different from other games from the period and has a couple of faintly tedious mechanics it is worth the effort and can be quite exciting to play. By today's standards we would like to see forced march and some command hurtles for the over extended Germans but one could say something similar about most old games.  This game does not allow players to ramp up a decided combat advantage from a god's eye point of view. No individual combat is decisive and one can only manage this not overcome it. The game needs to be played with all its bells and whistles (minus those requiring a referee) and when one bothers to do this they find an intriguing game of deception where planning pays off.<br/><br/>For those who do not have the revision kit:<br/><br/>Forced March:<br/>Each unit rolls on a D6 (as I recall this is limited to infantry and cavalry units)<br/>1,2 Cannot move at all.<br/>3-6 Gain 1 mp.<br/><br/>The Plan 17 rule requires the French to make 6 attacks on turns 1-3.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1. 390 Die Cut Counters in two sheet (note: 37 of the 390 are blank counters.)<br/>2. Color mounted map - 27&quot; x 22&quot; sections.<br/>3. One Basic Game instruction manual (4 pages).<br/>4. One Battle Manual (36 pages).<br/>5. One tablet of Mobilization sheets (37 sheets).<br/>6. &quot;Do Your Friend a Favor Card &amp; Registration Card&quot; Combo.<br/>7. Combat Results Table Card.<br/>8. Introductory Game Example Card.<br/>9. German Unit Counter Chart.<br/>10. Allied Unit Counter Chart.<br/>11. 20 Game Variation Cards (10 Allied &amp; 10 German).<br/>12.

        "description": "Trenton 1776 is the second game in the Campaigns of the American Revolution series. The first, New York 1776, covered the battles around the city. Following that campaign Washington was chased out of New York into New Jersey with the British storming across the Hudson in hot pursuit.  Trenton 1776 is that campaign. One where all seemed lost.  One described as the &quot;the times that tried men's souls.&quot;  One where Washington the hunted became the hunter in a miracle winter campaign across New Jersey.  One that saved the Revolution.<br/><br/>Can you do the same playing Washington or as British General Howe can  you cross the frozen Delaware, take Philadelphia and finish off your nemesis from New York?<br/><br/>Trenton 1776 has a campaign game that covers the entire campaign from  the chase of Washington across New Jersey, his refuge behind the Delaware river and the winter battles that reversed his fortunes.  Also included in the game are shorter scenarios; Christmas surprise: Trenton December 25/26 1776 and Bagging the Fox: Trenton and Princeton January 2/3 1777.<br/><br/>The game has an easy rules set, playtime of 2 hours or less, and the pleasure of using wooden blocks for units.  Wooden blocks provide a &ldquo;fog of war,&rdquo; and can be rotated during battles to keep track of losses easily.  Series rules are based on New York 1776 game system so game mechanics will be familiar to owners of that game, though both games play very differently.<br/><br/>",

They proceeded to award themselves fat contracts, paid for by the U.S. Congress, to construct their own railway.<br/><br/>In Credit Mobilier, four fictional railways race to construct track and move goods westward while the players invest in the railways and the Credit Mobilier.<br/><br/>User review: There are five railroads; each of a different color. Four of the railroads have fifteen shares of stock, a treasury card, ten railroad tracks, and several blocks. The fifth railroad, Credit Mobilier, only has the stock and treasury card. The game board represents the United States. One block is put on each of the cities randomly. Each player begins the game with three dollars and a share of Credit Mobilier stock. A start player is randomly chosen and the game begins.<br/><br/>In turn, each player will roll the five dice. The player will then choose to lay track (which adds to the Credit Mobilier treasury), move freight (which may add to the treasury of the railroad that owns the freight and traversed upon track), buy stock of one railroad (if available) for one dollar each, or pay dividends to the owners of the shares of one company.<br/><br/>A player&rsquo;s options are limited to which colors are rolled on the dice. Rolling orange is the only color that lets one pay dividends. Purple represents Credit Mobilier and it is also &lsquo;wild&rsquo; but it can only be used as a duplicate of any color rolled except orange.  <br/>Players take turns in clockwise order until there are blocks of two colors which have yet to be transported to the Pacific Coast wherein the game ends immediately. The player with the most cash on hand is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a number of units in his army, which is set depending on the faction they are playing. We call this combination of units a &ldquo;Combat Sword&quot;. Four factions are available for players:  Union of Terra, Centauri Brotherhood, Heimdall Industries and Ascaryan Infestation.<br/><br/>Game pieces represent the units of troops and vehicles in each army. Pieces have two sides, &quot;Front&quot; (Illustration and Health marker) and &quot;Back&quot; (Name, Attributes and Skills). Some units grant X &quot;Command Points&quot; at the beginning of each player turn, and all units require a number of &quot;Command Points&quot; to be used that turn (which is known as &ldquo;Activating &rdquo; the unit). When all command points are spent, the opponent&rsquo;s turn begins. Each unit, upon being activated, can move and act in any order. The possible actions are &ldquo;Move&rdquo;, &ldquo;Embark/disembark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Use active skills&rdquo;.<br/><br/>A typical game is a Sudden Death match, where the winner is the player that eliminates their opponent&rsquo;s ability to activate units. However, in addition to this a description of advanced rules and missions for more experienced players is given.<br/><br/>",

Travel to the Manor on the Forgotten Hill, where rumors says that a powerful Lich hides, cage its Soul, steal its Relics and face your friends in this fantastic game for 1-6 players!<br/><br/>The game has an unique way to play. The players start the game with 5 Magic Cards, and when the turn begins monsters will appear in front of each player, but instead of facing the player that is in front of them, monsters will chase the player they are pointing at!<br/>Then, players will have to choose secretly which monster or monsters they want to defeat, setting spells on the board face down, to prevent being chased when the magic Spells are cast. No one can see those Spells until the moment of revealing them, so if the monsters have changed between turns, the players will have to remember what they have prepared and if they need to prepare more Spells to defeat the Monsters.<br/>During the game you can find Relics, powerful items that you can hold to gain more power. You can also use Special Cards, changing the state of the game by adding Monsters, removing Monsters, changing Monsters or drawing more Spells.<br/>The game will end when a player defeats a Lich with one of its Special Relics (which have to be stolen from the Lich itself) or when a player gets 10 Souls (which are given by defeating monsters), whatever happens first. If there is a tie when winnng, the tied player which has its turn closest to the Starting Player Token wins.<br/><br/>In Animagicians we have three playing modes for all kind of players:<br/>- The all vs all mode, where each player wants to get all Souls before each other, facing the monsters, tricking the other players and casting a lot of magic Spells.<br/>- The Solo Player Mode, where a trio of brave magicians has entered the manor with 3 Soul Cages to encage the Soul of the Lich.<br/>- The Co-op Mode, a challenging adventure for 2 players, where those players have to accomplish several missions inside the manor in order to encage the Soul of the Lich.<br/><br/>You will also find ten unique Character Cards with its own backstory which explains why are they travelling to the manor, each of them with its own special powers (one locked and one unlocked) which makes each game different.<br/><br/>Do you still dare to face the Lich?<br/><br/><br/>The contents of the Core Box of Animagicians are:<br/><br/>1 Rulebook (both in English and Spanish)<br/><br/>149 Cards:<br/><br/>- 15 Characters (2 sides, one side in English and the other in Spanish)<br/>- 6 Glossary of Symbols (2 sides, one side in English and the other in Spanish)<br/>- 42 Spells<br/>- 20 Special Cards<br/>- 34 Monsters<br/>- 12 Relics<br/>- 4 Special Monsters (the Lich!)<br/>- 3 Special Relics<br/>- 2 Empty Rooms<br/>- 11 Missions (for the Solo Player Mode and the Co-op Mode)<br/><br/>1 Cardboard with:<br/><br/>- 3 Soul Cage Token (with Broken Soul Cage Tokens on the other side)<br/>- 25 Soul Tokens (2 sides, one side with a Level 1 Soul and the other with a Level 3 Soul)<br/>- 1 Starting Player Token<br/><br/>",

Her reign lasted between 811 BC &ndash; 808 BC. In this collaborative game you the players are Sammu-ramat, together with advisors surrounding the royal court and vassal states, you try to keep the Empire strong and protected against internal unrest, external threats, natural disasters and much more. All players win or lose together.<br/><br/>In this 1-5 player co-op board game, you will be one of the advisors surrounding the Assyrian royal court. Each Advisor has its own abilities and strengths. Players spend actions to play action cards and move from region to region along the paths printed on the board, trying to balance the needs of the regions (Military, Supplies, Health, and Religion). In battle with the enemy units are removed 1:1, i.e. combat is deterministic.<br/><br/>On each Empire card, there is a Scenario, with one or more win conditions. The specific setup of the Scenario is on the back of the Empire card. Multiple victory scenarios increase the game's replayability.<br/><br/>",

Each card shows one of six witnesses on its back and a witness viewing one of the five suspects on its front. On a turn, the active player reveals two cards in the grid. If they match, the player then turns over a third card. If all three cards show show the same suspect, the cards are collected and placed face-up next to the grid. In all other cases, that player turns the cards face-down once again, then flips over one of the ten timing cards, each showing Sherlock's nemesis Moriarty.<br/><br/>If all ten Moriarty cards are flipped, then the players lose the game. If, however, the players remove cards from the grid until only three remain, they have successfully identified the culprit &ndash; that is, the suspect who remains &ndash; and can claim victory.<br/><br/>A competitive variant is included in the rules which have players competing to collect witness cards. An additional variant rewards points to the player who holds (or doesn't hold) the suspect eventually identified as the culprit.<br/><br/>The Sherlock box also includes eight bonus cards, a new dinosaur and action cards for a fifth player for Ilopeli's Jurassik.<br/><br/>",

The last pawn leaving the tile has to take the tile from which it leaves. Sometimes players may or have to move the mummy or guards which provide some meaningful choices to the game.

        "description": "Nobura is a forgotten planet shrouded in mystery. The story told that a cosmic being sacrificed its divine essence to breathe life into its desolate lands. Etherstones shaped the planet's biomes and interconnected all living beings with nature.<br/>Yet, the lurking threat of the Vacuous, a parasitic force born from the depths of Nobura, poses a challenge to life on the surface, weaving a tale of divine sacrifice. Nobura has always been part of a paradoxical loop of life and death, where the forces of creation and destruction dance in an eternal cosmic struggle.<br/><br/>In Etherstone, players embody faction leaders uniting forces to avert the impending extinction, striving to gain the most victory points through various means, such as summoning cards, overcoming threats, and utilizing their abilities as effectively as possible.<br/><br/>The first stage of the game will be drafting your hand of 7 cards and your leader card, alternatively for the first few matches, players can take a pre-made hand of cards with the matching Leader.<br/><br/>Leaders have a set number of life points, a strength value, and a persistent asymmetric ability.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns starting with the first player and going clockwise.<br/><br/>There are three types of cards in the game: <br/><br/>     Followers: That can help you during the attack when facing a threat.<br/>     Rituals: Powerful spells <br/>     Technology: Artifacts that can modify your game strategy<br/><br/><br/>Cards might also have abilities that activate during dice drafts based on the drafted color or number.<br/><br/>During your turn, you can take only one action among the following:<br/><br/>1) Dice Draft: Etherstones contain concentrated Ether, and they can be spent by players to summon cards and activate powerful effects. Five different dice representing each of the Etherstones are rolled in the center of the table.<br/>Players can draft one die from the ones available on display to immediately get 2 etherstone tokens of that color and eventually activate any summoned card effects by taking into account the drafted color and face value of the dice.<br/><br/>2) Summon: Players summon one card from their hand by paying the relative Etherstone cost in tokens.<br/><br/>3) Attack: With this attack action, the player overcomes one Threat card from the center of the table. They begin the attack action with an attack value of 0. They must decide if they, as the Leader,  want to personally join the attack. If so, they add the strength value of their Leader card to their attack value, but they will also be vulnerable to taking damage from the Threat. Leader cards are never exhausted, so their card is kept upright even when used.<br/><br/>After this, they may exhaust any number of their Ready Followers to add the Follower&rsquo;s strength to their attack value. Exhausted Followers are turned to the side to show they may not be used in attack actions until rested.<br/><br/>4) Rest: Ready all your cards and skip the turn.<br/><br/>5) Void Pact: In case the Leader is defeated, players will skip the turn to revive their leader at full health and gain a void pact token that will be worth negative victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There is no winning strategy or play style.<br/><br/>Players will win by gaining victory points while doing several different actions and the game will end if any of the following three end-game conditions are met: <br/><br/>     The active player has cards left in their hand. <br/>     There are no cards left in the Threat deck. <br/>     The victory point pool has no more tokens in it.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This substance acts directly on gravity and space-time, affecting the laws of physics through its unique properties, and reshaping the rules that apply to the rest of the universe.<br/><br/>A few thousand years ago, a collision with an asteroid almost shattered the planet, which now holds together only thanks to the power of the Ether. Since this cataclysm, the planet's landscape has become a succession of inhospitable platforms gravitating to the rhythm of cosmic currents. Born of this collision, six natural satellites - Mauhea, Reces, Hivalia, Ertis, Meinas and Psolos - orbit Etherium in a chaotic ballet. These moons' erratic revolutions disrupt the rhythm of the seasons and strongly influence the development of life on Etherium. A calendar year sees the seasons pass in random order, making it difficult for life to develop.<br/><br/>Each of these moons is home to a people with very specific characteristics. These orbiting microcosms have developed a unique relationship with Etherium, which has significantly shaped their evolution.<br/><br/>Strongly linked, the natural satellites are connected to Etherium by gravity-defying etheric corridors, allowing the various people to move easily to the mother planet in the hope of harvesting the precious Ether.<br/><br/>All people need Ether to develop, but it exists in only one place on Etherium, within reach of all hands and at the center of all greed. Until now, the balance has been maintained, but as all people become more eager each passing season, everything is about to change.<br/><br/><br/>The 3D board of Etherium is made of cardboard &quot;boxes&quot;, easy to set up &amp; to store for each game. 6 tribes to mix &amp; play, with their own unique abilities.<br/><br/>Each turn, which represents a season, players will program their actions (7 seasons to play): development, attack or defense, resource optimization or mitigate luck, and even production.<br/><br/>Multiple victory conditions: earn victory points in many different ways through the game.<br/><br/><br/>     victory tokens in limited quantity to earn<br/>     special abilities to develop, units to upgrade<br/>     and of course, Ether you gather<br/><br/><br/>",

As representatives of the IWC, you will go on missions to research and protect endangered fauna. Each mission revolves around a specific animal, including the collection of data on related animals, in order to gain a better understanding of the behavior, habitat, and other important features of the animal being studied.<br/><br/>Animalia: Preventing Extinction is a co-operative card game in which you will attempt, on behalf of the IWC, to conduct research on endangered animals. As you do so, you will also raise funds that the IWC can use to protect animals and create global awareness of the animals&rsquo; plight. These goals can only be achieved if you communicate well and work together as a team.<br/><br/>Each round consists of a series of 8 turns for each player, called tricks. The first Animal card played in a trick determines that trick&rsquo;s color. The other players must follow suit by playing an Animal card of the same color, if possible. Whoever plays the highest-valued card in a trick&rsquo;s color wins that trick. That player moves the trick&rsquo;s cards to their personal trick pile, which is kept facedown beside them. When all tricks are played, each player with one or more Mission cards must fulfill their mission(s) by collecting (in their trick pile) all of the Animal cards listed on their Mission card(s). If even one of the missions has not been successfully completed, the players immediately lose the game. However, if all players&rsquo; Mission cards have been successfully completed, those Mission cards are set aside and the players continue on to the next round.<br/><br/>Animalia: Preventing Extinction also offers a campaign mode. The campaign game can be played in solo, two-player, and three-player mode. For setup, select how many and which continents you will play in a row. Any money earned will continue to the next continent. If you fail at any moment during the campaign, you have not succeeded in completing the campaign.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.<br/><br/>European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.<br/><br/>The map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player. Players have to deal with supply and a complex set of morale rules. Counters represent basic units, horses, naval units, leaders and a US dummy unit. Other counters indicate supply, unit effectiveness, fortifications, cities and various status counters.<br/><br/>Special rules for Yellow Fever ( 2000 U.S. soldiers died in combat conditions but over 11,000 died of disease), Limited Intelligence, Morale, Mexican Political Climate, Navy Gunboats, and Mexican Guerrillas.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 5 miles<br/>Units: Company to Regiments<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 21 x 33&quot; map<br/>One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 26-page Rules booklet<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Mikugames website:)<br/><br/>On November 30th, 1939 the Soviet Red Army crossed the Finnish border in attempt to conquer the whole country within a few weeks. Quite soon, it became evident that the Finns, despite totally outnumbered, were not an easy match. They were better equipped for the cold winter to come than the opponent. Ski capability was high and moving in deep forest was no problem. On the other hand, the Soviet troops were scared to death of the forest and stayed as close as possible to the few roads.<br/><br/>The Motti (Finnish term for &ldquo;encirclement&rdquo;) tactic became famous around the world and a great sympathy for the small country up in the north grew in many countries as the war went on. Soon, places like Suomussalmi, Tolvaj&auml;rvi, Kuhmo and Kollaa, to name a few, became famous for the heroic Finns fighting against overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>The situation was not good for Stalin and his communist regime. Allied intervention was very possible and the prestige over the greatest army to date, The Red Army, was shaking. He also knew that Hitler was studying the campaign very carefully, making notes for every weakness in the old and poor doctrine of the RKKA.<br/><br/>On March 13th, 1940, Finland had no other choice but to agree on the tough peace terms to follow. The Winter War had ended, but who won, or was it a stalemate? However, Finland kept its independence because the mighty neighbour in the east failed to take Helsinki among other vital objects, as planned.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>The first game of the trilogy to be released is the famous Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union, which is often referred to as an epic battle between David and Goliath. Historically the campaign lasted for 105 days, but will you as the Finnish side be able to last that long, or maybe longer? The game can last up to 16 turns (Dec. I '39 - Mar. IV '40), but in the 3rd volume (The Lapland War), there will be an extended option with a possible Allied Intervention. Vol.1 Winter War will include special features like Soviet Prestige and Finnish Morale.<br/><br/>The object for the Soviet side is to capture as many important cities and factories as possible, as well as destroy the Finnish Army in an attempt to make the Finnish Morale Status plunge, which means the onset of peace negotiations. But time is not on the Red Army's side, a slow advance lowers the Soviet prestige, which can cause a negative outcome.<br/><br/>Unit Counters<br/>The game will include eight countersheets in a total of 2.128 die-cut unit counters. Ground units are written in standard Nato symbols, while Air and Naval units have correct silhouettes.<br/><br/>The Mapboard<br/>The mapboard will be 100 cm x 140 cm (39&rdquo; x 55&rdquo;) in four pieces, depicting Finland and its' vicinity in a &quot;Winterized&quot; colour.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/>A 48-page coloured rule book includes basic, advanced and optional game rules.<br/><br/>Order of Battle (OOB)<br/>Two OOB&rsquo;s are included, one Finnish and one Soviet. Both in full colour. <br/>A lot of sources have been used to make them as historically correct as possible. Also, four Small Scenarios have been included: (1) Salla, (2) Kuhmo-Suomussalmi, (3) Ladoga Karelia, and (4) Karelian Isthmus. For added feeling, the OOB's are written in their native language (Soviet with Cyrillic) with usually the correct unit abbreviation and then translated into English in parenthesis.<br/><br/>Production Volume<br/>460 boxed copies were produced.<br/><br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>    Main Campaign<br/>    Extended Campaign (longer play and with Foreign Intervention)<br/>    4 Small Scenarios (#1 Kuusamo-Salla; #2 Kuhmo-Suomussalmi; #3 Ladoga Karelia; and #4 Karelian Isthmus)<br/><br/><br/>",

One pre-selected player (Villain) will defend the enemies, by taking actions for each enemy unit. Each scenario contains 3 epic boss battles which can last anywhere from 1.5 to 4 hours. Players can adjust the difficulty of a boss at any stage in the game, and players can join or leave a game as they see fit. Bosses' stats can be modified even mid-battle.

If a project's requirements are met the player places the completed project in his score pile. <br/>When hiring, a player takes an advanced filmmaker into his hand from the advance row by discarding another filmmaker of the same specialty. Advance filmmakers have multiple skills and special abilities.  <br/>Using the recast action, a player can draw a new card from his deck by discarding any one card from his hand.<br/>The four types of projects have different requirements. <br/>Movies need skills, based on their difficulty. Tv series need a defined number of skills while excluding some in particular. Commercials need specialties, not specific skills, whereas awards need exactly the skills shown on them and nothing more. Finally, there is also the trilogy in which all players can place filmmakers in secret during the course of the whole game and gain fame at the end according to the skills played.<br/><br/>After a project is completed it is replaced by a new one from the upcoming projects pile. When the pile is depleted, players play a last round before the era is completed. The game ends after four eras and the final scoring occurs.<br/><br/>It is a light to medium game, equally suited for families and gamers, and is recommended for players 12 years old and up. Two to four players can have the unique experience of managing a movie studio and each game lasts about forty minutes.<br/><br/>",

These are claimed by placing a castle and cathedral on the specified area of the map board.<br/><br/>Play commences with the Administrative Phase where players collect taxes based on the number of territories and cathedrals they control. Following is the Military phase that is divided into three optional steps. The first is to roll 2d6 for a random event that will cause the player to either gain or lose money, lose cards, lose castles or become the pope. The second option is to build new castles on your territories. The final is an attack on another person's territory.<br/><br/>Territories can attack adjacent territories or those on the same body of water. The attacking and defensive force are determined by the number of castles on each territory. For each castle on his/her territory, the attacker and defenders each roll a die and apply any modifiers obtained by cathedrals or cards in his/her possession. Results of 6 or over destroy a castle of the opposing side. If all of the defenders castles are lost, the attacker wins the territory, places a castle to claim it and may draw a card at the end of the phase.

Each play takes from 10-40 seconds, and quarters are played to 15 minutes of game time.  Rules for motion men, audibles, shotgun, hurry up, zone, double or triple coverage are all included.

Stipulate her with &quot;at finding dead cats.&quot; Earn points for coming up with the best and funniest stipulations to beat your friends in the game while stifling their superpowers, crushing their careers, limiting their lifetime supplies, and destroying their dreams.<br/><br/>Stipulations begins when a player draws a Stipulations card as well as a bonus card and chooses to announce the superpower, occupation, lifetime supply, or fulfilled dream. As soon as the announcement is made, each of the other players has 90 seconds to think up and write down a stipulation, or any condition that makes the announcement worse. For example, if a player announces that they have wings, one player might write &quot;but can't fly&quot;, whereas another player might write &quot;with a 50 foot wingspan that can never be retracted.&quot; All players hand their written stipulations to the player sitting next to the announcer who reads them aloud. The announcer selects which of the written stipulations is the worst (whichever they would want the least) and the player who wrote it collects the stipulations card to keep track of score. The announcer also reveals the bonus point category (Funniest, Most original, etc.) and awards the bonus card to whomever they deem worthy of it based on the written stipulations. The round is then complete and the next player begins as the announcer by drawing a card.<br/><br/>The game is complete when all players have been the announcer twice. Players should count the Stipulation and Bonus cards that they have earned through game play. The player with the most cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

You want to share the study of one celestial body with your colleague without monopolizing it, yet still gain more authority than them.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game contains three suits of cards: Sun, Moon, and Earth, with ten copies of each. Each player gets a hand of fourteen cards and cannot rearrange them. The lead player plays 1-3 cards of a single suit, and when choosing something to play, you can't break up pairs or triplets in your hand. If you have three Earth cards in a row, you can play them only together as three Earths. The following player must play the same suit, if possible, but a different number of cards; if they can't do this, they can play 1-3 cards from either other suit.<br/><br/>If both players play the same suit, the player who played more cards wins the trick, stacks the cards in their collection, then leads to the next trick. If players play different suits, then the player who has fewer cards of their played suit in their collection wins the trick. (In a tie, the following player wins.)<br/><br/>When a player runs out of cards, the round ends. Each player tallies their score.

        "description": "THE BLACK PRINCE features four battles from the Hundred Years War (Crecy, Poitiers, Navarette and Verneuil). Three of these battles include Edward, Prince of Wales, otherwise known as the &ldquo;Black Prince.&rdquo; These battles, Crecy, Poitiers, and Navarette are coupled with the later battle, Verneull, the &ldquo;Second Agincourt,&rdquo; to present four of the most important battles of the war. Each battle was not only a clash of arms but also a clash of military systems and weapons. The English longbow would be pitted against the French lance, with the crown of France in the balance.<br/><br/>THE BLACK PRINCE game system, designed by Rob Markham, is medium complexity and features rules on the longbow, heavy cavalry charges, commands and command control, ammunition, and demoralization. The system is quick to learn and quick to play, with games taking between 1/2 and 3 hours to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. (Glorious Adventures in Science Loosely Involving Generally Historical Times) is a set of miniatures rules for conducting skirmishes in the Victorian era. Bands of stouthearted Extras are led by Main Characters -- from the streets of London to the hills of South Africa and from the glorious charges of the Crimea to the maelstrom of the American Civil War. The rules are written with the works of Victorian science fiction authors in mind, such as Wells, Verne, and Haggard. In addition to standard colonial era actions, special rules are included for adding various science fiction elements to the plot, including, but not limited to, steam conveyances, fabulous inventions, glorious weapons, and strange creatures from the depths of the jungle or the core of the Earth.<br/><br/>In G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T., units generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters. A player normally controls one or two units. A player may also control one or two vehicles and their crews. G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. includes rules for creating Main Characters with somewhat more detail than the Extras. The games then are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.<br/><br/>Command and control is accomplished through a card-based turn system. Movement is based on moving individual figures. Firing is done by figure as well, but the firing procedure is very quick. Morale is accomplished through a unique, stateless system that treats loss of cohesion in an novel way.<br/><br/>Detailed charts are provided for creating personal weapons, heavy weapons, vehicles, and fantastic creatures. The concept used in G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. is that of imperfect mechanization -- machines don't always work as intended. This often adds a bit of excitement and humor to the games.<br/><br/>The authors of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules. Instead the rules allow for the generation of vehicles, weapons, and creatures that allow groups of players to tailor the rules to their perception of Victorian science fiction. As a result, the rules are flexible.<br/><br/>The system now includes The G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. Compendium which includes most of the expansion books.  It adds some new material and revises some of the old material.  It is 190 pages of G.A.S.L.I.G.H.T. information.<br/><br/>",

You and your teammates take on the roles of 4 different emergency room staff members of James Young Memorial Hospital, a failing medical center on the verge of being shut down by a government agency. You only have until the end of your shift to prove to them that the hospital deserves to stay open.<br/><br/>To accomplish this, players will need to coordinate care and prioritize which patients need to receive care first and which can wait until a later turn. Every round, patients will be added to the emergency room via ambulance or private vehicle with various conditions, needs, and risks. Patients with more critical conditions such as a heart attack or stroke have the risk of death, while others with more minor injuries, like an elbow sprain or knee pain may leave the ER against medical advice, if they don't receive treatment quick enough. Unexpected events such as an external disaster, code blue, and patients removing their IVs may also occur, causing more problems for the staff to deal with.<br/><br/>There are 3 ways to lose the game, and only one way to win. The players will lose if they are unable to place an incoming patient into one of 12 rooms, if 3 patients expire, or if they have not earned enough points from patient discharges to demonstrate to the agency that the hospital is worth staying open. Will you be able to make the tough decisions of patient care and save the hospital?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Europe 2163 AD: Automated transport systems, flying cars, unlimited energy, seamless information flow...<br/><br/>The growth of technology continues to disrupt, amaze, and influence society. The human race is fast approaching a huge catalytic technological disruption that will democratize knowledge and systems, potentially enabling people to live truly fulfilled lives. This is a point beyond which we cannot imagine how human civilization might actually look like because it is a moment of &quot;Singularity&quot; &mdash; but one group opposes this, an elite few who want to see a return to the dark ages of the early 2000s when they held all the power.<br/><br/>Only the Agency stands in their way. You take on the role of Agency operatives, dedicated to keeping people safe in the future and enabling them to live their lives freely, surrounded by a sense of ease in this complex, constantly changing new world. The key lies in a few High Potential Individuals (HPIs). They have the ability to create a new technology called the MindNet that will move the world closer to &quot;Singularity&quot;, but this also makes them targets. The Agency is responsible for ensuring the best possible outcome for society of the future by keeping these citizens safe.<br/><br/>Sarah's Vision is a story-driven, co-operative game of strategy and resource management set in a world beyond imagination in which powerful forces seek to undermine society and return us to the dark days of the early 21st century. Players take on the role of Agency operatives and have to work through a series of story-driven events. At the end of each round, the leading event triggers and danger builds on three special citizens unless the players can find a way to keep them safe. Players have to choose wisely which Agency HQ Tower resources to use and when to use them if they are to succeed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seven honorable and brave samurai, aided by a handful of frightened villagers, are the only defenders of the village. Will you help these villagers to fend off bandits, or will you command the thieves to steal all the rice you can and punish the insolent peasants?<br/><br/>Seven Swords is a game for two players in which one player controls seven samurai and the villagers to try to repel the attack of the evil villains while the other player controls the bandits who try to steal all the rice they can and destroy the village. The game lasts 18 turns, after which the player with the most victory points (VPs) wins. The samurai player begins the game with the VPs in the villagers' houses and rice stores, and the bandit player must attack peasant houses and steal rice to acquire these VPs. The bandit player can also earn extra points if he eliminates the samurai in combat.<br/><br/>Each turns consists of two phases. The bandit, who plays first, has seven cards in hand that symbolize the seven sectors of the village. He discards a card to give himself a number of actions that turn, and he might receive additional actions from the samurai player. With these actions, the bandit can play different bandit troops &ndash; including infantry, archers and cavalry &ndash; with which he can then move around the village and attack the samurai, villagers and rice storage. The samurai player then chooses between five chips &ndash; combat, movement, leadership and two special action chips &ndash; to see how many actions that he has that turn. A samurai can perform three types of actions &ndash; attack, move, and use the villagers to attack bandits &ndash; but only one time for each samurai until one of the special chips has removed the counters of such action. The more actions that the samurai player performs, the more actions the bandit has.<br/><br/>After a certain number of turns, the bandit player discards one of his action cards, then eliminates any samurai who is in the field of the discarded card. Other details in the game include bows that help players attack from a distance and fences that keep the bandits from just walking into the village. In addition to having a double-sided game board with different village layouts, the samurai player establishes the placement of villagers, fences, nows and rice storage at the start of each game, allowing for wide variability in gameplay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the 1960s, and soda pop has taken off as America's go-to drink. Instead of just getting the refreshing drink over the counter, the soda companies have bottled their sensational soft drink. These bottles are showing up in all of the major cities in grocery stores and vending machines. As the owner of a soda pop company, you need to make sure that your product captures the market it deserves in all of the major cities and that it knocks out the competition leaving just one top pop.<br/><br/>Top Pop is a card game in which players are placing city cards onto the table and stacking bottle caps (which represent the company's influence) onto the played cities on the table. At the start of a player's turn, if their bottle cap is on a higher stack than the other players on a city card, that player collects that city; if not, they continue to try to gain dominance on city cards where they can. Each city comes in two types: day and night. Day city cards are played face-up on the table for all to see. Night city cards are played face down and only the player who played the card and whoever it is in front of can see it. At the end of the game, players earn points for majority control in a city and sets of cities collected.<br/><br/>In the advanced version of the game, cities also have powers that are earned when a city is collected. A player continues to maintain their power until another player has collected the associated city, at which the power is then transferred.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But only one hero can take the glory.<br/><br/>Giant &ldquo;DUNGEON&rdquo; cards make up the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;board&rdquo;. Each card features a unique room in the adventure, complete with obstacles (or HAZARDS) that stand in a hero&rsquo;s way.<br/><br/>&ldquo;ITEM&rdquo; cards, along with each hero&rsquo;s innate ability, help players navigate from room to room. Whenever an unexplored part of the Dungeon is reached, a new Dungeon card is drawn from the deck and connected. Thus, the level builds as the heroes explore.<br/><br/>Hidden among the Dungeon cards are Boss Rooms, including the game&rsquo;s Final Boss. But ordinary Items won&rsquo;t be enough. A magic CRYSTAL, well protected by Mini-Bosses, are the only weakness of the game&rsquo;s ultimate villain. Heroes must first find a Mini-Boss, earn a Crystal and be the first to reach the Final Boss in order to win.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s all the fun of multi-player retro gaming without ever having to blow into a cartridge!<br/><br/>54 Item Cards<br/>26 Dungeon Cards<br/>1 Instructional Cards<br/>8 Character Tokens<br/>16 Crystal Shards<br/>1 Instructional Manual<br/><br/>Players: 2 - 8<br/>Ages: 10+<br/>Runtime: 15m - 1h<br/><br/>",

Sunflower Valley: A Tile-Laying Game, is a fast-paced drafting and tableau-building game in which 2-6 players settle their own mountain valleys.<br/><br/>Each player has a starting town card, a Valley Express train token that starts on this card, and a deck of twenty cards the same color as their starting town. Reveal three of the nine goal cards at random.<br/><br/>The game lasts three rounds, and each round plays out the same way: Draw a hand of seven cards from your deck. All players choose and reveal one card from their hand, then place this card orthogonally adjacent to another card in their valley. Pass the remaining cards in your hand to the player on your left. Repeat this process until you have placed six cards. Place the final card in hand on the bottom of your deck. If you connect railroad track to your starting town, then connect a town card to that track, move your Valley Express train token to the new town; keep moving this token for each new town added to your network this way.<br/><br/>After three rounds, you'll have 19 cards in your tableau, and you score points for these played cards:<br/><br/><br/>    Each lake is worth 1 point.<br/>    Sheep and sunflower fields are worth no points on their own, but they help you score other cards.<br/>    Farmers and towns score if they have the indicated number of sheep, field, lake, or mountain cards next to them; farmers count as fields themselves.<br/>    Mountains score based on the number of fields next to them.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to these points, score 3 points for each new town visited by your Valley Express train token. Score the goal cards as indicated; some award points only to the player who does the best of something, such as having the most sheep or the longest network of track and trains, whereas others award points &mdash; possibly several times &mdash; for everyone who does something.

The king's heart would break if his only little boy didn't win, so the other participants join forces to help the clumsy heir to the throne win.<br/><br/>A truly unique and funny cooperative card game in which the goal of the players is to have the prince's card at the front by the end of the game. It may seem simple, but you really have to pay attention to which player is playing which card. It is an excellent opportunity for children to learn the basics of algorithm construction.<br/><br/>During the game, we first place the participants of the running race in the specified places - princess, cook, knight, prince. Each player will receive a certain amount of program cards, which can be played to move characters in a certain direction. Caution! If we move with any character by running off the field from one of the sides, the game ends immediately and unfortunately we lost! This makes the game very exciting.<br/><br/>The game can also be played with difficulty - the played program cards must be turned face down so that only the last played card is visible. With this, the memory can also be woven into the game. The game also comes with additional cards that can be used to add extra characters to the running race.<br/><br/>The game can be won if the prince is first after the cards have been played, otherwise unfortunately the players have lost the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game detailing the Persian Gulf War fought in the early 1990's. Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.<br/><br/>Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.<br/><br/>Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.<br/><br/>The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!<br/><br/>Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.<br/><br/>Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.<br/><br/>All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.<br/><br/>A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.<br/><br/>",

Each piece represents either a squad, a heavy weapons section, a leader and his staff, a vehicle, or a cannon. The maps in are geomorphic, that is to say, they can be arranged in different ways to form different terrain.  Games in are played using historical scenarios.

        "description": "Just say no with this unique Nope Card Game by Ridley's Games. In this game you must try to keep your cards &ndash; this is the opposite to some other family games, so be careful! To begin the game, each player is dealt 7 cards and the remainder of the deck is placed in the centre to form the draw pile, then turn over the top card to start the discard pile.<br/> The player to the left of the dealer begins by looking at the card on top of the discard pile. The top card tells you how many cards you must discard through its colour and the number: e.g. if it has the number 1 on it, you must discard 1. Note that the numbers on the cards serve no other function in the game. The colour/colours on the top card determine which colour cards you must discard. Some cards will only have 1 colour, others will have 2.<br/> If you have the required cards place them down on the draw pile to end your turn. Remember &ndash; the card that you place on top will determine the next players go. If you cannot discard the required cards, pick one up from the draw pile (this is good) if you can then put down the cards, place them on the discard pile. If not, declare this to the group by saying &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo;. Your turn is now over. <br/>There are also wild cards which contain all four colours and can be used to complete any set. In addition the pack contains 3 actions cards: Reset cards which end your go and force the next player to put down any card, Invisible cards which mean the next player must play as normal but refer to the card directly underneath the invisible card, and Nominate cards which mean you can nominate another player by name and declare how man cards they must discard: 1, 2 or 3. <br/>This addictive colour-matching contest can be played with 2 or more players and is suitable for 6 years and above.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It goes long back before the history of the usurpation and the revenge between the rightful heir Deforge and the usurper Ken Rauhel. The age of the mighty Titans has ended. The human who are the most prosperous, the noble elves who protect nature, the strong orcs who worship power, the evil dark elves who are driven by vengeance, and the dwarves who are the skillful tradesmen - these five races compete to dominate the world. You will become one of them in this game. Although they want different things, their paths are already laid out by the fate. It is the way of becoming the strongest in this world of grave adventures, glorious victories, oaths of blood and evil treacheries; in order to leave your footsteps in this time of war and chaos.<br/><br/><br/>Lineage II : The Boardgame is based on a simple roll and move mechanism, played on a small hex map.

        "description": "At first the board is a field of ice with four squares in the middle cracked open to reveal a few fish.  You start your turn by picking up one more square of ice next to some water already open; this square will turn out to have more fish, or a polar bear, or to be hard ice instead of water and have a fox on it -- or instead it may confer a special power such as melting an extra square of ice or pushing a row of ice squares one space.  Meanwhile the players' Inuit meeples approach from the edge of the board to hunt the fish and the other animals to score points and to build igloos for territorial reasons.  The game ends when there's no more ice to be melted (all the squares next to open water have an Inuk or an igloo on them), prompting a final scoring based on which players have control of the remaining islands.<br/><br/>Even in the &quot;gamers' version&quot; (Inuit cannot enter a square with an opposing igloo, scoring is a little different at the end) noted by the authors, the tiles you draw determine, to a large extent, your luck in the game.  But your cleverness in scrambling to make the best of opportunities keeps Iglu Iglu interesting.<br/><br/>",

The game is played with a standard 52-card deck (or with multiple standard decks shuffled together with large numbers of players).<br/><br/>Each player takes an even share of the deck as their face-down pile. Players take turns laying a single card from the top of their pile. If a face card is played, the player after the player who laid the card has a number of chances to play another face card (J=1, Q=2, K=3, A=4). If they succeed play continues as usual; If they fail, the player who played the last face card claims the entire pile. If, at any time, certain &quot;sets&quot; appear in the pile (usually pairs and sandwiches, but not limited to triples, runs, etc) ANY player may SLAP the pile and claim all the cards.  Even a bystander may do this and jump into the game. The game ends when one player has all the cards.<br/><br/>",

Animals, of course, with the game including six types of animals on 1x1 tiles as well as a dozen animals on 1x2 and 2x1 tiles.<br/><br/>In each of the three rounds, you're going to use a worker-placement style system to acquire animals tiles, guest cubes, special action cards, door tokens, and more. Guests come in six colors: five of which match five of the animal colors (and these guests only want to see those types of animals), and a sixth color (white) that doesn't care what type of animal they see. Those are the guests you want most, but of course to acquire them, you must give up other things.<br/><br/>Many of the animal tiles have walls along one or more edge, and these tiles should be placed against other tiles with walls. During the round, you'll place the animal tiles that you've acquired on the board, with these tiles touching one of the four entrances around the perimeter of your zoo, and before the round ends, you'll &quot;lead&quot; the guests through your zoo, with the red cube stopping at the red (carnivorous) animal, the blue cube stopping at the blue animal, and so on.<br/><br/>You might need to snake your way around doors that block direct access to an animal, or you might have a door token that lets you cut through. When you don't have a matching guest for the next animal (or vice versa), the tour that day is done.<br/><br/>After three rounds, the game ends, with players possibly scoring extra points based on their final bonus card, such as the number of rows and columns in your zoo that are filled or the number of rows that have four or five different types of animals.<br/><br/>Solitaire rules are included with 5x5 Zoo.<br/><br/>",

Entertainers from all over the globe come to the city in hopes of becoming a star of the famous cabaret stages. Talent agents like you are there, too, looking for the best acts to sign to their agency.<br/><br/>In Cabaret, players are talent agents putting together performers for cabaret shows throughout Paris. The performers come from a variety of genres: singers, dancers, comedians, jugglers, musicians, and magicians.<br/><br/>In game terms, a hand of twelve cards is dealt to every player. The start player leads any card they like. The next player can play any card they want except that they CANNOT follow suit. Then the next player can't follow either suit, and so on until each player has played one card, with these cards comprising the &quot;trick&quot;. Whoever played the highest card wins the trick, taking all the played cards, adding them to their score pile, and starting a new trick by playing any card. A hand continues until each player has played all of their cards, then you score cards (each card has a value on it) that you've collected and the game continues for three hands. Between hands, you take all the cards, shuffle them up, and deal them out again.<br/><br/>",

When a battle does occur between two players, the other players must choose to either support the attacking or defending side of the battle.<br/><br/>Outmaneuver your opponents, cut off their support lines, and squeeze.

Not one piece of cheese is safe, and he risks becoming stuck in the mouse holes with his big belly. He really should have memorized by now which holes he can pass through after eating one, two, or more pieces of cheese! He also has to avoid the quick pet cat, Kiki, who always seems to be ready to pounce on the next mouse hole. Who can help Gary memorize the best way to the target mouse hole and collect the most pieces of cheese?<br/><br/>The bottom of the Gary Gouda box contains the game board, which resembles an apartment with 16 rooms arranged in a square and archways connecting each pair of rooms. Before the game begins, players slide archway tiles into the walls to adjust the heights of the various archways at random. The cat token is placed in front of any orange mouse hole to keep his eyes out for Gary.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player wants to move Gary from a corner of the house, pick up at least one pieces of cheese, and make it safely to the target corner without being seen by Kiki. To set up a player's turn, he draws four cheese slices, then places them in the rooms designated on the slices; he rolls the color die to determine where Gary starts and where he must move to. He is then free to move Gary through any archways possible &ndash; as long as he doesn't enter Kiki's sight &ndash; to reach one or more pieces of cheese. Gary eats this cheese immediately, with the player stacking Gary on the cheese slice to make the mouse fatter. If Gary ever gets stuck trying to fit through an archway, then the player's turn ends and any cheese on Gary is removed from the game; if a player reaches the corner, he claims any cheese eaten.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player can't place out four slices of cheese. Whoever has collected the most cheese wins!<br/><br/>",

If any player is on the &quot;wake up&quot; tile when all &quot;bad dream&quot; cards are removed, they escape and win the game; if all the characters are immobilized by chains or the event cards are exhausted without anyone waking up, then everyone is defeated.<br/><br/>In more detail, you and each other player take a character card and cover two of the six spaces on its &quot;chain gauge&quot;. The highest uncovered number on this gauge shows how many action points (AP) you have available on your turn, and each character has a unique skill, in addition to values for strength, wisdom, and luck. All characters start on the central tile, with the &quot;wake up&quot; tile being placed at the bottom of the room tile deck. On a turn, you use your AP to take actions from the following list, repeating actions as desired:<br/><br/><br/>    Add a new room tile to the playing area, matching doors and walls on all tiles; draw and resolve an event card, with a &quot;bad dream&quot; being placed on this card.<br/>    Move to an adjacent tile.<br/>    Search a &quot;secret spot&quot; on a tile, drawing an item card if you make a wisdom check.<br/>    Use a consumable (one-time) item card. (Equippable item cards can be used repeatedly and cost 0 AP.)<br/>    Give an item to another character on the same tile as you or on an adjacent tile.<br/>    Give chains to or take chains from another character on the same tile as you or on an adjacent tile.<br/>    Use your personal skill (if it has an AP cost).<br/><br/><br/>As chains are added to or removed from your character card, your AP count might change. If all six spaces on your chain gauge are covered, you're immobilized and can spend no AP on your turn. If a &quot;bad dream&quot; is placed in a room, no character can enter that room, although you might be able to remove it through various skills, items, or events; if a &quot;Bad dream&quot; ends up in your room, then you're trapped in that dream and cannot move until you or someone else can dissolve that dream.<br/><br/>After all players take their actions, the demon acts, initially with only one event card, but as the game progresses and shrieks are added to the table, more event cards are drawn for each demon turn.<br/><br/>If all the bad dreams have been vanquished and a player is on the &quot;wake up&quot; tile &mdash; which will be drawn only after sixteen room tiles in a game of normal difficulty &mdash; then you all win, with everyone awakening from the demon's clutches.

One commands the Sinai Front; the second commands the Eastern Front. Each player also commands the Arab forces facing the other player (his opponent.) The game is designed in this manner owing to the massive qualitative superiority of Israeli forces in this war. The assumption of the game is that an Israeli victory was generally inevitable, so the intent is to place the players in a situation in which they have to compete with each other on both sides to win the greatest possible victory on their own Front.<br/> The map is divided into two sectors, one for each Front. Only units of that Front may operate in that sector. There are additional units, called Reserves, which can possibly be assigned to either Front. The objective of each player is to score the most Victory Points in terms of seizing objectives and destroying enemy units at the lowest possible cost. Meanwhile, the player will be using the Arab forces facing the other player to delay or even stop that Front.<br/> The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) of Israel and the surrounding regions from the Golan Heights to the Suez canal (and all of the Sinai), and one counter-sheet (228 counters) representing all of the Israeli and Arab forces, color-coded to apportion them by their respect Front.<br/><br/><br/>Published with Modern War #4<br/><br/>",

Sailors collectively draw an object that recounts a rowdy adventure you all shared.

The Sunken Sailor wants to keep their identity from the other sailors and to try to piece together what everyone is drawing. Sailors win if they can figure out who the Sunken Sailor is.

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The set &quot;Im Osten&quot; contains historical events which are related to Asia. This relationship is not necessarily obvious. Like all Anno Domini the &quot;Im Osten&quot; edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

There is also one card from the 1968 season (Stage Door Johnny) that the company made and sent to faithful subscribers in the later 1970s.<br/><br/>APBA allows replay of famous races and construction of fantasy match-ups as well.  Like its APBA brethren, statistics for each horse are represented on cards, sometimes several for each horse (for different racing years).<br/><br/>The horses are historical and accurate in detail, though not in results.  If you play enough the horses begin to develop their own personalities and you stop worrying that Shecky Greene can beat Secretariat-- after a while you understand the cards and the way they are printed.<br/><br/>User modification makes this a better game-- limit the amount of lengths a horse can &quot;save&quot;-- give certain horses one mulligan per race, add real significance to jockey rating-- but be that as it may, this game is a geek fest-- results and stats can be retained for literally years.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/><br/>D-Day at Iwo Jima is a Solitaire wargame simulating the amphibious invasion of Iwo Jima. The five-week battle was some of the bloodiest fighting in the Pacific. In one of the costliest intelligence failures of the war, the planners had completely misjudged the situation that would face the Marines. The beaches had been described as excellent and the advance inland was expected to be easy. Instead, the Marines were faced with 15-foot-high slopes of soft black volcanic ash that brought the normally rapidly moving Marines down to a slow plod. In addition, the lack of a vigorous response led the Marines to believe that the bombardment had completely suppressed the defenses. However, Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten. Understanding that his forces were insufficient to defeat the massive American invasion force, he had decided to defend the island in-depth.<br/><br/>In D-Day at Iwo Jima, designer Joe Youst builds on John Butterfield&rsquo;s award winning solitaire game system. The player controls three US Marine divisions against a determined Japanese defense. The no-dice combat system highlights the unknown enemy deployments and coordination of the right weapon systems and tactics.<br/><br/>Players familiar with the previous three games in the system will be able to quickly set up and play this latest version. New features include a random fortification generation system that simulates the ability of the Japanese forces to &ldquo;re-fortify&rdquo; supposedly weakened positions and an updated infiltration system that encourages the player to maintain a continuous line.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>D-Day (19 February) &ndash; Covers the first day in six turns.<br/>Surabachi (20 to 24 February) &ndash; The 28th Marine Regiment&rsquo;s capture of Surabachi.<br/>Drive to the North (20 to 24 February) &ndash; The attack on Airfield One and advance by the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions.<br/>Hot Rocks (25 February to 4 March) &ndash; The attack to clear the Motoyama Plateau.<br/>Drive to the Sea (6 to 10 March) &ndash; The final attack on the plateau and the end of organized Japanese resistance.<br/>Sands of Iwo Jima Campaign (19 February to 11 March) &ndash; The campaign combines all aspects of the previous scenarios into one look at the entire campaign.<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/><br/>528 Die-cut counters<br/>One 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; Mounted Game Board<br/>One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; Set-Up Map<br/>Player Aid Cards<br/>Color Rules booklet<br/>Color Campaign Analysis<br/>55 Event cards<br/><br/>",

A letter and a number are randomly selected, then the players race to build a path with their tiles connecting the exit points with the chosen letter and number.<br/><br/>Cool, real time, Alex Randolph game that has been reimplemented both as a Sudoku (Sudoku Slide!) and as a Rubik (Rubik's Race) game.<br/><br/>",

Sometimes this is exactly what you must do!<br/><br/>Espresso Doppio contains three espresso cups, saucers, and spoons in three colors, and your goal during the game is to place them and move them on the placemat to match the combinations depicted on your task cards.<br/><br/>To set up, shuffle the deck of 16 task cards and give half to each player, each of whom reveals three cards face up. Players take turns placing items one at a time on the placemat, which has room for five settings on it. You can mix or match colors as you wish, but two of the same item (saucer, cup, spoon) can never be on the same setting. On a turn, you take 1-3 actions, with an action consisting of moving any one item from one setting to another or swapping items on one setting for items on another setting. After your actions, you score coffee beans for whatever task cards you can, with some cards scoring multiple times if the conditions are right.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has scored all eight cards, the players swap their decks of task cards, shuffle them, then reveal three task cards and continue playing. Once a player has scored eight cards in the second round of play, the game ends and whoever has collected the most coffee beans wins.<br/><br/>",

The game features a unique temporal mechanic; every time a player or the Fae Monster takes an action, time will move forward in the game and the connections between the rooms will shift via unique rotating corridor rings on the game board. Players have some agency in how to use their actions to affect how quickly (or slowly) time moves, but beware, if the players use up their allotted time and have not defeated the monster, they lose!<br/><br/>You will assume the role of one of six asymmetrically designed characters as you battle against one of the three different Fae Monsters, each with their own unique mechanics and loss conditions.  You&rsquo;ll make use of dice drafting, card play, resource management, and location actions as you move through the ever-shifting Manor in pursuit of the Fae Monster and his minions. You can also recruit additional companions to aid you and you will improve your character&rsquo;s abilities as you earn experience.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players will use their own deck of cards to take one primary action. Rooms they move to can offer additional actions and benefits. As well, players can make use of their own unique player and companion powers. These combinations can create varied and potentially powerful chains of actions on a player's turn.<br/><br/>However, after each player's turn the Fae Monster will act, using their own custom deck of cards. As the game progresses, the Fae Monster&rsquo;s strength will grow and things will become more dire for the players so they will have to work together to solve the challenges in front of them. The game offers deep tactical choice and a degree of unpredictability that will make traditional leader quarterbacking virtually impossible; the players will truly have to strategize as a group to succeed as the threat deepens!<br/><br/>And so, if the players can defeat the Fae Monster before time runs out - or before the Fae Monster completes his own unique victory condition, the players will win the game and have kept Weirdwood Manor safe for now... until he next threat arrives!<br/><br/>",

Which ostrich will win the race? Who will become the new wizard? The answers are not easy since it is an open secret that candidates are not limited just to making predictions...<br/><br/>In Banjooli Xeet, players become wizards who must predict the order of arrival of racing ostriches in order to gain points, while dodging obstacles, collecting berries, avoiding the dreaded lion, and not waking the sleeping crocodiles.<br/><br/>This second edition of Banjooli Xeet incorporates the Kanasu expansion, a single ostrich that sometimes joins the race, that cannot be scared, and that no one can gain points for if it wins. In addition, some minor rules were changed, rules for the lion tile were added, and some tiles from the first edition were replaced with new tiles that are intended to make the game faster and more fun.<br/><br/>",

After that, the player must set a new spot on just-drawn curve. To every spot can be attached maximum 3 curves.<br/>     The player who on his/her turn doesn't have a valid move, loses the game.<br/><br/><br/>In the image shown, the two black spots each have only two curves coming out of them, but nonetheless cannot be used because no curve can be drawn between them without crossing another already-drawn curve. Thus this game is over. The two black spots are called &quot;survivors&quot;, and the number of survivors is what can effectively be controlled in the game.<br/><br/>Sprouts is one of many combinatorial games analyzed in Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays as well as other math books on the subject of combinatorial games.<br/><br/>",

A once stable republic that spanned the land has been destroyed, and in its wake, some factions are vying to be new rulers while others just want to be left alone. Meanwhile, warped monsters and terrible Cabalists roam the earth pent on destruction. No matter what side you're on, the time has come to grab arms, prepare spells, and join the war for Indagar.<br/><br/>War for Indagar is a fast-paced, 4x strategy game that includes four distinct factions for 1-4 players, along with an engaging AI. Players select powerful heroes to represent their armies, choose unique strategies to tailor their gameplay, and use spells and abilities to gain control over the battlefield and &mdash; ultimately &mdash; the Spirit Well at its center.<br/><br/>After generating a dynamic board of face-down hexagon tiles, players take turns exploring the land, building outposts, gathering resources, and waging an intense battle against other players and the AI-driven monsters. Unlike many 4x games, War for Indagar puts combat at the center of the struggle, with heroes squaring off in epic combat and using abilities and spells unlocked as they gain experience. To participate in combat, players roll dice based on attack and defense characteristics; do enough damage and you send your opponent into retreat and gain the land they were defending.<br/><br/>Games of War for Indagar last for ten turns or until a player earns 10 primacy points. Primacy is earned by claiming land with new outposts, defeating the enemy champion, or mining the precious spirits from the well at the center of the battlefield. Points can be won and lost in this seesaw battle to dominate the land, so call your banners, summon your champions, and prepare for the war for Indagar!<br/><br/>",

Our judge never tries the same dish twice.<br/><br/>Each turn, the current player plays a recipe's ingredient face-down, and the opposing player tries to guess what was played. If the ingredient is not guessed correctly, then the player can place that ingredient in any of his recipes, otherwise, the opposing player can add any ingredient to the recipe of his choice.

Each pick has a power relating to the board or other picks which creates intense strategic choices. Guitarists attempt to get the most of their color picks onto each fret of the board by the time scoring is triggered. In addition to gaining popularity via area control, players have cards with real guitar chords on them which they attempt to score based on certain pick placements. Play resumes until the first four frets are full and the player with the highest total popularity score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At long last, a lost ship has sailed into your cove! Is your song strong enough to attract the sailors away from it? On the opposite side of the cliff, another siren is surely preparing to fill the evening with notes meant to allure our new guests, as well.<br/>Will that song overpower yours, or can you gather more sailors to your side of the cliffs?<br/><br/>Sirens is a quick and compact micro drafting game for 1 to 2 players, in which you&rsquo;ll draft cards over the course of 2 to 3 rounds to construct a song to lure sailors away from the nearby ship. The player who successfully attracts 2 of the 3 sailors with their music will win the game!<br/><br/>The game lasts for 2 or 3 rounds. Each round consists of 2 identical phases in which players draft cards, and then build a &ldquo;song&rdquo; with the cards that they kept. Each player&rsquo;s &ldquo;song score&rdquo; will be totaled on 4 conditions, and the winning song then takes a facedown card as a sailor. The first player with 2 sailors wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It opposed three German army corps (one Bavarian and two Prussian) and the small French garrison under General Douay at Wissembourg. Douay's division held the town and the heights of Geisberg until early afternoon before yielding to the mass.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>     the Battle of Spicheren (also known as the Battle of Forbach), on 5 August 1870, was the second of three critical French defeats. The third was The Battle of W&ouml;rth (also known as Fr&ouml;schwiller or Reichshoffen). The French II Corps under General Frossard had a good position, a fortified line between Spicheren and Forbach, and tried to block the Prussian troops under General Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz. Their retreat was ill-prepared and caused the rest of the Lorraine army to retreat to the walls of Metz.<br/><br/><br/>(sources : rulebook and description from the Publisher)<br/><br/>",

Through the strategic use of occupations, constructions of buildings, each player can collaborate or interfere with other players to the enlargement of their territories and sphere of influence.<br/><br/>Guild Stack is a game of speed and strategy, in which players are competing with all means to further their development. The buildings on the game ground are available for common use, using them for your purpose might have unintended consequences by profiting others. In some cases, other players can benefit even more from the buildings you made than yourself! The players have to work around this dilemma by developing their own strategy.<br/><br/>In Guild Stack players players start with 3 lands. Every turn you add a building to one of these lands. In a turn you can also acquire an occupation if one of your lands has no occupation on it and the required buildings are present. These occupations are mostly triggered by the building of certain buildings. You can do this yourself or react to your opponents. When triggered you can (among others) get points or more lands. There are also options to sabotage the buildings of other players. Combined with the triggering of the buildings this gives a lot of interaction in the game.<br/><br/>The game can end in 3 ways. The most common is for one of the players the reach the necessary score. What this score is depends on the number of players. The game also ends when three types of buildings run out or a player cannot place a building any more (because his lands are full).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Popular and intriguing military air, sea and ground forces tactics game TRI-TACTICS by Harry Gibson<br/><br/>History:<br/><br/>This board game was launched in 1935 by Gibsons aiming to provide an amalgamation of three other tactical board games:<br/><br/>- L'Attaque (1909) - the U.K. rights were acquired by Gibsons in 1925.<br/>- Dover Patrol (1911)<br/>- Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence (1925)<br/><br/>All of these Gibsons games, marketed at the time as Series: The Big Four (Gibsons), predate Stratego (1942) by Jumbo which shares many similar aspects of play, but is now much more well known.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The game is played on a special 12x12 board which illustrates land and sea spaces equally for each side, and each with two special squares, an HQ and a Lake containing a Naval Base. Two players, one RED, the other BLACK, command combined Navy, Airforce and Army forces, with a total of 112 prices, each player starting with 56, comprising the following:<br/><br/>Infantry<br/>5 Battalions - rank 1<br/>4 Brigades - rank 2<br/>3 Divisions - rank 3<br/>2 Army Corps - rank 4<br/>1 Army - rank 5<br/><br/>Artillery<br/>5 Anti-Aircraft gun - rank AA<br/>4 Field Artillery - rank FA<br/>3 Heavy Artillery - rank HA<br/><br/>Naval Force<br/>4 Destoryers  - rank 1<br/>3 Cruisers - rank 2<br/>2 Battleships - rank 3<br/>1 Aircraft Carrier - rank 4<br/>1 Submarine - rank SM<br/>4 Flying Boats - rank FB<br/><br/>Air Force<br/>4 Reconnaissance Planes - rank 1<br/>3 Bombers - rank 2<br/>2 Two-Seat Fighters - rank 3<br/><br/>Auxiliary<br/>8 Searchlights - rank SL<br/><br/>At the beginning of game, these 56 pieces are placed by a player to occupy the first 5 rows of one side (but not on the HQ or Lake), with the other player doing likewise with their 56 on the opposite side&rsquo;s 5 rows. This leaves two whole rows in the centre of the board empty, as well as the HQ, Lake, and 2 other squares between the two forces facing each other. All types and ranks of the pieces are hidden at the beginning of the game<br/><br/>The object of the game is to occupy the opponent&rsquo;s HQ with an Infantry piece, or the Lake with a Naval piece (not including the FB), which must approach via the river.<br/><br/>The players draw lots to decide who commences play, by moving one piece, and thereafter play alternates between the players, by moving one piece per turn.<br/><br/>All pieces can move one square at a time, forwards, backwards or sideways, with the exception of the Searchlight which can move multiple squares in a single direction (but only when attacking), as long as the squares are unoccupied.<br/><br/>To attack, a player must move a piece adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s piece and announce &lsquo;Attack&rsquo;. They may choose not to, in which case they state &lsquo;No Attack&rsquo;. In that case, the opponent cannot on their turn attack that adjacent piece without first moving another of his pieces.<br/><br/>The two adjacent pieces of each player are then revealed. The attacks are resolved by consulting the Value Table; as a general rule, the highest rank wins, but there are various combinations that apply, particularly when comparing land, sea and air pieces on land, sea or over a coastline. If successful, the attacker remains where they are, and the defender&rsquo;s square becomes empty as the defender&rsquo;s piece is removed. If the attacker loses, their piece is removed, and the defender&rsquo;s piece remains where it is. If the pieces are the same rank, both are removed.<br/><br/>It is allowed to place Land pieces on the sea and Naval pieces on the land, but with the risk that when attacked, any such piece found to be operating &lsquo;out of their element&rsquo; will immediately forfeit and removed. Excluded from this rule is the FB as well as all Air Force pieces and the Searchlights.<br/><br/>The River is a special area which is classified as Land or Sea depending on which piece is occupying it. When a Naval piece does so, the square is designated Sea, and when a Land price occupies it, then it is classified as Land. On the rest of the board, where land and sea meet, then the spaces are classified as Sea or Land depending on which is in the majority. The coastline in each case separates these defined areas of Land and Sea. Should there be an attack between a Ship and a Land piece over a coastline, the attacker is forfeit, except for HA and AA when the ordinary ruling applies. Also, Bombers and FB destroy Infantry and FA.<br/><br/>The HQ and Lake must not be occupied but a piece may be move over these squares in consecutive turns or else be forfeit.

        "description": "Yahtzee &ndash; aka Yacht, Kniffel, etc. &ndash; has been around for more than half a century, and over the past five decades the game has been transformed in all sorts of ways: letters replaced pips on the dice, players were asked to fill three columns instead of one, target cards were claimed then stolen, the dice were shrunk to the size of peas or enlarged to the size of abandoned warehouses on the west side of Manhattan. Yahtzee players have had showdowns and challenges, free-for-alls and knee-cappings, but never before have they experienced the rush of an extreme version of this long-lived dice game.<br/><br/>Come January 28, 2011, no one will ever be able to say those words again as on that date German publisher Schmidt Spiele will unleash Kniffel Extreme, a new version of the classic dice game that adds the awesome power of a ten-sided die &ndash; a red ten-sided die, mind you.<br/><br/>Now in addition to the familiar full houses and two pairs and long and short straights that players could previously score after up to three rolls of five dice, those players can score for three pairs, two triples, a great full house, a highway (being a straight of six dice), sums of 10 or less or 33 or more, and naturally Kniffel Extreme &ndash; a six-of-a-kind. In addition, each player starts the game with three chips; spend a chip, and you can push your luck a little further by rolling dice four times in a turn instead of only three. Extreme!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Chosin: X Corps Escapes the Trap&quot;, is a two-player, intermediate-complexity simulation of the fighting in eastern North Korea in late 1950 in which the Chinese attacked the United Nation&rsquo;s X Corps as it approached the Yalu River. One of the more famous incidents of the campaign was the US Marine Corps 1st Division fighting its way out of an envelopment at the Chosin Reservoir. Chosin, designed by Joseph Miranda, covers the entire campaign using the same game system as Gauntlet, which appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics 190. The two games are compatible, and the Strategic Scenario included in this issue provides instructions, as well as extra units, to create a combined Chosin/Gauntlet game of the entire Chinese offensive of 1950. Players can also use the Chosin rules and charts to update Gauntlet.<br/><br/>Each game turn equals one day. Each hex represents 2.5 miles (four kilometers). Units of maneuver are mostly UN regiments and brigades of 1,500 to 5,000 men, while each Communist divisional counter represents about 6,000 to 24,000 men. Each air UN unit represents 30 to 50 sorties. There are 280 NATO-style, small-size (half-inch) counters, including errata-fix replacements for Gauntlet.<br/><br/>Special rules cover: naval gunfire support, aerial combat operations, air transport, aerial supply, naval supply and troop transport, limited intelligence, bridge destruction and repair, fog of war, meeting engagements, organizational integrity, entrenchments, partisans, special forces, combat engineers, and the possibility of atomic warfare. The short scenario will take two experienced players about four to six hours to complete.<br/><br/>Chosin: X Corps Escapes the Trap was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #257  Jul/Aug 2009.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2.5 mile / 4 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page Chosin rules booklet<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-8 hours<br/><br/>",

It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each expansion increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.<br/><br/>All expansions can be played on its own.<br/><br/>The game contains 150 cards between Celtics and reinforcements for other GDM packs. Celtic Pact includes 6 pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + 33 cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + 40 cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings) and reinforcements to 150 new cards for GDM.<br/><br/>Each player  needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each installment increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Myths at War<br/><br/><br/>",

The Roman Empire has collapsed and a new power, the Byzantine Empire, has just begun its 1000 year history in Constantinople. The West clamors for goods from the East: Silk and Paper from China; Resins and Emeralds from Arabia; Wheat, Glass, Linen and Ivory from Egypt and Spices (pepper, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc), Dyes, Gums, Mordants and Incense from India.<br/><br/>Amber, Gold and Silver, along with many crafted manufactures, flow from and through the major trading cities of Constantinople and Istakhr to the people of the East.<br/><br/>As the head of a trading family, you wish to extend your influence and gain interest in the great Trading Families through the marriage of your children and grandchildren into those families. Great gifts are expected with each marriage, but you expect to gain from each new alliance with other families through your shared profits.<br/><br/>As new trade routes are established, profits are made and paid. The marriage price you pay to acquire an interest in another Trading Family should not be too low, or they will not have the financial resources to grow fruitfully. Paying too much is wasteful and diminishes your own personal fortune. We would wish you luck here, but there is no luck in this game.

There are no lives or rounds. It is based on a pass/fail system. Either all cards are in the correct order and you win or one (or more) cards are wrong and you lose.<br/>There is also a team mode where you will compete against another team trying to get more cards correct than them.<br/><br/>ito Rainbow comes with colorful gems and a timer to help assist with these new game modes.

        "description": "(from ATO website:)<br/><br/>Americans hear it on the news and wonder. July 12 in Ireland has become a day of pride and anger, lawsuits and fisticuffs. Called &ldquo;The Twelfth,&rdquo; it commemorates the Battle of the Boyne, 1690, when William of Orange (hence today&rsquo;s Protestant &ldquo;Orangemen&rdquo;) and his polyglot army ended the Jacobite hopes for James II to regain the throne and allow (at least) more religious freedom for Catholic Ireland.<br/><br/>In one sense, The Boyne might be considered the last battle of the English Civil War&mdash;a conflict that had spilled into both Scotland and Ireland along the way. And it might be considered one of the last battles of the Protestant Reformation, since much support on both sides had to do with which religion other countries wished to prevail, which is evident when you find that William&rsquo;s army included Danes, Dutch, English, Huguenots, Welsh and Protestant Irish. James&rsquo; army was mostly Catholic Irish but also included a brigade of crack French infantry and some of the best cavalry in Europe.<br/><br/>The Boyne also represents a key transition point in military technology&hellip;the last of the matchlocks and pikes and first of the flintlocks, a final time when cavalry caracole competed with pressing home a charge<br/><br/>So what&rsquo;s with &lsquo;Lillibulero&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s a song that was a popular tune before this time but became locked with the whole Irish campaign. Trust us, you have heard the tune. It used to be used by the BBC, various British army groups, and the movie Barry Lyndon, and has been featured in alternative lyrics versions for several wars since&mdash;including the ACW and WW2&mdash;and in Ulster folk tunes. It was &ldquo;said to have sung James II out of three kingdoms,&rdquo; and is still part of the Orange marches mentioned above.<br/><br/>What about the game? Philip Jelley&rsquo;s design brings us area movement for the broad area of eastern Ireland relevant to the battle, with units representing the various regiments, battalions, squadrons, and batteries that fought in the battle. Each turn represents roughly one hour of time, with weather, mist, and gunsmoke affecting command and control and unit activations. Scenarios are included for the full battle with historical deployments, the full battle with free-set-up, and for specific parts of the battle (for shorter playtime). Also included is a smaller battle &ldquo;delaying action&rdquo; that some people say is what James should have done, plus, there are optional rules for units who could have been involved or who had pressing reasons to NOT be involved (Even William might not be there!). You&rsquo;ll have plenty of chances to try various ways of heading off &ldquo;The Troubles&rdquo; of three centuries ago, or of pressing William&rsquo;s claims and making a truly &ldquo;United Kingdom.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Map - One full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet (plus a second half-sized map covering the battle of Aughrim)<br/>Counters - 176 full color 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>Rules length - 12 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>Complexity - Low<br/>Solitaire suitability - Low<br/>Playing time - Up to 3 hours<br/><br/>Design - Philip Jelley<br/>Development - Lembit Tohver<br/>Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>",

In Mercatores players take to role of the merchants and try to make the most profit of the new market. The wealthiest player wins the game.<br/><br/>Mercatores consists of two phases: invest phase and profit phase. In the invest phase, players take turns, which consists of two mandatory actions: First, player must trade with the market in the middle of the table by exchanging card in hand for two or three cards in the market. Second, player must play a card. Player can play cards in three different ways: play any number of a single good, play two cards of different goods or play a special card. After that player passes the turn to another player. When any player plays the thirteenth card in front of them, that player gets the captain card and other player can play one more round.<br/><br/>After that, the game goes into the profit phase. Players take turns selling their goods and using the special cards, like warehouses or ports. When all players resolve all their cards, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>The game will include at least two variants (and a second game board) to add more complexity.

        "description": "Designed, hilariously illustrated and captioned by Jamie Noble Frier,&nbsp;Hero Master: An Epic Game of Epic Fails&nbsp;is a humorous card game of dysfunctional dungeoneering. As one of Snoozehaven&rsquo;s worst adventurers you&rsquo;ll be squabbling over the right to be the Party Leader, avoiding the &ldquo;take-that&rdquo; of the bungling buffoons around you and trying to get enough gold to leave behind your failure-fraught-fellowship. You&rsquo;ll have to manage both your hand and your expectations... you guys really are terrible.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ve never really managed it as a hero. In fact, you&rsquo;ve been the undoing of many a quest. Half of the parties you&rsquo;ve adventured with ended up trapped in a cave-in you triggered, skewered by a trap you detonated or cooked by a monster you thought you could converse with. Somehow you have always ended up leaving unscathed, eager to join another party and change this streak of &lsquo;bad luck&rsquo;. It seems now though, just as a dragon has come to Snoozehaven and heroes look to band together, that your reputation has begun to precede you. As the numbers dwindle in the tavern and heroes sing their way to battle, you realise your hopes rest with the no-hopers sat around you. You&rsquo;re just pleased that you&rsquo;re probably going to be the party leader&hellip;<br/><br/>Hero Master: An Epic Game of Epic Fails&nbsp;is a parody dungeon crawler card game, with much deeper strategy than may first appear from it's comedic art style and playful humour.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game by drawing from race and class cards. Giving each player different special abilities, decks of cards, weapons and armour based on the mixture of the character they randomly generate. Each combination allows for a different synergy of humorous attacks and bungles that reflect a character&rsquo;s personality as they desperately strive to become respected as an adventurer.<br/><br/>Players will be trying to get the most gold by the end of the game. Maybe that way one of the &quot;real adventuring parties&quot; will take them on...<br/><br/>Along with gold, some monsters will drop valuable treasure which may give the heroes the edge over the painfully pathetic party members.<br/><br/>Players will find the key to the game is keeping hold of the title of Party Leader, but it won't be easy... These calamitous cretins can't stand to be told what to do!<br/><br/>With so much disruption and chaos, mistakes will be made, often at the risk of those nearby. Attacks are resolved using a D20, and bungles increase the chance of a critical fail. So be careful, as a party prone to accidents, you don't want to be standing too close when an axe swing is&nbsp; wildly off target!<br/><br/>In a game of fast flying dice, jockeying for first position and strategic card play, anything can happen. The heroes just need to stick together until they defeat the dragon, then they can go their separate ways.... Which hopefully won&rsquo;t be into the dragon&rsquo;s stomach.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each edge of a building card has a semi-circle on it showing half of a source symbol. Cards also have complete symbols for strength, faith, and food on them.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with two project cards &mdash; cards fueled by source tokens &mdash; and an empty 3&times;3 grid that shows semi-circular source symbols around the edges. The game lasts four rounds, and in each round you draft three cards. At the end of the second, third, and fourth rounds, all players compare their strengths in various horizontal or vertical rows on their grid.<br/><br/>In the first round, you draft three project cards, each with special effects that can be used if you fill all the source symbols on it. In each of the next three rounds, you draft and play three building cards. When you play a building card and complete one or more source symbols (by matching the colors on each half symbol), you receive a source token of that color for each completed symbol, which you must immediately place on a project.<br/><br/>After the third, sixth, and ninth building cards have been placed, you compare your strength in the row or column indicated on battle cards. (You have two such challenges after rounds six and nine.) The player with the most strength in the appropriate row or column receives 3 achievement points (AP), while the loser marks that row or column with a damage token. If a building card has damage in both its row and column, it's destroyed and removed from the game.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players feed their city, scoring based on the number of food symbols they have and the number of non-destroyed buildings. Players also score AP for faith symbols in their city.<br/><br/>Mū also contains rules for a solitaire game.<br/><br/>",

Race into the valley and fight with the other players over a herd of sheep. Play cards to stop the others from advancing or weaken them while you make yourself as strong as a shepherd can be.<br/><br/>Each player plays a card for himself and for another player face-down. Then the cards are turned face-up and the effects are resolved. The cards can either make a player stronger/faster or they can have several weakening effects. After that you move your figure towards the valley where the players fight over the sheep by comparing their modified fighting skills. The strongest ones take a sheep home, just to start another race towards the valley next turn until no sheep are left. The one who collected the most sheep wins.<br/><br/>",

Once a badger reaches an area, he must roll the die a number of times equal to the amount of meals presented, and for each roll turn over the correct tiles. If the player turns over the correct tiles, the player gets to keep the meal tile, which will have a number of points on the downside (the more meals the higher points, usually).<br/><br/>First player to the point goal wins the game.

But War is approaching. Built with the help of the Tokugawa clan during a brief time of allegiance, the 38,000 Tokugawa troops now march towards Ueda Castle on the way to the Battle of Sekigahara. Sanada with only 2,500 men holds them off long enough that their chance to contribute military might to the main battle is missed. This and many other outnumbered battle victories earn Sanada the title of Crimson Demon of War.<br/><br/>With 3 ways to win, your defeat will be a surprise to you every time. Quick and painless defeat will have you playing more than 1 game every time ROKUMON comes out. Can you see how the battle will play out?<br/><br/>Your limited actions make this a simple game to learn: Deploy troops of various strengths. Move them to cover the enemy or reinforce a position. Fight your rivals and reveal unit strength. Surprise your opponent with a bold - once per game move.<br/><br/>Play just one act, or play through all 6 acts following 100 years of Sanada history. Winning the most acts determines the winner of the game. However, each defeat grants you a one-time use attack bonus. If tied, play the last act again to determine who will be the new Shogun to lead Japan into an era of peace and prosperity.<br/><br/>",

Each mission provides the players a currency reward giving them more bidding power and bringing them closer to victory. Robots will need to work with and against one another to become the ultimate BetaBot worthy of entering Robotopia.<br/><br/>BetaBotz takes minimal time to learn but includes enough variation in content and strategy that no two games are the same. The simultaneous mission feature of BetaBotz allows all players to participate during missions. There is a high level of engagement and interaction between the players so that everyone can have a blast through the entirety of game play!<br/><br/>Players start BetaBotz with 40 bitz (currency) and use this starting pool to bid on a robot body with stats in four attributes (Agility, Firepower, Structure and Processor). Throughout the game players use their remaining bitz and any bit rewards received to bid against one another on components that increase their attributes or select single use &quot;Code Cards&quot; in an effort to complete missions. In addition to components increasing a robot's ability to complete missions, achieving a stat of 13 or more in an attribute activates a power associated with that attribute.<br/><br/>A complete game of BetaBotz is played over the course of ten missions. Mission cards of different tiers are selected based on the number of players. Missions require at least a specific value in one (or multiple) of the four attributes to complete. All players attempt to complete the current mission simultaneously and those that are successful receive a reward of bitz. Players are able to form teams to complete the current mission but they must split the mission rewards among the team. At the conclusion of the 10th mission the player with the highest individual attribute, the most gold components and code cards each receive an additional bitz reward. The player with the most bitz at the end of the game, including the bonus bitz, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

You colonize habitable planets, research technologies, and build a military with which to wage war. The civilization that colonizes the most planets emerges victorious and rules the galaxy.<br/><br/>Helios Expanse was inspired by a vision to develop a board game that provided a 4X play experience in under sixty minutes, and the play experience was crafted to be as satisfying for the traditional 4X gamer as it is for the casual gamer. This vision drove a specific set of design goals that would serve as the foundation for the game design. First and foremost, the game was created around the goal of being teachable in less than five minutes. This specific goal drove a streamlined decision tree resulting in simple, but tactical player choices turn to turn. An emphasis was placed on player interaction to preserve the game play tension typically associated with a 4X play experience. Ultimately, this combination of foundational design goals (along with a few others) led to an action/movement programming game mechanism that created just the right amount of tension turn-to-turn. At its core, Helios Expanse is a highly interactive game with simple, but tactical decisions and cohesive, working mechanisms.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publishers blurb: &quot;STORM OF STEEL is a complete simulation of World War One. The three maps cover Europe from the Pyrenees to the Urals, plus the Middle East. Fighting rages from St. Petersburg to Verdun to Baghdad and beyond. The maps can be combined for one grand game of the Great War, or they may be used separately for theater-level campaigns of the eastern front, the western front and the Middle East. The game rules use a modular approach, which allows players to employ the level of complexity they desire. Turns are quarterly, but players can use special campaign cards to provide additional move-fight impulses, recreating the intensive offensives of the war. There are scenarios for each year and each front of the war, as well as a grand game for the entire war. There is also a &quot;what if&quot; scenario for the war continuing into 1919.<br/><br/>Units represent land, naval and air forces. Ground forces are portrayed at corps level. Each corps is rated for the number of divisions it includes; so players can concentrate for the offensive or disperse for the defense. Corps include infantry, shock troops, mountain infantry and cavalry. There are also specialized armored car and tank brigades, as well as tank corps for 1919, plus the planned-for American airborne division. Each country has its own unique order of battle so, for example, the Austro-Hungarians have mountain corps, and there are also additional units representing Bolshevik and independent nationalist forces.<br/><br/>Naval units are at the squadron level for capital ships, and flotillas for cruisers and destroyers. There is also a complete submarine warfare module for attacks on merchant shipping. Air warfare is represented by strategic and tactical wings. A unique feature of the game is players can improve their aerial warfare capabilities by increasing their air doctrine level. As air doctrine improves, players can employ interception, aerial supply and aircraft carrier operations. On the subversive side, players can utilize agents to conduct propaganda and sabotage operations to undermine their foes from within.<br/><br/>Land combat uses three different combat results tables to model different tactics. Tank and shock troop units can use the much more effective Infiltration CRT. Naval combat requires opposing fleets to first acquire each other, then engage in gunnery. Lighter fleet units become invaluable for recon and screening, while battleships and battlecruiser squadrons close in for the kill. In the air, players can execute a variety of missions, including air superiority and bombardment.<br/><br/>An industrial production module gives players the capability to produce different types of forces. Production is tied to morale, and winning great battles will enhance your side's output while a disastrous defeat may lead to strikes on the home front. Storm of Steel uses a card system to generate major operations. Campaign cards give players additional move-fight impulses, combat bonuses and extra reinforcements. Players have to carefully choose which campaigns they will implement because some cards, such as the Schlieffen Plan, will provide for more maneuver, while others, such as Verdun, will enhance combat. There are also cards that will grant tactical innovations such as chemical warfare and armored doctrine, as well as bringing into play leaders such as Hindenburg, Brusilov and Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Often misquoted as &quot;the monster game of modern warfare&quot;, NATO Division Commander is a much-maligned SPI WWIII title that, because of being widely misunderstood, is often more studied than played.<br/><br/>Described in the rules as a &quot;battalion level simulation of conflict in contemporary Europe&quot;, NATO Division Commander gradually introduces players to the most complex version of mechanics through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty, the easiest of which is simple, fun, can be expanded, and should not be avoided.  When completely addressed, the game is a War College-level education on the conduct of World War III operations at Division/Brigade level between NATO and Soviet forces. The game system builds on the combat-as-part-of-movement late-SPI systems such as Next War and Fifth Corps, and has as one of its basic premises the idea that unit strength is subordinate to tactical and command considerations.<br/><br/>Central to its uniqueness, NATO Division Commander contains two identical mapboards and rules for Controller play, producing a refereed, double-blind, fog-of-war effect which is still unique today, more than 30 years after publication.  The game includes solitaire and face-to-face rules to help controllers build up their knowledge of the game, and decide what they will include, and what slows the game down too much for their taste: thus allowing the game experience to be controlled for the players' experience and expectations. It also allows testing of scenarios before controller use.<br/><br/>Scenarios are comprehensive and infinitely flexible, which makes demands of controllers, and offer a unique playing experience for those peering down the gun barrel.<br/><br/>With 1200 counters, rule books, and a pile of playing aids, NATO Division Commander still is, the one true smorgasbord of World War III land-based operational simulations.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the player lays two tiles and then draws replacements from the bag. Tiles are double-sided (where each side is the mirror image of the other), so tiles can be flipped as well as rotated. <br/>The idea of the game is to score points by completing snakes. The longer the snake, the more points you score (and you can score double points by completing two snakes with one move). Because any tiles played must match existing tiles on the table, it is possible to block opponent's plays as well as setting oneself up for a big score. There is a constant anxiety over whether to complete a snake to secure the points, or extend it in the hope of landing a bigger score later on.<br/><br/>",

We have replaced the hex-maps typical of World War II games with three beautiful, yet abstracted maps, representing the Pacific Theater and allowing for endless battlefield customization.<br/><br/>A simple solitaire system recreates small firefights (five to ten units per side) over a bevy of scenarios, including beach assaults, riverbank defense, random jungle patrols, raids on AA Gun emplacements and radio stations, and a campaign linking the missions together. Blind chit draws and die rolls, combined with artfully crafted charts create an impressive &ldquo;artificial intelligence,&rdquo; imbuing the game with true fog of war.<br/><br/>A fast paced and exciting solitaire World War II game, Rifles in the Pacific offers electrifying tactical challenges in a tiny package.<br/><br/>Rifles in the Pacific includes:<br/><br/>A full sheet of beautiful, 1&quot;-square die-cut counters<br/>    3 Abstracted maps representing jungles, beaches<br/>    Four Armies: USMC, Japanese SNLF and IJA, Commonwealth <br/>    Eight Action-Packed Missions and a campaign that uses them<br/><br/>The game components are fully compatible with Rifles in the Ardennes.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this mini-series tie-in card game, 3-7 players in the basic game and 3-8 players in the advanced game try to score points by collecting cards not unlike in traditional card games. The artwork features characters from the movie &quot;Shogun&quot;, and the game can be played in a simple (beginner) or an advanced version, which makes use of all the cards.<br/><br/>There are two &quot;colors&quot; of cards, peasants and samurai, which are organized into several subclasses like Farmer, Servant, Samurai Wife, or Hatamoto, which all have different point values. Basically, you try to score points by getting either a complete hand of one color (but no doubles), or several cards of the same type. Furthermore, there are wild cards like the Priest, the Emperor, the Heir and of course the Shogun which all have special values in certain combinations. Several other cards like a joker (the &quot;Buddha&quot;) or an elimination card (the &quot;Ninja&quot;) are also part of the deck. Unlike many other card games, you don't hold the cards in your hand; four of your five cards are displayed face up in front of you, while the fifth lies face down to be kept secret till the end of the turn. This makes bluffing as important a factor as luck and strategy in this game.<br/><br/>But that's not all. Right before the end (and before revealing their face-down card), players can choose a final strategy, represented by small strategy markers. &quot;Passive&quot; means you get the points your hand is worth (if any), while &quot;Power Play&quot; can double your score (or even turn a zero point hand into 20 points), but only if either you're the only one to play &quot;Power Play&quot;, or if you're the player with the highest score this round. For every other &quot;Power Player&quot; there's a hefty point penalty.<br/><br/>There are even more special cards that I won't go into detail about (such as the &quot;Spy&quot; or the &quot;Hostage&quot;), as well as an intricate turn sequence that allows players to play their cards almost simultaneously. Also, the deck is only reshuffled when all the cards have been used up, which may take a few rounds and will make sure that certain powerful cards only show up ever so often, and not always in the right order to be played.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy part of this game is it's unique atmosphere. The rules successfully impose a courteous oriental gameplay where cards aren't simply dealt, but offered, and where Favors can be used to influence a hand. At the same time, there's always the shadow of the Ninja looming over the table, and even though it rarely strikes, it can re-arrange the whole score sheet.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has reached 500 points (or 1,000 points for &quot;epic games&quot;). A regular game lasts about 45 minutes.<br/><br/>",

Each round, players play cards in clockwise order in turns to give them the right to a &quot;cut&quot; of the current deal, the value of which depends on the cards played. When a player has passed twice, he can no longer influence that round. After everyone has passed twice, the round ends, and points are totalled to calculate the value of that deal. Players then earn money for each &quot;cut&quot; or piece of the action that they have, which represents their share of that deal. While playing cards, players can negotiate in order to encourage other players to make plays that are favorable to them.<br/><br/>After a fixed number of such deals (rounds), the game ends, and the player who has the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "My Favorite Carrera RS is a &quot;must not follow&quot; trick-taking card game for 3-5 players based on the Japanese manga 彼女のカレラ, a.k.a. My Favorite Carrera. The game has six suits of cards ranked 1-5, with two differently suited versions of the 4-ranked card. Each rank is its own suit, e.g., all 1s are yellow, all 2s are blue, etc.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a game, each player has six cards and five fuel chips. The lead player of a trick plays a card from their hand, then in turn order, the following players each play a card of their choice to the trick with the caveat that no two cards can be of the same suit. The rank on a played card represents the speed of the player's race car. When playing a card, the player can place any number of fuel chips from their reserve on the card to increase its rank by 1 per chip. The player whose card rank is the highest wins the trick and receives a momentum token, then leads the next trick. Momentum tokens can be thought of as permanent fuel chips; when a player plays a card to a trick after having won any momentum token(s), their card rank will automatically be +1 per momentum token they have in their possession.<br/><br/>When a player cannot play a card of a unique suit to a trick, they play a card of choice face down. Note that a player can also choose to play a card face down even if they could play a unique suit. This card's rank is 0, and momentum tokens and fuel chips have no effect. After determining the trick winner, all players who have played face down refill their fuel chips, splitting all of the fuel chips played on previous tricks as evenly as possible. If a player now has more than five fuel chips, they discard the excess from the game. (Any chips that could not be divided evenly are also discarded from the game.)<br/><br/>The final trick of a round is the most important trick as that round's winner receives a trophy token, then a new round begins, with all players discarding their momentum tokens and keeping their fuel tokens; all fuel chips in the market remain there. Whoever won the final trick of the previous round is the first lead player. The game continues until one player earns a second trophy token and wins.<br/><br/>Twists: Small card powers.<br/><br/>-Cards ranked 1 will turn rank 4 or 5 cards to 0 when assessing the trick. However, any momentum tokens and fuel chips on the affected cards still increase their rank by the normal +1 per.<br/><br/>-Cards ranked 2 will allow a player to immediately take a single fuel chip from the market upon playing the card. The player may even immediately use this fuel chip to increase the rank of their card, however, if this chip would exceed their fuel chip limit of five they must discard the chip from the game.<br/><br/>",

Play a negatively charged card and your turn ends and your opponent can start playing their cards.  Basically, it helps provide a little &quot;momentum&quot; incentive, and adds strategy.<br/><br/>Creating combos that allow you to keep The Flow while you prepare for a killer blow, while making sure that the crowd is entertained... that's the key to victory!  If you don't entertain the crowd, your opponent can use their own popularity with the crowd to turn The Flow against you... so show off and impress that crowd!<br/><br/>",

Abandoned workers huddle together in makeshift settlements, struggling to survive in a world of scarce resources and lawlessness. Native nomads and bizarre creatures resurface to take back the wasteland. Factions and adventurers rise and fall, but only the greatest will be remembered in legend.<br/><br/>Forsaken is an immersive sandbox adventure game where you take the role of a character looking to leave their mark in the harshest of worlds. Every character has a personalized branching story, with every path uniquely-tailored to the choices you make along the way. How will you change the face of Thyrria, and how will Thyrria change you?<br/><br/>Your goal is to secure your place as a legend in any way you can, but there are many ways to become a legend. Navigating through personal and public story objectives, doing odd jobs, hunting down bounties, fulfilling prophecies, and even gambling at the Cantina can all advance your legend tracker. Finding the right opportunities to upgrade your gear, weapons, and skills can help you along the way. Once a player reaches the end of the track, the player with the greatest legend wins.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you may trigger an event or encounter, which allows you an opportunity to permanently change the game and the emergent story based on the decisions you make. These changes can determine your character&rsquo;s motives and goals personally, or guide the shared stories to impact the world itself. The more you change about the world, the bigger the mark you make and the greater your legend will be.<br/><br/>",

Taking the &quot;virtual board game&quot; concept to the bleeding edge; instead of forcing overpriced lead miniatures on players Wormhole offers a complete fleet of high quality 3-D models that you print and build from your home printer. This feature alone gives players the opportunity to build massive fleets without breaking the bank.<br/><br/>Wormhole promises &quot;cinematic&quot; space combat with visual style and presentation not yet seen in the genre. Rules are easy to understand but offer a scaling level of depth for a variety of play styles. Wormhole also introduces an interactive damage and orders system which removes heavy book-keeping tasks and replaces it with a &quot;control panel-like&quot; interface (you feel absolutely in control, barking orders to your fleet). A number of unique gaming elements conspire to make Wormhole a truly immersive and completely original gaming experience.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.worldworksgames.com/wormhole.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.worldworksgames.com/wormhole.html</a><br/><br/>",

With more players, the pieces are divided as required, but there must be an equal number of cops to robbers - thus with odd numbers of players, one player should play two pieces.<br/><br/>The object for the robbers is to steal objects and get them safely to their hideout - for the cops it is to catch a robber red-handed, and recover the goods. When all ten goods are either stolen (and hidden away) or recovered by the police, the winner is the player who has stolen/recovered the most.<br/><br/>A fairly straightforward roll and move game, but the pieces and quality of build makes this a better than normal game of this type. Nice molded and painted player pieces depict robbers with swag bag over their shoulder (into which can actually be placed the item being stolen), and the traditional British Bobbie with his truncheon.<br/><br/>",

The rest of the players secretly look at their scholar card.<br/>The player to his left takes a dictionary card, chooses and reads aloud one of the words and reads the corresponding definition to himself. (The cards have two positions to add more diversity, only one is used at a time). Then he passes the card to the next player and so on until all but the BAD HUGE have read it.<br/>Each scholar must choose a category, the BRIGHT player must choose the one indicated by the definition card and the ESPOS any of the others.<br/>Then, in turn order, they must say a definition of the word according to the category they have chosen. Leave a minute so that everyone can think of one, because the ESPOS will have to invent it and the BRILLIANT, if there is one, will have to memorize the correct one to say it when his turn comes.<br/>If it's your turn to be ORATE, come up with a credible definition, remember that your goal is to trick the starting player into choosing yours and thus score points.<br/>When the players have presented their definitions, the SAPIENTE will have to choose the one they think is correct or declare that they are all crazy and none of them are real.<br/><br/>     If the SAPIENTE gets it right, the word card will be kept as a prize.<br/>     If he fails, the player whose definition he has chosen keeps the card.<br/>     If it fails and had indicated that everyone is crazy, the card is left under the deck.<br/><br/><br/>Return the category tokens to the center of the table and give all the cards to the new BUDDY, who will be the player to the left of the current one. Keep playing until you've all passed through this post. If you want longer games, you can agree to do more than one round.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The player who has won the most cards wins the game and signs the first edition of the TESAURO as Supreme Director.<br/>In the event of a tie, play an extra turn with each of the tied players as the starting players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dojo, each player runs a dojo and tries to attract the most promising disciples.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds using a deck of cards, with each card showing a particular type of disciple: monkey, fox, tiger, crane, bear or raccoon (which functions as a joker). Each disciple also has a skill level, shown by a belt: white, yellow, green, blue or black.<br/><br/>During each round, one player is the dealer. Each round consists of three phases: Recruitment, Challenge and Training.<br/><br/>During the recruitment phase, the dealer draws a card, looks at it, and gives it face-down to a player. He repeats this process until each player has been dealt a card.<br/><br/>During the challenge phase, the dealer may be challenged. The player to his left gets the first chance to challenge. If he does not challenge, the next player gets a chance, etcetera, until the dealer is challenged or all players have declined the opportunity to challenge.<br/><br/>If there is a challenge, both players involved (the dealer and the challenger) show their card. The card with the highest value belt wins the challenge (with ties going to the challenger). The winner gains a trophy and may exchange his card with the loser&rsquo;s card, if he so desires.<br/><br/>During the training phase, each player adds his card to his dojo. During the first round, the card is simply placed on the table; during later rounds, new cards must be added adjacent to an earlier card. The end result should be a 3x4 grid. A player who has won a trophy must place that trophy next to a column or row.<br/><br/>After twelve rounds, the game ends, and players score points. For each row, players score points for the biggest group of cards of the same type. For each column, players score points if each card shows the same colour belt. Trophies modify the scoring of a row or column.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Of Dungeons Deep (Second Edition) is a vastly expanded version of the original game. It now play 1-4 players and consists of numerous Heroes and Henchmen to choose from to delve in the dungeon below. Here are some game highlights.<br/><br/>1)Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.<br/><br/>2)Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.<br/><br/>3)Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!<br/><br/>4)No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long. This makes Of Dungeons Deep! one of the fastest dungeon delvers out there.<br/><br/>",

If you collect four hit cards, you win.<br/>&bull; Loot beats Whiskey, with the winner claiming the current saloon card.

Attu, at the far western end of the Aleutian Archipelago, was American soil. In May 1943, American forces landed on Attu to liberate it. They were unprepared for the tenacity of the Japanese defenders and the brutality of the environmental conditions.

The design focuses on the challenges faced by the American forces in the form of extremely variable weather conditions and logistical hurdles posed by nearly insurmountable terrain. The Japanese must use these conditions to their advantage in order to survive the overwhelming American numbers.<br/><br/>In addition to the campaign game covering the entire battle, War in the Wind also includes three smaller scenarios focusing on separate phases of the battle.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 400 yards / 366 meters<br/>Units: Platoon to Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (324 9/16&quot; counters - includes 42 blanks)<br/>One 20-page War in the Wind rules booklet<br/>Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards<br/>Three 10-sided dice<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-10 Hours<br/><br/>",

Now is your opportunity to face off Poseidon against Ishtar! Thor against Cthulhu! Morrigan against Yog-Sothoth! You have one goal and one goal only: annihilate your foes' believers and seize absolute power.<br/><br/>Achieve this task by staking the souls of your followers, using the same bluff, psychology, and tactics that have made Texas Hold 'em Poker the world's premier card game. Once you seize victory, you can rest, and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of the gods. You have won Theomachy.<br/><br/>The game is quick to play &ndash; typically less than 45 minutes. First, choose your god. Then, drafting cards into your personal deck lets you slowly build your might. Ante up your followers, and stake them against your foes' minions. You can call, raise, or fold, in similar fashion to high-stakes Poker games (and what stake is higher than your own worshipers' souls?)<br/><br/>Your spells are powered by a Constellation, which is laid down in the middle of the table as a Texas Hold'em Poker style flop, river, and turn. Just as in Hold 'em, some Constellation configurations provide you with great combinations for your secret hand of cards, some are disastrous, while most are middling to fair.<br/><br/>Using miracles, spells, and powerful artifacts, powered by the Constellation, send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every hand: do you put your power on the line to help your believers, or do you turn your back to cut your losses, abandoning them to certain death? If neither you nor your opponents yield, the showdown takes place - hurricanes are opposed by deathly plagues, tempests extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful shrink every second.<br/><br/>Use your god&rsquo;s power to create miracles and activate myth cards for your heroes, temples, and godly artifacts. For example, the Norse pantheon has access to the Fenris wolf, Thor's hammer, and more. Babylon has Lilith, Ur, the tower of Babel, and more.

        "description": "&ldquo;Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine.&rdquo; <br/>― Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe<br/><br/>Three centuries ago, a singular story perfectly captured the drama of shipwreck and survival, hope and redemption. That story was Robinson Crusoe. Now this timeless tale is brought to life once more in a dynamic card game, but this time you are the one who needs to survive and make it off the island.    <br/>This ancient tale it&rsquo;s alive again!<br/><br/>In 1651 a young man leaves home for an adventure at sea. He is shipwrecked on an island, 40 miles out to sea. He spends the next 28 years on this island, gathering food, resources, and tools, and battling against insurmountable odds to stay alive. He hunts, raises animals, reads the bible, and begins to turn his focus and attention inward. He becomes a man of God, and learns to accept his fate, growing spiritually. He realizes that he has everything he needs to survive and live in peace.<br/><br/>Combining themes of hope, strength, and resiliency, this strategic, multi-layered game will test your skills in more ways than one, as you navigate through cannibal attacks, deadly storms, and your own inner turmoil.<br/><br/>Robinson Crusoe: Escape from Despair Island is a fast-paced, family-friendly game for 1-4 players, ages 14 and up. Offering a new gameplay experience every time, with vibrant art on 160 cards, push-your-luck mechanics, and the age-old theme of survival and escape, it will leave you wondering if you have what it takes to make it home alive.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/> The deck is shuffled, and every player is dealt five cards face down. These cards represent the players&rsquo; food supply, with one card being equal to one day's worth of food.<br/><br/>The game proceeds in a clockwise direction and includes two phases of play during each player&rsquo;s turn - the exploration phase, and the market phase.<br/><br/>During exploration phase the active player draws cards from the deck in order to take one card either food card or some camp cards to their camp. Market phase opens for other players once the active player has chosen what card to take.<br/><br/>Pay every turn<br/><br/>At the beginning of every turn, a player must discard one food card into the discard pile. This is the cost of playing the game and represents one day's food supply being used up.<br/><br/>Exploration turn<br/><br/>During exploration turn, players take turns flipping cards to find the resources they need. You can think of each flipped card as a new resource or ability your character has uncovered. A player can flip up to 10 cards. The aim of the exploration phase is to find food and resources and to build the camp and character. Ultimately the goal is to escape from the island.<br/><br/>After a maximum of ten cards have been flipped, the active player chooses which card they are going to keep, leaving the remaining cards on the table for the other players to buy.<br/><br/>There are two ways to take cards from the drawn cards<br/><br/>1) Harvest food cards i.e cards with a green palm tree symbol on the top left and a food icon on the bottom right. When harvesting, take the indicated amount of food from draw deck and place the food card on the discard pile.<br/><br/>2) Take camp cards such as construction cards with a brown upper left corner symbol on the top left, character cards with a blue upper left corner symbol, or resource cards with upper left corner left green palm tree corner symbol, other than food cards, to your camp if you meet the requirements.<br/><br/>The camp can consist of items like a hut, palisade, box or boat, as well as resources such as a rifle, an axe or gunpowder. Character growth and actual character cards are also placed in the camp. When a player builds an item in their camp, the card is placed image side up on the table in front of the player.<br/><br/>A player can continue flipping cards until either:<br/><br/>a) they have flipped a total of ten cards, in which case the player is forced to decide what card to take, or <br/>b) they decide to stop and take some of the flipped cards to their camp, or alternatively harvest food when the food card is discarded and food cards are taken from the draw deck, or<br/>c) they flip a total of two threat cards which from the player cannot defeat the more difficult one.<br/><br/>Defeat the threats<br/><br/>If a second threat card is flipped, the player must then defeat the greater of the two threats (denoted by 1, 2, or 3 skulls in the top right corner of the card) if they want to take some flipped card from the table to the camp.<br/><br/>The threat is defeated by having the cards listed on the card&rsquo;s &quot;requirement row&quot;. Each card has its own symbol. In the above example player have no any cards in the camp, so the exploration turn is over for that player and player do not get to keep any of the cards they have flipped.<br/><br/>If the player is able to defeat the threat, the card is placed on the discard pile, and they can either continue the exploration phase and drawing cards, or take the indicated amount of food cards and add them to their pile. The options available after defeating the threat are visible on the bottom of the card where there are card deck icon OR food icon with number.<br/><br/>Build your camp<br/><br/>When building the camp by taking a construction unit like a boat using an axe and wood, the wood is discarded (it has the finite symbol '1') while axe is not discarded (it has the infinite symbol &infin;).<br/><br/>With every draw you risk encountering threats and losing food, but the one thing you need the most could be waiting under the next card. How far will you go to survive?<br/><br/>There are many decisions to be made:<br/><br/>1) Stop flipping cards earlier, and minimize the chance for other players to buy the cards they need during the market phase.<br/>2) Keep flipping, and you have a better chance of finding the cards you need, allowing you to gain more food from other players who want to buy these cards from you later. But push your luck too far and you will be defeated by the second threat card, which you cannot defeat. <br/>3) Push for consistent development of your resources and character, or grow your food pile first and purchase more helpful cards later?<br/>4) Grow your food pile aggressively, and risk losing half of them if a bad luck card shows up. <br/>5) Use up your food supplies as you go, and you may find them doubled if a good luck card appears.<br/><br/>Market phase<br/><br/>After player has done his exploration turn, the market phase starts. Moving in a clockwise direction, all other players are now given the opportunity to buy any cards that are left from the exploration phase.<br/><br/>The cost of each card is denoted by a number in the top right corner, which represents the number of food cards the buying player must then discard to acquire the card. On top of this number, the buying player must also give one food card to the selling player.<br/><br/>If there is no number in the top right corner (as with the goat card) then the buying player does not need to discard any food cards, but they do still need to give the selling player one food card as payment.<br/><br/>The market phase continues until all the cards have been bought or the players do not want to buy any more. Any cards left on the table at the end of the market phase are then placed in the discard pile.<br/><br/>Grow your character<br/><br/>It will take more than just food and shelter to keep player alive. Player will need to teach, pray, and read to build up character, and better the odds of escaping alive. By collecting character growth cards, a player can get characters, which give effects and open up paths to victory.<br/><br/>Victory paths<br/><br/>a) Beacon Campfire victory path, either with the Man of God character card or with a camp of 18 victory points <br/>b) Escape the Island victory path, either with the Teacher character card or with a camp of 18 victory points <br/>c) Victory point strategy, by having the Wise Man character plus 25/20/17 VPs (4/3/2 players)<br/><br/>Beacon campfire<br/><br/>You could draw the attention of a rescue ship, but you will need to become a Man of God OR build a camp with at least 18 VPs and find wood and gunpowder to build a fire.<br/><br/>Escape from the Island<br/><br/>You can set your sights on building a boat, but you will need to find Friday and teach him how to help you.<br/><br/>Victory point<br/><br/>Finally, you can pray and read to become a wise man and build up your victory points to beat the other players.<br/><br/>Game ends<br/><br/>The game ends in either of the following situations:<br/><br/>a) When the draw deck has been played through twice, in which case the player with the most victory points (VPs) wins<br/>b) When any player achieves one of the three winning strategies: Beacon Campfire, Escape the Island or Victory points.<br/><br/>Explanation of card types<br/><br/>Food cards: There are two kind of food cards, regular food cards and food &amp; resource combo cards, such as wood and goat, that player can use either as a food card (harvested like other food cards) or as a resource card (placed in the camp like regular resource cards). These are necessary in order to maintain an adequate food supply.<br/><br/>Resource cards: Resource cards have two kinds, regular resources like axe and wood, and food &amp; resource combo cards (see above).<br/><br/>Construction cards: There are two kinds of construction cards, regular ones and combo ones, combo having two construction units in the same card. These cards are important for protecting yourself and also enabling some victory paths.<br/><br/>Exploration cards allow a player to take extra cards or double the amount of food collected, which boosts the exploration phase significantly.<br/><br/>Good &amp; Bad luck cards: Good luck cards give 4 food to the player with the least food cards. Bad luck cards force players with more than 6 food to lose half of their food cards. Both of these cards are enforced as soon as they are drawn.<br/><br/>Character cards: There are two types of character cards, character growth cards and character cards. Growth ones are important prerequisite cards for the actual character cards, Man of God, and Wise man cards. They are necessary not only for protection, but are also requirements for special victory scenarios.<br/><br/>The special character card Friday helps to protect the player against many threats. It also allows for an additional card to be drawn when exploring, but it also forces you to pay one more food when you buy.<br/><br/>Victory cards: Cards like Beacon Campfire and Escape the Island are key victory cards.<br/><br/>Said about the game<br/><br/>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking for something that re-creates the high drama of it&rsquo;s subject matter&hellip;it does a really great job.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ndash; Rahdo<br/><br/>&ldquo;The design and the art...

The player who played a higher value Tackle card can then play an Action card for shooting the ball at goal.  The opponent (defender) has to respond with an Action card that blocks the shot, otherwise the shooting player scores.  If someone plays an Action card for committing a foul, a card is drawn from the Referee deck and its instructions are followed.  Regardless, play continues with the cycle of playing Tackle cards and then Action cards.  When all Tackle cards have been played, each players draws another 6 Tackle and 5 Action cards, and continues play.<br/><br/>The game ends when the second batch of Tackle cards have all been played.

Until recently, your people have been living peacefully in underground dwellings to protect themselves from the noxious gases on the surface. But now you are besieged by violent and increasingly frequent asteroid attacks, which are causing irreparable damage and threatening your very existence.<br/><br/>Working together with the other rulers, you must rally the troops to build infrastructure and develop technologies that will protect you from the asteroids and will ultimately allow you to escape. Use your race&rsquo;s special powers to help you and your neighbouring moons, which are suffering the same fate, to settle on Uranus before your moons explode.<br/><br/>This is a co-operative game: players work together to try to beat the game. Players win the game if they manage to get all of the moon races housed in completed modules on Uranus before the moons explode. No race must be left behind.<br/><br/>Each round has four phases that must be completed in order. Players play simultaneously within each phase, but wait until all players have finished a phase before moving on together to the next.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Asteroid track. If the asteroid track marker lands on an asteroid attack, the next attack is carried out. Areas of moons are damaged and 'go dark' making these sections unusable.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Mine and transport. Each mine on a player's moon produces a moon rock of the appropriate colour. The rocks are then transported along tunnel and grouped together in connected networks.<br/><br/>Phase 3: Use and remove. Groups of moon rocks are used together towards a single project. Progress is marked on the project board. Players may get ready to build tunnels and mines, construct launchpads and fortifications, load up their space gun or work towards developing different technologies. Each technology helps the players to progress in the game.<br/><br/>Phase 4: Build and activate. Completed projects can now be constructed on your moon. Mines may be built or fortified. Tunnels constructed or removed. Networks will change as your need for different groupings of resources changes.<br/><br/>When all players have discovered spaceship technology and habitation modules are constructed on Uranus, players may travel to Uranus. This is a race against time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's a 2 or 4 player game (2 teams of 2). At the start of each round, each player is given 3 cards with which they must win at least 2 tricks out of 3 to win. With a hand so small, rounds go really fast and sometimes they even last only a few seconds.<br/><br/>The detail that makes the charm of the game lies in the announcement &quot;Trut!&rdquo; which is done verbally or by clapping a hand on the table. At any time in the round, as long as a player holds a card in his hand, whomever &quot;Truts&quot; simply announces to the opposing team he is certain to win the round. Of course, he can bluff. He's got 2 options then: to give up or take up the challenge! Knowing that winning a &quot;Trut&quot; can lead to a greater... or to a huge loss.<br/><br/>A game lasts between 5 and 10 minutes, but the pace is really fast, and the game is so addictive that players often easily play several games.<br/><br/>In 2017, Robin Red Games released a version of TRUT which adds a bunch of cards with special effects.<br/><br/>",

Each &lsquo;turn&rsquo; of the game simulates an over of Test or One Day Cricket. Turns are resolved by using a regular deck of playing cards instead of rolling dice, although six sided dice are used to resolve some plays. The device of replicating a single over per turn is perfect, as full test matches can be played over several hours, while one day games can be played out in a single session. The system ingeniously allows for hat tricks, batting collapses, batsmen playing themselves in, and batsman playing with confidence. There are two forms of the game. Basic, which only include some rules and in which players are not individually carded (although they do have individual stats) and the Advanced Game, in which each player has a unique card.<br/><br/>It produces a very convincing range of scores and excitement (perhaps rather more than the real game does). Extremely clever.<br/><br/>The 5th Edition of this game is now available from mindencricket.com<br/><br/>",

Pick up food, throw funny combos at your opponents and duck to avoid &quot;humiliation&quot; points from flying food impact.<br/><br/>In the center is a draw deck, with five food or other cards exposed at any one time to make up the &quot;cafeteria floor&quot;. Players start the game with three standard actions and one special action unique to their character. Every round, each player chooses three of their action cards, and puts them in a stack representing the next three turns. The turns are then resolved at once, but in clockwise rotation to handle any timing conflicts. Players can gain additional actions during the game, and global school events occur, instantly causing random chaos.<br/><br/>When any player reaches 10 humiliation points, someone has &quot;alerted the principal&quot; and the fight is over at the end of that round. The winner is the person with the LOWEST humiliation score.<br/><br/>",

But with those deceptively simple ingredients, veteran designer Ty Bomba has created his masterpiece, the game that he himself acknowledges as his own best design. The trick is that the game ends when only one player's pieces remain on the board, and the player who managed to exit the most pieces off of the opponent's side of the map wins. Because of this, players can't concentrate on just blocking/attacking or just advancing, but must strike a difficult and subtle balance between the two.<br/><br/>The first edition of Mr. Bomba's game was significantly altered by its publisher. Here, all unnecessary ornamentation has been stripped away, presenting the designer's original vision as he had always intended, in a handsome format utilizing chunky 40mm x 40mm x 16mm wooden blocks.<br/><br/>",

The Gods, who were once, long ago working in unity to bring the world together, are now competing and fighting with each other for world control. You, as one of the newer Gods must strategically use your acquired creatures and spells to win the Territories all Gods are desperately fighting for. Take what is yours, take what you deserve. Complete and utter supremacy.<br/><br/>Core Gameplay<br/><br/>War of Supremacy is a free-for-all, king-of-the-hill style, fantasy card game in which all players are fighting over a centralized Territory: a battleground in which all players want to take control of and ultimately win in order to claim it as their own. If a player gains control over a number of territories they will control enough of the world to win the game. With all players fighting for themselves, the battlefield becomes an all-in brawl with only one winner.<br/><br/>Players take turns, using creatures from their hand to attack the opponent&rsquo;s creatures currently defending the Territory. If a player manages to defeat the defending creatures, they take control of the Territory, placing all their creatures used in the attack into defense. That player will then become the defender in which all other players are trying to defeat.<br/><br/>If a player manages to defend against all opponents, then they win the Territory and take it as a victory point. Players can also win a Territory by building up enough score in their attack or defense to win the Territory outright before others get a chance. Players can combine creatures with spell cards that offer a wide range of game changing effects.<br/><br/>Master your tactics, form alliances and make enemies, and have a little bit of luck to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>Noble House is a game based on the novel by James Clavell. In this game, players take the part of the Tai-Pans of major corporations doing business in Hong Kong in the early 1960's, as portrayed in the Clavell book. Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.<br/><br/>Synopsis of play:<br/><br/>During a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own &quot;voting&quot; stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase. Otherwise, the game ends on the turn when the last event card is drawn.<br/><br/>",

The statistics of the historical runners have been modified so that they can compete with the current racers.<br/><br/>Components are the rule book (a5 format), 7 sections of 'track' , four charts (summary, race pace/progress record and timing charts for 1500m and mile), 36 cards for runners and record sheets for races and a training log for the optional campaign rules. Four dice (two yellow, red and green)and two counters are also supplied. <br/>(Extract of the following review)<br/><br/>&quot;The Metric Mile has long been a favorite game of many gamers, and not all of them sports replay gamers as it appears from time to time in all sorts of 'best games ' lists. Frequently played at conventions as a multi-player game, and the subject of many postal games in days gone by, the game was designed way back in 1986 as no more than another solo replay game, and its appeal to all shapes and sizes of gamers surprised me then and continues to do so. Or maybe not quite so much as it did, for I have to say that when I worked on it again recently ...<br/><br/>... I appreciated the quick easy-to-understand-but-difficult-to-suss-out game system that does in fact produce races over this classic track distance ( one mile and 1,500 Metres, despite the title) that are accurate and realistic and yet require a lot of on-the-fly decisions for each runner.&quot;<br/>A quote by the Game designer<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    More Metric Milers<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "卓上ヘボコン, a.k.a. Desktop HEBOCON Battle Kit, is a Japanese game based on the theme of &quot;HEBOCON&quot;. This is form of 'robot-wars' events, with microbots fighting Sumo matches. One robot must defeat the other according to Sumo wrestling rules, such as pushing them out of the circle, or flipping them to a fall. At HEBOCON events, people construct their own robots and fight knock-out matches to find a winner. HEBOCON is derived from the Japanese word Heboku, meaning 'bad' or 'heavy', something that is childish. HEBOCON is designed for people with little technical ability. This game recreates that experience in a simple build and fight way.<br/><br/>During the game, players collect tiles and place them in their build area, a 6x6 grid. Gathering tiles and building is how the player programs their robot to fight. Players gain victory points during the Gather and Build stages, and get more VPs through winning fights in the Battle stage. The player with the most points will be the HEBOCON champion!<br/><br/>In the Gather stage, each player takes turns to take a tile from a large circle of pieces. You move your robot forward, taking a tile from the circle. Each time the last player makes a complete lap, they place a nut on the gameboard to show a lap has been completed. Once each player has made nine circuits and collected a stack of nine tiles, then they start to Build. Whilst collecting tiles, players cannot look at their stack and must use their memory for what they need to build.<br/><br/>In the Build stage, a player starts a digital timer and everyone has a brief time to assemble their bot. If a player fills out all 36 squares of their grid, they suffer a penalty as their robot is too technical! This reflects the same rules in HEBOCON. Players score points for a solid, connected build, which in HEBOCON is more important than winning a fight.<br/><br/>Finally the players Battle with their bots, by placing a nut on a tile on their grid. These are the bots actions, such as moving and making turns in the sumo ring.

You will lead them in brawls and rumbles with the rival gangs of other players in an attempt to win turf, fame and hard cash. Each gang member is represented by one miniature on the table, customized and painted by yourself. As you play more and more games of Gangs of Mega-City One, your gang will become more powerful, recruiting new members, hiring specialists and buying superior weapons and equipment on the black market. The goal of each player in this game is to defeat the gangs of his opponents, through a mixture of skill and raw luck, building up his own gang in the process.<br/><br/>The more you play Gangs of Mega-City One, the better your street gang will become &ndash; even if you lose a fight, your gang members will at least have learned something and they may not be so quick to suffer defeat again in the future! As a gang grows, it will not just recruit more members and earn more credits. As it spreads its influence beyond its own block, the gang will begin to dominate more turf, gaining a sizable reputation within Mega-City One&rsquo;s criminal circles. Canny players will use this to gain access to incredibly powerful weaponry or hire extremely skilled specialists who will swing the balance of any confrontation in their favor.<br/><br/>As well as developing the street gang as a whole, players will also have a chance to build up the skills and capabilities of each individual member. Young juves have much to learn but the street is a harsh teacher. Those who survive will stand to become among the greatest of all gang members. Even gang leaders will develop new skills and traits that will ensure they are far harder to defeat in a rumble.<br/><br/>Gangs of Mega-City One allows you to see your gang grow from a group of disenfranchised and bored young punks to the greatest criminal masterminds Mega-City One has ever seen!<br/><br/>Each box set contains the full colour rulebook, 12 plastic Street Gang miniatures, a full set of card buildings and a floor plan that will have you fighting for turf within minutes!<br/><br/>Replaced by:<br/><br/>     Judge Dredd Miniatures Game<br/><br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player rolls three dice, then commits one of those dice to one of their three fields; once a field has three dice in it, that field is full.<br/><br/>Once all nine dice have played by both players, they compare the strengths of their die combinations in opposing fields. The best combination is a three-of-a-kind, with three 6s beating three 5s, which beats three 4s, and so on. The next best combination is a straight, followed by a pair, followed by a single die, with higher numbers beating low ones in each of these combinations, e.g, a combination of 5-5-2 beats 4-4-6. For each row won, the player receives 1 point.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 5 points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

The new harbour game Antwerpen is a stand alone new boardgame with some specific game mechanics which differ from Rotterdam. The game play is more compact and dynamic and the variance in scoring is more diverse.<br/><br/>Belgians are worldwide known to enjoy life, thanks to the delicious products of their fatherland. The best chocolate, beer of high fermentation and of course the real Flemish French fries. But without cocoa no pralines, without potatoes no fries! In the Antwerp port the necessities for an enjoyable life are brought together from all parts of the world: cocoa, barley and potatoes, but also containers filled with games and toys.<br/><br/>The players are owners of a fleet who must compete on the busy channels in the Schelde. They need to find their way in the network of locks and bring their cargo safe in the inland harbour! Each player has several special assignments which they try to accomplish. The planning in Antwerpen is easier than in Rotterdam since the product cards available are visible from the beginning. And also exchanging products could be very helpful to get the right combination of products needed to score your bonus points.<br/><br/>Characteristics of the game:<br/><br/>&bull; Sort of game: tactical family game<br/>&bull; No. of players: 2-4 players<br/>&bull; Age: 8 years and up<br/>&bull; Duration: 60 minutes<br/><br/>Antwerpen is being released in September 2010 in a multi lingual version with English, German, French and Flemish rules.<br/>The game can be played and will be available at SPIEL'10 at The Game Master's stand 12-42.<br/><br/>",

It was thought very little infantry would be needed.<br/><br/>In the end, when the last Allied troops evacuated, the casualty count for both sides topped half-a-million. (And Churchill lost his job.)<br/><br/>And yet, the big naval attack had almost succeeded. The Allies would not know until after the war ended how close they had come to achieving their breakthrough on the Dardanelles. It was the first of many &quot;what might have been&quot; episodes, where success was just one more push, one more aggressive movement away...in contrast to many times when failure was reinforced and repeated.<br/><br/>Gallipoli is held as something sacred by the Australians and New Zealanders... as though they own it. The British would point out that the ANZACs made up less than 10% of the overall force and suffered less than 10% of the casualties. (But you can still get into a fight in Sydney if you talk like this!)<br/><br/>A Fatal Attraction brings this campaign of tragedy and opportunity to life. The counters represent brigades, batteries, and ships, and players have the chance to do better than their historical counterparts, while gaining a greater appreciation for the difficulties faced by both sides, including supply shortages, command/control difficulties, and random events.<br/><br/>With A Fatal Attraction, you'll find everything you need to understand Gallipoli except the smell and the flies.<br/><br/>Published in Against the Odds magazine #20, August 2007<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 week<br/>Map: Area<br/>Unit: Infantry Regiments/Brigades, Artillery Batteries and individual ships<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet<br/>One countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 12 page Game Rulebook<br/>Four pages of chart &amp; tables<br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>Solitaire suitability - Low<br/>Playing time - Up to 6 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Sun Never Sets is a mid-to-high complexity operational level game of the colonial wars fought by the British during the 19th century.  It includes three separate games, namely &quot;March to Peking&quot;, &quot;Zulu War&quot; and &quot;The Sudan&quot;.  The game includes a core set of rules used in all three scenarios and scenario-specific rules unique to each game.  Optional rules add further chrome and complexity to the game.<br/><br/>March to Peking depicts the Anglo-French attack on China in 1860 to force it to open itself up to European trade.  Special rules allow for the veteran Chinese Hunan army (engaged fighting the Taiping rebels elsewhere) to march to Peking's relief.<br/><br/>Zulu War depicts the British campaigns in 1879 against the Zulus in South Africa.<br/><br/>The Sudan covers three separate campaigns; the 1883-85 Mahdist uprising in Sudan, the defence of Khartoum in 1884-85, and the recapture of Sudan in 1896-98.<br/><br/>The game consists of rules, two 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps and 620 counters.<br/><br/>",

An interesting combination of &quot;mana&quot;-style (in this case, &quot;mana&quot; = &quot;gold&quot;) creature summoning, and Star Wars CCG deck depletion to win. <br/>Each player has a certain amount of &quot;gold&quot; cards that they may play one of, each round. Gold is then moved from the &quot;reserve pile&quot;, where it is initially laid, to the &quot;spent pile&quot;. Spent gold is then used to summon all variety of mythological &quot;allies&quot; (beasts, gods, etc.), or &quot;totems&quot; (support items that remain on the table, enhancing your combat or gold producing abilities). Gold can also be kept in the reserve pile to be used to power &quot;talismans&quot; (think instants and interrupts), or to utilize special abilities that your &quot;allies&quot; have. Combat is resolved by comparing the &quot;power&quot; value on each card, if the attacker is higher, the difference is discarded from your opponent&rsquo;s deck. The first person to completely deplete their opponent's deck is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Your cards become the fighting units that conquer and control territories. You get Victory Points from each territory you control at the end of your turn plus bonus points from Angel and Demon cards. The player with the most Victory Points when the supply runs out wins!<br/><br/>The game features a large scale in the center of the board, with a discard tray on each end representing Heaven and Hell. Since you're a god you decide whether to send defeated cards to the Heaven discard tray or the Hell discard tray. The scale tracks how many defeated enemies have been sent to Heaven or Hell. Tip the scales and open the gates of Hell or Heaven. When the gates of Heaven are open, you can more easily summon angels from The Beyond to fight for you. The same is true for Hell and demons.<br/><br/>Before playing, each player selects two god powers and factions. God powers are special abilities that break the rules and factions are the cards that make up each player's deck, such as vampires, knights, wolves, merchants, farmers, giants, shepherds, or thieves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From The Complete Book of Indoor Games by Peter Arnold:<br/><br/>Klabberjass is probably best known in America than in England, because under the names of Clabber,Clobber, Clubby, Klab and Klob, it occurs in Damon Runyon's amusing stories,and in 1937 a variation of the game, jo-jotte was publicized by Ely Culbertson. Despite the simularity of names it is not idenical with the Hungarian game of kalabrias, which is a game for three or four players. There may have been a common ancestor, or possibly the game was taken to the New World by Central European immigrants and there bowdlerized version of kalabrias. (Exeter Books, 1984)<br/><br/>Klabberjass is played in the North American and Great Britain with the 32 card deck. (6s, 5s,4s,3s, and 2s removed from the standard 52 card deck.) The trump suit enjoys the strange ranking of the Jass genre: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7. Non trump suit rank A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 as in the Skat-Pinochle family. Six cards are dealt to each player and a card is turned up. Non-dealer then begins a bidding round to first to accept the turn-up as trump. Or pass. If both pass on the turn-up card a second round is held. Here the non-dealer may take the bid by naming one of the other three suits or pass, dealer than may take the bid by naming the suit of throw in the hand. (Some allow for a bid of &quot;Schmeiss&quot; which means to the bidder will take the hand with the turn-up or the hand can be thrown in at the non-bidders discretion)<br/><br/>After bidding, the dealer deals three more cards to the hand. Then sequences are scored. For this purpose the cards revert back to their numeral rank. A sequence of three scores 20 and a sequence of 4 or more scores 50. tiebreakers are decided by rank. As I will describe later, it may make sense not to score in this round and you are not obligated to do so.<br/><br/>Non-dealer leads to first trick. A player must follow suit. If he cannot he must trump if able. If trump is lead he must play a higher trump if able. If he holds the King and Queen of trump he may announce &quot;Bella&quot; on play of the second card and score 50 points. Once again he may choose not to score for this.<br/><br/>After the cards are played, both score for the following cards won:<br/><br/>Jass (Jack of Trumps) 20 points<br/>Menel (9 of Trumps) 14 points.<br/>Any Ace 11 points<br/>Any 10 10 points.<br/>Any King 4 points.<br/>Any Queen 3 points.<br/>Any Jack 2 points.<br/>Last Trick 10 points.<br/><br/>If the the high bidder (The one who established trump) scores the highest, both sides score what they made. If if opponent scores higher he scores for both totals. This is why the high bidder who realizes he is not going to beat his opponent in this hand may decide not to score or &quot;Sink&quot; points during the hand. 500 points wins the round.<br/><br/>Prior to the onset of Gin Rummy, this was the most popular two handed game in the United States. It still holds a loyal following.<br/><br/>Klabberjass remains a popular two handed game in the United States. There are several variations in play and several house rules. It is very popular in New England and especially Hartford, Connecticut.<br/><br/>",

(Paris is worth a mass) covers two battles of the French Religion Wars, Dreux (1562) and Ivry (1590).<br/><br/>The game uses a slightly streamlined version of the rules used in Ben Hull's other game, This Accursed Civil War (which covered the English Civil War). These battles are somewhat smaller than in the GMT game, as befitting the smaller format offered by Vae Victis.<br/><br/>Armies are divided into 3-5 &quot;wings,&quot; each of which is given orders every turn (either &quot;Charge,&quot; &quot;March,&quot; or &quot;Rally&quot;) and it is the giving and carrying-out of orders which drives the game.

        "description": "Designed by Mark H. Walker, La R&eacute;sistance is a simple, yet engaging, dice and card game set during the German occupation of France in World War II. During the occupation, brave French men and women fought against the Nazi conquerors, disrupting their communications, destroying supply warehouses, and ambushing German patrols. La R&eacute;sistance gives players a chance to lead a band of resistance fighters, working to keep their men and women alive as they also strive to become the most famous resistance leader.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player will roll six dice, placing the dice on mission cards common to all players, he or she attempts to defeat the mission card by matching dice on the card, spending recruits, and using their resistance leader&rsquo;s special abilities. To win, a player must amass 12 Glory Points or break--by stealing or otherwise removing all rival resistance group members&mdash;the other resistance bands. La R&eacute;sistance mixes elements of popular dice games, such as Yahtzee and King of Tokyo, with &ldquo;take that&rdquo; card mechanics and player interaction, giving the game a familiar feel.<br/><br/>The game is historically themed, and a great way to introduce gamers to strategy games. Three to five people may play, so La R&eacute;sistance is great for game nights and family get-togethers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

George Armstrong Custer and most of his command at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. This two-player game covers that entire campaign.<br/><br/>One player commands Army forces, including the regiments and battalions forming the three commands that participated in the original campaign: Crook&rsquo;s, Gibbon&rsquo;s and Terry&rsquo;s. The other player controls various Indian tribes, each rated for its fighting strength in warriors. The point-to-point map stretches from Fort Abraham Lincoln in the Dakotas to Helena, Montana. In between are famous historic battle sites such as Powder River, the Rosebud, and the Little Bighorn.<br/><br/>Custer&rsquo;s Final Campaign is part of the Hand of Destiny mini-game series. Each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate movement abilities, combat bonuses and historical events. Accessing the right card at the right time lets the player concentrate forces to win that great victory against all odds&mdash;or perhaps go down to inglorious defeat. Some of the cards include: Tribal Raiding, Indians Leave Reservation, and Gary Owen.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. There are special rules for: Gatling guns, &ldquo;dog soldiers,&rdquo; Army riverboats, and leaders such as Crazy Horse, Nelson Miles, Sitting Bull and Custer himself.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the best FTF fantasy baseball board game ever created. This baseball game is for people who like meat and potatoes with a side of greens. It is the whole enchilada. When playing it you will use your intuition or feel to pick up patterns leading to decisions to outwit your opponent. If you can deal with, &quot;Take that!&quot;, you will like this game. Baseball Strategy is not meant for the shy, but the hearty. Great baseball action. Thrilling too! Never a dull moment and you will actually feel like a batter or a pitcher, manager or a base coach, etc. when you play this game.  Then you can live out your fantasies of being a big-league ball player! At least that's the idea is promoting here and what's wrong with that? Let's face it. Even if you just played wiffle ball in your backyard, haven't you fantasied hitting one into the upper deck at Tiger Stadium, especially having seen a slugger do that many times in your life? It would be nice to hear the cheers as you formally rounded the bases with alacrity to score. Baseball Strategy seems to capture the psychological battle between pitcher and batter quite well. Experience the excitement of getting a bases loaded, bases clearing double when you anticipated the pitch correctly, but you will also experience the agony when you don't! This game is unlike any other baseball game this author has ever played. There are rules for series play in order to give proper rest to pitchers where the entire pitching staff is used and not just the &quot;Aces&quot;.  Series play is highly recommended to have a full &quot;baseball fantasy&quot; playing experience. The game now even has variant injury possibilities, video replay challenges, robs of hit opportunities, MLB Defensive &quot;Leather Larceny&quot; Highlight Plays, setting the infield at DP depth and more.<br/>This fantasy is a cat and mouse game (and vice versa) hiding in plain sight where the two gamers enter a complex matrix of double blind decisions that lead to the inevitable think and counter-think, out witting duel.  Gamers begin by first selecting their lineups from imaginary players or actual players by converting their stats to the game's parameters. (This is easily done from mlb.com on the net or baseball-reference.com.).  If you don&rsquo;t like agony, this game isn&rsquo;t for you!<br/>Enter The Matrix: The Defensive team is the manager and catcher, selecting pitch types (Fast Ball, Off Speed, Pitch out, etc.) to send batters fuming back to the dugout, sometimes with specific outs in a certain situation. Batters attempt to get a hit, get on base or at the least make an out that moves runners into scoring position/ or of course, scoring. (that's the idea, right?) Each tries to anticipate the other's tendencies throughout the game in order to &quot;exploit&quot; them.<br/>After a pitch card is played by the pitcher, the batter must then select a type of offense/ball in play strategy (Steal, Bunt, Hit and Run, Long Ball, etc.)The results of the two choices are found by cross indexing them on a result matrix table. Players can decide on the size of ballpark before the game.<br/><br/>",

Now the British were attacking a German defense for the first time in the was in the &quot;Brevity&quot; and &quot;Battleaxe&quot; operations. These battles featured swirling desert armored battles an the devastating power of the famous 88mm anti-tank gun. Fought over essentially the same battlefield as found in the O'Connors Offensive game, Hellfire Pass includes armored cars, Matilda tanks, desert fortifications and armor breakdown. Both players must decide when to use their mobility to outflank the enemy positions and balance that attack with the forces described as akin to a roller coaster ride on a tight-rope. Hellfire Pass is truly a tactician's dream.&quot;<br/><br/>Hellfire Pass is an Operational scale wargame of combat between the Allies and Germans in the North African Desert in World War II. Uses half-day turns, 2 mile hexes, and battalion/company scale units.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Series: Battles for North Africa (3W). The other games in the Series: Battles for North Africa (3W) are: Rommel at Bay, O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass,  Patton Goes to War, Objective: Tunis, Decision At Kasserine: Rommel's Last Chance, and Race For Tunis.

Players are wizards who use their energy to power spells and collect ingredients from the game board. Collect the right combination of ingredients &ndash; which varies depending on the number of players &ndash; and you win!<br/><br/>Spell cards are the heart and soul of the game. You get two random spells at the start of each game, then can acquire more via short, &quot;once around&quot; auctions at the start of each round. You bid energy cubes in these auctions, and you have only ten, so bid wisely. When you win an auction, you place energy cubes equal to your bid on the spell card. A certain number of these cubes are removed from the card at the end of each round; once the final cube is removed, the spell leaves the game and you lose that power.<br/><br/>Spell cards generate the Element cards depicted on them for their owners. You then use these Element cards to bid on and collect Ingredients. You can bid for Ingredients only with the Elements shown on the landmark tokens on areas of the game board; these tokens are placed randomly each game. To increase the strategy and player interactivity, some Spell cards let you bid extra cards or different cards, while others allow you to change the rules for bidding. After visiting 3-6 areas, with the number being determined by a die roll at the start of the round, the round ends and players remove Energy cubes from their spells.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a player collects the required number of ingredients, e.g., in a six-player game, five differently colored ingredients or six ingredients in any combination of colors.<br/><br/>",

The prices offered by the ports change with each delivery, so you try to arrive when the price is high.  There is a lot of scope for blocking other ships and for bumping them back to their last port.<br/>So where does the Bermuda Triangle bit come in?  There is a &lsquo;mysterious cloud&rsquo; - a plastic construction raised from the board on a central column - which moves about the board and twists around above the ships. There are magnets on the underside of the cloud and on top of the ships, so ships can be picked up and moved or destroyed when the cloud passes over.  Each turn, a player moves a ship and the cloud - usually trying to protect their own ships and attack those of other players.<br/><br/>",

Thus, you need to race and maneuver to be in the proper position when scoring your checkpoints.<br/><br/>Try as you might, it's impossible to maintain the lead throughout the race &ndash; and truth be told, while being first at the end of the race helps, placing first at your scoring locations is even more important.

You'll play two rounds of the game, and after each one, every player will accumulate points based on how guilty they look and add it to their running total. At the end of the second round, a winner and a loser will be decided. The game centers on the three factual categories of the game:<br/><br/>When: The time of the theft<br/>Where: The location of the crime<br/>Who: A partial description of the thief<br/><br/>Because no one has bothered to ask Ed about the details of the crime, police have nothing but wild rumor and rampant speculation to go on. You'll be able to change the alleged facts of the case and alter the focus of the investigation in each of these three crime categories.<br/><br/>At the same time you'll plant evidence on other players. If a round ends while the case facts match up with the evidence planted on you, the police will grow suspicious. Too much incriminating evidence after each round will land you in the big house for the theft of Ed's pants.<br/><br/>In a 4-player game, players sitting across from each other are on the same team and you will win or lose together as accomplices. In a 3-player game, it's everyone for themselves.<br/><br/>",

The gardens start in the middle (one more than the number of players). Players draw tiles and place vegetables, weeds, snails and moles in different plots. When you feel one garden looks good to you, you grab it for your score at the end. However, other players can continue to place tiles in your garden until one space remains. The scoring card shows a grid, you score for 2 plants based on a 3rd, so if you have 2 cabbages, your carrots will score 3 pts and your asparagus will score 4 pts each. But get another cabbage and the points drop, so you have to control your garden to get the optimum score.<br/><br/>A good, simple, fun game, this will entertain but not stretch gamers and is a great intro for kids and non-gamers.<br/><br/>",

Which of them will be the first to grow into a stately little bird?<br/>A cheerfully cheeky collecting game.&quot;<br/><br/>1. Roll the die.<br/><br/>2. What feed symbol does the die show?(worm, fly, berries, or seeds)All the children look to see whether the corresponding feed symbol is pictured on their meadow, that is, whether their chick would like to eat the corresponding feed.<br/>The children may take one matching feed dish from the middle. Cover the feed symbol on there meadow with the feed dish.<br/><br/>3. Your chick is full when you have collected all the feed dishes for it. Place all the dishes from your meadow back into the middle. Turn the card over and cover up the little chick with the pictured larger chick.<br/>The chick has grown larger but it is still hungry.<br/><br/>4.

        "description": "In the trick-taking card game 6th Sense, you score by correctly predicting the number of tricks you'll take in a round.<br/><br/>The game lasts 4-6 rounds depending on the player count. The deck contains cards numbered 0-14 in five colors, and at the start of a round players are dealt a hand of 11-15 cards, then the top card of the deck is revealed to designate a trump suit. Each player then simultaneously chooses a card from their hand to predict the number of tricks they'll win this round, then places this card face down on the table.<br/><br/>In general, standard trick-taking rules apply: Someone leads a card, and other players must follow suit, if possible, with the highest trump or highest card of the suit lead winning the trick. That said, some cards have special effects when played:<br/> <br/>    When you play a 0, you can treat it as a 0 of that color, or you can remove the 0 and one previously played card from the current trick.<br/>    A trick with a 4 in it is won by the lowest card played instead of the highest; a second 4 cancels this effect.<br/>    The 6 and 9 are on the same card, and you declare which value you want when playing it (or when using it to predict the number of tricks you'll win).<br/>    When you start a trick with an 8, you can peek at the prediction card of whoever wins that trick.<br/>    If a trick contains at least one 12, the trick's winner can choose to immediately split the cards in that trick to count as two tricks.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of the round, if you've collected as many tricks as you predicted at the start of the round, you score that many points. If you failed to collect that number, you lose as many points as the difference between your prediction and what you collected, e.g., if you predicted 5 and collected 4 or 6 tricks, you lose 1 point. After the designated number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a base token in hand for their faction along with three other tiles from the 58 included in the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either places one tile from hand into the playing area (with each tile featuring four illustrated quadrants and possibly a special action symbol) or moves his already placed base tile to a new location. The action symbols allow you to rotate or swap tiles already in play.<br/><br/>Once the final tile is drawn, players take one final turn, then tally the score of their most valuable section of orthogonally connected tiles. The base token is worth five points, regular characters worth one point, and bonus items worth three points. Each faction has arch-enemies scattered amongst the tiles &mdash; e.g., kraken for pirates &mdash; and each arch-enemy touching your faction costs you a point. Whoever has the most valuable faction wins!<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Schweiz&quot; contains historical events related to Switzerland, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

There's a large collection of islands that are going to be connected by bridges. Bridges are placed onto the board when the matching card is played. The kicker is that when a player gets a majority of the bridges on one island, his opponent's bridges from that island suddenly disappear.

Vigilus is at the mercy of five warring factions: Ultramarines, Orks, Chaos Space Marines, Aeldari Craftworlds, and Genestealer Cults, each represented by tokens for their leaders and custom game pieces for their single and triple-threat units.<br/><br/>To name a few, Marneus Calgar leads the Ultramarines with individual Primaris Intercessors and Repulsor battle tanks as their three-unit pieces. The Aeldari Craftworlds faction, led by an Autarch, has Guardians at attention with Falcons as their tanks. A Magus's Genestealer Cult boasts weapon-wielding Acolytes and heavily armored Goliath Rockgrinders. All five factions' leaders have various special abilities, while armies are deployed with daring attacks and defense at the roll of custom red and black dice. Players gain reward cards for completing objectives, allowing the acquisition of additional armies and providing strategic advantages. Conquer not only three objectives, but total control of all territories to win &quot;Total Domination&quot;!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher' website:<br/><br/>Operation Anaconda, the battle fought between Coalition forces and Al Qaeda in eastern Afghanistan in March of 2002. This battle was a combined US-Afghan-Coalition force attempt to surround and destroy Al Qaeda forces, but the operation fell apart owing to poor command control. While technically a Coalition victory, the battle demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.<br/><br/>The game system is based on the &quot;Boots&quot; system, which makes command-control the central feature of the design. Each player commands a combat force composed of one or more sub-commands. These sub-commands are maneuvered via picking Command Chits at random; When a Command Chit is picked, that sub-command is then activated. Since players do not know the order in which those Command Chits are picked, battles become chaotic fights as players strive to create and exploit opportunities.<br/><br/>This is a two-player game, with one player commanding Coalition forces, and the other Al Qaeda. Combat in the game is quasi-tactical. Units fire at enemy targets at range. Additionally, the Coalition player has access to various types of fire support, such as airstrikes. However, owing to the chaotic nature of the battle, fire support as well as various reinforcements appear at random. The Al Qaeda player has the advantage of his units being deployed face down so that the Coalition player must use ISR (Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance) to reveal them. Game play becomes a tense contest between asymmetrical forces in the mountains of Afghanistan.<br/><br/>",

In order to fulfill the prophecy and defeat Ganondorf, you must find out WHO possesses the power to defeat Ganondorf, WHAT item is required to defeat him, and WHERE he has established his hidden lair.<br/><br/>The game largely plays similarly to the regular version of Clue, with the addition of two new mechanics. First, you have boss encounters, where you can draw from a deck of  Boss Encounter cards if you land on a ? symbol or roll a ? on the dice. If you draw a regular Boss, you've defeated it and gain it's power, and if you draw the 8th Ganondorf card, you're immediately out of the game.<br/><br/>Second, each character has a special power you can use once per game. For example, Impa's power lets you start two Rumors (aka Suggestions in regular Clue) in a single turn.<br/><br/>",

Choose your favorite NFL team (All 32 teams are represented) and outsmart your opponent by calling the play on both offense and defense. Choose the right play and get rewarded&hellip; but you&rsquo;ll also need a little luck. Roll the dice to see if that big gain will go for extra yardage or if a key play will result in a turnover. Each team comes with 2 specific &quot;Big Play&quot; cards that embody the core strengths of that team. Use each card only once per half to change the outcome of a play. Clock winding down? Line up for a field goal and take your chances at kicking the ball through the uprights.<br/><br/>In more detail...<br/><br/>Starting The Game<br/>Choose Rookie or Pro Mode. The two game modes allow players at any skill level to get into the game!<br/>- Rookie Mode- For newer NFL players.<br/>- Pro Mode- For experienced players and fans.<br/>Pick your team and grab your team's Scoring Footballs and Big Play cards!<br/><br/>Picking Your Play<br/>The offense has 4 downs to either advance the ball 10 yards for a first down, score a touchdown, kick a field goal, or punt.<br/><br/>Both Offense and Defense choose a play card from their set of Playbooks. If the Defense correctly predicts what play the Offense is running it will result in a good outcome for them. However, if the Defense choose poorly, the Offense could pull off a big gain!<br/>The Offense announces what play book both sides will be choosing from.<br/><br/>Running a Play<br/>Each team chooses a play card and places it face down at the Line of Scrimmage. When ready, both players flip over their cards at the same time to reveal the outcome of the play:<br/>Find the circled player on the offense card and follow the arrow down to the defense card to see the result.<br/>Move the Line of Scrimmage marker the same number of yards as the result of the play.<br/>Also, move the First Down marker and the Down Tracker Chip.<br/><br/>Distance and Passing Dice<br/>Some plays may indicate that dice need to be rolled for the result of a play. Roll the indicated color dice to show the yards gained or lost on a play. The white passing die is also rolled to determine the outcome:<br/>    Catch- The pass is complete, and the offense gains yards.<br/>    Turn Over- The defense intercepts the pass and gains possession of the ball at the spot of the catch.<br/>    X- The pass is incomplete, the ball remains at the current yard line.<br/><br/>Big Play Cards<br/>Each team has 2 Big Play cards that showcase that team's strengths. Use these cards to make a big play during the game! Big Plays add or remove yards from the end of a play.<br/>These cards are played after the Playbook Cards are flipped over.<br/>Only ONE Big Play card can be played per down- the first player to place a Big Play on the game board gets to play the card.<br/>Once a card is played, it is discarded for the remainder of the half.<br/><br/>Kicking Field Goals<br/>Use the Flicker Kicker to literally kick the ball off the Line of Scrimmage on any down. Place the field goal posts behind the end zone, lined up between the lines marked on the game board.<br/><br/>If the kick is good- and passes through the field goal post uprights and above the crossbar, then that team scores 3 points.<br/>If the kick misses- and does not pass through the field goal posts, then the other team starts their next possession.<br/><br/>Just line up the kick, pull back on either the tab or the kicker foot, and release to send the football flying through the uprights!<br/><br/>Officially licensed product of the National Football League<br/>Includes all 32 NFL teams<br/><br/>Game Contents<br/>64 Big Play Cards<br/>19 Playbook Cards<br/>3 Distance Dice<br/>1 Passing Dice<br/>32 NFL Team Footballs for Scoring<br/>1 Scoreboard<br/>3 Scoreboard Clips<br/>1 NFL Showdown Game Board<br/>1 Field Goal Post<br/>1 NFL Flicker Kicker<br/>1 NFL Football<br/>1 Line of Scrimmage Marker<br/>1 First Down Tracker<br/>1 Down Tracker Chip<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle for China is a board game simulation of the War of Resistance against Japan from the initial Japanese invasion in July 1937 to the end of 1941. The game is designed for two players, one directing the military forces acting to defend China against the Japanese invaders (the Chinese Player) and the other the forces of Imperial Japan (the Japanese Player). The game can also be played with a third player taking the Chinese Communist forces.<br/><br/>Game comes with a map depicting China, 150 miles to an inch. It is divided into multiple areas, with one or more areas corresponding appproximately to a province. Units are abstract, each representing approximate Corps and Armies for the Chinese and Divisions and Brigades for the Japanese.<br/><br/>The Japanese translation of the game came out in Command Magazine Japan #42. It features die-cut counters, an enlarged map, and integrates the More Battle for China expansion kit (more rules, two extra half-maps and more counters to game out the rest of World War Two (1942-45) and the Civil War (1947-49)).<br/><br/>June 2009: Fiery Dragon productions has come out with &quot;Battle for China Deluxe&quot;, a special edition of the game that includes the expansion kit More Battle for China. The package includes:<br/><br/>- 44-page integrated rulebook for all three games, with coil binding<br/>- two red dice<br/>- 12 cards for the various charts and tables for the three games<br/>- 5 sheets of counters, for a total of 480 counters - consisting of the three sheets for the original game, and two new ones for the expansion. Counters might still be a bit thin for some tastes (but then they would not fit in the box) but the diecutting is good.<br/>- 3 maps, the original 11x17&quot; central map plus the north and south 8x11&quot; extensions (Siberia-Manchuria and Siam-Burma-India, respectively). The North map matches up well and obviously. For the South map the area north of Burma-1 is Burma-3, and the area north of Burma-2 is Burma-4. The unnamed area north of India-8 is Nepal and is impassable.<br/><br/>This was the last version of Battle for China to appear before the Decision Games edition of the basic 1937-41 game in late 2009. Production of the deluxe version is limited, fewer than 125 copies I believe.<br/><br/>When the Decision Games edition appears, the designer will post an updated and integrated set of rules and charts for the expansion kit, along with homemade redrawn extension maps to fit the larger 22x34&quot; map. The counter sheets provided do not need to be changed, but be advised that the counters in the Decision Games edition have been changed to iconic style, with a different format.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Battle for China, 1937-1941 (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to 1950s USA &mdash; the era of huge cars, rock 'n' roll, and alien activity! To prevent a mass panic, the President has ordered his generals to store all evidence of the existence of aliens.<br/><br/>In Area 51, a secret military base in the Nevada desert, players store all the futuristic weapons, unbelievable tools, and alien corpses in high-end storage facilities. However, this base is capable of hiding only certain artifacts and must be improved all the time. The generals try to outperform each other in building and upgrading the facilities and the infrastructure in addition to finding the optimal logistics for storing the artifacts to please the President.<br/><br/>In Area 51: Top Secret, players encounter several categories of artifacts &mdash; ships, weapons, tools, etc. &mdash; which are numbered 1-4 to show how dangerous they are (and therefore what security level is needed to store them).<br/><br/>Players must build storage facilities to store these artifacts. Artifact cards need to be collected, but the decisive element in the game is that once a player chooses to pick up a pile of artifact cards to place them into storage facilities, they need to store ALL cards possible, including those that will score points for the other players. The main strategy of the game is thus to use the existing storage facilities and transportation vehicles to optimize one's own scoring.<br/><br/>",

Real estate prices are skyrocketing, and it&rsquo;s time for a new class of skyscraper, the &ldquo;Supertall&rdquo;, to reshape the skyline.<br/><br/>In Supertall, 2-3 players are competing developers, presenting their plans for new skyscrapers. Featuring 18 Plan cards with various amenities, players draw 1 card each turn and must choose to add it to their skyscrapers, pass it to their rivals, or leverage it for special abilities. Once all the plans have been built, players score points based on the mix of Residential, Business, Entertainment, and Green Space amenities in their skyscrapers. However, due to constant lobbying, City Hall will heavily tax one of those types making it worth 0 points, so be sure to plan ahead.

        "description": "Discovery (also sold as Destination Tresor in French, and Discovery Island in Sweden) is an interesting deduction game of discovery. Each player begins in an unknown location on an island (the opponent picks where the other starts), and each has the same goal: find the hidden treasure. The treasure is hidden in one of 28 spots on the island, and there are 7 clues available in special checkpoints to help determine where it is. The island is made up of 5 different types of terrain, and for each type of terrain there is a set of corresponding hexes.<br/><br/>In play, one player calls a direction (Northeast, South, etc.) and the other player (who knows where you are) reveals a hex on the type of terrain you just stepped into. On the back of the hex there is a number, showing how many hours have been used.  Each turn, a player gets 12 hours worth of movement. By moving this way, you can eventually figure out where you are and then start moving with more accuracy.<br/><br/>The game uses a clever device that reveals only one spot of a 6 x 6 matrix. A card, from a large set, is initially placed and this determines where the treasure will be for that game. When players get to a checkpoint, they can reveal that spot on the card to get a clue. The clues can tell you which of 4 types of treasure spots is &quot;live&quot;, and also the six surrounding terrain types. The board is well designed so that with a few clues you can narrow down the options of spots.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OMEGA was born as an experiment on complexity and intuitive arithmetic. Both concepts teamed up to create this little monster. It feels like a cross between Hex and Go.<br/><br/>In OMEGA, players try to create groups of their colors by placing stones in a hexagonal grid, in order to score the most points. But each player places stones of all colors in play.<br/><br/>The final score for each color is calculated by multiplying the sizes of the different groups of that color.<br/><br/>Thanks to the 6 acrylic 'corners' included in the game, it can be played on various board sizes. From 5-hexes side to 10-hexes side. Other board shapes can be configured, too.<br/><br/>You will soon realize that you don&acute;t need to calculate your score during play (multiplying your group values). Use an intuitive strategy instead. How? You must figure it out by yourself.<br/><br/>2-player games of size beyond 8 are only recommended for experienced players and scores are often gigantic.<br/><br/>OMEGA was initially designed for 2 players. The designer then added the 3 and 4 player option, but the gameplay is completely different.<br/><br/>",

Players have until all of the technology has been destroyed or looted from Atlantis to decide when to flee to the other kingdoms on a first come, first serve basis.

Draft trade tiles from a common area, paying for them with time, in a marketplace where the costs shift like the sands from game to game. Make clever use of tradewinds to activate your drafted tiles again and again. Manage the space on your ship to carry only the most precious cargo as you make your way to floating bazaars to sell your goods. Watch for fluctuating values in the markets to make sure your goods bring in the most gold and ensure your victory as the shrewdest trader in The Bazaars of Ubar!<br/><br/>During setup, Trade tiles are laid out in a grid in the center of the table. On a player's turn, they take a trade tile from the center area and, paying a time cost for it. The time cost is spent by moving their ship along the path toward the next bazaar.<br/><br/>After taking a trade tile, a player adds it to their tableau adjacent to previously taken tiles - activating the newly taken tile and previously taken tiles in their tableau according to the direction of the trade winds on their tile. Trade tiles allow players to earn new goods from the supply or trade goods they already have for more desirable goods.<br/><br/>When a player's ship reaches a bazaar, they may sell any number of the goods they have in their ship (to marketplaces with fluctuating values that vary from game to game). When all players have reached a bazaar, the trade tiles in the center are cleared and a new grid of trade tiles created.<br/><br/>When all players have reached the third bazaar, the game ends and the player with the most gold from selling their goods wins!<br/><br/>",

Approximately 1400 tanks and assault guns met head to head near the town of Prochorovka, in a battle that became a desperate close range shoot-out which would decide the ultimate sucess or failure of Operation Zitadelle.<br/><br/>The 2nd SS Panzer Korps began it's attack on July 3rd, and spent the next 8 days breaking through the dense Russian defensive positions. During the late afternoon and evening of the 11th, they broke through and replused a counterattack by the Russian 31st Tank Corps. Reorganizing during the night, the panzers struck northward before dawn on the 12th. As dawn broke, the lead German elements ran head-on into the lead elements of the Soviet 5th Gaurds Tank Army and the battle was on. It was to last all day, in confused and savage fighting at close ranges. In the end, the Russians were driven back from the town, but the Germans were unable to push them any further. Losses exceeded three hundred tanks on each side.<br/><br/><br/>This wargame was first published as one of the Task Force Games Pocket Games.  It was later released in a boxed version with the name on the cover shortened to Armor at Kursk.<br/><br/>Units are German Battalions and Russian Regiments &amp; Brigades, though all are similar in size and manpower. Hexes are 400 meters across, turns represent one hour.<br/><br/>",

The board is hexagonal with each player having a path by which his pawns can visit his direct left and right neighbors. In addition, each side has a direct path to the center of the board. Players other than the direct neighbors could only be reached by traveling through the neighbors or the center.<br/><br/>Included in the game are 6 domestic army pawns for each player, 36 mercenary pawns, 12 ambassador cards, 6 lady cards, 50 coins and 2 dice. At the beginning, each player receives the 6 domestic army pawns, 1 lady, 2 ambassadors and 3 coins.<br/><br/>Combats are resolved without random chance by simple calculation of the difference between the number of pawns. <br/>Income is provided to the player on the basis of the number of spaces occupied by a single domestic pawn. Each player may offer alliance to any player and if accepted, ambassadors are exchanged. Alliance permits joint attacks and unlike some other games, alliances are law: allies absolutely cannot attack one another.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "They say the town of Wode Ridge has been cursed ever since Amos Wode founded the place way back in the 1800s. The sleepy, Colorado tourist trap looks plum peaceful in its postcards, but there&rsquo;s a darkness about the town you can&rsquo;t quite put your finger on. Some even say the town has an &ldquo;other side&rdquo; where the crazy roams unchecked, but I can&rsquo;t speak much to that.<br/><br/>By the 1980s, things had gotten especially weird--at least until a bunch of kids started snooping around trying to get to the bottom of the town&rsquo;s supernatural goings-on. While the adults were worried about their Tupperware parties, these youngsters were out tracking down clues and finding trouble before it found them. And rumor has it they found some kind of creature in the woods too which might explain all them FBI fellers around here asking questions.<br/><br/>And here they come now, riding around town on their bicycles. I just hope they figure things out soon. Looks like some kind of dark cloud is rolling in right behind them.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Take on the role of a group of kids and their newfound alien friend, and explore Wode Ridge looking for evidence of the town&rsquo;s supernatural happenings. But be wary, the Darkness knows you&rsquo;re on to it, so it&rsquo;ll be trying to get you before you get it. Find enough evidence to figure out what monster is currently ailing the town and then defeat it before time runs out and the Darkness overtakes you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Any marble is placed in a cell in the grid, whose position is corresponding to a category column and a letter row: you can take the marble finding a word in the category of the column, beginning with the letter in the row.<br/><br/>For instance, if the category is &quot;Games&quot;, and letter is &quot;C&quot;, you can also say... &quot;Category Game&quot;!  Players are arranged in teams, then the starting player has 15 seconds to try to get as many marbles as he can, saying words matching the category on the column, and beginning with the letter on the row. The uncomplete grid is then passed to the next player, who has 15 seconds to take some of the remaining marbles, and so on. When the grid is empty, or when everyone passes (i.e. when you only have on the grid marbles corresponding to a difficult or impossible letter/category match), points are scored. Category cards and letter tiles are then changed, marbles are randomly put again on the grid, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Category Game is a very nice reworking of a traditional pencil and paper game: I appreciate the fast pace induced by the 15 seconds sandtimer, the partnership play, the good assortment of category cards, and... the arguing! In effect, some of the cards are an undoubtful source for arguments (or - when the going get tough - for &quot;marbles wars&quot;... be careful!): &quot;Into the sea&quot;, for instance... What if someone says &quot;Cars&quot; or &quot;Chairs&quot;? Shouldn't cars or chairs get into the sea?<br/><br/>",

Each round, a player rolls the eight colored dice, then players draft one die in turn; you extend the length of your worm by drawing a vertical or horizontal line from your worm's current location that matches the length of the die rolled. Since you are a mindless space worm, you can't cross over your path or else you'll eat your own tail! If you can't move, you cross off one of your hearts.<br/><br/>If you pass through a fruit after drafting a die of the matching color, you score 1 bonus point. Should you cross out all fruit of one type, you score the highest available bonus for this fruit, lowering that potential bonus for all other players.<br/><br/>Once a player has eaten out all of the fruit in the solar system or lost their fourth heart, the game ends. Players tally their four fruit scores, earn 2 points for each remaining heart, then lose points based on how many of the eight planets they didn't visit.<br/><br/>Space Worm includes four different maps featuring wormholes, forcefields, and more, and is the first title in ITB's Lunchbox Series.<br/><br/>Per ITB:<br/>This game is strictly limited to 1000 copies, and will not be available beyond 31st December 2020.<br/><br/>",

In that campaign the Japanese overran Malaya, captured the strategic British base of Singapore and conquered Burma. Later campaigns saw the Japanese-Allied struggle for the Indian Frontier, the deployment of the Chindits, and the final Japanese grasp during the Imphal campaign, followed by the Allied counter-attack that won victory in the theater.<br/><br/>CBI is intended to be a simple game: it allows for the completion of the entire four year campaign within 16 turns.  It includes all critical operations, however: land and air warfare, special operations and logistical considerations. The game has two players: the Allied and the Japanese.  Players conduct operations with their units in their own turns. The objective of the game is to capture strategic locales and destroy enemy units.<br/><br/>Game scale: Each map hex equals 60 kilometers. Each turn represents three months of operations. Each airstrike represents one or two British wings, US groups or Japanese air regiments.<br/><br/>The game includes three scenarios. Scenario 1, &quot;Singapore to Calcutta&quot; is the campaign game, 1941 - 1945 (16 turns). Scenario 2 covers the last Japanese offensive in Southeast Asia: &quot;Imphal&quot;. Scenario 3 is a short scenario entitled &quot;Fall of an Empire&quot; and covers only the first few turns of the war, through the 1942-III turn. In addition there are two scenario variants, &quot;Operation Zipper&quot; and &quot;Historic Withdrawals&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ecologies: Hidden Habitats is the third game in the series, it is playable as a stand alone game or used in combination with the previous two ECOLOGIES card games.<br/><br/>Players build and maintain food webs in diverse environments. Healthy ecologies reward you with bonus powers and perks. Watch out though, as others may decide it&rsquo;s easier to disturb and degrade your ecosystem than nurture their own.<br/><br/>Designed by a biology teacher, the game includes 76 unique organisms, 7 biomes, and beautiful vintage Victorian art. (108 cards total)<br/><br/>Cards are arranged with plants/algae on the bottom and predators on top. Players negotiate trades and use biotic and abiotic factor cards to affect their webs and the webs of players around them. It is a race to get to 12 victory points, with players using different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or disrupting other ecologies.<br/><br/>Gameplay is rooted in authentic science, as it is used in the classroom to teach real concepts to biology students. While it is scientific enough for the classroom, it is also strategic enough for any game night.<br/><br/>The points system is based on ecological trophic levels. The producers (plants) are worth less and as you make your way up the pyramid organisms are worth more, as it takes a lot of energy to sustain them. In real life only roughly 10% of the energy makes it from one level to the next, meaning you have to have acres of land and hundreds of animals just to sustain one apex predator.<br/><br/>This game is a sequel AND an expansion. When using the game as an expansion, you can customize the deck to include cards from all three games, including cards you love and excluding ones you don&rsquo;t. Some players love aggressive &ldquo;take that&rdquo; mechanics, while others find them stressful. Some players love particular healthy ecology bonuses, while others feel they are overpowered. With multiple decks, you can create a customized experience to fit your group.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;d like to maintain the same game length and feel, we recommend choosing 10 factor cards and 7 different biomes.<br/><br/>Note: more cards = a longer game<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Unlock your past. Experience the nightmare. Embrace the dawn.<br/>     <br/>You have awoken in a world that can't possibly exist. Everywhere you look you see some fresh nightmare; some new perversion of reality. You don't remember how you got here. In fact, your mind feels as though it has shattered, its fractured memories scattered in the wind. Despite this, you see hints of your past all around you, glimmers of the familiar tormenting you amidst the twisted, fluctuating landscape. What's worse, though, is that as you stumble through this place you realize you are not alone. There are monstrous, impossible beings shuffling and slithering and skittering toward you, hideous beyond all comprehension. Their most disturbing aspect, however, isn't the abject terror they exude. It's that you recognize them.<br/><br/>It's not long before you discover there are other people here, too, wandering through this fever dream with you. They seem as lost, as scared, and as broken as you are. If you want to survive this place and escape, then you will have to band together with them, setting aside your differences and distrust to push back the oncoming torrent of seething corporeal chaos. Because otherwise you won't just die: your very essence will cease to exist.<br/><br/>Dawn of Madness is a story-driven cooperative game of survival horror for 1-4 players. Set in the same universe as the breakout hit board game Deep Madness, Dawn of Madness is a completely standalone, unique, and terrifying gaming experience. During the game players will assume the role of wanderers trapped in a feverish hellscape, surrounded by the distorted echoes of their own history. As one of these wanderers, you must seek to discover what led you to this horrific world, struggling to survive as your and your fellow players' stories unfold across multiple chapters in an ongoing campaign. <br/>   <br/>Experience true horror unlike any board game before as you are immersed in stories of terror and madness, using the amplified powers of your mind to survive and fight back against the encroaching aberrations out to devour you. Bind your consciousness to other players' in order to accomplish difficult tasks, and earn coda cards and memories to boost your abilities while uncovering your past. All the while you will be gathering story points toward one of the multiple endings for each wanderer, and in the campaign's epic finale the wanderer - and the ending - with the most story points will spawn their respective terrifying, relentless final boss.  <br/>    <br/>The choices made throughout a chapter - and even the order those choices are made in - influence almost every aspect of the game, ensuring that no playthrough will ever be exactly the same. Adding even more variety, danger, and tension are the chapter-agnostic mini bosses and their distortions who plague each game in unique and changing ways, summoning vortexes of energy to alter the course of play and bring fresh dangers with every round. And all these challenges don't even include the malformations: alternate versions of the wanderers themselves, each one increasingly more corrupt than the one before, and each one able to take players into the darkest recesses of their comrades' souls. <br/>      <br/>Hearkening back to survival-horror classics like Silent Hill, The Evil Within, and Alan Wake, Dawn of Madness is a mind-bending, psychological experience unlike any other attempted in a board game. So gather your wits and steel your nerves for a trip into other universes and the depths of the human consciousness. Sometimes, the greatest horrors of all lie within.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The new old game that combines philosophies from Pool, Pinball, Shuffle Board, Curling and Black Jack all mixed up with magnetic pull to create a fast moving new board game that is sure to provide many hours of enjoyment.<br/><br/>The homemade and well crafted board includes a magnetized &quot;Shucker&quot; to propel the puck down the board and magnets placed throughout the board to deflect and alter the course of the puck.

She demanded the soul of one of them. She will take her prize by a murderer who lives among them. One of the people they have offended, hurt, or ruined will take revenge, shedding the blood of one of the nobles guided by Death. They listed these people: 28 suspect. This night all will be revealed.<br/>Take much care about who lives close to you or you could be the one who pays this covenant.<br/><br/>In Covenant, you take the role of one of those greedy nobles. Your objective is twofold: Ensure that the murderer doesn't end up in your district at the end of night, and become the one with the most points to be proclaimed the new heir of the crown. To do that, you put in game the characters from your hand to your district, take advantage of their abilities, and expel any character that seems to be suspicious.

        "description": "Not all seeds are good, so be careful what you sow! In Pumpkin Patch: Bad Seeds, players will compete to harvest seeds from burgeoning pumpkin patch filled with ugly, scary, and horrifically creepy pumpkins.<br/><br/>Pumpkin Patch: Bad Seeds is a game of pumpkin planting, crow scaring, and tile laying for 1-3 players. Each round, players must choose which type of pumpkin to plant in order to help grow the budding pumpkin patch. Each pumpkin planted grants the players victory seeds. The goal of the game is to collect as many seeds as possible before the final pumpkin is planted. Players will use Baby Boos, Blazes, and Warty Goblins to collect seeds and thwart their opponents efforts to do the same!<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>In Pumpkin Patch, players take turns planting pumpkins in a race to collect pumpkin seeds! There are three stages to each turn:<br/><br/>1. Play a card from your hand or the compost to collect seeds.<br/>2. Move a crow to block other players.<br/>3. Discard any number of cards. Refill your hand.<br/><br/>Once the largest pumpkin in the patch has been planted, your ghastly garden is complete!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Go for it on 4th down and reach the end zone to score a touchdown. Then try to stop the opposing team by sacking their quarterback.<br/><br/>The team that starts on offense starts on their own 25-yard line. They have 4 downs to get to the 50-yard line or beyond. Once they reach (or cross) the 50-yard line, they receive a new set of downs and now have 4 tries to get to the opposing team&rsquo;s end zone.<br/><br/>Both team simultaneously roll all their dice. The symbol that appears the most on each team&rsquo;s set of dice becomes their play. The team that rolled the most dice with the same symbol wins the roll. Apply the outcome of the winning play by moving the Football Token and/or Down Marker Token accordingly. See the Dice chart for a description of each symbol.<br/><br/>The game ends when one team has scored 21 points or more.

        "description": "Players choose which of the four racetracks will be used for the game. Each player is handed a copy of the appropriate race form (which should be studied!). The eleven racehorses, which are numbered two through twelve, are randomized and are bought, one at a time, by the players in an open auction. Money spent in the auction will be brought back into the game during the third, fifth and eighth races.<br/><br/>Eight races make a complete game and each follows the same procedure. Each player, in turn, has the option to make as many bets as one wants but each bet is made &ldquo;across the board.&rdquo; All bets are made in 150-skin (the game&rsquo;s monetary unit) increments: 50 to win, 50 to place and 50 to show. After everyone has placed their bets, the money is divided as equally as possible into seven stacks.<br/><br/>After all bets have been placed, the race is run. A horse has completed a circuit of the track when five Xs have been placed next to it. Sometimes horses begin with some Xs and sometimes the favorites, horses 6, 7 and 8, need an extra X.<br/>When a player rolls the dice, that player may give the horse rolled an X and pass on the dice or give that horse a / (half-X) and roll again to that horse an X. When three horses have finished the race, the owner(s) of the winning horse and winning bettors are paid. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Across the Board features a pari-mutual betting system to mimic a real racetrack. There are no fixed odds. The winners win what the losers lost. That makes Across the Board unique among horse racing games.<br/><br/>",

The city's ports are filled with rugged individuals prepared for the difficult tasks ahead. Gather the crew, board the schooners, cast your nets, and catch loads of fish as you sail toward victory.<br/><br/>The two-player game Fisheries of Gloucester lasts six &quot;days&quot; (rounds). On each day, players have a designated number of hours to spend to perform various actions, such as charting the course, sailing your boats, and catching fish. Each player has a fleet of three boats that can be advanced by first &quot;charting a course&quot; (laying down an ocean tile, which have various polynomial shapes). With courses set, players can move their boats along the course, racing against other boats to find the prime fishing spots.<br/><br/>Players earn points by catching different varieties of fish and by finishing the game on one of the islands in the ocean.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The animals have escaped from the zoo, and it's up to the zookeepers to get everyone back in their cages &mdash; but lots of things can happen while you're chasing critters...<br/><br/>In Zooscape, originally released as Curio Collectors (はんか通骨董市), you must prove yourself the best zookeeper by rounding up animals worth the most points, but remember that all the animals need enough space in their cage to stay happy! Shove too many in one cage, and they'll be worth almost nothing to you.<br/><br/>In each round, someone deals a line of twelve cards face up on the table; each card depicts an animal (a curio in the original version) along with a point value and a limit. The starting player splits the line in two by choosing a dividing point. Each player holds two cards showing the left or right group, and each player chooses, then simultaneously reveals which group of cards they want. If only one player chooses a side, they take all the cards in that group and add them to their personal tableau. If a side is chosen by more than one player, however, then one of the players who chose it splits that group into two smaller groups, then everyone who originally chose this group secretly votes again for which group they want. This process repeats with each group until either each player has taken some number of cards or groups have been reduced to single cards and two or more players are still voting to take them; in this case, those single cards are placed in a special pile. At the start of a round, the starting player adds a special card to the line-up and whoever wins this card collects all of the animals in this special pile.<br/><br/>Players complete three rounds this way, then score points. If a group of cards has exceeded the limit on it &mdash; say, by collecting four cards when the limit is three &mdash; then the owner of these cards scores only 1 point per card instead of the point value for each card. Some cards in the game allow you to remove cards from your collection, possibly allowing you to stay under the limit and score more points. You might also start trying not to win cards so as not to spoil the value of what you've already collected. (In Curio Collectors, you would effectively crash the market value for an item by trying to sell too many of them at one time.) Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>Zooscape has also been published as Kimono, with players collecting Japan-related collectibles and cultural objects.<br/><br/>",

In the ensuing campaign, known as the Seven Days Battles, Lee flings his men into attack after attack, always threatening to, but never quite succeeding in, crush the federals. Yet so completely frustrated and demoralized is McClellan that he calls off the federal invasion that reached the very gates of Richmond.

Using hidden movement, players must maneuver historic armies while seeking to discover which combinations of units and tactics lead to victory, or are formulas for defeat.<br/><br/>Lee Takes Command is the forth of Clash of Arms Games' simulation of the great campaigns of the American Civil War. Lee Takes Command brings the struggle of the Seven Days campaign alive with a four color 34&quot; x 22&quot; map and 240 multi-color counters.

There are two ways to play. In Solo Mode, a single player becomes Conan, battling the game itself. In Battle Mode, one player becomes Conan, and the other player becomes the twisted wizard Yara, casting spells, deploying soldiers and eldritch horrors to punish Conan for his temerity.<br/><br/>Conan's adventure in Tower of the Elephant moves him from the town of Maul to a moonlit garden. From there, he will climb to the top of an impossible tower and face terrors he never imagined!<br/><br/>Conan's adventure through the Tower of the Elephant involves overcoming the challenges of many unique locations, each represented by a Tenfold Dungeon Box. Each location is explored in a single turn which consists of a Dice, Location, Combat, and Mopping Up phase. There are 10 locations in Tower of the Elephant which Conan must overcome to emerge victorious!<br/><br/>Players are not required to complete every location in a single sitting, and may stop playing between locations in order to resume play in another play session.

        "description": "GiftTRAP Lite is a quick simple filler card game themed around giving gifts. Unlike the full board game, which is focused on two dimensions (giving and getting), this is a card game focused on simply giving gifts that people like.  It is also suited to playing in teams, unlike the board game which is very much about you, the individual.<br/><br/>GiftTRAP lite is played over a series of rounds where players/teams take turns to be the judge and receive gits from their friends.  This is a game where less really is more. Each player can give 1, 2 or 3 gifts (as a collection). The judge must decide which collection is best.  Giving just 1 gift will get you three points, two gifts = two points and three gifts just one point, so the better you know the judge the more likely you can win more points with less cards.<br/><br/>The winner is the player/team with the most points after each player/team has been the judge twice.<br/><br/>This game is produced as a standalone game, that also happens to double as an expansion to the main game simply because the gifts included can be combined with the main game.  You can of course play this game with the contents from the original game.<br/><br/>",

To win you have to outfox your opponents and get into their heads! Gameplay is fast paced and it's ultra-portable.<br/><br/>THE DECK<br/><br/>One complete deck of Balk cards includes:<br/>10 point cards<br/>10 blue bid cards<br/>10 green bid cards<br/>10 salmon bid cards<br/>10 purple bid cards<br/><br/>GOAL<br/><br/>The goal is to win each round by collecting more points than your opponents. The first player to win three rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>SET UP<br/><br/>The gold point cards are shuffled and placed in the center. Each player chooses a color and takes all ten of their bid cards. With fewer than four players, unused bid cards are removed from play.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>Turn over the top point card and place it face up. Each player bids for the point card by placing the bid card of their choice face down on the table. Once all players have bid, flip the bid cards over. The player with the highest bid wins the point card and takes it.<br/><br/>If more than one player bids the same highest card, no one wins the point card and it is removed from the round. All played bid and point cards must be placed face up on the table so all players can see them.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/>Each round ends when all ten point cards have been played. Players then add up their points and the player with the highest score wins the round. If more than one player ties for the highest score there is no winner for the round. There are no ties in Balk!

Upon arrival, you discover some other witches have had the same idea. Now it is time to throw down and do a little magic to claim the forest as your own. If those other witches won't leave, they are going to get witch slapped!<br/><br/>Each player chooses a witch and is given nine lives. Next they are dealt five spell cards for their hand and one spell card face down. The dealer is the witch with the lowest life. Once the dealer says go the round begins!<br/><br/>The round is played over three phases. 1) Super Fast Set Collection - the witches are trying to collect a set of matching spell cards via Super Fast card drafting (not kidding about the Super Fast, if you aren't fast you might as well witch slap yourself....) 2) Slapping - once the witch has collected a set of cards they &quot;Slap&quot; the card in the middle of the table that matches the number they have collected (first witch to slap must have 4 or 5 collected). 3) Spell Casting- this is done simultaneously. The witches reveal the spell they are attempting to cast based on the collected spell cards and card they slapped. If the numbers match it successes, if it doesn't, the spell backfired just witch slapped themselves!<br/><br/>Most spells take life away from other witches, but some protect the witch. Once you lose your life you are eliminated from the forest and shamed by the other witches! The winner is the witch that is the last witch standing!<br/><br/>",

They have to think on their feet and adapt their news stories to different newscaster roles.<br/><br/>Each round, the players need to adapt the story elements they are given to the news segment they have been assigned.

The promise of an unforgettable trip from Gdynia to New York attracted onto the ship's deck the most prominent personas, who wished to take part in the adventure of their lives.  No one suspected that the scenes taken straight from the bestselling crime novels will soon unfold aboard the legendary transatlantic ship. Audacious theft of the countess Pawlicka's priceless jewels has shaken both the passengers and  crew members alike. However the most shocking fact is undeniable truth that the thief is hidden among them...<br/><br/>MS Batory is a deduction game, which in innovatory way makes use of three-dimensional game board. The players take a role of detectives, and their task will be to identify the thief as quickly as possible. Each character from among thirteen suspects has a set of unique features - gender, age and a role. The players will ask each other questions, based on which they'll be able to determine the innocence of the suspects. At the beginning of the game, one of the cards which represents characters will be randomly selected and put aside - this character is a thief.  The rest of the remaining cards will be distributed among the detectives.<br/><br/>The player's round consists of the two phases:<br/><br/>1. Movement Phase<br/><br/>The players move characters around the deck of MS Batory. They have at their disposal a three-dimensional ship, which consists of  several dozen rooms, located on the three separate decks. During this phase, the Players will move characters and perform different tasks - like for example: &quot;Meet up with the member of the crew&quot; or &quot;Go to the observation deck&quot;. By performing those actions they will gain question cards, which are used later during investigation phase. Characters need to be moved around the ship so that current task is completed as many times as possible. All the while it has to be remembered, that arrangement created by character's placement can hinder or help when it is time for asking questions in investigation phase.<br/><br/>2. Investigation Phase<br/><br/>During movement phase, the players had gained question cards. Each of these cards contains one trait - age, gender, role, number, room or deck. Using these cards, the player will formulate a single question, which he will ask to another detective.  This question can be of any kind, but it has to be based upon the question cards at a player's disposal.<br/><br/>For example, when in possession of  cards: &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;deck&quot; the player can ask another detective &quot;Are there any women among your characters which are currently on the observation deck?&quot; On the other hand, having a more varied set of cards like &quot;age&quot;, &quot;role&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;room&quot; allows for asking more detailed questions such as: &quot;How many of your middle aged crew members are currently in the cabin?&quot; Skillfully asked question allows the detective to eliminate further characters from his list of suspects, without giving away too many clues to the rest of the players.<br/><br/>The winner is the detective who first identifies the thief!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Since the beginning of time, wizards too powerful to be named have tried to learn all the secrets of the universe. Through millennia they studied and learned and traveled through time and space growing to become the most powerful entities of the universe. And today, after countless centuries they finally meet in the battle ground to prove once and for all who is the most powerful. But, after countless years, age has taken its toll. The wizards may be powerful, but only if they remember what each spell does. It is a combat of...witless wizards!<br/><br/>Witless Wizards is a fast and humorous card game for 2-4 players played in only 15-25 minutes.<br/><br/>At the start of the game the players choose 3 of the available decks to shuffle together to form a common deck. Each round, all players will draw cards from the common deck to equip themselves and their opponents. On your turn you draw cards one at a time and have to decide which player you are going to give the drawn card getting to keep one card for youself and one to an opponent.<br/><br/>If you draw a good card, you can keep it for yourself, but perhaps the next card is even better or it makes a great combination for your opponent. Perhaps you need to use some of those concentration cubes you kept to draw additional cards.<br/><br/>In order to win, players have to equip themselves with better weapons than their opponents and deal enough damage to be the last wizard standing, declaring themselves the most powerful wizard of all time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this cousin of Saint Petersburg, each player represents a monarch dragon clan, and attempts to assert herself as the Dragon Monarch by game end, by securing the most Royals (victory points).  In order to facilitate this process, players will use their Geld (money) to hire Dragon Lairds (aristocrats) and buy Resources (buildings) and Commoners (peasants).  You can use precious Royals (your victory points) to acquire Dragon Havocs, which empower you to do anything from getting extra cash, to stealing things from your opponents.  The Havocs tend to be one-shot little guys, however, and are always discarded to the bottom of the discard deck, as far out of reach as possible from those cards that pilfer the discard pile.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, you accumulate the Geld and Royals that your acquisitions generate for your clan.  At the end of the game, you additionally receive any Finale Royals on cards as end-game victory points.<br/><br/>From the Margaret Weis web site: <br/>Deep in the heart of an island continent, many years ago, was a long forgotten land of ancient Saureans&hellip; Dragons of all sizes and shapes, who had, through the generations tamed the foolish races of men, dwarves, and elves that lived among them. Over the centuries, they refined their techniques and now were trying to gain control over all the surrounding dragon countries. There could be only one Dragon Monarch, but who would it be?<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player is given a dragon clan and chooses to play either the king or queen of that clan.  The object is for your clan to score the most points in Royals by the end of the game and thus become the ruling Dragon Monarch.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First Blood: Guadalcanal is a battalion-level game simulating the Battle of Guadalcanal. Starting in August of 1942 and concluding in early 1943, the US Marines invaded and captured a small airfield, and then, with the US Army, spent months fighting off Japanese attempts to recapture or destroy the airfield.<br/><br/>Guadalcanal is considered one of the turning points in the War in the Pacific. Japanese expansion was stopped, and the Japanese Army confronted a foe who didn't flee from banzai charges. The Japanese found themselves unable to support offensive efforts on Guadalcanal and in New Guinea at the same time.<br/><br/>First Blood: The Guadalcanal Campaign was included with the SILVER Anniversary Issue of the A.H.I.K.S.-Vol.-26~#6-magazine and the game is akin to a &quot;kit&quot; in that you have to mount and cut-out the counters. They have been printed on adhesive backed paper which makes it easier for producing this aspect of the game.<br/><br/>The contents of the game include: the RULES Folder(8)-pages; a thick paper CHART; a Sheet of adhesive backed counters(over 150); &amp; a (4)-COLOR 11&quot; by 17&quot; thick paper Mapsheet; while players will need to provide their OWN 6-sided DIE.<br/><br/>The RULES contain the following sections of note: Off-board Movement; Artillery; I.J.N. Naval Units; U.S. Engineers; Airstrip Capacity; Air Units; Brief Historical Commentary; Counters mounting advice; &amp; the Turn Sequence on the back page. The Counters are RED/WHITE(Japanese)&amp; BLUE/WHITE(U.S.) which are Battalion level for ground units, Air Unit Squadrons, individual Ships(Destroyers), Damaged &amp; Destroyed Airfield markers, &amp; Off-board Movement markers. There are MANY different Combat Unit types as well as various Aircraft depicted in this although for game purposes, these are of either Fighter or Bomber types(and F4F-Wildcats can be considered as either).<br/><br/>The Game Chart is printed with the Setup-/Reinforcements-/Combat Results Explanations on one side with a Units-/Terrain Identification Charts on the reverse. Players may want to copy this prior to play for EACH player to have available. The game Mapsheet covers the area around Henderson Field and it's environs. Also on the Mapsheet are: the seperate Japanese &amp; American Attack Tables; Terrain Movement Cost/Defense Modifiers Table; Off-board Movement Boxes; Reinforcements Starting locations; and BOXES for I.J.A.F. &amp; I.J.N. - Reserve &amp; Attack; and U.S.A.F. Reserve, C.A.P., &amp; Ground Attack.<br/><br/>The Turn Sequence is as follows: 1.Japanese Reinforcement phase; 2.Japan. Movement phase; 3.Japan. Combat phase; 4.Japan. Supply Resolution phase; 5.Japan. Strategic phase; 6., 7., 8.,-U.S.Player's similar to Japanese 1st 3-phases; 9.U.S. Engineer phase; 10.U.S. Air phase; 11.Check Victory Conditions or begin NEW turn. Overall, a very professional appearing production considering it's subject matter &amp; their operating strictures while the graphics are very detailed, especially for the Aircraft types depicted.<br/><br/>Subsequently republished after major development in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #178 by Decision Games. The original AHIKS version is now available for free download.<br/><br/>Game scale in S&amp;T #178 version: approx. 600 yards/hex; units are mostly battalions.<br/><br/>",

To win, players will need to use the right combination of residential, commercial and industrial development as well as downtown construction to gain the most points.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player selects one of the square city cards from their hand and adds it to the city, overlapping at least one existing square. They must then move their planner to one of the four squares of the new card. If they left the zone they were previously in, they will score points for the size of that zone with additional bonuses for connected parks and mansions and penalties for connected parking lots and abandoned houses. Zoning out also helps build one of the city's four downtown towers, which award points at the end of the game based on who contributed to each of them the most.<br/><br/>Mastering Zoned Out takes good timing and clever card placement. In the game's advanced mode, players will also be competing to earn points from a variety of public and private objectives for the city.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the Decision Games web site:)<br/><br/>Luftwaffe is an update of the classic Avalon Hill game covering the US strategic bombing campaign over Europe in World War II. As the US commander, your mission is to eliminate key German industrial complexes. You select the targets, direct the bombers, and plan a strategy intended to keep the Luftwaffe off-balance. As the German commander, the entire arsenal of German aircraft is at your disposal against the finest in Allied designs. Turns are quarterly, with German reinforcements keyed to that player's production choices. Units are wings and squadrons, and they're rated by type, sub-type, firepower, maneuverability and endurance. There are rules for radar, electronic warfare, variable production strategies, aces, target complexes, critical industries and diversion of forces to support the ground war. Beyond that, the original, classic game system remains essentially sound and hasn't otherwise been changed much. Most of the upgrade was in adding in additional rules, revising the order of battle, and adding more deployment and industrial options.<br/><br/>The reverse side of the units now represents a condition of loss of effectiveness, rather than loss of material strength. That's due to a combination of factors: damage to aircraft, an infusion of novice pilots, or to veteran crews suffering combat fatigue. Historically, pilot training and morale were critical factors, and the game now shows that. Replacement points represent not only new aircraft but also logistical support, rest and relaxation time for aircrews, all of which are used to restore fatigued units to good morale. Fatigued units count the same as veterans for stacking on the assumption that a shot up or novice unit would be more difficult to coordinate in the air.<br/><br/>The orders of battle are much the same as in the original game, though the German player now has to plan ahead if he wants to get jets. We added a US P-61 unit. While P-61s were historically used mostly as night fighters, the USAAF based two groups in France and used them as intruders, so they can be useful in attacking German airbases. The Americans also get a &quot;Droop-Snoot&quot; P-38. They were P-38s that had their guns replaced with a bombardier and were used as light bombers. While only a small number were built, they were effective as bomber-leaders, so they're included in this edition.<br/><br/>The German player can now increase his ability to stack by expending fuel points, representing training pilots in large-unit formation tactics. The US player doesn't need to do that, since they had a much bigger training base as well as unlimited fuel. Since the Germans now get additional oil, owing to a more historic evaluation of the Ploesti fields, they can maintain an effective fighter defense as long as they can preserve that reserve of fuel.<br/><br/>There are also other new targets on the map, such as the Germans' power generation grid. In the original game the US player had to bomb all the targets on the map to win. Given the way the victory point system now works, the Americans need bomb about four out of the five major target systems to win, thereby duplicating the historic result.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The extremely addicting and fun thing about games that push your luck is that one moment where you tell yourself this is the last card you will be taking... then you survive and you change your mind that you will be drawing just one more... and you still survive! And you promise that this next one would really be your last - and you survive yet again! Nothing beats that moment of suspense as you push your luck to the extreme, only to be rewarded by  glorious victory for your bravery.<br/><br/>In the light and casual game Queen of the Hill, players are queens vying for control of a celestial hill. Taking turns, they attempt to Gather, Form and Keep the strongest female warriors from different worlds and eras to join their army. However, this is a very dangerous act, and they cannot always control what they Gather. At the end of every round, players compare their total warrior scores Formed and the highest score wrests control of the hill. Control the hill twice and a player wins the game! Watch out though, the Dark One (also the only male in the game) might accidentally be Gathered and he will prey upon all the ladies. If you push your luck too hard, you might end up drawing him, and he will clear all your points and force you to end your gathering phase. How lucky are you feeling today? How far do you dare to push your luck? The more you push your luck without drawing the Dark One, the more likely the next opponent will attract him. And the more you push your luck, the more your foes are forced to push theirs if they are to beat you! The pressure is ON!<br/><br/>In this game when a female warrior is Gathered (drawn from the deck), a player has the option of Forming her into the current fighting group for that round and her Battle Points will be counted for the player's total score in that same round, or the player can choose to Keep her in his hand instead. If he Keeps her in his hand, she will not contribute any Battle Points to the player's score this round and be set aside for now. She does not go into the player's hand immediately. Only after the current round ends will all such Kept cards go to their players' hands, where they can now be played at critical moments to turn the tide against other players. An interesting thing to note is that Gathering is secretive. Other players will never know the actual total score of a player in a round (unless the Dark One wipes them out), but they will know the amount of cards drawn by the player so they can make a rough guess.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Experience the schemes and skulduggery of life at Medieval court in Game of Blame.<br/><br/>Take on one of six roles as a royal advisor and tell the Queen exactly why her Realm is on the brink of catastrophe. Accuse your colleagues, bury your secrets and dodge responsibility as the deck runs down and incriminating evidence mounts.<br/><br/>On your turn you play up to 3 cards to the &lsquo;blame pile&rsquo;. Each card played must share an emblem with the previous card (some cards have 2 emblems and either can be matched). In an ideal world, you want to utilise symbols that are not your own role as when it comes to apportioning blame (Accusation), the numbers of your cards vs the other person you have accused of being to blame will be counted.  <br/> Accusation is achieved by pointing your finger very vehemently at the accused player.  Keeping a mental track of what&rsquo;s been played is therefore a really good strategy as looking through the pile is not allowed.<br/><br/>The player with the most of their own emblem in the pile takes the entire blame pile.  However, you don&rsquo;t want those cards left in your hand at scoring either.  All the other players not to blame may &lsquo;bury&rsquo; a secret and discard one card of their &lsquo;own blame type&rsquo; out of their hand permanently.<br/><br/>The game stops and is scored when the draw pile is exhausted.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nomad is a family game for more experienced players. <br/>A nomadic tribe decides to move their camp to a remote but more suitable land. The chief hunter sets off to explore the unknown area and find the best route, and he will also acquire food for the tribe by hunting. However, the outcome of his actions will be largely determined by the prayers of the tribe&rsquo;s shaman.<br/><br/>The game is played in 12 rounds. Players have their own terrain boards where they advance their hunter and move their camp (a yurt) towards the desired location in the farthest corner of the board.  At the beginning of each round, the shamans offer sacrifices to the Goddess of Nature on the shaman hill. This will determine the order of players, and therefore the outcome of the next, preparation phase. Finally, players execute their actions: exploration by placing terrain tiles on the board, hunting, or moving their camp further.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players add up their scores received for the areas explored, the animals hunted and the distance they have reached with the camp. In addition, they can earn various bonuses for terrain tiles positioned in a smart way. Connected areas of the same terrain type on their board may also give multiple points, depending on size; some of these are easier, some more challenging to build. The player with the highest scores wins.<br/><br/>In Nomad, everyone builds the landscape for themselves, but this is by no means a solitary experience. Although there is a good deal of interaction during the first two phases, players make decisions on their own. This game is ideal for 2-4 players, playing time is about 1 hour.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>A Nomad csal&aacute;di j&aacute;t&eacute;k, gyakorlottabb j&aacute;t&eacute;kosok sz&aacute;m&aacute;ra. <br/>Egy nom&aacute;d t&ouml;rzs elhat&aacute;rozza, hogy &aacute;tk&ouml;lt&ouml;zteti a t&aacute;bor&aacute;t egy t&aacute;volabbi helyre.

A fordul&oacute; azzal kezdődik, hogy a s&aacute;m&aacute;ndombon a t&ouml;rzsek s&aacute;m&aacute;njai &aacute;ldozatot mutatnak be az istennőnek. Ekkor alakul ki a j&aacute;t&eacute;kosok sorrendje, mely meghat&aacute;rozza a k&ouml;vetkező, felk&eacute;sz&uuml;lő f&aacute;zis menet&eacute;t. Majd ezt k&ouml;vetik az akci&oacute;k: a terep felfedez&eacute;se tereplapk&aacute;k lehelyez&eacute;s&eacute;vel, vad&aacute;szat, vagy a t&aacute;bor mozgat&aacute;sa.<br/><br/>A j&aacute;t&eacute;k v&eacute;g&eacute;n a felfedezett ter&uuml;letek&eacute;rt, az elejtett vadak&eacute;rt, valamint a t&aacute;borral megtett t&aacute;vols&aacute;g&eacute;rt pontokat kapnak a j&aacute;t&eacute;kosok, sőt a tereplapk&aacute;k &uuml;gyes illeszt&eacute;s&eacute;vel k&uuml;l&ouml;nf&eacute;le b&oacute;nuszokat is szerezhetnek.

This year promises to be no exception, with two dozen of the region's most prominent landowners shortly to descend upon those hallowed woods for a weekend of impeccable social graces and bloody slaughter.<br/><br/>You, an ambitious young adventurer, are among those favoured few by simple expedient of a forged letter of introduction. And while the gentry pass the weekend in depriving the local copses of their birdlife, you plan to pass the time seducing four of their most delectable young wives, and relieving them of their jewels.<br/><br/>For you are such an attractive and nimble young person that success is assured, if only you can contrive some time alone with each of them. This won't be easy, under the watchful eyes of husbands and associated private secretaries. But if it were easy then there would be no fun in it, would there?<br/><br/>The Shooting Party is a solitaire game that can be played with a standard pack of cards. Your hand represents the guests in the room with you; manage their comings and goings within the strict rules of etiquette so as to reduce your hand to a single queen. Once alone with her you can score her and take her jewels (ace) if available. How many queens and aces you take determines your final score, from impecunious boor to filthy (rich) scoundrel.<br/><br/>",

Five public objectives are revealed, showing players the seashells they want to collect &mdash; whether by type, color, or overall pattern &mdash; on their 3x4 treasure chest board. You receive two secret objectives, keeping one and discarding the other. If you wish, you can play with each player taking a mermaid character (each of which has a unique power) and a moonshell, which serves as a wild seashell.<br/><br/>On a turn, you take three actions, repeating actions if you like. The actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Rotate: Turn the game board 90&ordm; in the direction of the tide. <br/>    Pull 2: If the two rock spaces on the side of the game board next to you don't have any seashells on them, choose a column, place the first two seashells in this column on these rocks, slide the remaining seashells toward you, then draw from the supply bag to fill the empty spaces.<br/>    Collect: Take a seashell from a rock in front of you, and add it to your treasure chest, sliding the seashell to the bottom of the column in which you place it.<br/><br/><br/>If the bag runs out of seashell tiles, add the sea urchin tiles to the bag and continue playing. When someone has filled their treasure chest with twelve tiles, finish the round, then score. The &quot;trove&quot; objective scores only for the player who has the most seashells of that type or color, whereas the other four types of objectives &mdash; collector, array, pairs, composition &mdash; can be scored by each player, sometimes multiple times. You also score 1 point for each sea urchin and if you achieved your secret objective, you score for that, too. Whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 2023 and the world is buzzing with excitement as a groundbreaking new project is announced. A leading corporation in space exploration has unveiled its plans to build a lunar complex unlike any other. The name of this project is LUNARIS 45, and its goal is to create a fully operational lunar colony that will be run entirely by artificial intelligence.<br/>As news of this project spreads, it captures the imagination of people all over the world. The idea of a self-sufficient lunar complex, with its own power sources, food production, and communication systems, is both ambitious and awe-inspiring. And with the use of advanced AI technology, the possibilities seem endless.<br/><br/>But as with any groundbreaking project, there are also concerns. Some wonder if the reliance on AI will make the colony vulnerable to malfunctions or even takeover by rogue AI. Others worry about the impact that such a project might have on the future of humanity.<br/>To address the concerns of vulnerability surrounding the LUNARIS 45 project, the corporation has assembled a team of the world&rsquo;s top experts in disaster response, AI safety, and cybersecurity. These scientists are tasked with identifying and anticipating any catastrophic scenarios that might arise from running a lunar colony entirely by AI.<br/><br/>But these experts are not paid in the usual way. Instead, they are offered a unique incentive: for every problem they solve, they will receive a generous amount of credits.<br/><br/>This payment system ensures that the team is motivated to work tirelessly, leaving no stone unturned in their quest to make the LUNARIS 45 project as safe and secure as possible. From the possibility of a solar flare disrupting the colony&rsquo;s power supply to the risk of rogue AI causing a catastrophic malfunction, the team of experts works to identify every conceivable problem and develop plans to mitigate them.<br/>Players will take on the role of one of these experts. Players will use their knowledge and powerful computers to predict and solve any problem that may arise. Players will be upgrading these computers to achieve better results and solve even more complicated problems. Players will also be working in a vast network where they can share knowledge and achieve the optimal solution to the most varied problems.<br/><br/>Players will be rolling dice to match the values on problem cards in order to solve any catastrophic events. Players will be able to upgrade their inventory by buying more dice, more rerolls, and the opportunity to use the dice of other players. Every problem card solved will grant players credits that may be exchanged for Euros, but the more players upgrade the worst their conversion ratio of credits to euros becomes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of a Masai mother and must make one of the beautiful traditional necklaces of the Masai people. It's just a single necklace, with limited spaces. Therefore, the best strategy to gain control of empty areas and spaces will be crowned with victory!<br/><br/>In Masai, players compete to fill empty spaces in a single necklace. For this, a draw is carried out at each round, where players choose two dice, one to access a sector and the other to place it inside the necklace. The player must check if there is already a die with the same face in the selected sector, as there can only be one face of each type in each location.<br/><br/>Players score points each time they fill an empty spot on the necklace and also receive points for links and for controlling areas within sectors. The game ends as soon as the players have no more space to fill in the necklace, the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Masai is simple but intense and cerebral, don't miss this challenge and become the best Masai craftsman.<br/><br/>",

Beautiful, glowing swarms of fireflies may be released only from the highest towering platforms in the city during the upcoming summer solstice. Six different guilds reside in the city, and they will do everything possible to build their own tree as high as possible in each district. As chief of your district, each round you decide which guild you want to support in your part of the city as you want to lure the spectators to your show on festival day and to send as many brightly-glowing fireflies to freedom as possible.<br/><br/>In game terms, the guilds are represented by a deck of 108 cards, with each of the six guilds appearing 18 times. To set up, deal three cards face up to each player, grouping those cards in columns by color. Lay out five cards face up to form the market. Place the game-ending firefly festival card twenty cards up from the bottom of the deck.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player takes all the cards of one color from the market or one card of each color that appears only once in the market; they then add these cards to their collection. If you already have cards of that color, you place the new cards upward in a column so that everyone can see how many cards you have; if you don't have this color, place cards of the new color to the left or right of your current columns. Then refill the market. When the firefly festival card is revealed, end the game after each player has taken the same number of cards.<br/><br/>To score, look at each column of cards in your collection and compare the number of cards in it to the number of cards in the columns to the left and right. (For the columns on the outer edge of your collection, you compare their height to the height of your neighbor's closest column and the adjoining column in your collection.) For each column, if it's at least as tall as each column adjacent to it, you score points equal to the number of cards in that column. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.<br/><br/>Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.<br/><br/>By the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game was originally published by the designer in 1984 (or earlier).  Hexagames published a German edition (which is the only one that handles up to 8 players) in 1988.  Avalon Hill published their edition (with very minor changes) in 1990.<br/><br/>",

The basic puzzle is to assemble them into a square. However, Tangoes comes with cards showing various shapes that can be made. The two player game is to race to be first to form the shape, but just trying to solve the puzzles is an absorbing solitaire game.<br/><br/>Tangoes' package is patented and is partly what sets it apart from other tangram-related games.  It is a travel-compatible case which holds a pack of puzzle cards and two sets of tans.   There are also at least eleven additional packs of cards available from this manufacturer, and virtually unlimited puzzles from other sources.<br/><br/>",

Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.<br/><br/>The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!<br/><br/>UNDO: 600 Seconds places you in Los Angeles on New Year's Eve.

It takes place between two events revealing the working conditions of textile workers:<br/><br/>- On November 25, 1910, a fire occurred at a four-story factory in Newark, New Jersey. 25 factory workers, mostly young women, died.<br/>- On March 25, 1911, exactly four months after the Newark event, a fire engulfs the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building, occupied by the Triangle Waist Company, causing the death of 146 workers.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/>&quot;Which Side are you on?&quot; is a historical and cooperative survival game that simulates the struggle of the workers in New York between the years 1910 and 1911; for their survival; against employer offensives; for the control of the means of production.<br/><br/>Workers pose and resource collection mechanisms allow for a fluid game; and a system of elements with their historical context, which facilitates immersion.<br/><br/>This game will particularly appeal to players who like adversity, cooperation, immersion, History ... and perseverance!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>1-A game lasts 10 turns. Each turn, the bosses carry out offensives through cards drawn at random. These cards establish temporary or permanent mini-rules against players.<br/><br/>2-You will be playing a family or a small group of people living together. Each member is one of your &quot;workers&quot; and has one action to perform per turn.<br/><br/>3-Each turn, you send your &quot;workers&quot; to the Tiles of New York in order to: a / work and be paid in order to pay your rent, your food and the expenses of the struggle; b / work in political places to cause agitation, strikes or sabotage.<br/><br/>4-Then, you will use agitation, strikes and sabotage to fight the bosses offensives against your rights.<br/><br/>5-With the added agitation, evolve the New York Tiles to make them more worker friendly; complete 6 objectives and take control of the means of production BEFORE the bosses take control of everything and even leave you enough to survive.<br/><br/>6-Be careful, each turn you will have to draw: a / misfortune cards which will make everyone's life even more difficult; b / incident cards which will strike the player who will have the most Risk (obtained according to the work), Police Threat (obtained by causing agitation) OR the least healthy.<br/><br/>7-You could end up with workers in prison, injured, or sick. Which will lower your possibilities for your next turn.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>1-Victory: Take control of New York's means of production by purchasing 6 objectives with your resources.<br/>2-You lose if you fail to pay the cost of your living or if the bosses reach turn 10.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Missions provide VP at the end of the game.  Each mission has unique requirements to complete, and missions can be completed anytime on your turn. <br/>     Players use actions to move across tiles to dig up truffles. Players may upgrade actions throughout the game, and they must avoid wolves (which move at the end of each round). <br/>     Truffles come in 3 types (different difficulty and available points). Some Truffles are SUPER TRUFFLES which provide use of Super Pig Powers! Truffles are also used to fulfill missions. <br/>     Actions can also be used to activate Super Pig Powers. These powers provide powerful one-time abilities. <br/>     Players play a number of direction cards at the end of their turn in order to program the movement of the wolves. <br/>     At the end of a round (once all players have taken actions), all direction cards are turned face up and the wolves are moved. If a wolf lands on or moves through a tile with a pig, the pig is removed from the forest. <br/><br/><br/>Game End:<br/>There are two end game triggers:<br/><br/>     Only one player's pig(s) are left in the forest<br/>     When there are 3 or less truffles left in the forest. <br/><br/><br/>The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

One player leads Napoleon Bonaparte's Grande Arm&eacute;e d'Allemagne, the other player commands the Austrian Army of Archduke Charles of Austria.<br/><br/>Victory Points are awarded each player for the elimination of strength points, elimination of leaders, and control of Aspern and/or Essling.  (Exception: The Austrian player wins immediately if Napoleon is a casualty.)  The difference in points between the players determines the level of victory.  <br/>A pyrrhic Austrian victory, Aspern-Essling turned out to be Napoleon's first ever setback in Europe, and the first time the Austrians ever defeated Napoleon in the field of battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "October 1941: After the initial success against the Russian &quot;Bear&quot; in the summer of 1941 the German advance slowed down. Hitler advised the commander of the 17th Army, General Erich von Manstein, to take the Crimean Peninsula and the important port of Sevastopol before the winter weather would set in. After a quick successful campaign with the final conquest of the Crimea as its goal, the German Wehrmacht should have gained itself a good stepping stone for the next summer offensive to reach the most important oilfields of the Caucasus. Also the mighty Black Sea Fleet would be disloged to the far away port of Batumi...<br/><br/>But history took a different turn. The initial assault failed to take the fortress. The Russians counterattacked in the winter with some success. And so Manstein&rsquo;s final conquest of the mighty Crimean fortress lasted until July 1942 when there were no more Soviet fighting formations on the Crimea.<br/><br/>Fortress Sevastopol is a simulation of the German assault on the Crimean Peninsula. The Germans had to advance to Sevastopol as quickly as possible. Eventually the mighty fortress will have to surrender before the snow falls, which would be a great pleasure for the &quot;F&uuml;hrer&quot;. If not, you will have to wait until spring to receive more reserves and finally capture Sevastopol before the game ends.<br/><br/>If you play the Russian side: stay cool! Try to avoid losses in the initial onslaught. Collect units and reserves in the winter months for an eventual counterstrike at the German weak points. If this is unsuccessful, go for entrenchments and fight for every meter in Sevastopol til the end.<br/><br/>Fortress Sevastopol uses an easy to learn area movement and combat system. A similar system was already used in games like Breakout Normandy, Monty's Gamble - Market Garden, and Storm Over Arhhem. Fortress Sevastopol is Issue #8 in UBB's Command &amp; Strategy magazine series.<br/><br/>",

Walrus Surprise cards add in an extra gameplay twist during pitches - for example, by requiring the players to sing a jingle for their product or explain why the previous player&rsquo;s invention was a bad idea.<br/><br/>Players judge the best pitch and the player with the most pitches approved wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is set in a universe where the human home worlds of Viridia, Ironglass and Prime battle for colonies in the farthest reach of the galaxy. A fourth power, VASA, is the policing body of panhumanic space. It protects the interstellar space lanes and attempts to arbitrate between the ambitious and imperialistic home worlds. With the recent emergence of the alien Koralon race it remains to be seen whether humanity can put aside its petty rivalries and avoid falling victim to this new threat. <br/>VOID is a fast paced skirmish game, with the emphasis placed on enjoyable free flowing game play. It uses a unit-by-unit activation system that encourages strategic use of supporting troops, and prevents the game from becoming mired in hour-long turns. The game mechanics are clear and concise, allowing you to fight games ranging from very small skirmishes with only a few miniatures, to massive battles using hundreds of miniatures. Simple enough for beginners, the game system also has subtle depths that will provide a satisfying challenge for the experienced player.<br/><br/>The VOID rulebook contains all the rules of play, an armory section and army lists for the four human armies: Viridians, Junkers, Syntha and VASA, as well as the mysterious alien race, the Koralon.<br/><br/>A miniature line covering all five armies supports VOID.

Defend your own bins with precise critter placement and tricky abilities. Call for backup and boost your plucky pests to outmaneuver the competition. Swoop, sneak, and scurry your way to dumpster-diving dominance, and may the fullest belly win!<br/><br/>A game of Varmints is organized into a series of shared turns, each consisting of a Day Phase and a Night Phase. During the Day Phase, players trade actions back-and-forth, playing one Varmint card from hand at a time. Varmint cards are placed in lanes (called &quot;alleys&quot;) in order to defend their own Trash Bins while attempting to swipe Scraps from the opponent. During the Night Phase, the strategically positioned Varmint cards face off in individual alleys, and the quicker critter wins, removing one Scrap from the defending Trash Bin.<br/><br/>The game continues through cycles of Day and Night as alleys swarm with critters and scraps start to disappear from Trash Bins throughout the neighborhood. Empty all of your opponent's Trash Bins before they empty yours, and you win the game!<br/><br/>",

Players collect ships and crew to build customizable fleets (much like in WizKid&rsquo;s previous popular game series &quot;Pirates&quot;), and then they gather resources during the game to add more ships to their fleets. The first player to capture his or her opponent's home base, or to destroy all of the ships in his or her opponent's active fleet, wins.<br/><br/>In late 2005, the expansion pack &ldquo;Battle of Titans&rdquo; introduced 60 new ships and 30 new character cards to the Rocketmen universe, as well as a new ship type (Harvester), pod type (Tractor Beam) and even a new crew type - though technically, it wasn&rsquo;t really a crew but rather a new weapon called the Torpedo (which loaded just like crew).<br/><br/>Each game pack contains 6 plastic styrene cards (2 ship cards and 2 base cards, or 1 ship card and 1 Fighter squadron and their base cards; 1 crew card; and 1 resource card), 2 cardboard ship data cards, 1 cardboard asteroid, 1 six-sided die, and a rulebook (which was updated with the release of Battle of Titans and the new features it brought with it).<br/><br/>Each Axis of Evil game pack also contains a small comic of which there were five to be found and these added to the game&rsquo;s charming story.<br/><br/>Each Battle of Titans game pack also contains a Jovian Fuel Jelly template. This can be used with the included scenario (or you can create your own). The Jovian Fuel Jellies float in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter and are the only source of rocket fuel in the solar system. This fuel is harvested by both Ganymede (who has a bigger slice of the rocket fuel pie) and Io using their harvesters.<br/><br/>",

It is a two-player tactical/operational simulation of the combat action on the American Sector during the first two days of the Normandy invasion, 6-7 June 1944.  The game looks at the American efforts all along the right flank of the Normandy landings. While Utah seemed relatively easy, it was there, at Omaha Beach, where the Germans came closest to derailing the greatest sea-borne invasion of all time. Behind both beaches, two famous airborne divisions were scattered all over the countryside, and fought by twos and twenties to accomplish a semblance of their missions. Call it the &ldquo;Longest Two Days,&rdquo; because that is the time-period covered in the game. Forty-eight hours of some of the most critical action in American history.<br/><br/>The key units are all here, including engineers with special abilities, DD-tanks,  parachute and glider landings, and even railroad coastal artillery. One defining feature of the game is unit deployment; a unit can be deployed in one of two modes: Movement Mode allows for the greatest movement but the weakest combat (which is not to say those units can&rsquo;t fight) and Combat Mode, which allows the strongest fighting abilities (but still some movement for most units).<br/><br/>&quot;Bradley&rsquo;s D-Day&quot; offers an intriguing scale, a moderate level of complexity, and an ease of play that will make this game either a fine addition to your Overlord collection, or a good first start for those who have not already focused on this campaign.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 2 hours of daylight or 4 hours or nightime<br/>Hex 800 meters<br/>Units: Company/Battalion<br/><br/>Game Equipment<br/>One 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two counter sheets (320 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 20 page rule book<br/>One Terrain Effects Chart<br/>No dice (game owners need to supply two six-sided die)<br/><br/>",

Their finest scientists may even be drafted to serve as simple soldiers at the front!<br/><br/>Fast and quick playing, Die Atombombe shows just how easy it was to be bewitched by the idea, and how hard it really was to mount an effective nuclear program under the increasing rain of Allied bombs and the Soviet menace looming to the east.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The more complicated the sequence, the more the Sequence Card is worth. If a player manages to match a sequence, that player collects the Sequence Card, scores the points listed on the card, and a new Sequence Card is drawn. The player with the most points at the end of the game - as determined by the sum of his or her Sequence Cards - is the winner.<br/><br/>hexaGONE is sort of like abstract Scrabble. Instead of creating words (and then losing a friendship over an argument about whether yex is a real word) players strive to create sequences which match any of the various face-up Sequence Cards. The sequences on the Sequence Cards range from simple 4-hexagon sequence to more complex, longer ones.<br/><br/>Special-Play hexagons add variety to the game by allowing players to do more than just place hexagons  onto the board. Here are some of the Special-Play hexagons included in hexaGONE:<br/><br/>Swap-agon: swap the positions of any two hexagons on the board.<br/>Draw-agon: immediately draw 2 hexagons. You may exceed your hand size limit for this turn only.<br/>Move-agon: move one hexagon on the board to a new location<br/>Bomb-agon: remove a face up Sequence Card then you may immediately draw a new one<br/><br/>",

In all Sumoku games, game play starts with the roll of a die to create a &quot;key number&quot; &ndash; either 3, 4 or 5. The digits in all groups of tiles placed in rows and columns must sum to a multiple of this key number. A tile is one of six colors, and a color cannot be repeated in a connected set of tiles.<br/><br/>In the main game, players draw eight tiles to start the game. On a turn, a player adds a single row or column of tiles to the playing area to create valid plays &ndash; that is, the sum of the tiles played and all rows or columns added to during that turn sum to a multiple of the key number. The player scores the sum of the tiles played, and the sum of tiles in any row or column added to during that turn. If you finished a row or column of six tiles &ndash; that is, one with all six colors &ndash; you take another turn immediately before refilling your hand to eight tiles. The game ends when no one can play, and numbers in hand count against a player's score. High score wins.<br/><br/>Other games include &quot;Speed Sumoku&quot; in which players each have ten tiles and try to create a crossword-style grid in which all sets of tiles sum to a multiple of the key number before anyone else. &quot;Team Sumoku&quot; plays similarly, but with each team creating one grid. &quot;Spot Sumoku&quot; has players trying to spot four tiles that sum to a multiple of the key number rolled from a public array of ten tiles. &quot;Solo Sumoku&quot; tasks a player with drawing 16 tiles and creating a legal grid from them, then drawing ten more tiles and adding them to the existing grid in a legal manner, then doing this with another ten tiles, and so on through all 96 tiles.<br/><br/>",

Scenarios range from the first U.S.-Soviet Space War, to Asteroid Pirates (the title of a later Yaquinto game), to Alien Invaders.  Inertial, vector-based movement provides some realism (there are even some three-dimensional optional rules).  Detailed energy management between fifteen ship functions (including cloaks, shields, scanners and so on) and a myriad of weapons provide even more playing pleasure.  Eight ship designs are included, with more easily designed.  This is almost a miniatures game, as some weapons come with effect templates.  Pieces are provided for larger ships, a space station and asteroids.  Hidden movement is possible using the advanced optional rules.  Turns are simultaneous, with the players using the familiar Yaquinto shields to adjust their ship displays hidden from view.<br/><br/>(In this game's credits, we learn that Michael S. Matheny is Michael Scott Matheny)<br/><br/>Asteroid Pirates: A Game of Ship to Ship Combat in the Asteroid Belts is a simplified version of this game.<br/><br/>",

Live fast and die hard on Hell's Highway. Can you survive the Devil's Run?<br/><br/>There are four main types of vehicles: Bikes, Trikes, Buggies and Cars. Each of these vehicle types play differently due to how they drive, their weapons and their arcs of fire. The game has story driven missions which are a mix of full throttle racing and maximum carnage vehicular battle, with an immersive ruleset to make you feel like you're a part of the post-apoc action. You use three, six and ten sided dice, statlines and modifications to represent every aspect of the game from scenery effects, shooting, ramming and sideswiping, to using equipment like Nitros, Oil Slicks and Smoke Screens.<br/><br/>This set is the Law Haulage gang being attacked by the Purple Causairs<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s a hilarious game about playing irreverently with words and meanings.<br/><br/>The game comes with 100 prompt cards and 375 answer cards. In each round, one player serves as a judge and reads aloud a question or fill-in-the-blank prompt. The other players submit answer cards, each containing a verbatim quotation from Shakespeare, as suggested completions for the prompt. The judge reads all the submissions aloud and chooses the best one, construing &ldquo;best&rdquo; however he or she sees fit. The winner keeps the prompt card, everybody replenishes their answer cards, and the role of judge rotates to the next player. At the end of the game, whoever has the most prompt cards wins.<br/><br/>The game depends on understanding the particular wit of the other players and strategically playing answers to appeal to each round's judge. The sheer linguistic playfulness of Shakespeare&rsquo;s text is what makes the game exciting and hilarious.<br/><br/>",

Only the Spartans dared to challenge their might through the strength of their unsurpassed Hoplite troops. The result was a 30-year conflict that ended in the destruction of Greek dominance in the ancient world.<br/><br/>Two to four players use military force and political influence in their struggle to control the city-states of ancient Greece. Playing time ranges from 4-10 hours for short scenarios, to 20+ hours for the full campaign game, as players mobilize forces four times a year, and deploy them three times each season. As the leader of the Athenian Empire, can you save Athens' glory from the Spartan onslaught? As the leader of the Peloponnesian League, can you free Greece from Athenian tyranny without destroying it in the process?<br/><br/>Players have a full range of strategic options, including sieges, constructing and destroying fortifications, razing enemy cities, foraging and raiding. Event Cards provide both random events (such as storms at sea, bad omens, the crippling plague at Athens, etc.) and strategic targets (city betrayals, rebellion of Athenian regions, Persian support, the Sicilian Expedition, among others).<br/><br/>Fleet units represent 25 triremes, the light war galleys of the ancient Mediterranean, plus associated transport vessels. Hoplite units represent 1,000 heavily-armored Greek infantrymen. Each cavalry unit represents about 400 men and horses. Light infantry includes all types of lightly armored foot soldiers, including missile troops and barbarians, with each unit representing between 1,000 and 5,000 men.<br/><br/>The rules allow for historically accurate periods of peace, where both sides caught their breath while preparing for a renewed struggle. The Epic of the Peloponnesian War is a complete simulation of this conflict.<br/><br/>Scenarios include the introductory Argive League scenario, played on only a portion of the map; three scenarios each covering only a portion of the war; and the full Campaign Game for 2-4 players (adding Thebes and Corinth to the Peloponnesian side as the third and fourth players).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the author's homepage:<br/><br/>Double Agents is published as an insert in the french boardgame magazine &quot;Des Jeux sur un Plateau&quot;, in the October 2005 issue (#20). In this card game, each player is trying to manipulate five double agents with ambiguous loyalty, and to guess which ones are working for him and which one for his opponent. Hidden information, face down cards... it's a two player game, but it's also a classical Ludo or Bruno game, where you don't know what is sophisticated bluffing and what it just global chaos.<br/><br/>From an earlier description on Bruno Faidutti's website:<br/>Double Agent is based on a simple idea : each player knows each agent's loyalty to him, but doesn't know his loyalty to his opponent. In such an ambiguous situation, it's hard to decide who you can trust with your precious top-secret documents, which must not end in enemy hands. Each player plays cards face down on his side of the gameboard. It is therefore a bluffing game, but it is also, as one can expect from a collaboration between Ludovic and me, a deliberately chaotic and often uncontrollable game<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Teutons!: Assaults on the West, 1870-1940, is a 'Three-in-One' invasion of France game.<br/><br/>France and Germany have been rivals for centuries, dating back to the splintering of the Frankish Kingdom in the ninth century. In 1870, Otto von Bismarck expertly played on a millennia of tension to orchestrate the Franco-Prussian War that led to a unified German state, and the dissolution of the Second Empire of Napoleon III. This resurgent (and increasingly belligerent) Germany sent diplomatic shock-waves throughout Europe, setting the stage for the Great War, which saw pickle-helmed German troops invade the West in 1914. Resentment over the eventual Allied victory paved the way for the rise of Nazi Germany, which pointed its panzers toward Paris in 1940, delivering a crushing and humiliating defeat to France and its allies.<br/><br/>Each of these conflicts saw France invaded by Germany, and resulted in a desperate, bloody struggle. In what other ways were these conflicts similar? How were they different? Why did they turn out the way that they did?<br/><br/>Teutons! seeks to answer these questions by simulating these three conflicts utilizing a common basic ruleset and map, with modifications specific to that era and conflict. Each Unit represents an Army or Corps, and each hex represents 35 kilometers. This keeps the counter density fairly low, and the playtime reasonable. The game uses a Move-Combat sequence and odds-based CRT, and allows for some flexibility when resolving Combat. In the 1914 and 1940 games, the German Player has a special Breakthrough (exploitation) phase. These familiar mechanisms are further enhanced by clever bits of chrome, from the amorous misadventures of Mata Hari to the Miracle at Dunirk. It's an ideal introductory wargame - or rather, three ideal introductory wargames in a single box.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: approx 21 miles / 33 kilometers<br/>Units: Corps to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 17&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 12-page Teutons rulebook<br/>One dual-side printed Players Aid Card<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-3 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The players try to form snakes, which are as long as possible. A snake always consists of a head-section, at least one middle-section and a tail-section. The player who has formed the most and longest snakes wins.<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and placed face down fan-like on the table. One card is drawn from the &quot;fan&quot; and is placed face-up in the middle of the table. In turn, each player draws a card from the &quot;fan&quot; and tries to match the color with a card in the middle of the table. The card can be turned around to match. If the colors of the two cards match, a snake is started.<br/><br/>If a player draws a card which cannot be placed next to a card or a snake in the middle of the table, this card is then placed on its own in the middle of the table. A card which is drawn from the &quot;fan&quot; can be placed next to a snake to lengthen the snake. A snake can be made longer on both sides. If a head or a tail was already added to the snake, the snake cannot be made longer on that side where the head or tail was placed. A snake without a head or a tail is an incomplete snake. Incomplete snakes remain in the middle of the table until they can be made complete and claimed.<br/><br/>A complete snake consists of a head-section, a tail-section and at least one middle-section. A complete snake does not need to have all colors. The player who is able to complete a snake by laying down a head or a tail with the matching color next to the &quot;open&quot; side of the snake may pick up the snake from the center of the table and place it directly in front of him.<br/><br/>The head and the tail with the rainbow colours are jokers. They may be placed next to every middle-section of a snake.<br/><br/>If several incomplete snakes exist in the middle of the table, a player who draws a matching card from the &quot;fan&quot; can combine two incomplete snakes. The player picks up the combined snake and places it directly in front of him. The player is only allowed to combine two incomplete snakes if he uses the card which he just drew from the &quot;fan.&quot;<br/><br/>The game ends when the last card is drawn from the &quot;fan.&quot; If the player with the last card is able to complete a snake, he is allowed to pick up the snake and place it directly in front of him. Now the cards in front of every player are counted. The player who has the most cards wins. If two or more players have the same number of cards the player with the longest snake wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late 19th Century the land of Transylvania fell under a terrible curse allowing Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies to terrorize the citizens.  The Governor issued a desperate plea for help.  You play one of the best and bravest Adventurers in the world called to Transylvania to break the curse.  Your goal is to find the Knowledge to break the curse over Transylvania but beware, the Knowledge you seek may just turn you into one of the terrible Monsters you have come to destroy.<br/><br/>Transylvania: Curses &amp; Traitors is a heavily themed adventure and exploration game utilizing a modular board, variable player powers, hand management, and dice rolling.<br/><br/>Paths to victory include:  1. Solving the curse of Transylvania by finding the right combination of Knowledge cards and returning your pawn to the Church Tile.  2.  Becoming a Monster (vampire, werewolf, or zombie) by collecting Transformation cards and then killing half the other players.  3. Killing a Monster as an Adventurer.<br/><br/>Game play:  The board consists of sixteen 6&quot; x 6&quot; tiles representing places in Transylvania such as the Church, Graveyard, and Castle.  Adventurers start on the Church Tile and explore uncovering new tiles.  Each tile contains token spaces which are opportunities to perform challenges of strength, mental acuity, and spiritual fortitude.  A successful challenge results in the reward of a Quest card.  The Quest deck contains the Knowledge cards needed to break the curse.  While exploring Adventurers will also encounter Events.  Failure of Events leads to injury and/or death while success leads to additional rewards.  If Adventurers collect Transformation cards plus a card that activates the Transformation card, they become a Vampire, Werewolf, or Zombie.  The goal of the game immediately changes from seeking Knowledge to eliminating the other players by attacking them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The greatest nation in the world is in decline. A wealthy oligarchy has all the money, land, and power, leaving the masses to starve and struggle under the weight of oppressive debts. A bitter, partisan feud between polar opposites &ndash; liberal and conservative &ndash; finds no room for compromise. Government, once conducted with dignity and restraint, becomes a dangerous game of brinksmanship and obstructionism. The very foundations of the republic are undermined by demagogues and dictators, using civil unrest to seize power. Opponents are marginalized or made to disappear, with even murder given the veneer of legitimacy retroactively. The result is the collapse of the old order, and the establishment of new, totalitarian regime, with the populace often at the mercy of madmen and idiots, the venal and the vainglorious.<br/><br/>We are talking, of course, about the Roman Republic. OPTIMATES ET POPULARES is a political game for two players, in which players fight for the primacy and dominance of their ideology. The Populares (&quot;populists&quot;) pursue a liberal and egalitarian agenda that seeks to better the lives of the poor through measures such as land redistribution, debt relief, and welfare programs. The Optimates (or &quot;best men&quot;) aim to thwart this progress, maintaining the traditional rights and privileges of the wealthy elites. Both players seek to win elections and pass laws, and to prevent their opponents from doing the same, using every tool at their disposal - building alliances through influential Senators, buying loyalties, inciting mob violence, and proscription - state-sanctioned murder.<br/><br/>Central to the game is Political Will. Each action you take will cost you some Political Will. The more you accomplish, the more anger it incites in the opposition and its supporters - and so, each action you take also cedes Political Will to your opponent. This creates a dynamic tension in which each player must balance pursuit of his own goals against the backlash that's just around the corner. Each law you pass will also have subtle (and not-so-subtle) effects on the People of Rome and the Senate, building or eroding support for your overall platform. It's a careful balancing act - a vicious teeter-totter - a knife-fight on a tightrope.<br/><br/>",

A dynamic card game fusing Real-Time combat with the hidden-role genre.  No turns. No waiting. Just lies and murder!<br/><br/>DETHRONED, the whole game is a set that comes with 2 decks: -Traitors and Kings &amp; Guards and Thieves- Each with their own theme, unique art, and lore. They can be played completely independently up to 4, OR together for up to 8 player chaos and fun!<br/><br/>Players first begin by going around the table claiming a role. Depending on the role you secretly got will help determine if you should lie about your role, though you never have to. After that, players continue discussing until 2 players vote to begin combat. Once combat begins, players may attack each other at any point in time, until someone dies. Every time someone dies, combat is paused and a vote to end the game goes up. All living players must unanimously vote to end and to not vote yes, you have to attack another player, if you cannot then you're forced to vote yes to end. The game can only end in a stalemate (players reveal hands to prove such) OR after a player has died.<br/><br/>Once the game ends, roles are revealed and winners are determined based on the role's win conditions.<br/><br/>",

Taking Actions<br/>Starting with the first player and moving clockwise, each player can perform up to 3 actions on their turn among all their workers (4 actions if you have 3 workers) before moving on to the next player's turn, as follows:<br/><br/>Explore by selecting and placing a tile adjacent to one of your workers (YOU MUST INDICATE WHICH OF YOUR WORKERS IS EXPLORING, but you can place this anywhere adjacent to this worker as long as there is an open space and it can be placed adjacent to two or more existing tiles). Note that movement to this tile is not included in this action. Whenever a new tile is added to the board, add one cube for each matching resource icon on this tile.<br/><br/>Move to an adjacent tile or between any two market tiles (even if they are not adjacent)<br/><br/>Collect all resources of ONE type from a tile your worker is currently on<br/><br/>Trade items at a market (you may trade as many as you want for one action, but you must trade two of one type to receive one of another type and must have a worker on a market tile to do so).

The new worker may be placed on the tile of one of your existing workers, or any market tile, including the starting market tile. You may have a maximum of 3 workers.<br/><br/>How to Win:<br/><br/>After the fifth and final goal has been scored, players add 1 point for each 5 total resources they had at the end of the game (they don't have to be the same type, but don't return them to the stockpile just yet!). The player with the most points is declared the winner!<br/><br/>If there is a tie, it is broken by the player with most total resources remaining.

Pluto as a were-dog?).<br/>The game is an easy to learn collectible game, very fast (10-15 minutes for a single match), Teams of three wizards will challenge each other in magical castles, to obtain &quot;diamagics&quot; (magical gems that can also activate mage powers sometime). First team to grab 6 diamagics wins. Sounds easy?
