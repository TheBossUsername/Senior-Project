        "description": "Creepstone Manor is empty again, the last &lsquo;guest&rsquo; running screaming into the night as Tinker, Creak, Giggle and Boo celebrate their victory.<br/><br/>But Spookie won&rsquo;t let them rest on their laurels! The house is secure, so it&rsquo;s time to turn your attention further afield and sort the gardens of Creepstone Manor.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, being a ghost has certain disadvantages. For one, handling a spade is tricky when your hand keeps passing straight through it! But help is on hand. The resurrected gardeners from the Manor&rsquo;s heyday have returned to lend their rotted expertise to you. Use your crew of Zombies, Skeletons and Ghouls to grab plants and ornaments for your part of the garden; hire new crew members such as werewolves and vampires to boost your work and get those extra flowers planted before the night is over. But beware! Only those ghosts who show the greatest aesthetic eye will impress Spookie and be the best undead Haunticulturist.<br/><br/>During their turn, players will bid for plant and ornament tiles using the monster cards they have in hand. Each monster has a gardening skill number (the higher the better) and up to two special abilities. During bidding, players will need to consider both the row and column their monsters are in when trying to grab those tokens. On top of this, if a player can play the third in a row of a particular monster type (say zombie or skeleton) they'll be rewarded with a boosted special ability on that card.<br/><br/>Players also can earn gold in the game, either through clearing 'junk' from their player board or various monster abilities. These can be used to hire 'special monsters' that have enhanced skills and abilities which the player keeps from round to round, replacing the basic monsters the player starts with.<br/><br/>After bidding, each player will place any plant tokens onto their personal flower bed (even the bad ones that score negative points!). How these are placed will affect the players' scores at the end of the game. How each plant will score can be varied by the players, changing the challenge from game to game.<br/><br/>Players can also use the gold earned earlier to build any ornament tiles earned during bidding. Do you fill up on gnomes to get the highest score, or shoot for the all-or-nothing fountain?<br/><br/>Finally, players can earn points for a secret objective card selected at the beginning of the game. These feature a way to score that is unique to that player, and can be the difference between winning and losing.<br/><br/>The game ends after four rounds, at which point each player tallies up their score for plants, ornaments and secret objectives with the highest score being crowned Head Haunticulturist!<br/><br/>Haunticulture also includes rules for solo play<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

First, a player draws an event card and follows the instructions on it. These cards may do things such as kill other players, change loyalties, or provide valuable information. Then players check to see if enough players are recruited. If there aren't, players end their turn by recruiting another player, who goes next.<br/><br/>When there are enough recruited players, The Rebellion starts: loyalties are revealed and counted.

This was to be a pincers type attack, enveloping Kharkov. The Germans coincidentally were planning an assault in May against the salient which formed the southern base of the Soviet May offensive. The Red Army struck first, and five days later the German attack commenced. These double offensives are what are covered in &ldquo;Pincers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Operation Fredericus&rdquo;. As the German Zitadelle offensive of 1943 was winding down, the Soviets launched a major attack of their own on the northern part of the Kursk area. Then on August 3 the Soviets attacked the southern part of the Kursk area. &ldquo;Orel Salient&rdquo; and &ldquo;Operation Rumiantsev&rdquo; cover these actions.<br/><br/>Eastern Front Operational Battles use the same basic rule set in all four games as one would expect in a quad game. The rules are accessible and straight forward for playability, and at the same time, all aspects, such as movement rates, combat outcomes, and so on, are based on historical analysis. All of the games play at the operational level.

We were very glad to see him. We were to form a box round Mokpalin, we being in the S.W. corner.&rdquo; &ndash;Officer of the 8th Burma Rifles about the battle for the Sittang Bridge.<br/><br/>The situation for the Allies in Burma was increasingly desperate following the Japanese invasion that began in December 1941. After nearly a month of fighting the British Dominion forces were in full retreat, hoping to meet with reinforcements being rushed to the theater and to regroup behind the Sittang River. Key to this goal was the successful withdrawal of the Indian 17th Division. That division had been engaged in a running fight with the Japanese 33rd (214th and 215th Regiments) and 55th (143rd Regiment) Divisions from the outset of the invasion. Both sides converged on the only major bridge over the Sittang river north of Rangoon, a railway span near the town of Sittang.  An Allied success here could potentially thwart the Japanese offensive and save Rangoon. Another victory for the Japanese could lead to the capture of that major port and even more conquests by the sons from the land of the Rising Sun.<br/><br/>Each copy of An Unpleasant and Devastating Fight is composed of the following:<br/><br/>One 11 by 17 inch hex map<br/>One sheet of 70 double-sided, unmounted counters<br/>8 pages of rules<br/><br/>Infantry units are battalions, all other units are companies. A hex is approximately 800 yards across. Each turn represents six hours of time. Players will need a standard deck of playing cards and a six-sided die to play the game. A custom card set that replaces the standard deck of playing cards is also available.<br/><br/>An Unpleasant and Devastating Fight is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Ilya Kudriashov.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A historical fiction game set in the &quot;age of sail.&quot; As the captain of a small sailing ship, you sail into uncharted waters where strange things happen from time to time.<br/><br/>- The game board shows a map of the archipelago with marked sea lanes, which players will use to move their ship between islands. At the top is a large weather panel, with a Beaufort scale, as the wind strongly affects ships and possible actions. Thanks to the mechanics of uncovering weather tiles, players have an accurate forecast for the next two days.<br/><br/>- In their turns, players can move their ships, fight with cannons or boarding, and perform a number of other actions, such as building facilities, buying or repairing ships, selling goods and valuables found on islands or at sea, and hiring captains, officers and sailors. Moving ships around the board is extremely simple, but good planning and the use of maximum speed can determine the outcome of the game, as sometimes, especially close to the finale, it is very important to get our ship in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>- Immediately after landing on an island, the player discovers the exploration cards there, which describe adventures, encounters, events or objects. You can find both good things on them (such as pirate treasures) and not-so-good things (plagues, dark forces, strange creatures...). So it's better not to approach this task without having a full crew and with the right action cards in hand.<br/><br/>- Although the Misty Waters are unexplored, the archipelago is nevertheless full of native life forms. Some of them are humans... Players will face all threats, but also other players.<br/><br/>- There are two trading posts with taverns on the islands. Here you can make profitable deals, gamble (inviting other players too!), meet &quot;interesting&quot; people, arrange risky tasks or missions for which you will need cargo holds, passenger cabins or.... cannons.<br/><br/>Each player builds a deck of Action Cards, which in fact is a set of useful tools, such as weapons, additional sails, maps, tactics or experts that can help in difficult situations, significantly affecting the chances of victory. Since the number of Action Cards is limited - you need to choose them wisely, according to your preferred strategy.<br/><br/>- Since the game is designed for 1-4 players, and each player can command up to two ships (6 different types), spectacular sea battles are not uncommon on Misty Waters. (Especially when the Galleass of the conquistadors sails out of the harbor, fully loaded with gold and jewels, and everyone wants to get it.)<br/><br/>- In addition to the players' ships, there are quite a few &quot;AI&quot; tokens on the board, such as pirate and conquistador ships, sea monsters, cannon batteries, rafts, and trapped chests in the sea vortex. You can also come across unique units, such as the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>- To win the game you must become the governor of the Misty Waters. You can achieve this either by: winning an election, conquering a certain number of islands, acquiring the legendary Conquistador Treasure. Often the fate of the game is weighed until the last minute.<br/><br/>- Players can choose team play against other teams, solo play or solo mode.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Order of the Crimson Hand has a long and rich history of seeking out ancient relics and sinister offerings to unlock forbidden lore and the power of dark gods. These Acolytes of occult knowledge have devoted their souls to unlocking the secrets of these twisted and dark magiks. Carrying scrolls writ in tainted blood and runic amulets imbued with chaotic potential, the Dark Acolytes of the Crimson Hand set up wicked altars and lead depraved rituals aimed to summon demonic creatures and unleash this raw power for their own nefarious goals.<br/><br/>The Dark Acolytes bring another facet of the sinister Order of the Crimson Hand into the game. Tasked with preparing the occult rituals and dark altars of the Order, these Acolytes are steeped in forbidden knowledge and use scrolls and amulets to gain Runic Protection and to unleash spells on the Heroes. Arcane Magik is a new Spell Deck that allows the Dark Acolytes to summon Demons or Undead to  the Fight, launch bolts of Arcane Energy, or even allow one of them to ignite their hand ablaze with a crimson fire to attack, a burning effigy of the ancient Master of the Order, Shi-Hai Da'kal. Though not as tough as their more numerous cultist brethren,  Dark Acolytes are every bit as zealous, using arcane lore and forbidden knowledge to attack the Heroes.<br/><br/>6x Enemies, Cards, Rules, and Mission<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Dragon CEOs run pharmaceutical companies while flame demons prowl the back alleys and kobold zealots trade shots with an elf hacker.<br/><br/>CHA features a full campaign game where your punks gain experience, find new cool gear and hopefully don't end up face down in a rainy alley when a security guard finally frags them.<br/><br/>Random events, extensive lists of gear and abilities and a huge array of creatures are present in the book, allowing for you to really immerse yourself in the world of cyber fantasy.<br/><br/>The combat system is based on Squad Hammer and Chrome Hammer allowing fast, colorful combat without being bogged down by complex rules, letting you focus on the scenario you are playing and the enemies you are facing down.<br/><br/>Intended from the ground up as a solo game, all you need is a handful of miniatures to get started doing battle on the blood-slick streets, in VR space or the astral plane! Each campaign sees you fighting the mega-corps leading to an epic showdown against their monster CEO.<br/><br/>All of this is supported by included random tables to add flavor to the game experience.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic opportunity to use some figures you have not had a chance to use yet, plan some wild new paint jobs or conversions or bring some beloved old favorites back.<br/><br/><br/>     The core mechanics use a 2D6, pick highest roll to determine how many characters can activate each turn with characters being able to perform an array of actions.<br/>     Ranged combat is resolved with a 2D6 roll trying to exceed a target number, with enemies in close range being permitted to return fire.<br/>     Physical injury, squad casualties and morale is all merged into a single damage score, which can be reduced through the use of certain actions. This allows a fast-playing but tactical feeling experience.<br/>     Mechanics are included for stealth missions, spells and more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The rules are intended for solo play and are stand-alone. You do not need a copy of Chrome Hammer or Squad Hammer to play.  <br/>     The intended play space is roughly 3 x 3 feet though smaller tables are manageable. <br/>     Game scale is agnostic but will play fine in both 15mm and 28mm+. <br/>     Record sheets are included. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Kingdom Series Board Game follows the books of The Kingdom Series and The Knights of Arrethtrae very closely. A familiarity with the books will lead to a quick understanding of how the game is played.<br/><br/>The Kingdom of Arrethtrae is divided into thirty territories. At the beginning of the game, each territory is occupied and controlled by the Dark Knight and his Shadow Warriors. The mission is to retake as many of the territories for the Prince as possible before He returns on His ship as He journeys from the Kingdom Across the Sea. It will take Him ten rounds of play to reach the city of Chessington. Once the Prince reaches the docks at Chessington, the game is over. Every knight has the opportunity to retake one territory on each turn by battling against Shadow Warriors and possibly creatures. If a knight is able to retake a territory on his turn, he will acquire a precious resource or weapon to help fight future battles. A knight will usually not know the scope of the battle until he or she enters the territory and draws a battle card. The knight may face a single Shadow Warrior, multiple Shadow Warriors, creatures, and even a Stronghold. Weapons and resources will be necessary to retake a territory with creatures or Strongholds.<br/><br/>One to six players can play the game, but there will always be six knights represented on the board. For example, if there is only one player, he will control all six of the knights. If there are three players, each player will control two knights. For four or five players, one or two of the players must control two knights or those knights can be controlled by all players jointly. All six knights are encouraged to work together and strategize on how to recover as many territories as possible. Only through teamwork and keen strategy is a team of knights successful. Victory occurs in varying degrees, for each territory and its people are precious to the Prince. Ultimate victory occurs when all thirty territories are recovered before the Prince arrives.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Impro the Board Game is a twisted party game. The game combines insightful questions and the pitch-black humor of the therapy world.<br/><br/>The game is prepared by setting up the game board on the table. The hourglass along with the Psychiatric Hospital-card are placed next to the board. The category cards are placed on separate decks on the table. The five different categories: Emotion, Creativity, Mental Health, Self-knowledge and Task.<br/><br/>The youngest player starts and the game proceeds clockwise. The players move their pawns on the board according to the die and depending on which category they land, they pick a card and read it out loud. The category depicts how the player will execute the card: verbally, artistically, using their body language, facial expressions, or their wild imagination.<br/><br/>Depending on the correct guesses and/or successful execution of the card, the player and the co-players can move forward on the game board. The die is used in the beginning of one's turn until the homestretch, the rest of the way is moved forward only by completing the categories or guessing right. The player who reaches the finish square first is the winner. If two or more players get to the finish square in the same round, the game ends in a tie.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The story of the adventure plays independently of the others and therefore no prior knowledge of other chapters is necessary. Since new elements and tiles from later adventures have been added, it is recommended that you have already played the basic game. All outlaws already have their own special abilities. The functions for new items can be found on the following page. No prior knowledge of this adventure is required.<br/><br/>A boy arrived at the secret camp crying with a rabbit in his arms and searched for Robin Hood, screaming loudly. &quot;Help! Rooobinnnn!&rdquo; he yelled! &quot;You have to help me! My rabbit suddenly lay down motionless on the forest floor!&rdquo; he sobbed. The child cried, yes he wanted to say something in a hurry: &quot;Oh, but... but it's not just my rabbit so bad. The animals, plants and people feel bad. The animals are lying around, the plants cannot grow and the people suffer Headaches and are powerless.&quot; Robin immediately picked up his bow, rounded up his friends and them decided to look around the forest and ask the people involved what happened.<br/><br/>",

It's as bad as we feared.<br/><br/>Robot Rising is a solo deck-building game where you must program the bots (cards) in your hand to quell the AI takeover. Each turn, new bots may join the uprising, making it more difficult to regain control. Use Config Settings to maintain your bot population, keep your Code clean to avoid compromising CPUs, and Install USBs with data patches to regain control of mutinous bots. Can you find a way to keep the robots from rising to power? Humankind depends on it...<br/><br/>Your objective is to regain control of all the bot cards in the Uprising deck to quell the rebellion before the bots compromise ten CPU chips and take control of the world.<br/><br/>Each bot card in Robot Rising has a helpful ability when you control the bot, and a separately harmful effect when the bot instead joins the uprising.  The game is played in rounds until you've either defeated all bots in the uprising or the bots have hacked all your CPU control.<br/><br/>Each round, you start by rolling a die - the Bot Roll - any card in the population with a matching value will join the uprising, and is another bot you will have to regain control of in order to win.  Next, the active bots in the uprising take actions based on the bottom of the card. After the uprising bots have finished their turn, you may use the bots in your control to fight back.  You can Code lines (improve your health), Install patches in uprising bots (each bot requires a certain amount of USBs before falling), gain Configuration Settings (the game's currency), and lots more!  At the conclusion of each turn, you may acquire bots from the population if you have adequate Config to do so.<br/><br/>Robot Rising was designed for the 2021 54-Card Game Design Contest on BGG<br/><br/>",

Bear Trap adapts the game system from Sekigahara to this new setting.<br/><br/>One player takes command of the ruling Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its forces, supported by the Soviet 40th Army. The other player takes command of the local tribal rebels (the Lashkar) and Mujahideen guerrilla fighters. The Soviet player seeks to prop up the sympathetic local government and &ldquo;solve the Russian Ice-lock Problem&rdquo; while the Insurgent player seeks to expel the foreign invaders and secularist government.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of alternating turns playing cards to replenish, activate, and move units on an area-based map of Afghanistan, with battles occurring whenever units from both sides end up in the same space. Bear Trap adapts the core mechanics from GMT Games' classic Sekigahara, allowing for the possibility of betrayal and defections, but also adds several new aspects, such as hidden unit stances, powerful strategy cards, and a unique card-assisted solo mode for either side.<br/><br/>Bear Trap is first and foremost a 2-player game, but it also includes rules for solo play (which utilizes a card-assisted flowchart bot).<br/><br/>Time Scale: 16-20 months per Reshuffle<br/>Unit Scale: 1 Block = 500 - 8,000 soldiers<br/>Number of Players: 1 to 2<br/>Play Time: 2 to 3 hours<br/>Complexity: Low (3/9 on GMT's scale)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nobody knows what Priggles are or where they came from. What is known is that they don&rsquo;t like the aliens. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the aliens that don&rsquo;t like them? Either way, who cares? The important thing is that they can be used against the aliens, and that makes them really handy. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re clingy little things, and once they get their cute little hooks in you, it can be really hard to shake them off...<br/><br/>This microexpansion for The Captain is Dead adds Priggles!  Shuffle these little critters into the skill deck. You may draw one, and you can't get rid of it.  But when you have three of them, you can discard all three to get rid of aliens on the ship!<br/><br/>",

Players will take on the roles of friends and relatives of Rose, a girl with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Players will need to work together to the best of their abilities to accompany and care for Rose through multiple scenarios, each with their own unique challenges.<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn, he or she must play a card from his/her hand which he/she has drawn from his/her character&rsquo;s unique deck. All the cards have two kinds of effects to choose: a positive one might let player help with Rose&rsquo;s wellbeing or add a more powerful card to their decks etc. A negative one will harm Rose&rsquo;s mental state or add a harmful card to a player&rsquo;s deck etc. All cards from the players&rsquo; hands must be played (or discarded) in order to complete a round, yet each player can only resolve a limited number of positive effects depending on the efforts they can spend.<br/><br/>The game is won if Rose's life is saved.<br/><br/>",

But when the cataclysm struck, the wizards were destroyed, while the deathless vampires went into a frozen hibernation. Now, as the city thaws, so to do its undead inhabitants. The masters of the night are rising again: reoccupying their hidden strongholds, reforming their old cabals, and finding new victims to serve as their thralls. The destruction of the old city has brought one other boon to the vampires - giant's blood. While giants used to live out of reach to the far north, in the intervening millennium, they have descended on the city in large numbers. Their blood is like an elixir to the vampires, filling them with strength and magical power. A new war is forming between these two ancient races, and once again, the wizards of Frostgrave are caught in the middle.<br/><br/>This supplement for Frostgrave: Fantasy Wargames in the Frozen City presents greatly expanded information about the vampires and the giants that occupy the frozen ruins, including rules for vampiric magic and a breakdown of the different tribes of giants. Also included are rules for a new type of soldier, the giant-blooded. These huge men and women have the blood of giants running through their veins, granting them great strength unseen in normal men. Finally, the book contains a section on playing Frostgrave with high-level wizards and includes two mini-campaigns to challenge these experienced spellcasters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "New World Order - the game of future - is an fast paced game  with easy set-up and game-play mechanics, but has plenty of strategy and players need to make good choices to win. You take the role of a globalist billionaire and your purpose is to collect different corporations and institutions (society has already collapsed) and by collecting them gain Achievements that are high-tech inventions or some other global development. <br/>When you collect 3 Achievements with the same color you will reach Big Goal which will change our future considerably here on Earth or Space.<br/><br/>In this boardgame/cardgame hybrid players are collecting Corporation cards from the table and adding them together to maximize their points. For those points they can buy Achievement tiles which are placed on the table like a pyramid. Achievements give Victory points.<br/><br/>When you collect a three Achievements that match (they have same color on them) then a Great Goal is achieved and player gains extra 500 points Victory Points for it, which is pretty good.<br/><br/>Every player has 3 actions from which they have to choose 1 on their turn. Game moves clock-wise of course. The first action is to choose same corporation card or cards from the table, second - buy an Achievement for the Corp cards points and third - player can throw away a card or a set to make room for other Corp cards. That is sometimes necessary since the slots for Corp cards are limited (7 slots for 2-3 player game and 5 slots for 4-5 player game).<br/><br/>These actions go quickly most of the time, but there are moments where player needs to take a look at his cards and tiles he/she has and think what direction he wants go. He could go for high Corp card points (by collecting more cards) to get the expensive Achievement or forgetting about the full set and take a cheaper Achievement tile from the pyramid with a suitable color to get the Bonus points.<br/><br/>Making things more interesting is that player can&acute;t take any tile you want. He can only take a tile that is free which means it don&acute;t have any other tile on top of it ( not even a on a corner). So there needs to be some tactics how to get to that tile that is unavailable at the moment. It helps if a player got &quot;another action&quot; card, then he can use it to take the two tiles in a row!<br/><br/>The good thing about the game is players can influence each other games by simple ruining other's plans and taking the cards (or tiles) he/she really needs.<br/>Looking at other players despaired face is always fun! Don&acute;t forget you are a ruthless globalist billionaire :)<br/><br/>The game ends when all corporation cards are played out and Achievement VP-s ja Great Goals are counted.Who has most VP-s will be the most powerful elite!<br/><br/>This game is great for people who don&acute;t play games much and are afraid of extensive rules. Gameplay is easily learned in the first 15 minutes. <br/>For experts it could feel a bit of a filler game, but in my opinion it has too many tactical options to be that and the game goes on a bit longer for a filler (60-75 minutes for 3 players).<br/><br/>Also the game has deep theme and makes you think a bit where are we heading as a society. It is a great conversation starter and very fun to enjoy with a couple of beers! :)<br/><br/>For more information check out the game site <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.newworldordergame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.newworldordergame.com</a><br/><br/>",

But the jungle climate is unpredictable at best, and the stifling heat can suddenly give way to torrential rains. When a downpour arrives, it can awaken various jungle creatures. These saurian spectators rarely pay for their tickets, and they tend to attack unsuspecting players who get too close to the edge.<br/><br/>One side of the field is a dense jungle floor, dotted with poisonous snakes and featuring a huge Team Amazon icon in the center. On the other side, torrential rains have flooded the field, attracting colorful birds and huge scaly beasts native to Lustria.<br/><br/>You'll also find two matching pits to complete the theme. Redesigned for the new edition of the game, each pit features score, turn, and re-roll counter tracks, as well as Reserve, Knocked Out Players, and Dead and Injured Players boxes.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Each animal needs a different combination of cards to secure a positive rescue or release, with others unable to be released scoring negative points.  Each player has slightly different rules depending on their Meeple.  Vet cards throw a random element in typical of what is faced in animal rescue.<br/><br/>In addition, there are a range of map type score tracks your Meeple moves along, with bonus points to be picked up.<br/><br/>The game is asymmetrical in 2 ways - when each player rehomes their own animal type, they receive a different bonus.  Also, each animal player type moves differently -<br/><br/>- The dog player can take a shortcut through a dog agility tunnel<br/>- The cat player can hop between adjacent cardboard boxes at no movement cost<br/>- The rabbit player can move diagonally between obstacles as well as orthogonally<br/>- The pigeon player can fly directly over and land on obstacles and fly over water<br/><br/>There will be 2 options for the board in the base game, additional Kickstart exclusive boards, and various expansions including a Horse Player (which can gallop on some moves), additional maps and different full versions of the game to come.  Be ready for a lot of twists on the theme and unexpected variants.<br/><br/>Game is designed by the CEO of Farplace Animal Rescue, an avid board gamer, and 100% of the profits will support animal rescue via Farplace.<br/><br/>",

All the necessary information, - campaigns, battles, weapons, tactics, etc - is included and the books are illustrated with tactical diagrams, maps, contemporary illustrations and photographs.<br/><br/>Brother against brother, family against family, in a long, drawn out, numbing, never-ending surge of battlefield drama - this was the American Civil War. At Gettysburg, &quot;the enemy came on yelling and running with the fixed bayonet charge which few troops can withstand; but the patriots did not waver ... it was a mel&eacute;e, a carnival of death.&quot;<br/><br/>Now many carnivals of death spring to life in one of wargaming's greatest actions. Here is everything the warmer could possibly want: meticulous descriptions of Confederate and Union uniforms, artillery, cavalry units, rifles, and colorful battle flags, plus authentic terrain maps, combat photographs, rundowns on the strategies and tactics of such crucial battles as Vicksburg, Antietam, and Bull Run - even evaluations of army commanders for charisma, reliability, and aggression (Grant scored 22 out of a possible 30, Lee 28).<br/><br/>In a Union cavalry raid, see how campaigns are successful if objectives and aims are clearly defined and how the battles are won or lost by master manoueuvres or crucial failures.<br/><br/>The history, panoply, and roaring destruction of the Civil War, tabletop-style, are here.

        "description": "'Nimmerlichtern' is a cooperative board game for up to 4 players, throwing roleplay, area-control and fortress building mechanics into the mix. Each player takes over one kid out of a ragtag group of survivors and enters the world of a stodgy 90s suburb - where kids' dreams quite literally become reality. The goal is to fight back the monsters borne from the children's own subconsciousness, before the horde of evil dreams swallows the town completely.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, each kid is haunted by their very own primal fear, drafted randomly at the games' beginning out of a pool of six: The fears of loneliness, illness, pain, darkness, deceipt and decay. Starting as mere forebodings, these Grand Nightmares grow stronger and gain abilities at the end of each round, the pace heavily depends on the decisions of the players. At some point the primal fears manifest themselves and enter the game board to lead their minions against the last remaining refuge: the childrens' headquarters in the attic of an empty house. A game is lost once a Grand Nightmare and its pack reaches the headquarters and the subsequent battle is lost by the players.<br/><br/>To avoid that outcome, the players must use their rounds &ndash; each representing a day, from dawn to dusk - to break the curse cast upon their formerly cozy town. Gather resources, build weapons, craft fortifications and barricades and banish the monsters back to the realm of nightmares where they belong.<br/><br/>But foremost, they've got to learn to harness the force of dreams to their advantage: At the beginning of each round &ndash;in the morning &ndash; every player draws a card from their unique deck of dream cards, containing good dreams, bad dreams, dreams that affect the game board itself and also continuous dreams that can be collected in order to unleash unparalleled powers. Dream diaries, night time seances, REM manipulators and other bizarre objects can be used to get the decks under control &ndash; to a point, because, if Nimmerlichtern teaches you one thing, it's that the force of dreams is something to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>So be careful what you wish for: Your dreams just might come true.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gyve (pronounced like &quot;jive&quot;) is a drawless unification game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons (board).<br/><br/>Black starts by making one move, then turns alternate with players making exactly two moves per turn, one move after the other. A move is placing a stone of your color on an empty cell adjacent to N groups of your color. N must be the same for the two moves of a turn.<br/><br/>If you cannot make two moves on your turn, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. When both players pass, the game ends and the player with fewer groups wins. A group is a stone along with all stones one can reach from it through a series of steps onto adjacent stones of the same color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesThe game works best on boards with between 6 and 12 cells per side. For quick games on boards with fewer than 6 cells per side, the pie rule is recommended to prevent Black from easily connecting a central stone to multiple edges of the board. The pie rule gives White the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>Gyve was inspired by a conversation with Michael Amundsen about both designers' previous contributions to the fewest-groups-wins family of games, namely Bola&ntilde;os' Yodd and Amundsen's Solder and Elea.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is part of the Battles for Canada Series of games that portray famous battles fought for in Canada during the War of 1812.<br/><br/>Each hex is approximately 50 yards across, a regular or militia infantry unit is 250-350 men, First Nation and Dragoon units are 80 to 100 men, and artillery units represent 2 or 3 guns. A turn represents one hour of time.<br/><br/>Players use a standard deck of playing cards (a custom series card set is available from the publisher) to activate their units. A six-sided die is used to resolve combats (assault and fire) as well as other game events.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You are minding your own business at the poker table and someone challenges you to a dicey duel.<br/><br/>Players roll their dice secretly and simultaneously (grabbing their bullets), and then they take turns placing a die one by one (loading) onto the board (in the shape of two revolver cylinders) to see who can make the better poker combination (e.g. a Pair, Straight, Full House). Knockout your opponent before he knocks you out. Only one person walks away as a winner from a poker table.<br/><br/>This game involves a balance of randomness (your initial dice roll) for variability, skill (placement of your dice), as well as bluffing (just like poker).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The cards have five suits with one being a trump suit, and each card has two different values. The game allows 3 to 9 players. The rules state that playing with 3 to 7 players is recommended but 4 to 6 players is best.<br/><br/>Players each receive a Team Card that tells them whether they are secretly on the Dark Kingdom or Sailor Guardian team. During the initial bid, players may declare the number of Character Cards they will collect and for which team they will collect them. They are not required to declare they are collecting for their true team. The highest bidder becomes Queen Metalia (if they declare for the Dark Kingdom) or Princess Serenity (if they declare for the Sailor Guardians) and leads the first round.<br/><br/>During a round, each player plays one card. Players must play a card matching the suit of the first card if possible, but each card has one value for the Sailor Guardians and one for the Dark Kingdom. Players choose which value to use, and the winner of each round will keep cards won using the Sailor Guardian power separate from cards won using the Dark Kingdom power. The Moon suit is a trump, and there are other special cards that can affect who wins each round. The winner of a round plays the first card in the next round.<br/><br/>When a round ends and at least one player has no cards left in their hand, the game ends and points are scored. Each player only scores Character Cards won using the power matching their Team Card. In order for the team with the Queen or Princess to win, two conditions must be met: (1) a single player on that team must have collected at least as many Character Cards as the Queen or Princess declared and (2) that player must have collected more Character Cards than the person with the most Character Cards on the other team. If the Queen or Princess player's Team Card matches the team they declared in the bid, that player a bonus of 5 on their count of Character Cards. If either of those 2 conditions are not met, the other team wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "C&amp;B is an abstract assymetrical game for two players. The Republic, in center of the board, is defended by the Oligarchy, while the People's insurrection arises with its militants from the Conurbans, on the periphery. The capabilities and mobility of the pieces of the Oligarchy far exceed those of the People, who on the other hand tend to be very numerous as the insurrection grows.<br/><br/>KOAN Juegos de Mesa, a young Argentine game developer and publisher, has launched its first game C&amp;B - Civilization and Barbarity.<br/><br/>It is a strategy game that is defined by the absence of chance and where each of the opposing parties seeks to impose its hegemony. To prevail, the People must block and paralyze each of the oligarchs, or take the Republic by storm through an irruption of their Leader, making the Revolution possible. The Oligarchy, on the other hand, must seek the obstruction of the Conurbans to stop the insurrection, or, using its ability to capture People's pieces, remove the Leader from the board twice.<br/><br/>It is a game where the strategies are completely asymmetrical, and yet a balance is achieved between the two fields allowing for the development of very different situations from game to game, in which apparent advantages often crumble quickly leading to surprising setbacks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Desde el principio de la historia la humanidad se ha debatido entre la civilizaci&oacute;n y la barbarie. En este juego asim&eacute;trico en el que las estrategias del pueblo y de la oligarqu&iacute;a son netamente diferentes, para conseguir la victoria la oligarqu&iacute;a buscar&aacute; ahogar el levantamiento popular o suprimir su liderazgo con un magnicidio, mientras que el pueblo deber&aacute; crecer en n&uacute;mero para bloquear a la oligarqu&iacute;a o irrumpir en la sagrada rep&uacute;blica y hacer la revoluci&oacute;n.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box (original)<br/><br/>Since the beginning of history, humanity has debated between civilization and barbarity.

Fought on July 21, 1861, First Bull Run was the first major engagement of the American Civil War. Despite opening the engagement with a successful flank march against two smaller Confederate armies, which had only just combined, the Union army would end the day in a disastrous rout back to Washington, D.C.<br/><br/>The design of Baptism at Bull Run is based on the highly regarded Bonaparte at Marengo (Simmons Games). In addition to modifying elements of its Napoleonic predecessor to reflect the character of the Civil War battle, Baptism at Bull Run expands on the earlier game's command rules with the addition of a simple card play system that varies each player's command points from turn to turn.<br/><br/>The game is played on a large map of the battlefield. The military units that participated (or could have participated) in the actual battle are represented by 72 pieces, with many additional pieces provided to represent units reduced by casualties or reorganized into smaller or larger formations.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to place six city defense cards around your city for the win.<br/><br/>Players begin by choosing a monster body, and hero body and a city to defend. Then they are dealt five cards and play begins. On their turn players can place a monster power on a monster body, a hero power on a hero body, or a city defense card on a city card, and they can play one special card. When they have a few monster powers on their monster they can instead choose to attack another player's city. They can also take their turn to discard up to their whole hand and pick new cards.<br/><br/>Attacking another city is called &quot;combat&quot; and when that happens both the attacker and defender roll a die, then add the role to their either their monster score (for the attacker) or hero score (for the defender). Then both players can start throwing combat cards which modify the numerical results for either side making the fight go back-and-forth until one player comes out on top with the highest score. If the attacker wins they add the city defense card to their city. If the hero wins they get a bonus to their next defense. There are many combat cards and also special cards which add to the teeter-totter effect that keeps the game neck-and-neck to the end. The game ends when one player manages to place a 6th city defense card around their city, making it impregnable.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

German Fleet Boats assumes that Germany never entered into the 1935 agreement, instead following OKM&rsquo;s original view that aircraft and hydrophone technology will dramatically impact concentrated submarine operations around the British Isles and that the fleet boat concept of long range submarines are needed to operate outside areas of dense ASW coverage.<br/><br/>German Fleet Boats postulates a change in Uboat design strategy: instead of focusing on medium Type VII boats, the Germans turn to the larger U-cruiser with which they experimented with in World War I. German Fleet Boats assumes that early Type I, II, and VII submarines are built as historically occurred, but prior to starting a more extensive building program, OKM makes the decision to build cruiser/fleet type submarines starting with more Type Is and four of the even larger (projected) Type III, the designs for which were based on the IA.<br/><br/>German Fleet Boats contains a new opening campaign and introduces four additional types of U-cruisers, The Type III, VIII, XI, and XII.

        "description": "Defending England during the Battle of Britain.<br/><br/>Tally-Ho! is a book-based solitaire air war game that puts you into the role of a Sector Controller during the Battle of Britain in the Summer of 1940. You direct Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter squadrons as you struggle to protect England from attack by incoming raids by the Luftwaffe &ndash; and in one mission, by the Italians. There are too many raiders, however, and too few RAF aircraft, yet you have one major advantage &ndash; England&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chain Home&rdquo; radar network.<br/><br/>Fifteen individual missions are included in this book-based game. Each mission relates to one of the key aerial engagements of the Battle of Britain. Most missions can be completed in less than thirty minutes. This is not a simulation of air-to-air combat between individual fighter planes, nor is it intended to be a realistic depiction of the air war, but rather an entertaining educational tool that allows you to experience the story of the conflict through strategic decision-making set against a backdrop of the real history of the Battle of Britain &ndash; as if you were there.<br/><br/>Tally-Ho! is designed for experienced and novice war gamers alike. It is quick and easy to play yet deeply challenging. Though dice do play a role, the outcome of each mission rests on your shoulders. Where you deploy your fighters, what orders you give, and what tactics you employ are the critical factors that determine the outcome of each mission. You decide which enemy squadrons to engage and how to prioritize each as you struggle with radio communications and the fog of war.<br/><br/>Most of the time, you cannot stop the Luftwaffe. Bombs will fall. Airfields will be strafed. Convoys at sea will suffer. Your performance in each mission will affect the setup of subsequent missions by reducing or increasing the number of aircraft available to fly on each side. If you direct your squadrons skillfully, you might prevail and save England.<br/><br/>The game is available on Amazon at: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMSP4MXM/?tag=article-boardgamegeek-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMSP4MXM/?tag=article-boardgameg...</a><br/><br/>A boxed set of game assets is available through Blue Panther, which includes an add-on EXPANSION GAME called Operation Seel&ouml;we, is at:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.bluepantherllc.com/products/tallyho\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.bluepantherllc.com/products/tallyho</a><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As in the base game, it is a power-building strategy game where you as a viking warchief use divine powers, manage a village and resources, play powerful spells and build temples. You gather followers, fight off enemies and climb the steps to divinity.<br/><br/>This expansion gives you the chance to discover the power of the Giants. 15 new cards for the base deck and 68 new Giant cards that offer you brand new powers with never before-seen graphics. A new powerful resource, 7 Giant powers, double sided action tokens and 5 new player boards complete this expansion.<br/><br/>STORY<br/>All was peace and quiet in Asgard. The Gods continued being worshipped and led their easy immortal life. Until Hel, Queen of the Underworld wanted to broaden her empire. She seduces Surtur to form a powerful alliance. Thirsty for destruction Surtur calls his fellow brethren to reclaim their territory. After decades of hiding the Giants rise again. War is among us.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY (AND WIN)<br/>In Valda: the Rise of the Giants, you now have a choice between Gods and Giants and their powers to use to your advantage. <br/>Now every player finishes 4 phases during their turn. The player starts with the Valda phase where he/she scavenge and explore the newly formed world by drafting and playing cards and actions. Building temples in the different God or Giant domains is an important way to gain divine abilities, and get access to more powerful spells. The attack phase is played similar to the base game. So every player can attack the player in turn once. In the follower phase you worship a God or Giant by building a temple in the specific God or Giant area. Resources (divine blood, gold, diamonds, runes), cards or (dice) eyes can be transferred into followers. In the last phase you roll dice to harvest rare resources for your tribe.<br/><br/>The viking chieftan who has the most followers when the ship arrives in Asgard, is worthy enough to climb the world tree Yggdrasil and becomes a God! Oh.. and he/she also wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players collect memories, curios, items, and vehicles as they discover the region&rsquo;s vivid history and culture, and the player with the most discoveries at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>On their turn, player roll the dice, and move on the board in the direction they choose. They explore the location they land on. Some give Discovery Points (DP) and advance you towards victory. Some allow you to draw cards. There are different types of cards: Events to be resolved immediately, vehicles to equip, souvenirs and experiences, or tricks for the other players! Some can be kept in hand, some are played immediately, and others played when you want to.<br/><br/>The 10 main temples of Bagan are represented on the board. They are a good source of DP. You came to Bagn to visit temples after all! The first player to land on one gets 5 points and the &quot;temple card&quot; that features interesting facts about the building. If another player lands on the same temple, he only gets 3DP (there's more tourists on the site!) but gets the card from the previous player. Some effects in the game reward the player with the most temples cards.<br/><br/>But there's other ways to rack in many points, such as getting a hot air balloon ticket for the trip of a lifetime and getting on the location with luck or cards! (10 DP!). Or mounting an elephant and wearing the traditional Tanaka and visiting villages and markets are all locals will cheer with you! (3DP per visit)<br/><br/>The game ends when one player reach 30 DP (50DP in the Advanced rules)<br/><br/>Recommend to anyone: Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to play a game about going on holiday?<br/><br/>",

These powerful guns are deadly to enemy aircraft and can be used effectively against ground targets as well.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the SSU has long considered artillery the most important weapon on the modern battlefield. Since the beginning of the war, fielding these huge guns has proven a successful tactic for the Soviets, one which they see no reason to stop now. The second configuration of the IS-5, the Vladimir Lenin, is a powerful artillery platform, capable of reducing enemy targets to rubble with its massive 252 mm field mortar.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's advertisement in The Dragon #42:<br/><br/>COULD YOU LIVE WITHOUT METAL, POTTERY, FARMING OR FIRE?<br/><br/>Well, Java Man could ... sometimes. Java Man is the colloquial term for Homo Erectus, the earliest of our ancestors to deserve the title &quot;man.&quot; Remains of Java Man were first discovered in Java, where the species did not survive, and later in Africa, where it did, although no one really knows why.<br/><br/>Now, Java Man is a challenging simulation game for one or more players. As leader of a tribe of Java Men, can you gather enough food to keep the tribe alive? Can you conjure up good medicine to make the tribe grow? Can you avoid natural disasters and the depredations of other hungry tribes? And, if the answer to all these questions is &quot;yes,&quot; can you persuade the tribe to let you try? Find out now; play Java Man.<br/><br/>Java Man features die-cut counters, four-color map, rules booklet and player record sheets packaged in a rugged, 4-mil zip-lock bag. Send check or money order for $5.00 per copy, or ask your local retailer for Java Man.<br/><br/>From the game's back-cover blurb:<br/><br/>Java Man is a simulation game of tribal politics and survival in the pre-historic, pre-agricultural, pre-civilized era. Each player attempts to control a single tribe, to ensure the survival of his tribe, and to boost it along the road to civilization. Towards this end, players work to control the normally random movements of their tribes across a hexagon grid representing a typical area of the pre-historic world, so as to avoid or destroy hostile tribes, contact friendly tribes, and gather as much food as possible.<br/><br/>The success or failure of previous actions influences a tribe's willingness to obey a leader's orders. Tribes may be ordered, among other things, to go on the warpath against other tribes, to strip the immediate area bare of food, or to conduct mystic rituals, which may have dire results. A unique aspect of this simulation is that, theoretically, a player may win by ordering nothing at all. Of course, victory is more likely if the leader seizes control of the tribe and leads it boldly into the future... or perhaps into a tar pit.<br/><br/>",

It comes with three rule versions: an easier one with less and open cards for beginner players and for competition purposes, a similar easy one with more cards and hidden cards designed for more players, and a more complex one for advanced players.<br/><br/>There are three gameplay-versions of the game. All of them can by played with the same deck or with its parts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Version 1: Kendo Shiai - Kendo CompetitionThe Kendo Competition is a more complex variant rule designed to more advanced players and for those who practice kendo in reality. It takes more time to learn and needs bigger attention while playing, however the gameplay is very much like a real kendo bout.<br/><br/>Difficulty: 4/5<br/>Players: 2<br/>Gameplay: 10-20 mins<br/>Cards needed: 110<br/><br/><br/>    at the beginning players draw 8 cards<br/>    during the game players must swith their cards and pick a new one befor every attack or counterattack<br/>    a player is awarded an IPPON or hitpoint if he or she make the opponent not be able to react to an attack. The player wins who gets the 2nd IPPON first.<br/>    it is also possible to get HANSOKU or penalty points during the game for stepping out of court, or losing the bamboo sword (SHINAI)which is exactly the same in real kendo comeptitions.<br/>    The players can gain adventage by altering their cards. The use of the cards is more complex than it is in the 2. version: Musashi's Challenge.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Version 2: Musashi no chōsen - Musashi's ChallengeMusashi'c Challenge is much easier to learn and play the kendo playing cards.It also makes possible a simulatnous gameplay of 2-6 players. It needs less attention as it offers entertainment for children and non kendo practicioners as well. The players can have a glimpse into the wonderful World of Kendo, the Way of the Sword.<br/><br/>Difficulty: 2/5<br/>Players: 2-6<br/>Gameplay: 3-10 mins<br/>Cards needed: 105<br/><br/><br/>     at the beginning the players draw 12 cards<br/>     it is allowed to switch only once and only the the beginning. the players don't keep picking new cards during the game<br/>     players can choose whom they attack (when &gt;2 players)<br/>     there is no IPPON or HANSOKU nor marking sign during the game. <br/>     the player who is the last one to lose all of the cards form the hand wins.<br/>     attacks can be parried or turned back to the attacker or even to other player, and can also be strenghtened with additional cards.<br/>     the players can take other player's cards and use them if they can't react to an attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Version 3: Shobu - Bushi no ketto - Samurai's DuelThe Shobu - Samurai's Duel is a variant of the Musashi's challenge version, but with only the half of the cards.<br/><br/>It is the easiest and the suggested way to start to get acquainted with the Kendo Playing Cards, however it needs different strategy than Musasi's Challenge and Kendo Shiai since it is played with open cards.<br/>Therefore it is also the best choice for a competition since the spectators can easily follow the game and may think together with the players.<br/><br/>Difficulty: 1.5 / 5<br/>Players: 2<br/>Gameplay: 3-10 mins<br/>Cards needed: 55<br/><br/>",

Night was falling and it was time to feed. She lay back in her bed, closed her eyes, and slipped into a deep trance-like state that was as close as she got to sleeping.<br/><br/>Her mind drifted across the dreamscape, looking for a psyche to invade. Her mind probed minions, taunting a Condemned with thoughts of freedom, a Ravenous with visions of a barren land with no food and a Twisted with a hale and beautiful body. But there was no sport and little sustenance in such weak beings. She needed something with more power to drain.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the Astral Plane warped and reformed around her, as another entity left the waking world and began to exert its own will on the malleable landscape. It could only be another Witch, certainly a meal worth taking. Mara watched carefully as the being revealed its likes and fears in its growing manifestation. No, this was not a Witch, it was a Demon. Still, perhaps the risk was worth taking. If Mara could drain a small fraction of its essence while it was distracted by her visions, her power would grow immeasurably.<br/><br/>As she conjured images of weakness in the Demon&rsquo;s slumber, she realized she had overstepped: she was losing control of the dream! Was the Demon simply waking? Or was it taking control? She had moments to decide if she should flee or gamble all for her prize. Then the truth became clear. She was waking! This was her esoteric domain. Never before had she been dragged from it.<br/><br/>She tensed for an attack as she struggled to focus on the physical world. But all she could see were swirling mists as she was drawn into the Conjunction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>",

Using &ldquo;power gems&rdquo;, players attempt to bluff each other into over spending their gems and leaving them vulnerable for the next spell.<br/><br/>Every warband must have a leader figure, but that leader can only command figures within 5&quot;. Courier figures are required to deliver orders to any units outside of that range. Orders range from bonuses to automatically passing morale checks.<br/><br/>Currently there are four factions are available: The Alliance (aka The Legion of the One Hundred Hearts), The Soimi, The Herd's of Urueh and the Adepts of Malesur.<br/><br/>On September 2011 a new race is released:The Newborns, that will also bring powder, technology and war machines to combat.<br/><br/>The miniatures for the game are 28mm in size, and they are  unassembled and unpainted.<br/><br/>Official Website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.spherewars.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.spherewars.com</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The Spitfire Mk. IX was designed and developed to compete with the Focke Wulf FW-190 which in some regards could out-perform and out-climb previous Spitfire versions. The Mark IX was based on the Mark V airframe with the addition of the new generation of Merlin engines allowed this aircraft to duel with the deadly German enemy. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft included George &quot;The Falcon of Malta&quot; Beurling, Johnnie Johnson and Stanisław Skalski. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. Larger maneuver cards (63 x 88 mm) are included with this model, to handle the fast movement of this airplane.<br/><br/>",

This large, but playable, game features six countersheets covering the forces of Japan, the US and the Commonwealth forces that fought in this theater during WWII, as well as those forces of the various other nations that were engulfed in the conflict that enflamed the Pacific.<br/><br/>Oceans of Fire accurately reflects the spread of the conflict from Japan's starting home areas to across the Pacific at the start of the game.  Eight turns cover the entire conflict, with some scenarios being shorter duration.  Counters generally represent divisions or brigades for land units, generic air points for air assets, and 1-2 named capital ships (and their escorts) for naval vessels.  Cards are included as an optional variant that reflect many of the historical events (e.g. Stillwell's Chinese forces, Japanese night naval proficiency, etc.) that add additional flavor to the game with little additional overhead.<br/><br/>",

The game is played over a number of rounds, in each of which a faction (a lobby group or organisation) is willing to meet up with the parties to decide who to support in the upcoming election. Players play politician cards to convince the faction to support them, and event cards to affect politicians and the faction. At the end of the round, the votes represented by the faction are gained by the player whose politician is most influential. The first player to gain 9 votes wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Comes complete with 4 new double sided map tiles as well as 4 new Encounters and a fifth Epic Encounter, fought across 4 Acts.<br/><br/>Madra stared at Kakhard&rsquo;s slack face, checking she was fully immobilized. Casting spells on other Witches was always tricky, it was best to be sure. Stepping back, she began the incantation to flay Kakhard alive. As her tough hide was peeled back, the monstrous energies sealed and twisted the bleeding flesh, making sure that Kakhard would live. Keeping her around as a pet would be a fitting reminder of the awesome power Madra controlled.<br/><br/>It was done! Now she had five Witches&rsquo; skins in her possession. Plenty enough to impress Voskor and make him deify her. If not, with this power coursing through her body, she would do the same to him as she did to the five Witches and simply steal her Demonhood.<br/><br/>Perhaps the time to ascend had come. Yes, better to summon Voskor here and now, and let him see Kakhard doting on her, as she adjusted to the agony of her skinless form. Madra arranged herself on her palanquin and tried to look both relaxed and commanding. Best to get it over with. More muttered words of power and she summoned the Demon to her lair, straining her powers to the limit to drag such a powerful entity through the aether.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Voskor! See what I have stolen for you!&rdquo; she shouted, as she tossed the skins on the floor at the Demon&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;You can feast on their hides. I have their power. But first give me what I want! Raise me to Demonhood!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Voskor stared at her, no expression possible on his bone face. He gestured with one hand as he scratched at the skins with the other. Consumed by her lust for power and the energy flowing through the room, Madra failed to see her imminent danger and gave herself to the rapture of Voskor&rsquo;s transformation. Instead, Voskor was teaching her a lesson for her presumption. Her body devolved to a feeble worm-like form.<br/><br/>As she finally realized the trick that had been played on her, she reached for her power to attack. But looking at Voskor, all she could see was the Conjunction transporting her away.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are three mini-wargames and one long campaign wargame which the rules state &quot;It is very lengthy and is recommended for fanatics only, or those with time to spare&quot;!<br/><br/>The game includes a bright desert yellow 44&quot; x 15&quot; five colour map. There are about 300 playing pieces, 123 of which are actual combat units and the rest are markers. The markers are used to show a units combat changing strength as the the units only have a movement rate printed on them. (Per Fire &amp; Movement #10, this was the first game to use this type of step-reduction system.) The rules are only 8 pages.<br/><br/>There is a very interesting sequence of play:<br/><br/>Impulse 1 - The Allied player moves all units as desired then conducts attacks against any adjacent Axis unit.<br/><br/>Impulse 2 - The Axis player may move all of his units as desired but may NOT attack.<br/><br/>Impulse 3 - The Allied player moves all units as desired. Once moved he may then conduct attacks with any unit that did not attack in impulse 1 against any adjacent Axis unit.<br/><br/>Impulse 4 -  The Axis player moves all units as desired then conducts attacks against any adjacent Allied unit.<br/><br/>Impulse 5 - The Allied player may move all of his units as desired but may NOT attack.<br/><br/>Impulse 6 - The Axis player moves all units as desired. Once moved he may then conduct attacks with any unit that did not attack in impulse 1 against any adjacent Allied unit.<br/><br/>You repeat process this three times to complete each month of time. In the campaign game taking 28 months that's 504 impulses over 84 turns!<br/><br/>Supply as ever is important in the desert with the Axis having to keep track of &quot;Stores&quot; to supply attacks and &quot;Issues&quot; to supply movement of motorized units.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wunchunk is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players that is played on a &quot;hexhex&quot; board (a hexagonal shaped board made of hexagonal cells).  Recommended playing sizes are boards with 5 to 8 cells per side.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing stones on a hexhex board, until the board is full or until all players pass consecutively. Groups of like-colored stones are &quot;chunks&quot; if they contain two or more stones; single stones are merely &quot;crumbs.&quot; The winner is the player with the fewest CHUNKS in his/her color of stones at the end of the game.<br/><br/>In the case of a tie in the number of chunks, the tied player with the &quot;fewest smallest groups&quot; wins. That is, tied players compare their number of CRUMBS; the player with the fewest crumbs wins.  If the number of crumbs is also tied, then players compare their number of groups consisting of exactly two stones; the player with the smallest number of size-2 groups wins -- and so on up through the various sizes (size-3, size-4, ...) until the tie is broken.  (In the two player game, an &quot;all the way up&quot; tie is mathematically impossible so long as the players did not prematurely pass; eventually the tie will necessarily be broken as players compare larger and larger groups. In the multi-player game, an &quot;all the way up&quot; tie is theoretically possible but non-existent in practice.)<br/><br/>On his/her turn, a player is allotted a number of stones equal to his/her current number of chunks. (The initial board configuration begins -- Othello-like -- with each player having one chunk already on the board.  See the  &quot;Starting Configuration&quot; posting in the rules forum for details.) A player may play any number of stones from 0 (a pass) up to his/her allotted number.  A player may play any color of stone (even an opponent's color); multiple stones can be any color or color mix.<br/><br/>In the two player game, in order to offset the first player advantage, the PIE rule applies:  After Player 1 plays his/her very first stone, Player 2 then decides whether to play a stone to the board or switch colors with Player 1.  (If &quot;switch colors&quot; is chosen, then the player who was formerly Player 1 is now Player 2, and immediately plays a stone as his/her turn #1 move.)<br/><br/>Honors<br/><br/><br/>     Wunchunk won 3rd place in the Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game Contest of 2019<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Example<br/><br/><br/>     This forum posting gives an example of a Wunchunk endgame, which shows the above rules in action.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

But when the chips are down and the galaxy is at stake, he sides with the freedom fighters of the Rebel Alliance. From captain of the Millennium Falcon to Administrator of Cloud City, no leadership role Calrissian has taken on is as important as Rebel general and he brings all this experience to the battles of Star Wars: Legion.<br/><br/>This expansion contains everything you need to add Lando Calrissian as a commander of your Rebel armies, beginning with a beautifully sculpted, unpainted hard plastic miniature that reflects Calrissian&rsquo;s unique sense of style. Not only will you find three different options for his signature cape, you&rsquo;ll also be able to choose between two facial expressions and whether or not Calrissian appears reaching for his X-8 Night Sniper Pistol in its holster or has it at the ready.<br/><br/>While the miniature gives Calrissian a unique presence on the battlefield, other components, like his unit card and three signature command cards, represent his history as a gambler and his tendency to take high stakes risks. Finally, Lando Calrissian isn&rsquo;t one to enter a fight unprepared, and this expansion also includes six upgrade cards that give him access to the gear and training he needs to take on any challenge.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The witches were up to no good at all: they talked with animals, shoved innocent travelers into the river and Cursed the queen&rsquo;s children (the princes and princesses, basically). Sometimes, them witches quarreled; who may use the cauldron first, who may shove this particular traveler, who may hang out at the graveyard &ndash; actually, to be honest, most of the time they quarreled. Mightiest of them all was &ndash; dramatic music &ndash; the Archwitch. Was. The Archwitch is dead.<br/><br/>Over multiple rounds, all witches decide secretly and simultaneously what they want to do where this round. You might want to collect poisonous mushrooms in the forest, or magical toads in the mountains, or maybe you want to mislead travellers in the bog. Any time multiple witches go to the same location, no productive witching is possible there. However, you may try to change the other witches&rsquo; minds by giving them one of your &quot;Favour&quot; markers, making them retreat to their cottage.<br/><br/>As soon as those problems are solved, items are collected, favours called, and quests fulfilled, all with the aim to gain prestigious titles. Whoever gains three titles first is appointed the new Archwitch (Erzhexe) and wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

However during the first sessions of the States General things go wrong and irresolvable disagreements arise between the aristocracy, the intransigent minority reluctant to lose their privileges, and representatives of the &quot;third state&quot;, the vast majority of society, who demands equal rights, freedom and dignity. As a result, after a few days frustration and outrage spread across France to the cry of &quot;liberty, equality, fraternity&quot;.<br/><br/>In A New Dawn: The French 1789 Revolution players assume the role of the different warring factions during the French Revolution. All intrigue for themselves, according to their individual ideology and interests, yet sometimes are forced to cooperate to safeguard the gains of the Revolution against the reactionaries and against the retaliation of the Imperial powers which, from the borders, threaten to invade France to restore the old regime...<br/><br/>A New Dawn is a political game of hidden identities in French Revolution.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t=Brief description of the game:<br/><br/>In A New Dawn, the players take on the roles of factions during the French Revolution. At the beginning each player receives one identity tile face down and keeps it secretly until the end of the game. Each faction has a different victory condition.<br/><br/>In his/her turn the active player reveals a event tile and performs one action: Press, Government, Assembly, Army or Popularity.<br/><br/>The Press action: the active player take Newspaper tokens. Spending newspaper tokens allows players to increase their Popularity and recruit Leaders.<br/><br/>The Government action: The player take Influence tokens. Spending Influence tokens allow the players to purchase cards. The cards are an important tool in the game.<br/><br/>The Assembly action: the active player may vote on one Law (card Law) by playing cards face down on it. The other players may vote or not in clockwise order. If the law is approved, its effects are applied.<br/><br/>The Army action: the active player attack the Counterrevolutionaries or the Sans Culottes in France, or to attack a foreign province if the war has been declared.<br/><br/>The Popularity actions: there are several available popularity actions depending on the position of the Popularity marker<br/><br/>The game the may end immediately with the defeat of all players or because a faction reaches its goal.<br/><br/>If none of the above happens, the game is over after three terms of office, and then the players count earned victory points.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns either placing one piece on the board or moving an already placed piece; the Witches are the first pieces each player must play. All pieces are initially placed on the outer circle of the board, in any free junction. The game ends when one player cannot move her Witch because it's locked in by her opponents' pieces, or even by her own pieces.<br/><br/>Each player controls one Witch, three Wolves, two Owls and one Raven. Witches can move up to three junctions (they need not be aligned) and may jump over one piece of its own colour. Wolves move the same way, but only up to two junctions. Owls can only move one junction at a time, and therefore cannot jump over other pieces. Ravens may move any amount of junctions in a continuous line, without jumping over any pieces; the outer circle counts as a continuous line.<br/><br/>",

Their words are sacrosanct omens none dare to ignore, for to earn the ire of a bone shaman is to invite nothing but death.<br/><br/>Rattlebone is a visionary of unlimited potential, her voice carrying prophesies not only of the chieftains of old, but the Ascended themselves.

Each card represents a post that influences the conversation in our favour, in an attempt to inflate our own ego and gain Victory Points.<br/><br/>Some toxic messages can create flames and spoil the conversation, ruining everyone's efforts. Luckily, moderator cards help to keep threads in good spirits. At the end of the game, the player with most Victory Points will have become quite an influencer.<br/><br/>Special effects allow players to make things as: creating an off-topic, trash talking, picking on a new user, deleting offensive posts, spoiling half-written posts due to server maintenance, pinning a thread so that it becomes more important, hyping a game, trying to put out a flame by mass-deletion, dismantling another player's fallacy, naming another users to draw them into the thread...<br/><br/>This game began as a cardgame about generic internet message posting. However, it was reskinned to match the aesthetics and some of the slang of the specific Spanish gaming forum &quot;darkstone.es&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It's simple to explain yet dynamic in its gameplay. With options for Single player right up to 7 players or using additional decks to expand the players even further. You could play this with 50 players if you really wanted to!<br/><br/>Game styles include:<br/><br/>     Single Player<br/>     Co-op play<br/>     Competitive play<br/>     Boss Mode where 1 of the players plays as the monster. Essentially an Evil Dungeon master!<br/><br/><br/>Here's how it works:<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 3 hero cards, and a certain number of location cards are drawn based on the number of players. These locations represent quests from a local lord or lady regarding attacks that have been happening in that area. Players are tasked to go and kill the monsters in order to receive 1 item from the item reserve for every monster their party slays.<br/>During gameplay, each player takes turns starting a round and selecting which quest they want to take. Players may entirely or partially opt-out of questing this round and instead head to the tavern to heal their party or avoid the quests that round. 2 players can go on the same quest, and the player who selected this location first will go first in attacking order. Once all players have allocated their quests, they can go and fulfil the quest by flipping over the monster cards to see what monsters they are attacking.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is for your party to end with the most gold value.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But for some reason you thought it would be a good idea to film your holiday film over the holidays, posing a serious risk to your crew's mood during this moody time of year. Luckily, the spirit of the season is all about the giving and receiving of material possessions, and you've got some special ones wrapped and ready to go in case things get grinchy. ROLL CAMERA!<br/><br/>Roll Camera! Story Packs give a little thematic cinematic boost to your madcap movie-making, with all-new components and a small rules twist. The X-Mas Movie Story Pack introduces a Cheer Tracker to monitor the holiday mood of your crew: let it fall too low and you'll incur grumpiness penalties, but give other players (or yourself) new Gift cards to keep spirits high.<br/><br/>This pack includes 12 Gift cards, 10 holiday-themed Scene cards, 3 Idea cards, 1 Equipment card, 4 Script halves, 1 Cheer Track, 8 holiday prop tokens, and 3 new&quot;X-mas Ghost&quot; cards - a new twist on Problems with a Dickensian flair. The X-mas Movie Story Pack can be played as an isolated module, replacing certain main game components for a highly thematic one-off game, or simply mixed in with the rest of the game and any previous expansions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description form the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's the perfect calm before the storm: welcome to the Sakura Slam!<br/><br/>In this standalone sequel to Kabuto Sumo, players return as the wrestling Kabutomushi (&quot;helmet bugs&quot;) and compete to knock off their opponents on an all-new square arena. The coin-pushing mechanic returns, but with a new platform, characters, pillars, and powers.<br/><br/>New Arena Features:<br/><br/>NOTCHED PUSHING PLATFORM<br/>In Sakura Slam, you must push from the corners of the arena. That makes it harder to focus completely on defense, as you can&rsquo;t always push your piece away from the edge&mdash;this means less stalemates and more body slams.<br/><br/>FIXED CORNERS<br/>Four fixed corner posts loom over each match. Using these posts, can you better predict how an aggressive maneuver will play out? Alternatively, if you&rsquo;re near the edge: can you &ldquo;rope-a-dope&rdquo; and use the post defensively?<br/><br/>TAGGING CORNERS<br/>When you push from a corner you haven&rsquo;t pushed from before, you place a marker, &quot;tagging&quot; that corner. Place one on each of the four posts to take a second push action immediately.<br/><br/>Will you try and activate this power every four turns? Or, will you save one corner un-tagged until you have the perfect, epic, game-winning setup created?<br/><br/>All but two characters are compatible with the original Kabuto Sumo.<br/><br/>",

But the relic has gifted your enemies with unnatural power, and they are not likely to surrender it willingly. Will you be able to defeat the Corsairs on their own land and end your quarrel with them for good, or will their increased strength prove too great an obstacle after the trials you have already endured?<br/><br/>The City of Corsairs Adventure Pack features two separate encounter sets, one for the land and one for the sea. Now, should you reach the shores of Umbar, The City of Corsairs Nightmare Deck increases the peril of the second encounter deck by adding treacherous new locations like the Umbar Bridge and bringing the pride and ruthlessness of the Corsairs to the forefront with cards like Inspiring Fury.<br/><br/>But by far the greatest enemy you will face in your quest is the very captain you have been chasing across the sea for the entirety of the Dream-chaser cycle. Should you dare to set foot on shore, you will come face to face with the dread Captain Sah&iacute;r, now empowered by the dark energy of The Cursed Sword. This Cursed Item rewards the Corsair for his thirst for blood, granting him resources when he deals excess damage. Defeating a man with such a powerful weapon may prove nearly impossible, but you are bound by honor to end Sah&iacute;r&rsquo;s reign and make the seas safe once more!<br/><br/>Contains 20 cards to swap with specific cards from The City of Corsairs Adventure pack encounter deck to raise the difficulty of that scenario to nightmare difficulty.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. It requires a copy of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game Core Set, the Grey Havens deluxe expansion, and The City of Corsairs adventure pack to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Although there are a number of simulations for the dramatic events in Bavaria, Austrian and Spain in 1809, not much emphasis has been placed on conflicts in Prussia or in the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. However there were uprisings and armies in conflict in Eastern Europe, especially in the newly created Duchy of Warsaw.<br/>La Bataille de Raszyn depicts the major battle between the VII Austrian Armeekorps and the Polish Forces defending Warsaw. The invasion force commanded by Archduke Ferdinand d&rsquo;Este drives toward the capital of Poland being defended by General Poniatowski.  Poniatowski decides to defend a crucial river crossing that has limited crossings and swampy ground.<br/><br/>The forces of Poniatowski are limited as much of the Polish forces are fighting in Spain. His available forces have excellent morale being highly motivated to defend a country once partitioned by Austrian, Prussia and Russia. A contingent of Saxons assist the Polish Army and scenarios add a variety of forces from neighboring areas.<br/><br/>D&rsquo; Este &lsquo;Austrian&rsquo; Army is in fact made up of infantry from Hungary and Galician (Poland), with Grenz (border) troops and a sizable number of elite cavalry. Although this army outnumbers the forces of Poniatowski, it may lack the motivation and leadership of their counterpoints. The Austrian Army&rsquo;s tactics include some of the recent reforms and traditional formations. Option rules and scenarios provide for a number of &lsquo;what ifs&rdquo; and fresh simulations<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game that can be completed in an afternoon. In addition to the historical game there are two scenarios that vary the orders of battle and appearance times.<br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original  rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/>Marshal Enterprises intends to publish a Napoleonic Grand Tactical Game every quarter. The games are free by down loading all the required documents at our website. Each specific title will have a Special Rules Package.  Options include printing the map as a series of 11&rdquo;x17&rdquo; pages or as a  two or one piece file. Instructions are included to make the unit and informational counters.

Wars are won by those with the will to continue fighting.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It has 24 new die-cut playing pieces for the Black Panthers under their distinctive insignia, and two dozen scenarios based on the epic battles of the 761st and other African-American units.<br/><br/>Most of the scenarios in the Black Panthers set feature the two battalions that served on the Western front alongside white divisions. The 758th Tank Battalion remained a light tank outfit, attached to the African-American 92nd Infantry Division in Italy. The 92nd did not have a very good war, thanks in large part to its spectacularly incompetent commander, Edward &ldquo;Sic &rsquo;em Ned&rdquo; Almond. They often fought against die-hard Italian Fascists, who of course aren&rsquo;t included in Elsenborn Ridge (and have yet to appear at all in the Panzer Grenadier series), and in terrain very different from the wooded hills of the Ardennes. But the 761st and 784th provided plenty of action.<br/><br/>The nature of those battles is that of grinding, close-quarters combat, emphasizing combined arms cooperation.<br/><br/>",

Their outer layer is made with silica, giving them a glass-like quality.  Here at the Society for the Microscopic Arts, we collect these diatoms and delicately arrange them on slides into beautiful, tiny mosaics. As part of your induction into the Society, you will each create your own entry for today&rsquo;s Exhibition of Microscopic Mosaics.<br/><br/>In Diatoms, you compete with your fellow players to collect and place diatom shapes into a mosaic form. You take turns placing tiles representing algae colonies. From that placement you earn diatoms of different colors and shapes. You then strategically place these diatoms on your personal board, taking care to consider how your arrangement will be scored at the end of the game. In the base scoring, you'll want to achieve matching colors, shape variety, and symmetry along your mosaic's central lines. Each time you play, you may also have a &quot;guest&quot; judge card that brings a unique scoring criteria to the game.<br/><br/>Diatoms also includes a solo variant where you collect diatom tiles as in the main game while trying to create a mosaic that fulfills specific requirements from mosaic commission prompts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Several different clans call Neemus home, including Wolf Clan, Hedgehog Clan, Rabbit Clan, and the Owl Clan. While the many clans have called this land home for as long as they can remember, they know they were not the first to live here. On the edge of Neemus lies a place the clans call Iron Forest, filled with strange looking structures and creations. Upon deeper exploration, the combined forces of Animal Clans discovered incredible technology that they quickly learned how to use, creating their own amazing machines that helped them develop their own civilization. However, one day, Iron Forest sprang to life and rose into the sky, building machines of their own. This Iron Force has one objective: to take back the technology stolen from Iron Forest. Now Animal Clans must fight back to protect their homeland.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Iron Forest is a flicking game for 2-4 players, split into two opposing teams: Animal Clans or Iron Force. Each scenario offers asymmetrical objectives that each side needs to fulfil in order to win. Scenarios involve players trying to control certain areas of the game board, destroy opposing team mechas, collect certain objects, and much more. On their turns, players draw cards from their team's activation deck, then activate the mecha depicted on that card by either flicking it or launching it. Players also have access to a range of different power-up cards that will grant their side unique abilities, turning the tide in their favour!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The overall goal was to cut the St. Lo-Bayeux highway, a task that was critical for protecting the east flank of the 3rd Army&rsquo;s breakout from Normandy along the west coast.<br/><br/>Follow units of Patton&rsquo;s 3rd Army&rsquo;s breakout that ultimately encircled the German 7th Army and led to its destruction in the Falaise Pocket. These Missions range from crossing key water barriers, forming bridgeheads, and seizing key crossroads to eliminating fortified positions.<br/><br/>Finally, see if you can do better with outnumbered Allied troops who were tasked with taking or holding, what seemed to them, pointless objectives during the Hurtgen Forest and the opening stages of the Battle of the Bulge campaigns.<br/><br/>This volume introduces new weapons and terrain including Rhino tanks, hedgerows, and sunken roads. Each mission provides challenges with different elements, forces, and situations, making this volume an exciting addition to The Last Hundred Yards Series.<br/><br/>Note: Players will need both LHY Volumes I and II to play all the Missions in this Mission Pack.<br/><br/>Two double-sided geomorphic maps <br/>Five Mission Cards (10 missions)<br/>Mission Pack Special Rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legendary are the tales told of The Hellfire Club. Since time immemorial we have decided the fates of Empires. How times have changed...<br/><br/>In The Hellfire Club two to eight players take on the roles of the destitute final members of an ancient aristocratic secret society as they recount&shy; the tales of their greatest adventures to the patrons of the shadiest public houses of Old London Town. Drawing on the cards in their hands for inspiration, the players will weave an ever more elaborate (although far from honest) tale of daring and adventure in the hope that the drinking den&rsquo;s patrons will offer them a penny for their woes. As competition for the pennies on offer increases, so too do the exaggerations and outright lies the players will tell about their role in the story in the hope of making themselves seem more deserving. But watch out &ndash; at any time another player can challenge your version of the story by playing a less impressive card from their own hand thereby revealing your exaggeration and taking the rewards for the story that would otherwise have been yours! When the tale reaches it&rsquo;s thundering climax, whoever has been given the most pennies wins the game!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>The Old Hellfire Club is a storytelling card game featuring push-your-luck and memory mechanic that add a spark of tension to an otherwise hilarious game. At its heart is the deck of 100 Boast cards. The Boast Deck includes 100 cards in 10 suits themed around a full spectrum of Victorian melodrama from motives and perils to crimes, insults, and teatime and each illustrated with an excerpt from an original Victorian era masterpiece! Players cooperate to tell a story including the plot elements from their own cards, but opponents can challenge the active player&rsquo;s boasts by playing less impres&shy;sive cards of the same suit with lower values. Thus, lies are unmasked, embarrassing truths revealed and any pennies earned by the active player that turn are lost!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is a turn-based operational level 2-player contest based on the battle for LZ X-Ray during the larger &quot;Battle of the Ia Drang Valley&quot; in Vietnam, 1965. There was a successful movie starring Mel Gibson made about this well-known battle for the Landing Zone.  The game is challenging for both sides and historically accurate, but only takes a few hours and can be played at one sitting.<br/><br/>They Were Soldiers: Battle of the Ia Drang Valley lasts 15 turns. Each turn, players alternate moving and attacking each other&rsquo;s forces on the game map, which is divided into hexes. Combat can include small arms firefights between adjacent units or fire missions that target hexes with artillery, airstrikes, helicopter gunships and mortars.<br/><br/>At the end of the combat phase, once all fire combat is complete, adjacent units may conduct close quarters combat (CQC) to decide which force will occupy contested hexes.<br/><br/>Each turn, after all movement and combat is completed, both sides draw cards to determine special actions for the future turns and may get reinforcements according to a preset schedule based on the history of the battle.<br/><br/>History - At 10:48 A.M. on the morning of November 14th, 1965, the first 80 soldiers of the 1st Battalion of the U.S. 7th Cavalry landed in a small clearing at the foot of the Chu Pong Massif in central Vietnam near the Cambodian border.  The Americans had landed in the middle of the base area for an entire North Vietnamese division, and were almost immediately attacked from multiple sides of their small landing zone - called &lsquo;LZ X-Ray&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The battle raged over the next several days, with high losses on both sides.  In the end, the Americans had proved their new airmobility tactics and had inflicted high losses on the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldiers they faced.  The NVA had also learned how to fight the Americans - and had inflicted serious losses on a high-tech superpower enemy  by using classic light infantry tactics with only a fraction of the firepower available to the Americans.<br/><br/>This game challenges the players to re-fight the first day or so of that battle - the critical time when the NVA forces had the chance to overwhelm the Americans and overrun the landing zone.  Can you, as the U.S. player, hold your ground and repeat history?  Or will the NVA player triumph and overwhelm the perimeter - cutting the Americans off from supply and reinforcement?  Get ready to re-live or re-write history in the battle for LZ-Xray!<br/><br/>",

Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.<br/><br/>To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.<br/><br/>This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the manufacturer:<br/><br/>Hyperchess is an intriguing extension of chess into the third dimension. It is, so far as we know, the first and only playable form of chess in three dimensions. A number of attempts have been made over the years to extend chess into three dimensions, but in one way or another each has suffered some flaw that has compromised the integrity of the basic game, and therefore none has been generally accepted. We feel that Hyperchess overcomes these problems and is for the first time a viable three-dimensional version of chess.<br/><br/>The regular rules of chess apply in Hyperchess, and the object of the game remains the same--to checkmate the opponent's king.  In addition, the game is played on the same number of board squares as traditional chess, with the same number of chessmen who keep their same moves.  The dramatic difference is, of course, that play is extended into the next dimension.  Each chessman may move vertically as well as horizontally.  This opens up exciting new possibilities for the world's oldest and most popular game.<br/><br/>",

Even though the mechanics are pretty straightforward (there are only 14 pages of actual rules), there is a great amount of adjudication needed for every shot taken.<br/><br/>Players use range estimation and plot their shots by target, distance, number of shots, and spread. Factors such as the hieght of the firing ship's gun platform from sea level and a target factor based on the target ship's size are cross-referenced with the range to determine the &quot;Danger Space&quot; that extends beyond the ship model. All shots that are estimated to fall within the Danger Space are considered hits. The location of hits is determined from the Hit Probability Table and Armor chart that is unique to every ship. After this, penetration, damage, and critical hits are determined. The whole process for a single shot can be lengthy. Games that involve several model ships can take a very long time to adjudicate all the shots in any one game turn.<br/><br/>The rules recommend that judges be used in the game in order to adjudicate the shots and record damage that only the player commanding the ship can see. Because of the time involved in this, the rules also recommend that an area be set aside for the players commanding the ships to play other games (like Monopoly) while waiting for the results of the firing to be determined.<br/><br/>The area needed for play can be quite large. Gun ranges at 1:2400 scale can go up to 30 feet. Something like a gymnasium floor is the best place to play if you plan on a large fleet action like Dogger Bank or Jutland.<br/><br/>For small actions, like the SMS Emden vs. the HMAS Sydney, these rules can be very good becasue the detail makes the individual action more exciting. However, the rules don't work for actions that are larger than Coronel or The Falklands.<br/><br/>Despite its claim to cover the period from 1890 to 1920, Cordite and Steel is solely dedicated to naval combat in World War One. The only ship cards and Danger Space Tables supplied are for German and British WWI ships and guns. It would be very difficult to expand the game to other eras because of the intense amount of research needed to create ship cards and gun tables for other navies and wars.<br/><br/>",

This was also the year when the first of the 'Jane's Fighting Ships' appeared. There seems to have been a 1906 version of the game, but his last work on the subject was the 1912 version, here reprinted in 1990.<br/><br/>Fred Jane's version of the 'Seekriegspiel' was regarded as sufficently accurate imitation of reality to be used by most modern navies for tactical training.<br/><br/>The notes and reports on actual games which have been played, which appear at the end of the reprint, give a good idea of possibilities for large scale games, including 'press reports' and other 'goings on' which are possible where there are enough players and umpires and plenty of time.<br/><br/>",

It was originally titled Statis Pro Championship Racing and was distributed thru Midwest Research/Statis Pro Publishing for one year.  The Game was renamed Thoroughbred Racing and distributed thru Tabletop Sports and currently thru ASG Games where it is still available for purchase.<br/><br/>The game is designed to give a maximum amount of realism, while emphasizing ease of play. A race can easily be run in 15 minutes, but the method of recording the moves gives a chart of the race that is as detailed as those in the Daily Racing Form. The basic rules are simple, and can be understood by anyone who has played any table top sports game.<br/><br/>The First Edition of the game utilized a 6x6 grid to determine horse speed results which was changed in the second edition to 2-12 die role results.  The horse tracks remained the same.<br/><br/>ASG Games currently publishes a paper and computer version of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game system has some unique qualities.  Above all the open sequence of play within each players Operations Phase.  The game system models the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) in some detail and this makes play of the game feel very different from other comparable games.  During this Operations Phase you can perform Maneuver/Fire, Fire Support, Engineering, Intelligence, in any order you desire to support your plans.  During the enemy player turn you have the opportunity to exercise the Air Defense OS, and during other times of the sequence of play you account for Command and Control and Combat Service Support.  There is a lot here to digest and if you want to get closest to being involved in a military Command Post Exercise, this is it.<br/><br/>This game is going to give you a completely new appreciation for the struggles of the Gross Deutschland Division during the Citadelle offensive.  The attacks timetable was disrupted early on and never got back on track.  The division hit the Pena River, bounced back, slid to the right along the southern bank, and then north toward Oboyan.  The sheer quantity of troops set against them is daunting to have to try and wear down.  But this is the nature of the battle.  And the game does a great job of presenting the situation as a real slugging match.<br/><br/>Game Scales are:<br/><br/>     Game Turns are 2 Hours of Daylight and 4 Hours of Night<br/>     Hex Scale is 330m per Hex<br/>     Red Army Units are Companies<br/>     German Units are Platoons and/or Companies<br/><br/><br/>Gross Deutschland was the largest German division involved in the battle and was endowed with an abundance of armor.  Unfortunately it was armor (Panthers) that was still too young to work properly and caused everyone lots of headaches.  For this reason it is also the largest game in the series.  Gross Deutschland had the hardest mission as it moved through the center of the area of operations.  Its mission was to spearhead the XLVIII PzK operation and make the main effort up the Oboyan road towards Kursk.

        "description": "This is the WW2 edition of the Ambush miniature rules series.<br/><br/>It is a complete game, including fully integrated infantry and armour rules that can be played in a reasonable time. Use of an hex grid recommended for smoother play.<br/>Smaller tables can be played in as little as 45 minutes.<br/>Infantry three stand units represent platoons or full companies and they do play their proper role; like in reality mighty tanks are of little use unless properly supported. This is effectively enforced by awarding full objective values only when infantry takes them.<br/>The game does not feature common alternate turns, instead HQ issue orders accordingly to random initiative dice (d6); this means that HQ Ally1 may activate, then HQ Axis1, then HQ Ally2, etc.   <br/>The rules feature 1:144 miniature pictures and are probably best from 1:200 to 1:144.<br/><br/>Because of its design and the use of an hex grid by default, this game has been pointed as a bridge between a miniture wargame and a boardgame.<br/><br/>Note: this is a rules book only, an hex grid, a dozen d6, 1 d20 dice and miniatures or custom built counters required to play.<br/><br/>Now available again (2023) from Wargame Vault, in pdf format.<br/><br/>Has been available on BGG market, in book format.<br/><br/>",

The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The German&rsquo;s 5th Panzer Corps drove the Belgian and French screening forces through the Ardennes forest, then sought to cross the Meuse River near Dinant.

For those who want to feel like you are really part of something bigger, these enhancements now allow a team of players to play much more like a real command staff. there are 4 primary staff sections in a military unit at Battalion and higher. They are the S1 which handles all aspects of personnel and replacements, the S2 which handles all the aspects of battlefield intelligence, the S3 who deals with the operations of the unit, and the S4 who is responsible to provide for all the supply, repair, and provisions of the fighting force.<br/><br/>This enhancement features the need for players to provide for the supplies that keep the battle running smoothly.  This will provide some additional critical thinking to decide how to plan for moving supplies from the back to the front where they are needed and used.  It will also allow you to perform operations at full strength even when cut off, at least until your reserve supplies run out.<br/><br/>This package provides for more detailed supply operations for the Death Ride Kursk series.  Supplies are represented as points and are stored at the supply units already in DRK and then moved around via additional supply convoys (supply trucks) as needed to support combat.  Units now can move out of supply at will and can stay in supply until the on hand stocks fall short.  This module will add a whole new dimension to the game and again has only a page of rules to digest.<br/> It comes with:<br/>(2) counter sheets<br/>2 page rules supplement<br/>Example Card<br/>Logistics Tables<br/>(2) Logistics Charts<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Zhukov's Final Victory is a low complexity level, two-player wargame on the battle for the capital of Nazi Germany, Berlin. In mid- April of 1945, Marshall Zhukov's 1st Byelorussian Front was poised and aimed like a dagger at the &quot;Heart of the Fascist Beast&quot; the city of Berlin, capital of Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>With thousands of tanks, artillery and soldiers available, the Russian Bear was determined to take the city and end the Great Patriotic War.<br/><br/>Konev's Gambit is an expansion game for Zhukov's Final Victory that extends play to include the offensive by Marshall Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front to take Berlin. Konev's Gambit is suited for two players, as well as solitaire play.<br/><br/>So here you get two games in one package.<br/><br/>Both games combined allows for three players as participants to take on the roles of the German Army and the two Soviet Front commanders. The Soviet players will be seeking to not only defeat their German opponent, but see who can be the first to capture Berlin. Looming over all players is the will of the supreme commanders on both sides: Hitler and Stalin. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>Game Components<br/>Two, 11&quot; x 17&quot; map sections<br/>120 double-sided unit counters<br/> 12 Playing Cards<br/> One Player Aid Card<br/>One, 8-page rule book<br/><br/>",

Units are modeled as flights and significant parts of many squadrons are reflected in supporting both sides.  At this time the Germans had local area air superiority for a time, but this would finally end after the battle and the Red Air Force became a force to be reconed with on its own.<br/><br/>The original system made Close Air Support (CAS) a fairly easy mechanic to understand and implement.  This enhancement provides just the right amount of sophistication, while still remaining easy to learn, and forces both sides to do more planning for the air part of the campaign.  In the end that part of why we play, to see how the planning takes place to support your ground combat.<br/><br/>You will now be able to have air to air combat, interception of enemy CAS, and the possibility of hitting friendly troops with air strikes.<br/><br/>This has to be the most fun of all the enhancement packages so far.<br/><br/>This enhancement package was recently updated with an expanded set of rules.<br/><br/>This enhancement comes in a photo envelope.

        "description": "Two new enahancements in one huge package.  First is the Command and Control enhancement which premiers the first of its kind Radio Line of Sight checks.  All HQ units must check to see if they have good communication and use a Radio Line of Sight to check this.  If the commo check fails the HQ without good commo must check its initiative to see if it will have to attack or regroup or freeze.  The HQ will also have to check and see if the commo check is intercepted and/or located.  When located the HQ becomes a possible target for enemy artillery counter fire.  If the commo check is intercepted the HQ gives up a negative DRM to the enemy player for combats until commo is re-established.  The game will now include Signal units that are the focal point for transmissions and maintaining good commo with subordinate and higher HQ.  The last and most exciting part of this specific enhancement is the inclusion of German Company level counters and an optional Tiger Tank Battalion that could have joined the battle if the Axis High Command hadn't sent it to North Afrika and wasted it.<br/><br/>Each German Division and Soviet Army have a new Task Organization Chart that provides the players a means to change the assignments of Companies in the case of the Germans and Battalions in the case of the Soviets.  These charts are the ultimate in showing the command relationships that change on the battlefield and help to keep the troops organized.<br/><br/>In addition to all this is the Fire Support elements.  Counters that show specific artillery battery assignments and what those assignments mean.  There are artillery mission markers for Direct Support (DS), General Support (GS), and Reinforcing (R).  These missions have specific rules that restrict artillery fire on the field of battle to what they could actually do.  Coupled with the Task Organization charts you will need to plan carefully in order to have the right amount of artillery available to support different parts of your divisions.  The Fire Support Enhancement gives you the ability to fire smoke and even provides for better counter-battery fire.<br/><br/>There are now some new counters to support play.  These are included at the direct request of the playtesters and will help you keep track of when units have fired, moved, opportunity fired, with either secondary or primary weapons, and which units are Out of Command or Out of Supply.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MAMAEV KURGAN, STALINGRAD, RUSSIA, 27 September 1942: Acknowledging the damage done to his army in assaulting the southern and central sections of the city, General von Paulus had systematically reconfigured his forces for a fresh assault. Two shock groups were formed, with one consisting primarily of the 100th J&auml;ger Division, whose task was to clear and control Mamaev Kurgan, followed by an advance into the Tennis Racket and the Bannyi Ravine and finally to occupy the Krasnyi Oktiabr workers' settlements. Paulus' counterpart, General Chuikov was well aware of these preparations and had planned appropriate spoiling attacks, though he was unaware of the fresh German reinforcements. His attack was disrupted before it could even begin, with waves of Stukas strafing his advancing forces. His strongpoint on the crest of the burial mound was destroyed. Bombs and artillery cut down the attackers, decimating their ranks and allowing the following German advance to gain ground. The j&auml;gers advanced two regiments abreast and captured the western slopes, but initially failed to take the southern slopes. The 227th J&auml;ger Regiment's vigorous assaults, supported by intense artillery, destroyed the Russian ability to hold on. The Germans would secure the summit that evening (though some bypassed remnants would harass the Germans on the southern and western slopes for the next few days). By day's end, the 95th Division retained a foothold on the northern and eastern slopes of the burial mound, but was down to only 400 effective fighting men.<br/><br/>The Battle of Stalingrad has received no shortage of treatment in the wargame realm. No tactical-level game has ever treated the titanic and unique battle for Stalingrad's Mamayev Hill, aka Mamayev Kurgan ... until NOW. From the first thrusts of Hitler's Wehrmacht on 13 September to the last days of 1942 the hill changed hands time and again. By 27 September the Germans had again captured half of Mamayev Kurgan. The Soviets held their own positions on the slopes of the hill, as the 284th Rifle Division desperately defended key strongholds. The defenders held out until 26 January 1943, when the Soviet winter offensive known as Operation Uranus, relieved them, in the process trapping and destroying the German VI Armee in the tomb of Stalingrad.<br/><br/>When the battle ended, the blood-soaked hill known as Mamayev Kurgan was plowed up and under ... and mixed with blood and fragments of shrapnel (between 500 and 1,250 steel splinters were later counted per square meter). The earth on the hill had remained black in the winter, as the snow kept melting in the many fires and explosions. During the spring of 1943 the soil of Mamayev Kurgan remained black. No grass would sprout in its scorched and blood-soaked soil.<br/><br/>It's time to come out of the factories ... at least until CH's ATS Krasny Oktyabr hits the streets ... and have a unique Stalingrad-themed experience as you fight to hold, capture, or re-capture Mamayev Kurgan. Interested in accurate, color Molotov Projector counters? Check. Panzers in Eastern Front summer 1942 colors? Check. And a battlefield like none you and your cardboard soldiers have ever contested? Check and mate. It's time to get your Schmeisser strapped on, hitch a ride on the pack of a Panzerkampfwagen IIIj ... and get to where your Feldwebel tells you to get. Raus!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>GAVRUS, 29 June 1944: Company of the Argylls bore the brunt of the first assault made by 10th SS &ldquo;Hohenstaufen&rdquo; in Normandy. As waves of Panzer Grenadiers broke against the Argylls&rsquo; position, B company PIATs drove off the accompanying tanks. By evening, the enemy had infiltrated the sunken road behind B Company, driving a wedge between it and the rest of the battalion. The position of B Company&rsquo;s forward 11 Platoon became difficult, as it was engaged front and rear. Difficult, but not impossible, so long as ammunition held out. Captain Mackenzie, 2 i/c B Company, was leading 11 Platoon. Earlier in the afternoon, he used the platoon PIAT to drive off three enemy tanks that were manoeuvring along the hedges north of the Bougy road. By evening, he and his Platoon had been given up for lost. But just before sunset, he led the fourteen survivors of 11 Platoon back into the Battalion perimeter. He had only withdrawn from the fight when his 2 inch mortar had taken a direct hit and the platoon had no rifle ammunition left. He brought out all but his most seriously wounded. Mackenzie&rsquo;s gallant stand won him a Military Cross.<br/><br/>Many years ago military historian par excellence Ian Daglish joined CH to launch the first in a string of historical modules created by onsite research. What followed was a successful career as a military history book author, penning titles including Operation Bluecoat and others for Pen &amp; Sword. Before his research went into books focused on the British experience during the Battle of Normandy, Ian's work was brought to the fore in the form of what became ATS's SCOTTISH CORRIDOR. This release has long been slated for new editions and the time is finally here, NOW, in the form of ORDERS FOR THE MAJOR and SHOUT FOR PIATS. Times have changed, art has changed, and we continue to strive to create the most eye-pleasing tactical-level game cartography and color counters to provide you with an interesting and evocative experience. Both of those elements make the ORDERS FOR THE MAJOR equal to a brand new approach, with color die-cut counters, maps that simply DEFEAT the earlier versions on every level, and more. More as in scenarios using the new and popular layout plus optional scenario OOB tweaks that pop the action in tournament-sized actions ... to meatier versions. The product stays true to design Daglish, and the new OOB changes are provided as additional content for those that want to boost the octane and push the redline ... and up the Panzer count ... in their gaming.<br/><br/>The new counters include more Tommy Atkins (i.e., British nationality), an all new set of Waffen SS in yet another one of their camo patterns (never before published), PLUS AFVs and guns in Normandy camo.<br/><br/>",

These scenarios can be strung together to form a campaign or story.<br/><br/>Character actions and combat are resolved using an initiative card (chit pull) system and dice pool mechanism.

The players can play several scenarios, or play out the full time framed. <br/>The game system is focused at the operational level commander, but the use of many rules features brings a high level of &lsquo;tactical&rsquo; effects into consideration without creating a high level complexity for the players.<br/>The combat system especially is designed to reduce mathematics and speed play, both for ground forces, and with the &lsquo;no die roll&rsquo; air-to-air and antiaircraft system for the aviation actions.<br/><br/>The OCMS is designed to be a constant rule, constant rating system that can link together all games in a series to allow for strategic levels of actions, this in effect is the linking of various theaters so the actions and outcomes in one  theater can show impact in others.<br/><br/>The OCMS does this by having a solid core of rules (24 pages) that is standard for all the games in each series. In the end, the World War II series will allow players to make transfers of forces not only inside theaters, but globally, for example divisions can be transferred from Europe to the Pacific (or in the other direction) as all units are consistently rated for movement, and combat.<br/><br/>",

Then, starting with the second player, players take turns in anticlockwise order, placing their playing tile on the table adjacent to at least one placed tile so that the tiles fit into an imaginary orthogonal grid, then drawing a new playing tile from the supply (if possible).<br/><br/>The game ends when the last tile has been placed on the table, and each player then calculates her score. For each of the two symbols on your mission tile, find the largest contiguous, orthogonally connected group of that symbol. Count the number of squares in that group. Note: Diagonal connections do not count! Once you have counted the largest group for each of your two symbols, multiply these two values to determine your score.<br/><br/>The player with the lowest score wins.

Attacking them were the hundreds of T-34s of the Southeast Front, composed of a number of Soviet armored army-sized formations, which continued to move west, slicing through the vast plains of the Ukraine, finally reaching a force that would stand and fight. The SS clashed with the Russians on the 8th of February, 1943. The 1st SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, fighting alongside I/1st SS Panzer Regiment, halted the Soviet juggernaut at the village of Merefa. Still, the Soviets disregarded their heavy losses and pushed the SS back into Kharkov proper. Envisioning another Stalingrad-like encirclement and destruction, Hausser ignored Hitler&rsquo;s orders to hold the city at all costs and withdrew to the southwest while continuing to fight delaying actions. Hausser, having disobeyed Hitler, needed to take back Kharkov and with the support of von Manstein on 2 March the LSSAH was formed into three Kampfgruppen which would attack into and capture Kharkov.<br/><br/>During the year 1976 a ground-breaking tactical-level game called &ldquo;TOBRUKTM&rdquo; was released. The brainchild of designer Hal Hock, it quickly broke new ground. Years later it was the inspiration behind a new and much-expanded system. That all happened with the publication of ADVANCED TOBRUK in 2002. One &lsquo;Best of&rsquo; award nomination later ... and a lot of hard work by the publisher and enthusiasts ... and ATS 2014 was in print in the form of color rules set and play aids.<br/><br/>Prior to the release of ATS 2014, a TT Kharkov module was the only one available for system enthusiasts. That&rsquo;s all changed now with ATS BACKHAND BLOW &lsquo;43&mdash;a new release that features full-size ATS counters in the 5/8&rdquo; Personnel and 3/4&rdquo; AFVs enthusiasts clamored for. What&rsquo;s more, the map is expanded&mdash;a hex size that is befitting the subject matter&mdash;and close-in nature of the urban warfare depicted.<br/><br/>The module includes two sheets of 176 5/8&rdquo; die-cut German and Russian Personnel and Weapon counters, plus a sheet of 108 AFV/VEHICLES in 3/4&rdquo; size, a total of 460 counters in all&mdash;everything you need to play (just bring your standard ATS markers). You also receive 10 scenarios (all playable on the map provided) in color format, and color Battlefield Walkaround special rules in 3-hole format.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Much like games like CAH and Apples to Apples, each round starts with a suggestion card. But in Out of ConTXT players will find their answers within their phones.<br/><br/>Depending on the category the answers might be found in their texts, photos, or song playlist. For example a &quot;Text Search&quot; category might have &quot;Something you never want to hear from your Grandma.&quot;. Players would then go through their text messages to find an answer they think fits (in a funny way). Once everyone has chosen their answer, they are read out loud and the group decides on a winner. That person gets the card and a new round starts.<br/><br/>An example of a photo usage would be the &quot;Photo Bomb&quot; category where you might get the suggestion of &quot;Bad Action Movie Poster&quot;. Here you find a photo that fits. &quot;Soundtrack of your Life&quot; has you pick out song that fit a suggestion like, &quot;Not the song you want to hear at in the operating room.<br/><br/>The game can be played with any number of people and since each person has their own (very personal) deck, and that deck changes every day, you'll never have to hear the same &quot;card&quot; over and over again. A great way to get conversations going at a party. Especially since everyone is looking at their phones anyway!<br/><br/>",

In ACNOS, players manipulate armies of shapes within a standard 8x8 chessboard with a win condition of either capturing the opponent&rsquo;s treasure square, or depriving the opponent of a legal move.<br/><br/>There are 24 pieces per side in ACNOS, each of which has unique move sets determined by the arrows shown on their face. Throughout the game, pieces get placed on the board, moved according to their arrows, flipped to produce mirror images, rotated in multiples of 90 degrees, or merged to create more powerful shapes. During setup, players secretly choose a treasure square and 8 pieces to surround it. Each turn, players choose to activate one of three abilities (place a new piece on the board under your control, build a blockade to remove a square from the board, or declare a merge between two pieces to make a stack), then choose two different pieces under their control and move them. Initially, pieces are limited to 2 shapes per merge stack, but when a piece makes it to the other side of the board, it can teleport home by moving off the opponents back rank, thereby deepening its merge potential by one extra piece.<br/><br/>ACNOS is extremely complex (over 10^35 legal setups, 36 million possible states per square, over 200 thousand legal first moves on average), and rewards deep strategic thinking, careful planning, and tactical calculations. Acknowledge the potential, and capture your opponent&rsquo;s treasure! NOTE: For casual play, reserve pieces are drawn randomly from a bag, with each &ldquo;next piece&rdquo; being public information. For tournaments, players determine the order of reserve pieces during setup phase, and the entire order becomes public information when the veil is lifted.<br/><br/>",

In a city under siege by the Corsair fleet, you must fight ship-to-ship, using every ounce of your newfound nautical prowess to gain the upper hand and defend the citizens of Dol Amroth.<br/><br/>In the A Storm on Cobas Haven Nightmare Deck, the battle's difficulty is increased tenfold as the invaders fill their ranks with more vessels like the Ramming Ship and you have less time to prepare a defensive plan. First, this Nightmare Deck introduces two new objective cards, and when your troupe of adventurers chooses an objective during setup, you must choose randomly among the six Dol Amroth objectives. Will you find the Ships you need to confront the Corsairs, or will each new objective simply destroy your will to continue as you attempt to both accomplish these tasks and protect the city?<br/><br/>Contains 20 cards to swap with specific cards from A Storm on Cobas Haven Adventure pack encounter deck to raise the difficulty of that scenario to nightmare difficulty.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product.

We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replayability and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files.

        "description": "You are already dead. One way or another, you have fallen to the lich Yor'Mir. They have locked your soul within their phylactery, along with their other victims they have slain. Within this cursed orb exists a demi plane known as the Ragnorwald. A cursed forest with one purpose: to kill its residents. Death is not permanent within this realm, but it is costly. With each death, the victim loses a cherished memory, which forms into ghostly blue crystals known as Essence. This Essence is what Yor'Mir desires, and as such is used as currency within the Ragnorwald. Once drained of all your memories, you become Forgotten.<br/><br/>But fear not, all hope is not lost. There is a way out, a gate which Yor'Mir uses to check on the Ragnorwald. Two small problems: First, whenever someone uses the gate, the Ragnorwald is reset. The second is the gate is guarded by a Keeper, a twisted monstrosity placed by Yor'Mir to keep the residence of the forest from escaping. Luckily for you, you are a Champion. A being capable of Awakening these memories. Remember your powers from your past life, collect essence to purchase powerful Items, and defeat the Keeper. However, you are not the only one with this plan... Race to be the first to slay the Keeper, lest you lose your progress when the plane is reset.<br/><br/>Journey Into the Beyond is an asymmetrical competitive tableau building adventure game. Inspired by epic fantasy games such as Talisman, Runebound and Mage Knight, Journey takes these long winded, large scale games and condenses it into a shorter more palatable experience. Players will notice right away that in the Ragnorwald, death is not only common and inconsequential, but often convenient. Fast paced highly strategic deterministic combat keeps the game flowing, and it's heavy player vs player elements keeps players interested even when it isn't their turn. Move around the board, choosing which stories to Encounter. Each Encounter type offers different risks and rewards, from fighting Goblins, exploring Dungeons, and even discovering critical information about the Ragnorwald itself.<br/><br/>Tabletop Simulator Link<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1510019854\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=15100198...</a><br/><br/>Discord<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://discord.gg/GnV5TpyMAg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://discord.gg/GnV5TpyMAg</a><br/><br/>YouTube Tutorials<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSq5JJx-Oy7wecuwMQBVirw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSq5JJx-Oy7wecuwMQBVirw</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fly Fight Win: Warbirds is a hex-based, miniatures wargame rules set for aerial combat in World War II. It emphasizes the importance of speed, altitude, and pilot skill, and minimizes much of the tedium typically associated with air-to-air combat games. It includes statistics for more than 60 frontline fighters of the era and a pilot advancement system for campaign games.<br/><br/>Warbirds is a standalone rules set and the first game in the Fly Fight Win series. All games in the series are designed for playability but retain sufficient detail to recreate historical outcomes (with a nod towards the physics of flight). Most scenarios can be played in under 60 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player takes control of an international space agency which must build and launch rockets to the other planets in the solar system. The game features simplified orbital mechanics to generate a constantly changing but predictable board that the players must adapt to.<br/><br/>Game-play consists of 2 phases per round. The first is the player phase in which players launch and manoeuvre their rockets as well as conducting an action at their base. Once all players have had their turns the second phase is to move the planets and the landed/orbiting rockets.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player with the most points. These can be earned by completing achievements, where the number of points corresponds to the advancement of a player's space agency, or through completion of specific missions which can be collected throughout the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is meant to be an inexpensive game that requires only one miniature per player and that can also be played solo. Best of all, the hunter creation system allows you to create stats for virtually any miniature you own.<br/><br/>Matches in Urban Manhunt take place in zones, sectioned-off areas of partially destroyed cities that are used as prisons. Highly-trained, larger-than-life mercenaries known as hunters are set loose in the zone to compete with each other by &ldquo;eliminating&rdquo; crims (&ldquo;criminals&rdquo;, prisoners who volunteer to take their chances in return for full pardons if they survive).<br/><br/>Each crime is assigned a base point value by the Urban Manhunt Rules Committee, based on their competency. When a hunter eliminates the crim, they receive that number of points. This amount can be modified by the live studio audience based on how flashy, interesting or gory the elimination is. The hunter with the most points when the time limit expires wins the match.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The cargo hold is specifically designed to hold an M577 APC with its turret stowed, but in some cases it could be utilized to carry large amounts of equipment, emergency supplies, or even entire companies of troops to the ground. It has the ability to take off and land vertically from almost any terrain type large enough to accommodate its size.<br/><br/>After it has deployed its cargo, the UD-4L will often adopt a gunship role in combat. With a crew of two, a pilot and a weapons officer, the Cheyenne is an efficient piece of hardware.<br/><br/>The two main weapon bays fold out to deploy missile pods containing sixteen 150mm Banshee 70 rockets, six 70mm Mk.10 Zeus rockets, and four 120mm anti-tank Mk.88 missiles each. Two missile pods on either side of the front fuselage often carry AIM-90E Headlock anti-aircraft missiles to deal with airborne threats. A GAU-113B gatling cannon is mounted directly under the cockpit which is typically used for strafing enemy infantry units.<br/><br/>The entire craft is coated in superplastic-formed diffusion-bonded metal matrix composites, or MMC armour for short. While it is able to withstand many ranged attacks, should even light damage occur, it would prevent the dropship from escaping to orbit until repaired.<br/><br/>",

Cheaper to operate and easier to sail without the sacrifice of offensive capability, the only ships a 3rd rate could not single-handedly engage were larger three-decked ships.

        "description": "Drop Zone: Southern France is a fast-playing (about 2 hours), company-level game of the Allied airborne assault (code-named Operation RUGBY) that spearheaded Operation DRAGOON, the Invasion of Southern France&mdash;the Second D-Day, August 15th, 1944. The game can be played face-to-face, by 2, 3, or 4 players or solitaire (as the Allies). Early on the morning of D-Day, the allied First Airborne Task Force (1st ABTF) parachuted a dozen miles behind the Riviera landing beaches to seize key towns and road junctions, to prevent the German occupation forces from counter-attacking the amphibious landing, and to facilitate the advance of Allied forces. The 4:00 AM parachute drop was badly scattered due to an unexpected dense fog bank that blanketed the battlefield. Drop Zone: Southern France covers the first two days of this airborne operation in six tense turns, when the American and British paratroopers and glider-men fought surrounded and alone, supported only by French resistance bands.<br/><br/>The game board is a hex map of the Argens and Naturby River valleys and surrounding areas in Provence, Southern France, covering the area of operations. Each hex measures about 500 meters across. The key towns, villages, roads, rivers, and bridges that were fought over are indicated. The counters portray companies and company-sized units of allied paratroopers and glidermen, French resistance bands, German Infantry, and a few small armor units on both sides. Assets depict fire support units (artillery, heavy mortars, and anti-tank guns) as well as key capabilities (such as reconnaissance and seizing initiative).<br/><br/>Drop Zone: Southern France shines in its depiction of the fog of war (both literal and figurative)--unit type and strength is concealed until revealed in combat. On the first day, Allied parachute companies begin scattered across the board with minimal strength. German reinforcements arrive in a random fashion, often surprising and disrupting the plans of the opponent as well as the controlling player. The correlation of forces ebbs and flows as the Allies gradually build up their parachute companies and gliders deliver reinforcements and heavy weapons. Meanwhile, German reinforcements steadily increase in quantity and quality. The chit pull activation system adds another level of uncertainty. By D+1, the second day, both sides have gained in strength and acquire more powerful assets, leading to larger, bloodier battles as time runs out to achieve victory. It often comes down to the final roll of the dice.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game contains 120 cards and a rule booklet.<br/><br/>We have collaborated with 4 NGOs across India that do tremendous amount of work for the different causes associated with animal welfare - World For All (WFA, Mumbai), The Welfare of Stray Dogs (WSD, Mumbai), People For Animals (PFA, across multiple states), and Charlies Animal Rescue Centre (CARE, Bangalore). A part of the sales proceeds from this game will be donated to these organisations. We have featured a few of the dogs and cats from these NGOs. These and many more are still looking for a forever home!<br/><br/>",

Against all odds, the Skull-tribe Slaughterers buck this trend, believing that the higher they rank in leagues, the better calibre of skull they will be able to claim for Khorne. As a result, the Skull-tribe Slaughterers have made their extremely bloody mark in the NAF as one of the greatest teams around.<br/><br/>Want a team that can both mutilate your opponent with ease, and score a good touchdown? Khorne teams have plenty of brawn and just enough brain to make it happen. Marauder Linemen are hardy enough to withstand plenty of punishment and smart enough to remember to pass the ball once in a match. Those who endure the brutal training regimes of Khornate teams become Bloodseekers. Impressively violent and single-mindedly bloodthirsty, they specialise in putting the opposition out of commission while offloading any erstwhile Blood Bowl balls to the team's Khorngors &ndash; houndlike Beastmen who are utterly intent on scoring touchdowns.<br/><br/>The multi-part kit is comprised of 64 plastic components with which you can assemble The Skull-tribe Slaughterers, a Khorne team for use in games of Blood Bowl. The team is made up of six Bloodborn Marauder Linemen, four Bloodseekers, and two Khorngor. This box also contains two double-sided Blood Bowl coins, two turn and re-roll markers, four Blood Bowl balls, and a transfer sheet with 222 symbols and icons to customise your team with. This kit is also supplied with 12x 32mm Citadel Round slotta bases.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These realms make up a broad array of strange creatures, spells, and magical items that you can combine to bring your own unique flavor to the battleground. Your minion&rsquo;s mastery in these realms and the construction of your deck will determine how well it can perform during play.

Several weeks after the German invasion of Poland, she began to attack Allied merchant shipping.

Instead of more undefended shipping, she found three British cruisers.

        "description": "June 1944: On the right flank of Operation EPSOM, the British set up Operation MARTLET. This operation was necessary because EPSOM was vulnerable to German counterattack from the high ground in the Rauray area. It was essential for the Allies to seize several key points prior to the launching of EPSOM. These key points were the villages of Rauray, Fontenay-le-Pesnel, Tessel, Brettevillette, and Juvigny.<br/><br/>The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, consisting of the 70th, 146th and 147th Infantry Brigades, as well as the 8th Armoured Brigade, was assigned to carry out MARTLET. The operation&rsquo;s first objective was BARRACUDA, the road between Juvigny and Fontenay. The German forces in this sector consisted of the Panzer Lehr Division and the 12.SS-Panzer-division Hitlerjugend (Hilter Youth).<br/><br/>Objective: BARRACUDA offers two ways of experiencing the battle. Players can sample a portion of the fighting by playing one of eight standalone scenarios. Scenarios FLP1-FLP8 also serve to familiarize players with the battlefield and the opposing forces. Players who enjoy a strategic aspect are encouraged to experience the entire battle by playing the Tactical Mission (TM). The TM is comprised of five inter-connected scenarios that begin the morning (0900 hours) of 25 June and continue over the course of four additional time periods: 1100, 1300, 1600, and 2100 hours. The TM lends itself well to team play.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>One 35&quot; x 24&quot; map with one inch hexes<br/>One countersheet<br/>Chapter Obj:B rules<br/>Eight ASL scenarios<br/>One Campaign Games<br/><br/>",

The Japanese government rightly interpreted this as a threat, as Roosevelt intended. The Japanese would not strike for another 18 months, but had they done so the fleets involved would have been very different. The U.S. Navy still operated biplanes from its carriers, while ships like Hornet and Shokaku had not been commissioned while Oahu is not yet the impregnable fortress it would soon become.<br/><br/>Midway: Rising Sun 1940 is a Campaign Study with 10 scenarios depicting a Japanese campaign in Hawaiian waters opposed by the American Pacific Fleet of 1940 &ndash; one with far less capable aircraft (biplanes!) and fewer of them.

        "description": "In Portugal, some restaurants serve traditional Portuguese food alongside performances of fado, a music genre that can be traced to the 1820s in Lisbon, Portugal and is often characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, while being infused with a sentiment of resignation, fate, and melancholy.<br/><br/>People spend their entire evenings in these restaurants, called Casa de Fado (&quot;House of Fado&quot;), dining and listening to the music, which speaks about &quot;saudade&quot;, a Portuguese word meaning &quot;longing, nostalgia, yearning, missing something or someone&quot;. Typically, there isn't any rotation of the tables. Once you enter the restaurant, you stay until it's closed.<br/><br/>In its traditional form, fado is played by a trio of musicians: a guitarist plays &quot;Guitarra Portuguesa&quot; (a twelve-string Portuguese Guitar); a singer,  that is, a &quot;fadista&quot;; and a guitarist playing &quot;Viola de Fado&quot; (classical guitar). The Portuguese guitar has a unique sound, and the chords are played in different bars from those of the classical guitar.<br/><br/>In the game House of Fado, players have to manage their restaurant, attract customers, and contract and promote fadistas and musicians, thus gaining prestige for their fado house. Managers will move their staff members to different places to perform some actions, using the same bump action as in The Gallerist.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Waterberg (Ohamakari) is a low to moderate complexity tactical level board-wargame set during the German Herero War of 1905. It covers the German attack against the Hereros in German-occupied Southwest Africa.<br/><br/>August 11, 1904. The Herero forces have gathered near the Waterberg Mountains, far away from the German supply trains. The thick thorn bushes provide a natural defense. The Germans plan to attack from several different sides of the Herero camp to annihilate the Hereros once and for all. The Hereros have other plans: to ambush the Germans and exploit their numerical superiority. The stage is set...<br/><br/>The game takes about 90 minutes to play. One player commands the German forces and the other player commands the various Herero forces. Cards vary the game play.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Be the first to earn 10 Cure points and try not to succumb to any of the insidious infections you will encounter throughout the game.<br/><br/>Before starting the game, each player receives 3 Marker tokens, 1 Blood Transfusion token, and chooses a Player board. The first player takes the Patient Zero token and goes first, determined by the person who was most recently sick in real life.<br/><br/>Infections cards are shuffled and placed as a deck on the table. Each player is dealt 5 Treatment cards, keeping them hidden from others, and the remaining cards are placed on the table. Lastly, the Bad Luck cards are shuffled and placed on the table.<br/><br/>Each Round begins with Patient Zero creating the Round deck by drawing cards from the Infections deck. Then, starting with Patient Zero and proceeding clockwise, each player takes their turn. They choose a card from the Round deck and fight the infection by playing Treatment cards. If they can't defeat it alone, they can seek help from other players. Successfully curing the infection earns them Cure points, while failure results in 1 Infection point. Players then draw new Treatment cards to replenish their hand, up to a maximum of 5 cards. Finally, the Patient Zero token is passed to the next player in clockwise order.<br/><br/>",

Players each receive a pen and paper and when the first player turns over a category, players must write down as many answers as they can in one Manic Minute. When the timer finishes, each player stops writing and one by one reads out their answers to the group. Duplicate answers are worth zero points - so consider blocking your opponents by guessing what they might be writing down too! Players should justify their answers and arguing is the point of the game! Do you think Victoria sponge counts as a dessert? Do Amy and Aimee count as the same name? Its all up to you in Manic Minute!<br/><br/>At the end of the round each player totals up their points and the person with the most points wins the round! Another player turns over a card and the next Manic Minute can begin!<br/><br/>Manic Minute is a game for all the family and can consist of as many or as few rounds as you like, the game can also be slightly modified for younger or less able players; such as giving points for every correct answer or working in teams instead of as individuals.<br/><br/>",

In this high-stakes game of power, you'll navigate the treacherous landscape as the head of a crime family, vying for control and dominion over the sprawling city.<br/><br/>Each turn starts with a play of a plot card to gain action points &mdash; the currency of your authority &mdash; which you then strategically spend to strengthen your grip on the city.

Dabble in legal enterprises, establishing businesses that promise lucrative returns, while dispatching your trusted associates to maintain control.<br/><br/>The game isn't just about expanding your empire; it's about playing the political game.

There were several escape lines &mdash; networks of safehouses, forgers, and civilian guides &mdash; but the most famous of these was the Comet Line, running from Belgium through France and Spain to British Gibraltar. Real people along this line, many of them teenaged girls, are represented in this game, as well as the real challenges they faced. Given the nature of the work, infiltration by the Gestapo was unavoidable, and the threat of capture was omnipresent. More than eight hundred members of the Comet Line were arrested; about three hundred were executed, or died in concentration camps.<br/><br/>Smith's game acknowledges this grim reality while celebrating the courage and victories of these brave civilians who risked so much in resistance to fascism. With a limited number of actions available to you each turn, you need to satisfy competing demands: finding new guides and safehouses, rooting out infiltration, and dealing with the impact of world events beyond your control. At the end of each turn, you'll plan and execute movement of the men under your protection, risking their capture and your exposure. Losing your only guide for a route can bring the whole thing to a standstill. Through clever card play and careful use of your stretched resources, you'll have to rebuild and move forward &mdash; ever-optimistic in the face of incredible odds.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the start of your turn, you schedule your day on a board styled as a day-planner, placing discs on three tasks you hope to accomplish&hellip; if migraines permit.<br/><br/>Migraines in the game, just as in real life, range from troublesome to fully debilitating. In 14 Days, this requires you to remove discs from your schedule. &quot;On a bad migraine day, this might look like skipping game night with your friends. On a debilitating migraine day, this could look like an entire day in bed&mdash;or in the emergency room.&quot; The player must choose when to tap the limited supply of medication, and when to let responsibilities get crushed under the heel of a migraine. Shirking responsibilities brings consequences, but 14 Days thrives on narrative: When your character suffers a migraine, the other player asks a question about how the migraine reshaped your day, such as, &quot;What sort of 'home remedy' did someone recommend to you today?&quot;<br/><br/>Once the two weeks are up, each player gives an epilogue that explains the long-term negative effects of the migraines (or miraculous lack thereof) the character suffered, at least as the player imagines them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kereszt &eacute;s F&eacute;lhold (Cross &amp; Crescent) is an abstract-style battle game for 2 or 4 players. It was designed to reenact battles between the Ottoman army and the allied Christian forces in the 16th and 17th centuries. Gameplay is entirely based on strategy, with zero luck factor. In the case of 4 players, the game becomes semi-cooperative; two commanders are in charge of the same army forces, but the winner will be the one with the higher score on the winning side.<br/><br/>Each round consists of two phases. In the first phase, players prepare for their planned operations behind the screens. The second phase is the combat itself, when the pre-defined commands are executed. The game ends when 50 victory points are achieved by any of the parties.<br/><br/>Both armies are controlled by means of troop cards, which govern the operations of the &ldquo;troop towers&rdquo; representing the specific army corps on the board. Troop cards are double-sided: turning them over, players can develop troop capabilities and unlock more advanced features. The available options for movement and combat are determined by troop capabilities and terrain conditions. Certain terrain structures (such as bridges and tranches) can be built during the battle.<br/><br/>The rulebook includes 4 real battle scenarios, but the modular board allows players to set up a custom play area, giving the game unlimited replay potential. <br/><br/><br/>A Kereszt &eacute;s F&eacute;lhold 2 vagy 4 fős absztrakt harci j&aacute;t&eacute;k, mely az eur&oacute;pai sz&ouml;vets&eacute;ges seregek &eacute;s az oszm&aacute;n hadak k&ouml;z&ouml;tti,  XVI-XVII. sz&aacute;zadi csat&aacute;k &uacute;jraj&aacute;tsz&aacute;s&aacute;hoz ad kereteket.

        "description": "REGULAR SEASON BASKETBALL is a statistical based tabletop game that allows you to recreate NBA games alone, quickly and in a very realistic way, by using two six-sided dice of different colors (a dark one and a white one) and two team charts. A ruler can also be useful if you want. You are not the coach, but a spectator which attends the game and watches its development and the stats accumulating in a very realistic manner.<br/>There is a BASIC GAME, very simple and fast to play, and an ADVANCED GAME, which allows you to choose the statistical detail you desire, by giving you the possibility to keep track of minutes played by each player, blocks, steals, disqualifications, team possessions and the chance to use special playoffs rules. You should have more time to play if you desire more detail, but after learning the very simple mechanism, you will be able to play an entire game in about 30 minutes while keeping every kind of individual stats. Regular Season Basketball is ideal to replay a whole season, since actual games played by each player are also recreated by consulting the &ldquo;Rest Chart&rdquo; at the beginning of the game. So, no boring dice rolls before the game just to determine which player will play, no setup time involved; players will populate the scoresheet as soon as they are called in action by the chart. Also do not ask about how to resolve the opening tip-off. This is a segment by segment game, not a possessions game.<br/><br/>Every single game is played through several segments, each one representing three minutes of real play. In each segment, both teams roll two dice once to determine scores and stats; after four segments a quarter of 12 minutes will be over. To complete an NBA game, 16 dice rolls are required by each team. For an NCAA game the time scale is different with each die roll representing four minutes and 10 total rolls necessary to complete a game. When a tie game occurs, an overtime is played by rolling the dice once more for each team, this being the only case in which a segment represents five minutes instead of three.<br/><br/>You will never lose the feeling of the game because alternating the dice rolls between the two teams you have the score for each three minutes of play, catching the drama of a close game, realizing &quot;garbage time&quot; situations, big come-backs and the influence of the home court advantage very strong specially in the final minutes of a game.<br/><br/>",

Who would be the &quot;Himiko&quot;, the queen of Japan, who would later rule the nations?<br/><br/>In 詠天記, a.k.a. EETenki: The Queen Himiko Chronicles, each player is a priestess-king who can master sorcery and skillfully read the changing weather. They perform rituals and direct agriculture to bring wealth and power to the nation they lead. Players race to get the most victory points by growing rice coins that represent rice plants. These rice coins will grow or rot depending on the weather. On a turn, you perform two actions:<br/><br/>1. Use your sorcery to predict the weather.<br/>2. Push your luck to plant some rice coins, or wait for the next day.<br/><br/>When the weather is good, planting rice coins can yield a better crop and earn you victory points. However, if the weather is bad, your coins will level down (rot) or be lost. Level up (grow) your rice coins efficiently and occasionally buy trade goods to earn victory points. When the fourth sunny card is revealed, players finish that round, then the game ends. The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>This game involves some strategic luck pushing based on previous information, such as calculating probability, but also bluffing and poker face to read your opponent's expressions.<br/><br/>-description via designer's translator<br/><br/>",

We added a few rules in this quest to test some ideas, teleported some expansion content over, and broke from the traditional one-page format, to provide greater context and make this a more robust tool for Zargon. You could play this game as a &ldquo;Quest 0&rdquo; and head into the HeroQuest core quest book better equipped, or you might choose to run this as an alternative to &lsquo;the Trial&rsquo;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Manufacturer:<br/><br/>Cockpit of Europe (CoE) covers the campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession in the Flanders theater between 1744 and 1748. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. The French leadership were divided into two schools of thought. The traditionalists believed that the Habsburg dynasty was the primary threat to France's position in Europe, and that the main thrust of the war should be made against their possessions in Italy and Germany. The other school feared the rise of the Maritime Powers (England and Holland) and counseled a hard blow in that direction. CoE looks at the five years that the French spent in the Low Countries attempting to smash the ring of enemies surrounding them.<br/><br/>Even though the French, thanks to the sublime leadership of their German-born Marshal, Maurice de Saxe, conquered Belgium and invaded Holland, defeating every army sent against them, the campaigns resulted in a draw. The subsequent peace merely restored the status quo. The stage was then set for the titanic Seven Years War.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there is great scope for you as the King's Captain General. The armies involved were the largest yet seen on a European battlefield &amp;#8800; the French fielded over 200,000 men, and the Allies tried their best to match them. The region is relatively compact, yet difficult to operate in, with the open country thickly studded with fortresses and cut by rivers. Seaward are tracts of swamp and fenland. On the other flank are the dense woods and rugged hills of the Ardennes.<br/><br/>The French player, with the strategic initiative, must constantly press forward, laying siege to town after town (and leaving many men idle in garrison), as he seeks to lever the Allies away from the French frontiers and ultimately threaten the Allies' own bases of operation. The Allied player must decide whether to defend everywhere, to bide his time and harass the enemy, or to launch an offensive of his own. Even if he makes the right choice, however, he must still get the agreement of all the nations under his command<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Did you ever feel like your town was a dead end full of mindless drones? Like you just had to get out of there at any cost? Well now you might be right! LocaliZED is a Zombie survival game set in your backyard. It is a 1-8 player co-op game that uses any map and your imagination to turn your neighbourhood in into Zombified blood fest.<br/><br/>LocaliZEd is an open-source print and play game that encourages players to customise their game within the parameters of the core rule set. LocaliZED has players use a map of their hometown, or anywhere else they would like to try and survive a Zombie apocalypse, as the board. On this board a few key locations, church, school, police station are set and then players are given missions at random that force them to interact with these locations while Zombies quickly accumulate on the board.<br/><br/>As the game progresses players draw cards from one common deck that sometimes cause more Zombies to flood the map, sometimes giving the players bonus items and sometimes changing the dynamic of the whole board. <br/>The game is turn based and the turn sequence runs like this: clockwise players may all move once. Then running clock-wise again, from the same starting player, each player must fight the Zombies in their location once only.<br/>The core mechanic that players use to combat Zombies is really simple. In a location that has Zombies players must roll a D6. If they roll a score greater than the number of Zombies they are fighting then they have won the combat. They may now remove Zombies equal to the difference between their score and the number of Zombies. If they roll a score equal to the number of Zombies this is a draw and nothing happens. If they roll less than the number of Zombies then they have lost the combat and they lose 1 life.<br/> A roll of a 1 on any dice at any time means they lose the combat. A roll of a 6 on any dice at any time means they may roll an extra dice and count its result towards their score.<br/> For instance, if there are 4 Zombies in a location and you roll a 5 then you may remove 1 Zombie, because 5 is one greater than 4. If you had rolled a 4 then you would have drawn the combat and nothing would happen. If you had rolled a 6 you may have re-rolled the dice and added the score of the second dice to the original 6 potentially rolling another 6 and gaining yet another re-roll. If you had rolled a 3, 2 or 1 then you would have lost and had to lose 1 life.<br/> Players may team-up to fight Zombies, and this becomes very necessary. To do this they must be in the same Location. All players who are teaming-up must agree to the team-up before any dice are rolled. The player who&rsquo;s fighting (because it is their turn) may now roll their dice once only using their weapons. Then they may roll an extra dice for each other player that teamed-up. The player adds the totals together and combats the Zombies with this score.  Teaming-up allows players to achieve much higher scores. However, the down side of teaming up is that if they lose the combat everyone in the team-up loses 1 life.<br/><br/>LocaliZED also contains a rather unique mechanic for death. There is no player elimination, instead the dead player switches sides becoming a Zombie and gaining some control of the normally random Zombie deployment.<br/><br/>All of these missions and combat are driving the game towards the Final Mission. This one of 5 set endings for the game that can only be revealed once players have burned through all of the other missions. Final mission are always much harder than the individual missions that lead up to them but they generally involve all of the players working together to achieve them. Final missions range from hiding till the end of the apocalypse, curing the Zombies, killing the other players, or just out right killing all of the Zombies.<br/>The tone of the game is quite tongue in cheek with a lot of the missions and cards having humorous elements. Every part of the game is designed to leave the door wide open for players really take ownership of the scenarios an in-game elements, with blank cards of every type being provided, the onus being on using your own map as a board.<br/><br/>The game was written in response to the Beasts of War websites 2014 Halloween game design challenge. Beasts of War then went on to distribute the game as free down load to all of their members.<br/><br/>",

She served in the Spanish Navy during the French Revolutionary Wars, but was destroyed during the Second Battle of Algeciras, with the loss of many of its crew. After participating in the capture of San Pietro Island for Spain and Sant'Antioco for France, in July 1801, she was in Algericas battling against the British fleet. The HMS Superb, cutting through the rearguard, maneuvered between Real Carlos and San Hermenegildo. When the Spanish ships opened fire, they struck each other and then collided, with fire spreading out of control. Both exploded and more than 1700 men were killed in the blast.<br/><br/>This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish Meregildos class &ldquo;Conde de Regla 1786.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Combat Leader is Minden's game series that simulates tactical level infantry combat during the Second World War.  Counters (5/8th inch) represent individual soldiers that are individually named and rated for marksmanship, morale, melee ability, leadership rank, and weapon.  The map scale is 17 yards per hex, and time scale is between 45 and 60 seconds per turn.  A variety of scenarios enables gamers to conduct firefights between individual squads.  The game was designed for two-players.<br/><br/>Like all Minden releases, this game series emphasizes historicity and playability.  Games and modules may be freely combined.  The first two releases cover the titanic struggle on the east front, at the smallest scale possible... individual German and Russian soldiers.  The counters reflect the strengths and weaknesses of each army.  Note that players must supply a six-sided die and deck of standard playing cards to play, and the two-sided counters must be cut apart prior to play.<br/><br/>Tanks?  No tanks!  The Combat Leader system is a two-player game designed to simulate tactical infantry firefights between individual soldiers and leaders in an historically faithful yet highly playable manner.  And yes... more games and nationalities for the Combat Leader system are planned.<br/><br/>While the Combat Leader game system was designed for two players, many solitaire enthusiasts would consider it &quot;solo friendly&quot; since it is low complexity, there are not many units on the map at any time, and there is some &quot;chaos&quot; and variability built into the system (similar to other two-player games published by Minden).<br/><br/>Combat Leader: Core Rules is Minden's rulebook for the entire Combat Leader game system. It includes all standard, advanced, and optional rules to play the game. The book also contains portions of game maps and soldier counters to allow you to play sample scenarios. To fully employ these rules, it is assumed that players have access to at least one Combat Leader game, module, or game component set.<br/><br/>COMBAT LEADER: CORE RULES is a 52-page book containing all the standard, advanced, and optional rules for the system, covering German and Russian soldiers (including rules for Green, SS, Assault Engineer, and Volkssturm squads, and commissars)<br/><br/>",

Well, in Freshwater Tank, now you can. With 155 fish and 100 incidents, see for yourself what fish you would want to have and how to take care of them while having fun with friends and families; you can even create what type of community tank you would desire. So, do you want a goldfish tank, a tropical fish tank, an aggressive cichlid tank, or any other type? That's up to you to decide.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to become the first person to create a compatible fish tank with 10 fish, but be careful; there you might lose some of your fish as you play. So what are you waiting? Set up your aquarium.<br/><br/>Players roll a die to move around the board and collect fish or cards when landing on specially marked spaces.

Each player will draw one card of each type from the so-called &quot;moon phases&quot; (the first 5) and will receive 3 Treat Coins that are used to pay for card exchanges. &quot;Wild&quot; cards will also appear. These will give a certain strategic advantage to the players.<br/><br/>When a player finishes his exchanges (there are two types of exchanges called &quot;trick and treat&quot;) he/she must decide if he wants to risk the combination of cards obtained by taking (or not) a card from the sixth moon deck (the &ldquo;Red Moon&rdquo;). Here the risk is double or nothing.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score combination will receive a Victory Coin. After winning a second time the player will flip his Victory Coin.

That's the Chicago way! &quot;<br/><br/>In The Chicago Way you control a gang of driven men determined to achieve their goals no matter the cost. Choose from hard nosed Gangsters, two-bit gangs of Moonshiners, unswerving Prohibition Agents or bright-eyed squads of Police officers. Campaigns in The Chicago Way represent a season of violent activity as the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; tussle for control of their patch against rival bootleggers, or to sweep the streets clean of the criminal fraternity.<br/><br/>The Chicago Way is the 28mm skirmish game in Prohibition era United States from Great Escape Games. With an accompanying range of 28mm miniatures, vehicles and pre-painted buildings, players can gun down the opposition as they vie for control of the city. The Chicago Way rule book provides all the rules to play, four competing factions and a campaign system in which your characters gain skills and your boss exerts his influence over his rivals.<br/><br/>The rule book comes with a 54 deck of The Chicago Way cards and an A3 campaign map.<br/><br/>",

Darkball rewards accuracy, reaction times, as well as creativity. As the pieces are rearranged, the ball can travel in any direction, and down any path with no limits to the number of players or ways it can be played.<br/><br/>Any endpoint Blink displaying cyan has a Darkball. Play begins when one player presses their endpoint Blink to release the Darkball. The ball moves along the pathway, making decisions randomly when it reaches forks. Clustered pathways are treated as forks, and can produce very chaotic behavior.<br/><br/>When the Darkball reaches your endpoint, you must press the button to bounce it back into the pathway. If you click too early, your endpoint will go dark for a moment, and you cannot press again until it brightens. If you press too late, you will take damage, as indicated by red lights on your endpoint. You can then release the Darkball by pressing.<br/><br/>Once a player has missed the Darkball 6 times, their endpoint will explode, and they are out. The last player remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>",

These wars were truly a world affair, with European powers fighting battles not only on the mainland of Europe but as far as India, Egypt, the Caribbean and America.<br/><br/>The greatest generals of the age finally faced each other on the field of battle; The Duke of Wellington, rooted to a little-known ridge, faced, the Emperor of the French. Napoleon Bonaparte, master of the attack, opposed brigades of British, Germans, Dutch and Belgians; brigades of an infamous army that, despite horrific casualties, clung to the ridge for over nine hours to ensure that the arrival of BlǬcher's Prussian army would put the Duke victory beyond doubt.<br/><br/>The Battle of Waterloo became a true landmark in military history, one that will never fade, and nothing on such a grand scale would be seen again.<br/><br/>This new starter set for Black Powder contains everything needed to start your campaign for victory at Waterloo!<br/><br/>",

Hunger of a Shadow Vile expands the role of Cities, provides new uses for Lux, and introduces Luxwardens and Cultists to the base game. Hunger of a Shadow Vile is not a standalone game: Shadows of Malice&reg; is required to play.  The expansion Seekers of a Hidden Light is only required to take advantage of the new uses for Lux offered in this expansion.<br/><br/>Hunger of a Shadow Vile brings life to the Cities of Aethos and highlights the struggle between the Lumosari, the Luxwardens of Aethos, and the Shahudiri, the Cultists of Xulth&ucirc;l. The additional content allows players to engage in battles to drive Xulth&ucirc;l&rsquo;s followers from the Cities of the Realm, and, in so doing, starve the Lord of Shadow and remove the threat it poses. Because Xulth&ucirc;l feeds on fear, anxiety, and despair, when all the Cities in the game are purged of Cultists and these dark emotions are excised, Xulth&ucirc;l begins to starve and grows too weak to generate Shadows.<br/><br/>But be warned! While you can defeat Xulth&ucirc;l by purging its Cultists from the Cities of Aethos, your efforts will not deter the Shadows from their singleminded pursuit of a skin for their master. And the Shadow Lord's corruptors are still roaming the land, seeking to debilitate the avatars with their master's corruption.<br/><br/>Time is not on your side.<br/><br/>",

The hard-working farmers gradually expand their settlements with the help of old acquaintances such as craftsmen, monks, and scholars, and they have to face only minor skirmishes, which affect their otherwise quiet life a little. A story for all those who love the quiet construction without big disturbances from outside.<br/><br/>The fourth story, &quot;England vs. France&quot;, differs quite a bit from the previous one: The age-old feud between these two countries serves as a basis for the clashes between the teams. Exactly four players are involved, two of them playing for France, the other two for England.<br/><br/>But who is who? This secret is revealed only in the course of the game, and often the surprise is big because one had bet on another competitor. Now it is time to quickly complete the common task and hope that the secret messages will also contribute to the victory in order to triumph in the end.<br/><br/>",

In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replay ability and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files.

They&rsquo;d like a shot at glory just like anyone else, and Blood Bowl is a fantastic way to put their dark magic to use for fun and profit. They&rsquo;ve raised their teams and are now ready to unleash their horrors on a pitch near you!<br/><br/>Necromancers often hire Werewolves to liven up their teams, calling upon ancient pacts and promising them plenty of fresh meat &ndash; as long as the wizards get to keep the bones. Meanwhile, Flesh Golems have long been, ahem, a &lsquo;staple&rsquo; of Necromantic teams, adding their custom-built combination of strength and unnatural resilience to the team&rsquo;s line of scrimmage. That&rsquo;s not all &ndash; Necromancers have begun to call not just upon the bodies of the dead, but the spirits of the damned too! We&rsquo;re not sure about the skills of the new Wraiths, but they definitely look like they&rsquo;ll have some sneaky tricks up their sleeves.<br/><br/>Necromancers are notoriously anti-social, so you&rsquo;ll just have to wait a little longer to learn more about the Wolfenburg Crypt-Stealers. But rest assured, this won&rsquo;t be the last you&rsquo;ll hear of these Necromantic Horror teams! Keep a watchful vigil for these creatures that go bump in the night, lest they catch you unawares.<br/><br/>- description from publisher<br/><br/>Necromantic Horror teams are compatible with the 2016 Edition of Blood Bowl using the &quot;Teams of Legend&quot; optional rules published by Games-Workshop.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Have you noticed patterns that conventional media does not explain? Do you want to know who is pulling the strings behind global decisions? Then It's Just A Theory is the game for you. In this fast-paced, storytelling card game players take on the role of conspiracy theorists competing against each other to come up with the greatest and most entertaining conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>During the game players create a conspiracy theory together, using &lsquo;fact&rsquo; cards that show concepts or objects which can be used to form conspiracy theories. One player is the lead conspiracy theorist who will start creating a theory using their cards. The lead conspiracy theorist will try to guide the theory towards an ending on one of their propaganda cards. However to do this they will have to compete against every other conspiracy theorist at the table, who wishes to highjack their theory and explain their own deluded ideas. Other players hijack a theory by trying to use their cards to interrupt and successfully challenge the theory. The winner of a round is the player who plays their propaganda card ending the theory. Points are scored by finishing theories and more points are awarded by playing more cards. The winner is the conspiracy theorist who has the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>So don your tinfoil hat, open your third eye and prepare to discover truths you did not know about the world, and remember; It&rsquo;s Just A Theory.<br/><br/>",

You possess authentic weapons and technology in a thrilling fog of war where every decicion you take may be your last. <br/>A system of rotatable discs defines your encounters with the enemy by storing all the data and reactions.<br/><br/>You fight to stay alive and to fulfill your secret missions. A 63 cm long wooden U-boat is used to store wooden torpedoes and fuel during the game. The deck&rsquo;s gun ammo is represented by wooden shells of different kinds and stored in a 20-round wooden magazine. All game tokens are made of wood and engraved as well. Burnt wood sets you back in time and deep under the surface of the ocean. You can call a wolfpack to support you or dive deep to avoid attacks while risking that the pressure may crack your hull every second.<br/><br/>You play multiple missions in every chapter and have unique targets each time. Move your ship above a overworld map and choose your path there. Fuel is used to keep on moving or follow your targets and alter the weather and daytime conditions. Support tickets allows you to refill your ammo and fuel or order combat support via radio. If you encounter enemies at the overworld map you start a combat loop which will be ended after you defeated your enemies or managed to escape. After each mission you will update your crew or even buy new technology for your submarine.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It does not repeat the extensive historical or bibliographic information already found in 1870, however.<br/><br/>Each well-researched scenario includes complete orders of battle, historical notes, map, and alternative scenarios; they range in size from relatively modest battles of a couple of divisions to multi-corps debacles.  Well-illustrated with contemporary artwork and terrain board pictures; a one page color quick reference sheet is included.  Approximately 65 pages, spiral-bound, full color.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The bulk of the Free Folk forces are made up of the everyday people of the various tribes. They don&rsquo;t have fancy metal armor. They don't relentlessly train and drill maneuvers. They barely have weapons, just scavenging a bit of bone or old swords from the battlefield. But what they lack in military tactics, they more than make up for in one thing: numbers. When the raiders come down from the north, they&rsquo;re like a tidal wave, overwhelming enemy defenses as they go.<br/><br/>The Free Folk Raiders unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Free Folk commanders a new option for the battlefield. The unit may not have the best stats in the game, but that means their low cost makes them very easy to combine with any force. The Raid Leader Unit Attachment adds to their deadliness, allowing another Fee Folk unit to activate directly after the Raiders do.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In fact, it's a true politically incorrect game, that can be played according to its rules or... not ! The rules are a bit complex and explain the multiple combination between counters and action pawns, but this complexity is more valuable for the trickiness !!!<br/><br/>The game is short enough so that it can be re-played thus avoiding silly quarrels, so let's play !<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BrickQuest is a game of small-scale fantasy combat similar to HeroQuest, Warhammer Quest, or MageKnight Dungeons. It requires at least two players to play and can be played easily by four to six players.<br/><br/>One player takes on the role of the BrickMaster. His job is to create, using construction blocks, a variety of dungeon rooms in which the game will take place, and creatures to inhabit them. Ideally these rooms will be modular so they can be added to the table one at a time as players enter them or get sight of them.<br/><br/>The remaining players will play heroic characters who enter the dungeon in pursuit of gold and glory.<br/><br/>Since BrickQuest is a boardgame, it uses a higher level of abstraction than roleplaying games. Rather than trying to capture all the nuances of fantasy combat, it uses simplified rules for quick and balanced play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game that attracted little attention when it was published in the eighties, despite the reputation of its designer. The concept was developed by French essayist Guy Debord (1931-1994) in 1965, but not published for many years. Debord described himself as a filmmaker, but he is known as the founder and one of the most important members of the Situationist International, a small band of avant-garde artists and revolutionaries. One key concept of their theory is the spectacle: the image replaces substance and modern capitalist society is a society of &quot;spectacular&quot; commodity consumption. Having long been treated as a producer, the worker is now courted and seduced as a consumer.<br/><br/>In 1977, Debord created a small publishing company named &quot;Les Jeux Strat&eacute;giques et Historiques&quot; with French movie producer G&eacute;rard Lebovici. The first game was Debord's &quot;Le Jeu de la Guerre&quot;, but only 4 prototypes are produced. The game was published as a book, with a map, rules and detailed descriptions in 1987. (Lebovici had been mysteriously shot in a parking lot in Paris by this time). In 1991, Guy Debord decides to insist that all his movies &amp; books be destroyed. It is also the fate of his book/game. Debord committed suicide in 1994. Nevertheless during the '90s, his work gains more and more influence. The book/game is published again in 2006 by French publisher Gallimard (price: 18 &euro;), but it's only a book (in French), co-signed by Debord's lifetime partner Alice Becker-Ho.<br/><br/>The game uses a mapboard containing 500 squares (25 x 20) divided in two by a border line. Each territory has 2 arsenal squares, 3 fortress squares, and 9 mountain squares (blocking movement,shooting and communication lines). Setup of units (infantry, cavalry, artillery, horse artillery) is free and secret. At his turn, each player may move up to 5 units and/or attack. Aim of the game is to completely destroy the enemy or conquer his 2 arsenals. No dice: combats are resolved taking into account the attack/defense ratios of the opponents (unit retreats from -1, and is destroyed from -2) Communication lines are critical.<br/><br/>The English translation published by Atlas has a faulty translation of the rules, making it more or less unplayable.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guided Lands - Tabletop battles for all fantasy miniatures<br/><br/>Guided Lands is a new tabletop game for two players, ages 14 and up. The game has an universal approach to tabletop gaming, where almost all fantasy miniatures with a scale around 28mm can be fielded in battle. Players take on the role of two mighty warlords, who muster their troops to claim the throne and be crowned king of the Guided Lands. Doing so players will use a unique step-by-step approach to create different races and equip their soldiers with weapons, armor and special abilities, thus making nearly all of your fantasy miniatures you have lying around somewhere ready to be used as heroes or units in Guided Lands. The scale ranges from small skirmishes to epic battles including monsters, magic and powerful artillery. An easy and streamlined ruleset as well as a card-driven initiative system keeps gameplay fast, while also engaging for seasoned tabletop generals. So dust of your old miniatures and start playing!<br/><br/>Guided Lands is the first game of the new publisher Smiling Monster Games and will be released in a limited first edition of 500 copies at Essen Spiel 2010 in German language (Hall 6, booth 6-808), estimated price &euro; 20 (softcover book).<br/><br/>More information at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.smiling-monster.de\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.smiling-monster.de</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back cover<br/>&ldquo; Cranston Snord's Irregulars have widely different reputations, depending on who you ask. Katrina Steiner thinks of the unit as one of the most effective, if unorthodox, units in her employ. House Marik would like to rid the Inner Sphere of the unit and has been trying for many years. Jaime Wolf sees the unit as a band of looters who have made good. One way or the other, the Irregulars are probably best known for their ability to get into and out of tight spots created by their never-ending quest for the lost artifacts and/or treasures of Mankind's past. Whether called looters or not, they are still a unit to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>This scenario set details the history of Snord's Irregulars, profiles the statistics and conditions of it members and the company 'Mechs, and includes 14 scenarios pitting the Irregulars against the wide variety of opponents they have fought throughout their colorful past. Also described are some of their more memorable treasure hunting expeditions.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a team trivia game with a betting element (guessing how many answers your own teammates or the other team will get right).<br/><br/>The game is played in two teams, team white and team black. Team white starts by drawing a card. Each card contains one general question or overall topic (e.g. &quot;Which of these fungi are edible?) and 6 specific questions (in the example above: names of different fungi). The first player of team white announces the general question for the first player of team black to answer. Before the specific questions are read, a die is thrown to determine which of the two teams (the active player's own team or the opponents) has to guess how many correct answers the active player will be able to give. The number of points gained by the active player's team is determined by both the number of correct answers and by how close the team's guess were. (The system for point allocation is a bit complicated; the game comes with a cardboard dial for determining the number of points.) Then the next player in team white has to answer questions and so on, until one of the tams reaches a  previously established numbers of points (40, 50 or 60 points).<br/><br/>Question cards come in three different types: &quot;for all ages&quot;, &quot;young players usually have an advantage&quot;, and &quot;more experienced players usually have an advantage&quot;, which allows the players to adjust the level of difficulty. Each player also randomly draws two joker cards, which can be played after the general question has been announced (but before the specific questions are asked) and is then discarded. Joker cards also come in three different types: one allows you to pass on your question to a different member of your team (the &quot;I'd rather you answer&quot; joker), one allows you to take over a question from a member of your team (&quot;I'm an expert in this area, I want to answer this&quot;), and one allows all the team members to answer a question together.<br/><br/>",

The presentation is minimalist: a mostly blank hex sheet and one page of rules. Players must improvise their own counters!<br/><br/>Like its successor, the game depicts combat between spaceships. Each ship is represented by a series of letters,with each letter representing a system (shields, engines, several types of beam weapon, torpedoes, guns, etc.). In each turn, ships fire their weapons, then move. The probability of a hit depends upon range. A hit destroys one of the target's systems, gradually reducing its firepower, defenses and speed. Movement is simply a number of hexes equal to the number of engine systems - no momentum or other complications of physics.<br/><br/>There are three scenarios: &quot;Main Battle Fleet&quot;, &quot;Convoy Action&quot; and &quot;Planet Assault&quot;. Terrain, in the form of radiation belts or asteroids, may be added in the players' discretion.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>     Starfire<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Buried deep within the soil lies an ancient tomb. But this tomb is more than a mere resting place. It's a library of spells lost over time and secrets meant to be forgotten. Spells and summons controllable by only the strongest of Sorcerers. Down in the eternal darkness these ancient tomes and scrolls have lived on throughout the turmoils above ground. Now that's all about to change, as a group of adventurers has broken the seals of the Spellforce and by doing so, they unleashed the single greatest terror known to man... Dragons.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). Is a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.<br/><br/>The Second Expansion to Elemental Clash focusses heavily on Spell cards and introduces a whole new card type - Equip Spells - which can be attached to Creatures in order to strengthen them or give them certain abilities. Furthermore, an exciting new ability is introduced: Salvage. Cards with Salvage can be played for free if discarded from you hand. Also, Dragons make their debut in Elemental Clash: Spellforce...<br/><br/>",

This game is inspired by the classic foosball.<br/><br/>Foosball is a game for 8-22 players, aged eight years, with a variable playing time depending on what players want. It's a typical convention game for a large number of players that have a long table to sit comfortably face to face.<br/><br/>In each team one player will be the goalkeeper, another player will be the striker and the others will be field players. The game is divided into rounds, which end when a team scores a goal. Each round begins with a goal kick. Goalkeeper places the ball in front of him and then the goalkeeper rolls ball (rolls die). When player rolls the ball, any other player of the same team can claim the ball and the opposing team can attempt to steal the ball. If the player that has received the ball is a striker, he can shot at goal. The team that has received fewer goals is the winner<br/><br/><br/>En Futbol&iacute;n los jugadores forman parte de dos equipos de f&uacute;tbol que se enfrentan en un partido, y su objetivo es<br/>ganar dicho partido. Este juego est&aacute; inspirado en el cl&aacute;sico futbol&iacute;n.<br/><br/>Futbol&iacute;n es un juego para 8-22 jugadores, mayores de ocho a&ntilde;os, con una duraci&oacute;n variable determinada en funci&oacute;n de lo que los jugadores deseen. Es un t&iacute;pico juego de convenci&oacute;n para un n&uacute;mero alto de jugadores que deben disponer de una mesa larga para sentarse c&oacute;modamente frente a frente.<br/><br/>En cada equipo un jugador ser&aacute; el portero, otro el delantero y el resto jugadores de campo. El juego se divide en rondas, que concluyen cuando un equipo marca gol. En cada ronda el juego comienza con un saque de puerta. Le entregamos el dado que hace de bal&oacute;n al portero, que comienza el juego lanzando el dado. Una vez el dado se ha lanzado, cualquier compa&ntilde;ero del jugador que ha lanzado puede reclamarlo, y cualquier contrario entre ambos jugadores puede robarlo. El delantero, cuando recibe el bal&oacute;n, puede lanzar a puerta. Gana el equipo que logra m&aacute;s goles.<br/><br/>",

It details everything from troop capabilities to a mercenary unit's expenses, and from the ins and outs of contract negotiations to the nature of 31st century warfare.  Commentary and views on the Succession Wars mercenary provide a solid background for gamers who need to learn the basics of the business of war, while game rules translate these ideas into simple systems for creating a merc outfit, finding and signing with employers, and resolving an entire military campaign.<br/><br/>This 104-page book contains more than 50 full-color illustrations and mercenary crests.  The complete history and operating procedures of three example mercenary companies are also included, the Eridani Light Horse, the Waco Rangers, and Wilson's Hussars.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "City of Ideologies is a strategic board game in a futuristic setting for two up to four players.<br/><br/>Humanity had to leave Earth centuries ago and travels in search of a new home in a huge city by the vastness of space. Players assume the role of leaders who are trying to reshape the city after their vision in an erupting revolution against the old system. For this they must legislate, kindle demonstration, gain influence over the districts of the city and always keep an eye on the mood of the people and the changing game board.<br/><br/>Both the game board, as well as the laws are constantly changing, it is important to keep a cool head, gain advantage through agreements with other players or through own concepts or intrigue to weaken the position of the other players.<br/><br/>City of Ideologies combines different game mechanics: You move protesters across the board, which turns around three times each round, role dice and push your luck, gain influence in districts, use different cards to perform unique actions and at the end of each round, one person is chosen by election of all players who is allowed to change a paragraph / rule mechanism.<br/><br/>Each action may be carried out in various ways. In most cases, they are paid with influence points, which vary from faction to faction depending on their main focus. If a player can not muster enough points for an action, then he can trade with his fellow players. Or he activates a district, which lets him perform the action or pulls a card that allows him to perform the action or uses a person of his faction. Or he changes a paragraph, so that the action costs less points.<br/><br/>The player who collects the most victory-points will win the game after five rounds. The way you collect victory points depends on the one hand on your ideology, which you choose at the beginning of the game. So every player gains victory points in different ways. For example, one player gets a victory point every time he prevents other players actions. Another player collects victory points if the other players give him voluntarily cards or influence points. On the other hand players can gain victory points on certain districts, by cards and paragraphs.<br/><br/>At the end the player will be victorious, who is both the most accurate follower of his ideology, as has also been successful in competitive areas.<br/><br/>",

That's 536 years, which is a LOT of history! Our system uses 10 year turns for a total of 54 turns. During these turns, the Romans (and Parthians/Sassanids) will create their empire, try to maintain it, and then finally defend it against many incursions.<br/><br/>The game covers not just the Roman Empire, but the Parthian/Sassanid (Persian) Empire as well, and even one you've probably not heard of: the Kushan Empire. The map covers from Ireland (Hibernia) to India and from Tingis (Morocco) to the lands of the Huns (Kazakhstan) on the 37&quot; by 18.5&quot; vinyl-covered map.<br/><br/>Units are included for all the peoples of Europe and Asia that were involved in the conflicts: the Celts (over 30 tribes), the Germans (tribes, migratory tribes, and Germanic Kingdoms), and over 35 other native peoples. Not only are the Huns included, but the less well-known Hunae (Hephthalites) that moved against the Sassanid Empire are as well. Two complete Roman armies are included on the four 88-counter sheets: the legions and the reformed Roman Army of the later Empire. There's even a counter for the &quot;Walls of Constantinople&quot; and counters for the numerous Civil Wars that Rome had. Leadership was important, and the best of the Roman Emperors are included, as well as the best of the Parthian and Sassanid &quot;King of Kings.&quot;<br/> Production is key to success, and the primary economic centers of Europe, Africa, and Asia are shown on the map. Gaining control of these is key to replacing your losses. The Parthians even get a boost for the profits from the Silk Road.<br/> Game Rules will be posted on-line and you can take a look at them before buying!<br/> &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.&quot; -Horace<br/><br/>",

This game is about trying to gain Trajan's favor and rule Rome from the shadows.<br/><br/>In Senatus players are members of a secret cabal attempting to control the Senate from behind the scenes. By manipulating the system, passing Bills that improve their status, and gaining influence over the city's factions, the players gain control over various aspects of Rome. Victory points are earned by having influence over the Senate, factions, Senators, and Emperor's Favor. At the end of the game, the player with the most extensive power structure (i.e. victory points) wins.<br/><br/>Be warned, Politics is a bloody endeavor!

        "description": "Kampfgruppe Commander is the winner of the prestigious Origins Award. This updates third edition adds two scenarios, a template for vehicle cards, and makes many small tweaks to the system --incorporating ten years of player feedback.<br/><br/>A poorly led Soviet tank brigade uses its entire turn simply to move and fire at an enemy held town. The German commander now seizes his chance. With superior command quality, his Panzers move twice to come out of seemingly nowhere to strike at the Soviet&rsquo;s flank. An exchange fire leaves one Soviet unit broken and other shaken. The Panzers then move out of harms way. The mobile defense prevails!<br/><br/>Most WWII rules leave you wondering how the Germans ever won a battle. Usually they fought outnumbered and against opponents with equal or superior equipment. So how did they ever win? The answer lays in their outstanding unit level leadership. Kampfgruppe Commander III places leadership quality at the forefront. Using the game&rsquo;s unique and fast-paced leader activation system, German units simply fight with more options and capabilities than their opponents. And each allied army fights differently with its unique command abilities that develop as the war progresses.<br/><br/>Kampfgruppe Commander III recreates all aspects of grand tactical mobile warfare using a scale of Company sized, multi-stand units. Infantry battles are as fast-playing and interesting as tank duels. The game&rsquo;s mechanics are fast and simple, yet full of historical flavor. Small to medium sized games can be played in under two hours, or larger battles involving whole divisions in an evening.<br/><br/>Included in the 136-page book:<br/><br/>     Complete Rules.<br/>     Eight scenarios introduce players to the simple, yet unique game mechanics and illustrate basic battle tactics.<br/>     Complete Tables of Organization and Unit Data for Germans, Italians, Americans, British, French, Soviets, and Polish.<br/>     Player Aid Cards and Unit Information Sheets<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "While the vipers lay in the shade and wait for their prey, the lions roam and hunt for theirs. Generalfeldmarschall Rommel himself started calling the tank-hunter Grenadiers of the Neue Deutsches Afrikakorps the 'African Lions'.<br/><br/>Throughout the history of the Axis presence in Northern Africa, these men have fought isolated, without any support from tanks, walkers or artillery, more often than any other Axis unit. With only an automatic weapon and a trusty Panzerfaust, they have repeatedly defended desperate positions against all the might of the Allied army.<br/><br/>More men coming from the &lsquo;African Lions&rsquo; have been awarded the Iron Cross (often posthumously) than from any other formation in the Afrikakorps. Brave and fierce, they surely deserve their nickname.<br/><br/>Many &ldquo;African Lions&rdquo; are veterans of the first Deutsches Afrikakorps. They have already been through the worst this war can offer, and many have chosen to join these specialist tank-hunters squads, were you need nerves of steel. Attacking an armoured vehicle at close range is not for the faint of heart, and veterans are more comfortable alongside others equally prepared to tackle the job, leaving younger recruits in the Grenadier Battle Squads, providing covering fire.<br/><br/>",

On September 1st, 1965 Pakistani forces launched Operation Grand Slam, an offensive intended to secure approaches to Jammu and Kashmir provinces from India.<br/><br/>Outnumbered Indian frontier forces fought desperate holding actions that successfully held the Pakistanis to limited gains that brought them to the outskirts of their objective, the town of Phillora. On September 15th Indian forces launched their counter-attack,<br/><br/>Operation Riddle, that sought to throw back the Pakistanis and take back the crucial crossroads town of Chawinda. What ensued was the largest tank battle of the post-WWII era to that date, one that would only be eclipsed by the 1973 Yom Kippur War.<br/><br/>Each copy of Hot Blood, Cold Steel is composed of the following:<br/><br/>Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets<br/>One sheet of 180 single-sided, un-mounted counters (mounted counters can be had for an additional $5.00).<br/>One Players' aid sheet<br/>7 pages of rules<br/><br/>The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Ilya Kudriashov. Hot Blood, Cold Steel uses the Blood and Steel design. Players draw formation chits to activate their formations and units, and play is very interactive. A complete game takes about 2 to 3 hours to complete. Although designed for two players, Hot Blood, Cold Steel is well suited to solitaire play.<br/><br/>",

Police alone cannot handle the investigation of all crimes, while the population and the press are demanding energetic action from the authorities. With police under pressure, authorities decide to hire private investigators in the hope of helping police unravel the recent wave of crimes plaguing the city. Players represent these investigators, and they must seek the clues hidden around the city and use all their acuteness to solve these mysteries&quot;.<br/><br/>Master Detective is a game of medium complexity, suitable for casual and experienced players. Its main mechanics are deckbuilding and deduction.<br/><br/>In each game, one crime card is randomly chosen and secretly put face down. This card contains the description of one murderer, one accomplice and one witness. The first player to discover the identity of these three characters is the winner.<br/><br/>During the game, the players will use their cards to walk around the city, buy stronger new cards to improve their decks and check the hidden clues, in order to solve that crime.<br/><br/>Take your magnifying glass and start unraveling crimes!<br/><br/>",

As soon as the 6 cards per player are distributed, you may add the monster cards of your choice to the game deck. The more monsters you include, the more the game will be tense and difficult.<br/><br/>As you are playing, if a monster shows up in a permanent challenge, no other monster can be played until the first one is defeated.<br/><br/>How to fight a monster?<br/><br/>In the card, on the upper right side, you will have an indication of the number of Monster tokens associated with the Brawl Card.<br/><br/>Place the corresponding number of tokens next to the Monster Card. As soon as a player engages in battle with a monster, he will roll the dice needed to overcome the challenge indicated. If he is successful, the player will take a token and place it next to him. If he is more successful than necessary - by means of having other players participate in the fight - he will take a Monster token for every successful roll of the dice. In union, there is strength! Keeping in mind that there is a very handy Cheap Shot Card you can use to &ldquo;invite&rdquo; the other players into your fight!<br/><br/>If even after a successful attempt the Monster is not dead, his card is placed in the permanent challenge along with all his remaining tokens. If there was already another permanent challenge card in place, the Monster Brawl Card is placed on top of it. The other permanent challenge can only be played if the Monster is defeated for good! In case of defeat, the player takes the effects of the defeat and places the Monster Card in the permanent challenge pile.<br/><br/>If a monster is placed in permanent challenge, he will calmly stay there until we engage him, even if he was previously injured.<br/>The player with the most Monster tokens will win the Monster Card once the creature is defeated. Merit will always come to those who hit the most.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Berlin Crisis was the culmination of a series of events that heated up the Cold War. Following the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the inconclusive Vienna Conference, Khrushchev saw Kennedy as a weak and inexperienced leader. He used this as an opportunity to solve the unresolved and aggravating problem: Berlin. East Germans were escaping to the West weekly by the thousands, creating economic chaos. A solution had to be reached. This led to Khrushchev's ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Western armed forces from West Berlin and later, the construction of the Berlin Wall. Events continued to escalate to the point where opposing troops faced each other down gun barrels at Checkpoint Charlie.<br/><br/>NATO 1961 is a simulation of the potential for war in Germany, covering events that could have led to World War Three. Players assume the roles of President John F. Kennedy and the NATO powers or Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and the Warsaw Pact general staffs. Confronted with the crisis, players can manage the conflict at a limited level or escalate it to full-out war between the Superpowers.<br/><br/>The 17&quot;x22&quot;map covers the Central Front including both East and West Germany as well as part of Czechoslovakia, France and the Low Lands. The 240 1/2&quot; counters (die-cut and back-printed) show regimental, brigade and divisional level forces of the NATO and the Warsaw Pact.<br/><br/>",

But the fate brought her later to an eastern magical school, where she learned the arts to cover and defend huge places with a misty veil, the perfect protection for cities against enemy attacks. But every coin is double sided, that's why sometimes her positive intentions cause more trouble than real good...<br/><br/><br/>    NCBC is a collection of mini expansions based on neutral big scale figurines, which are designed to enlarge the immersive Battalia universe, introducing a whole bunch of new strategic possibilities to the players and adding completely new adventure elements to the basically competitive plot. In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replay ability and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files. The miniatures are distributed in small packaging boxes with custom artwork as separate items or possibly in bundles.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "These aliens are the most basic of all xenomorph hive creatures, similar to a worker bee. Also referred to as Drones, they are responsible for the construction of alien hives by using a strong resin-like material they secrete. Spawned from human hosts, they stand roughly seven feet tall and sport smooth, elongated heads. As they age and mature, the smooth carapace sloughs off, revealing the ridged structures that adult Warriors have. Another job the Drones have is to procure captives for the hive to birth more xenomorphs. In combat, they are able to wield their long tails with deadly accuracy, the bladed tips able to punch through marine combat armour.<br/><br/>Like several other evolutions, they too are able to spit acid at their enemies and can do so with great ability. They also have enormous strength and they are able to easily subdue an adult human, or even fight a yautja head on. Drones often work alone, using stealth and waiting in ambushes to attack their prey. Their jet-black exo-skeleton allows them to blend into their environments; curiously well among the pipes and shrouded alcoves of starships. When they work together, a pack of them will often force their quarry directly into an ambush by chasing it around. Fear makes for a wonderful weapon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rocket engines blaze to life. Lasers light up the formless void. Galactic Empires clash. A lone hero rises up to fight for the resistance. Welcome to the world of Fistful of Lead: Galactic Heroes!<br/><br/>In Galactic Heroes, or GH for short, you&rsquo;ll take on the role of a Hero or Villain, leading a scruffy pirate crew looking for adventure, or maybe a troop of faceless soldiers of the Empire in search of bringing order to the galaxy. It&rsquo;s really up to you!<br/><br/>Galactic Heroes allows you to play a small-scale wargame in the far-flung future, a galaxy, far, far away, a grim, dark future 40,000 years from now, or a certain Red Planet where swords and ray guns reign supreme. Whatever YOU think Sci-Fi looks like, from your favorite Space Opera to gritty Pulp epic.<br/><br/>Like all the Fistful of Lead games, you&rsquo;ll only need 5 or 6 miniatures per player. You can play 1-on-1 games or larger skirmishes with up to 6 or 8 players. Galactic Heroes can be played with whatever miniatures you already have in your lead pile.<br/><br/>These rules contain all the information you need to play a game, including rules for building your forces and how to set up the table for different scenarios. Most players will pick up the game mechanics quickly, even people who haven&rsquo;t played a wargame before. The rules can be learned in a couple of turns, and the fast-paced game play keeps everyone engaged. If you&rsquo;ve played Fistful of Lead before, a lot of this will be familiar.<br/><br/>What separates Galactic Heroes from most tabletop miniature games on the market, is the unique card driven turn mechanism. This leads to snap decisions and tense moments where all the players are involved. The play is fast and furious, with a Hollywood flair, while record keeping is kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>The original Fistful of Lead has been around for a decade with a small, but loyal fan base. Galactic Heroes expands the line of western gunfight rules into outer space, because what else is a good sci-fi movie other than a western set in space?<br/><br/>-description from the Kickstarter page<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Banner, adds a whole new aspect to the Soviet forces in Flames of War.<br/><br/>It combines with Enemy at the Gates to allow you to build a wide variety of forces, with plenty of different play styles.<br/><br/>Red Banner allows you to field the re-organised tank corps that started appearing in the Battle of Stalingrad and made up the bulk of the counterattack troops in the Battle of Kursk and lead the advance to the Dnieper River in the Autumn and Winter of 1943.<br/><br/>Between Red Banner and Enemy at the Gates you can field almost any Soviet force that fought in late 1942 and 1943. The older style tank formations from Enemy at the Gates supported the riflemen right through the Kursk battles and beyond, while the newer formations of Red Banner formed the spearhead of the offensives. You can mix and match the two books to create almost any historical force.<br/><br/>&mdash;description (extract) from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reactor is an intense and competitive contest where each player must react to the alarms of the reactor core before their opponents. Played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system, Reactor is a high-speed battle that takes advantage of the distributed intelligence of Blinks pieces to create a constantly shifting gameboard and dynamic difficulty levels. Originally created at the Global Game Jam 2020, Reactor takes inspiration from competitive fighting games, and distills them down to an intense contest of reflexes and concentration.<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Arrange your Blinks so that each player has a single-file pathway to the center Blink. If possible, each player&rsquo;s path should be the same length. When you are finished setting up, long-press the center Blink to start the Reactor.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>The center Reactor will continuously flash colors. If it flashes the same color twice in a row, players must press the Blink at the end of their path to &ldquo;buzz in.&rdquo; The order in which the players buzz in will be shown by the color of their path. The first player to buzz in becomes green, the last player becomes red, and all others become yellow. Any player that does not buzz in is considered &ldquo;last&rdquo; and also displays red.<br/><br/>After results are shown, any player with a red path must remove the last piece on their branch and set it on the table in reach of all other players. This piece is now &ldquo;unstable,&rdquo; and displays a spinning yellow pattern.<br/><br/>All players, in addition to watching the Reactor, must now keep their eyes on these unstable Blinks. When an unstable Blink erupts in a green display, any player can grab it off the table and add it to the end of their chain. If the Blink flashes red instead, it is permanently out of the game.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION:<br/>The game continues until all players but one have lost all the Blinks in their pathway.<br/><br/>PAY UP VARIANT<br/>Reactor can also be played with a set of &ldquo;Pay Up&rdquo; rules. In this version, players who display red after buzzing in, either because they buzzed last or didn&rsquo;t buzz at all, must give their end pieces to the green player instead of setting them aside. Because players &ldquo;Pay Up&rdquo; after each round, there are no unstable Blinks on the table.<br/><br/>This version of the game is more focused than the standard rules, and two evenly-matched players can battle it out for a very long time.<br/><br/>",

The first two places can score, stealing information cards from other players.<br/><br/>At the end of 3 rounds, we will count the points.

However, due to various design faults and bugs in the operating system, controlling Lexomatic may not be as easy as you had hoped.<br/><br/>Lexomatic is a robot whose operating system accepts any word in the English language as a command word. Each letter in the word corresponds to a movement direction or an action (Activate electromagnetic shield; Open door; Grab item; Disable laser; Remove letter from buffer). Each turn you roll dice to add one or more random letters to the buffer. You then issue a command word that contains those letters in order, attempting to make Lexomatic negotiate the map, collect as many items as possible and escape intact. Finally, you resolve each letter in the command word. Invalid commands cause Lexomatic's temperature to increase, eventually leading to failure due to overheating.<br/><br/>The game includes an introductory mission, plus a campaign of 5 missions with new elements on each map and a small legacy element.<br/><br/>Designed for the 4th Roll &amp; Write Game Design Contest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Key audiences for these capstone documents include defense planners, programmers, budgeters, managers, analysts, and policymakers who support the development and management of forces that can be postured and employed in alignment with a given defense strategy to accomplish objectives.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop, RAND researchers developed Hedgemony, a wargame designed to teach U.S. defense professionals how different strategies could affect key planning factors in the trade space at the intersection of force development, force management, force posture, and force employment. The game presents players, representing the United States and its key strategic partners and competitors, with a global situation, competing national incentives, constraints, and objectives; a set of military forces with defined capacities and capabilities; and a pool of periodically renewable resources. The players are asked to outline their strategies and are then challenged to make difficult choices by managing the allocation of resources and forces in alignment with their strategies to accomplish their objectives within resource and time constraints.<br/><br/>Hedgemony can be played in a modestly sized conference room equipped with a projection screen and a table big enough for the game board and ten to 12 people. Assuming trained players and facilitators are available, a game session of the length necessary to complete a useful number of turns for the session&rsquo;s learning objectives will typically require a half-day or full-day commitment. Detailed lists of required game components and full descriptions of the facilities and setup procedures necessary.<br/><br/>This is game is considered a governmental roleplaying game to simulate real world dynamics.<br/><br/>",

Following the US intervention in April, the unit was deployed to Đồng Nai Province to protect the Bien Hoa Airbase. The 173rd was a &ldquo;showcase&rdquo; unit that embodied what was to have been an international effort to combat the spread of Communism in South Vietnam. From the start the unit was engaged in battles with the National Liberation Front&rsquo;s 9th Division for control of the province.<br/><br/>In November two battalions, one from the 503rd US Airborne Regiment and another from the Royal Australian Rifles, were deployed to once again &ldquo;search and destroy&rdquo; the elusive Viet Cong. The offensive was dubbed Operation Hump, as many of the participants optimistically felt that once this fight was over they would soon be going home. This time, however, the Communists elected to stand and fight as their brethren had done further north earlier at the A Shau Valley. What resulted was one of bloodiest and violent fights to that point in the war, sowing the first doubts among the US and Allied forces that perhaps victory for them was not &ldquo;just around the corner&rdquo;... Perhaps you can do as well or better?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Scientists have recently discovered a mistake in its orbital calculations and predict that it will collide with Earth in the year 2038!<br/><br/>There is only one way to prevent this catastrophic event: destroy the comet. A secret experimental rocket station built in 1929, when rocket technology was still in its infancy, is our only hope. In order to complete this mission, a rocket full of explosive cargo must be launched at the comet each time it approaches Earth, weakening and ultimately destroying the menace over the course of four periapsis events.<br/><br/>Four brave scientists will simultaneously time travel between the last four years of periapsis ‒ 1930, 1957, 1984, and 2011, to attempt to destroy the deadly comet. They must ensure the explosive cargo reaches the Rocket Station in time. The only consistent form of travel across these years is rail, so they must build an iron path for the cargo to reach its destination.<br/><br/>If they can build a track for all four trains to reach the Rocket Station, while repairing damaged rails and navigating obstacles, they can save the planet! But they have to be careful: their choices in the past affect the future, and if any one of the trains falls off the track... the Earth is DOOMED.<br/><br/>In 27Panic you play cooperatively as a team of scientists building a railroad track in four years simultaneously. You build tracks by playing cards and ones that are built in the past carry forward into the future. You must plan closely with your team in order to strategically build a path for explosive cargo to follow in each year. If you are able to get the cargo to a nearby rocket station in all of the years by avoiding obstacles and repairing damaged tracks, you'll win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Robin Hood is an old school style tactical solitaire board game of action and adventure, with a bit of wargame and RPG elements mixed in. An open-ended sandbox style game where the player may choose his own path.<br/><br/>Set in Nottingham Shire, England in the year 1180, the player will control up to 6 Merry Men at once. The Merry Men will frequently encounter enemy bandits, Nottingham soldiers, or possibly even Foresters in Sherwood Forest.<br/><br/>Game components include a Nottingham Shire map, various mats, a tables book, and several counter sheets representing individual Merry Men, soldiers, weapons, items, etc.<br/><br/>The player moves his band of Merry Men across map, searching for rich targets to steal from, visiting Newstead Abbey and The Blue Boar Inn to buy necessary items, gamble, or pick up new quests. They may even sneak into a castle in order to steal gold or rescue a peasant in the dungeon.<br/><br/>As the Merry Men earn more experience points, they will continue to improve their skills.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of your Merry Men is to arm the towns of Nottingham Shire, convince them to rebel and attack Nottingham Castle, and remove the Sheriff from power before December 31st, 1180. To accomplish this, the Merry Men must increase Loyalty of the town to 10, plus arm the town with 10 weapons. The more towns that take part in the rebellion, the better chance they will have of succeeding in defeating Nottingham Castle and removing the Sheriff from power. But if the towns fail to remove the Sheriff before December 31st, the Merry Men will all be automatically hunted down and executed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sensuikan: Japanese Fleet Submarines, 1941-45 is a solitaire, tactical level game that places you in command of a Japanese Fleet submarine from Pearl Harbor until the end of the war in 1945. <br/>After choosing a class, your mission is to conduct special missions as assigned by the Combined Fleet. <br/>The player will take his submarine on assigned missions with the objective to complete said missions, as opposed to necessarily sinking merchant vessels (although that is sometimes an objective). <br/>You will be advancing your crew quality and increasing your commander&rsquo;s rank and awards&mdash;all while remembering you have to make it home amidst diminishing odds of survival as the war progresses.<br/><br/>Players will find it extremely challenging to survive an entire tour from 1941 to 1945, at which time, if still alive, you will surrender at port, having done your part on the front lines.<br/><br/>A fascinating historical addition to Sensuikan is three new modules: the Aircraft Module, the Midget Sub Module, and the Kaiten (suicide torpedo) Module. These modules facilitate play if a player is assigned to a submarine that is equipped with one of these special capabilities.<br/><br/>The system is packed with rich technical detail based on the various submarine classes used by Japan. There are no less than 17 classes of submarine to choose from. These include:<br/><br/>     Types A, B, C<br/>     Junsen (3 classes)<br/>     Kirai-Sen Class<br/>     Kaidai (5 classes)<br/>     Type B. 3 and Type C. 3<br/>     Sen-Toku and Sen-Taka Classes<br/>     Type A (Modified)<br/><br/><br/>The different classes have historical equipment, sometimes including aircraft in watertight hangars, midget submarines, and later in the war, suicide torpedoes. You may be assigned to special missions based on your class&rsquo;s capabilities &ndash; perhaps a midget submarine attack on Pearl Harbor or Australia, the bombing of the U.S. west coast, or possibly even an attack on the Panama Canal.<br/><br/>Besides the focus on hardware, the human aspect of the war is captured as the submarine Commander (the player) and his crew can improve over time via skills acquisition. In addition to having combat modules to facilitate ease of play, the game includes a major change by including the &ldquo;Major Event&rdquo; markers that track the war&rsquo;s progress and possibly involve the player in supporting the Major Events as they occur.<br/><br/>Gameplay moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial assignment, your submarine goes on patrol, randomly rolling for events and encounters. Special emphasis is placed on successfully conducting any operations assigned to you by Higher Command, as implemented by the &ldquo;Major Event&rdquo; marker system. Although sinking enemy shipping is always encouraged, the game&rsquo;s primary goal is to conduct operations as assigned to support the Main Force Fleet or other ongoing significant military operations.<br/><br/>This game should be highly accessible to those familiar with the The Hunters or Silent Victory game systems and is meant to be a historical yet highly playable and exciting solitaire game covering Japanese fleet boat operations in World War II.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is not about railways, but about investing in trading groups of countries to earn money. The main differences between this game and the usual 18xx game are that there are no railway tiles in the sea. Instead, you can use &quot;route blocks&quot; to expand your routes. In this period of Asian maritime trade, there are obstacles such as Japanese pirates and European powers. The game is played in a number of different ways. The number of turns is predetermined. There is no &quot;Bankruptcy is the end of the game&quot; rule. The game is similar to Poseidon, but a bit more 18xx.<br/><br/>",

Players will lead either the English forces of King Henry V or the French nobility in the levying of forces, management of logistics, and campaigning through Northern France. Designed by Joe Schmidt, Henry aims to create a more streamlined version of Levy &amp; Campaign that is equally suitable for someone&rsquo;s first experience  or a quicker lunchtime gaming session.<br/><br/>The English player will build their army at the outset of the game, and in doing so set their victory conditions based on these choices, and then begin their campaign. While the English march through Normandy, the French Nobles will need to rapidly respond by levying their forces and navigating the internal court politics of their ongoing civil war between the Armagnac and Burgundian factions. Then, once ready for battle, the French will attempt to hunt down and prevent King Hal and his happy few from returning home.<br/><br/>The Levy &amp; Campaign system offers us something more focused on the human element. Humans need to be fed, and that food needs to be both secured and transported. Without that, even the greatest of armies will fail. Henry endeavors to lift the veil of the mythology of the Battle of Agincourt to offer a more detailed look into the circumstances that created the legend.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Last Labour of Hercules is a game about the English occupation of Tangier during the second half of the 17th Century. The port was bequeathed to King Charles II as part of a dowry when he married the Portuguese princess, Catherine of Braganza. It would be another generation before the English captured Gibraltar from Spain, but Tangier seemed an ideal base for many of the same reasons. It would be a handy staging post for ships bound for West Africa and the Caribbean, it would place a watch upon the Catholic Spanish, and it might facilitate trade with the Moors, the port being one terminus of the ancient caravan route for slaves and gold-dust. There were only two problems. First, the Moors hated outsiders. Second, but more importantly, the port lay open to the worst the Atlantic could throw at it. The anchorage was deep, but it was unprotected. For twenty-two years the English tried to maintain themselves at Tangier, and withstood at least two significant sieges by the Moors, but at last the Government decided they had wasted enough money, though the fact that the Moors had at last forged a unified (and powerful) kingdom might have had something to do with the decision to pull out.<br/><br/>The Last Labour of Hercules is part card game and part wargame. Covering a period of twenty years, it does not represent a single siege of Tangier but many attempts, some large and some small, by the Moors, to dislodge the English. For long periods the protagonists tolerated each other, and the English even formed the odd local alliance. The Moors spent much of the period of occupation engaged in a brutal civil war &mdash; or put another way, they were in the process of emerging from Medieval anarchy. Also, they had to ward off attempts by the Ottoman Sultan to reestablish his suzerainty over the land.<br/><br/>As the English player you must keep the Moors at bay while gauging how many of your precious resources you can spare to build Tangier&rsquo;s Great Mole &ndash; a breakwater that will protect your ships. As the Moorish player you must endevour to make the English inclined to leave, ideally by sacking Tangier. At the same time, you have two additional problems to deal with. First, there is the small matter of a civil war among the Berber tribes. Then, there is the Sultan at Istanbul. He seems to be under the false impression that Morocco belongs to him. If the Moors ever take the town's Citadel they win outright. If the English ever complete the Great Mole they win outright. If neither side can achieve their main objective, someone might or might not win on points, by comparing the English player&rsquo;s progress on the Mole against the Moorish player&rsquo;s ability to secure Morocco for his dynasty.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The strength of the bomber formations that survive the run in to the target areas determine how many cards are drawn to get hits. Each Target Area has a minimum number of hits required to win the game.<br/>Do you execute pre-war doctrine and send unescorted bombers deep into enemy territory? Use your fighters for escort duty or send them on fighter sweeps? <br/>Assemble B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-24 Liberators,<br/>P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs. Assign Lead Bombardiers and Ace Gunners.  Will they encounter FLAK filled skies, flocks of ME 109s and FW 190's, or a dreaded Me 262?

The goal of this game is to put a high quality, inexpensive rule set in the hands of players which allows them to play campaigns as various denizens of a post-zombie-apocalyptic world, a genre that we feel is missing an iconic miniatures game that provides a fun, compelling, yet streamlined experience.<br/><br/>In Zed or Alive, players choose to either start one of several human group types or they can opt to develop their own unique Virus Strain. Human groups range from standard Survivors, Military units, to even outlandish and savage Tribals. These groups will clash with each other in various Confrontation types (scenarios), all the while fending off independent Shambler zombies (classic &quot;walkers&quot; which are neutral, although Virus Strain players can influence their actions). Additionally, players may choose to go on solo or co-op confrontations if they do not enjoy head to head competitive play.<br/><br/>As players go from game to game, they will gain experience and level up characters, add new group members, scavenge loot to barter, sell, or even combine into custom-made gear with the new jury-rigging rules! Powerful groups can get their hands on a vehicle and attempt to get it running, giving themselves a huge advantage both in battle and between games.<br/><br/>Virus Strain players, unlike human ones, do not control a specific group of individuals, but instead control their own unique branch of the zombie pathogen. This manifests itself through mutant &quot;Aberrant&quot; zombies which can be controlled during gameplay, able to become part of any scenario and throw a wrench in the works. Some are pure killing machines, others are more insidious and are geared toward influencing the actions of otherwise mindless Shamblers. Instead of gaining experience, Virus Strains gain Evolution Points for inflicting carnage and chaos with which to mutate their Shamblers, different Aberrant types, or their Virus Strain as a whole.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "La Bataille d&rsquo;Heilsberg 1807 recreates the almost forgotten, but extremely bloody battle for the East Prussian Teutonic castle town just four days before (June 10, 1807) the decisive battle of Friedland. While the French were under the oversight of the Emperor Napoleon, their forces at Heilsberg were under the command of Marshal Joachim Murat and Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult. Both Marshals frontally assaulted the well-prepared defenses of the Fourth Coalition around the old Teutonic Knights town of Heilsberg in East Prussia. The commander of the Coalition forces was Graf von Bennigsen, a Hanoverian general in service to the Russians. Bennigsen had spent months fortifying the area around Heilsberg with redoubts; fleeches; and assorted abattises surrounding the old Teutonic Knights castle in Heilsberg itself. It was probably the best-fortified position of any Napoleonic battlefield. Napoleon had 85,000 troops in the immediate area on June 10 facing Bennigsen&rsquo;s 90,000 Russians and Prussians. The battle lasted nearly 12 hours and consisted of a series of cavalry charges and French frontal assaults on the well-defended Coalition positions. There were 20,000 casualties in the battle.<br/><br/>The game will has two large maps; over 700 counters and assorted player aides, including a virtual 160-page rules and historical commentary book.<br/><br/>",

Minor companies eventually merge into major ones that have more freedom to expand their operations.<br/><br/>The twelve minor companies have distinct abilities that persist even after merging into a major to make for different combinations and unique company identities.<br/><br/>Enjoy multiple game modes and modular options that allow groups to tailor the game to their needs.<br/><br/>",

It uses maps of the period and a simple system to manage units. Combats are solved using a face to face system, simple but precise, with the morale as the main endpoint. Combats can also be fought using any existing operational or tactical system including miniatures.<br/><br/>The present volume 2 does not need volume 1 to be played. It includes a 72 page-booklet including all the rules of volume 1, and more complex parameters like supplies, the management of losses, as well as prisoners and artillery reserves, are introduced. Two additional and more complex combat systems have been added.<br/><br/>All the material needed to play the campaigns of 1805 (Germany), 1812 (Russia) and 1813 (Saxony) are included (33 unit sheets totaling 641 divisions and Leaders, and 10 maps).<br/><br/>",

First seeing use by Republic police forces during the height of the Clone Wars, this transport is sufficiently armed and armored to contend with criminal enterprises or insurgent cells. Whether dropping clone troopers into urban battlefields or pinning down Rebel soldiers, both the Republic and Empire can use the LAAT/le for both transport and air support.<br/><br/>Within this expansion, players will find everything needed to add a LAAT/le Patrol Transport to their Republic and Imperial armies. The beautifully detailed, unpainted hard plastic miniature can be assembled with either Phase II clone pilots or Imperial TIE pilots, and unit cards for both factions help players fully integrate them into their forces. In addition to these cards, 12 upgrade cards invite players to customize their LAAT/le with unique pilots from both factions as well as ordnance and comms systems.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Canadians were assigned the far right flank of the British Eighth Army, on the coast, and given the task of driving northwards to capture the small port town of Ortona. Before they could do that, however, they would have to cross the heavily defended Moro River, about three-kilometres South of Ortona. The Canadians' plan called for the crossing the river and the securing of a bridgehead at three points; on the right along the coast, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment was to capture San Donato; in the centre, the Seaforth Highlanders were to capture San Leonardo, and on the left flank, the Princess Patricia&rsquo;s Canadian Light Infantry was to capture Villa Rogatti.<br/><br/>Crossing the Moro is not a complete game and ownership of a tactical wargaming system such as MMP&rsquo;s Advanced Squad Leader, Critical Hit&rsquo;s Advanced Tobruk System, or Firefly WWII Battlegroup Actions is required.<br/><br/>",

Its new encounter cards force you even further back on the defensive as you stumble into a Dunlending ambush. New enemies and treachery cards reinforce the original scenario's design adding new effects that trigger when you draw cards, as well as others that discard the cards you've just drawn, forcing you to draw more. Meanwhile, several new locations offer the scenario's Dunland enemies a measure of cover that makes it harder to damage them in the staging area and harder to avoid.<br/><br/>Nightmare Decks for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios cast in the shadows of the game's challenging Nightmare Mode. Featuring deadlier enemies, darker locations, and more terrifying surprises, each Nightmare Deck introduces new, alternate encounter cards and instructions for using them to reshape a scenario's encounter deck. The result? A nightmarish journey through territory you thought you knew, but with twists and turns that will have you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>",

Ops is a strategy board game for 2-4 players in which you take on the role of one of seven agency directors, each with different specializations, and vie with other directors for missions and gathering of resources such as operatives, agents, gadgets, deployment assets, and intelligence.  But plan well, because the other agency directors are competing with you for the same resources and only the most cunning director will be named the new chief director!<br/><br/>During the course of play, you compete with other players to claim missions. Players then use their budget to train agents, claim power cards and resources to help complete missions or even increase future budget. Completed missions give victory points and other rewards that give new missions or help complete other missions. At the end of 8 rounds of play, the director with the most points is named the new chief director and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "    Parallel is a 2-4 four player light-weight matching card game of deduction and strategy. Play consists of being dealt (4) randomized playing cards; followed by the clockwise execution of various actions in a race to match the goal card in the center. This means that each players goal is unique to their perspective of the goal card. After the cards are dealt, each players stands them keeping them secret. Each round consists of checking for matches, and execution of actions until one player claims victory. Players begin with (4) action tokens and lose one for every match. Action tokens replenish at the beginning of each players turn, after their first turn. <br/> Their are two types of actions. The Swap and Switch actions effect your cards, while the Flip and Spin action effect the goal card. This is important because players cannot win on the same turn as manipulating their own cards. This means, in order to win, a player must come into their turn having 4 matching, a winning board state, or have the ability to Flip or Spin the goal card into a winning position. Winning a round grants a VP token.<br/><br/>For more on Parallel please follow @ParallelCG on twitter or check out Parallel.Mozello.Com<br/><br/>",

Deal each player five cards, and give each player three Life Tokens.&nbsp; <br/>Place the deck in the middle of the table.<br/>The player&rsquo;s Hand is kept concealed.<br/>The player&rsquo;s Stockpile will be placed face up on the table in front of them.<br/>Cards are drawn from the Search Deck.&nbsp; Discarded cards go on the Trash Pile, which is placed next to the deck.<br/>There are six card types: Food, Water, Shelter, Weapon, Beast, and Trash.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/>Each round is broken up into two phases: Search, and Negotiation.<br/><br/>SEARCH PHASE<br/>In the Search phase each player takes it in turn.&nbsp; The player who hasn&rsquo;t eaten for the longest time goes first.<br/>First, you can place any number of cards from your Hand face up into your Stockpile.&nbsp; There is no limit to the number of cards you can have in your Stockpile.<br/>You can also discard any unwanted cards onto the Trash Pile.  In the first round, discard any Beast cards in your Hand before you draw from the Search Deck.<br/>You can now draw a number of cards from the Search Deck equal to five minus the number of cards in your hand (e.g., if you have two cards left in your hand, draw three cards).&nbsp; You may never have more than five cards in your Hand.  You can only draw once per round.<br/>Any Beast cards that you draw from the Search Deck must be placed face up in front of you.  This indicates that you have been attacked by one or more beasts whilst searching, and must defeat them to avoid losing any Life Tokens.<br/>Once you have drawn from the Search Deck play moves to the next player on your left.  Once every player has had a turn the phase is over.<br/>If at any point the Search Deck is exhausted, shuffle the Trash Pile and start the deck anew.<br/><br/>NEGOTIATION PHASE<br/>All players now negotiate at the same time and with anyone they choose.<br/>Players with missing resources should do their best to attain them from other players to avoid losing any Life Tokens.<br/>The only rule to negotiation is simple: you can&rsquo;t steal cards from another player&rsquo;s Hand or Stockpile (actually, there is one exception to this which is explained below under Weapons).  <br/>You can trade, haggle, swindle, beg, coerce, threaten, lie, manipulate, make promises, break promises, form alliances, betray alliances, seek revenge, avenge others, be helpful, be unhelpful, do nothing, or do anything that you think might help you to win.    <br/>Once a card has been played into your Stockpile it can&rsquo;t go back into your Hand.  Any cards you receive from other players must be placed into your Stockpile and not into your Hand.&nbsp; The phase is over when the majority of players agree that they&rsquo;ve finished negotiating.<br/>NOTE: Trash cards are essentially worthless.  That said, they can be useful for tricking other players into believing that you have more resources in your hand than you actually do, believing that you have a Weapon card in your hand, or even accepting them for trade (if you can get away with it).<br/><br/>WEAPONS<br/>Weapon cards can be used in one of four ways:<br/>1. Remove one Beast attack from any player including yourself.<br/>2. Remove one Life Token from any player.<br/>3. Steal all or part of a Stockpile from any other player.<br/>4. Counter one Weapon card played.  You must play the Weapon card immediately after the other player.<br/>You can play any number of Weapon cards during the Negotiation phase.&nbsp; <br/>Once a Weapon has been played it is discarded onto the Trash Pile.<br/>HINT: You can threaten to use a Weapon on another player before actually playing it, or even to avoid having to play it.  You can also pretend to have a Weapon card in your Hand when you don&rsquo;t, in order to bluff other players.<br/><br/>END OF THE ROUND<br/>Each player must now discard one of each resource &ndash; Food, Water, and Shelter &ndash; onto the Trash Pile.  These can be discarded from the player&rsquo;s Hand and/or Stockpile.<br/>For each resource not available to discard, that player loses one Life Token.&nbsp; <br/>For each Beast card still in play on the table in front of them, that player loses one Life Token, and then the Beast card is discarded onto the Trash Pile.&nbsp; <br/>Once a player loses all of their Life Tokens they are out of the game.<br/>Players are encouraged to continue vocal involvement even after going out.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The game ends when only one player is left and is declared the winner.<br/>If every last player is removed from the game in the same round, then nobody wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Turning Tides is a tile placement game for ages 5 and up. Players place tide pools, each containing a critter, and seek to create roads to the tide pool by matching compatible edges. Some tide pools will disappear faster than others as rising waters threaten shallower pools. As players build out a unique set of tide pools they may also block off any player who seeks to create a continuous path. Play time can range from 30 to 45 minutes depending on skill level.<br/><br/>To play, download the two zip files containing the rules and fully colored game assets. To play you also need road sticks, such as these <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/stick-orange\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/stick-orange</a>. For our play tests we used orange, blue, purple, and green sticks, however, any color is suitable. If you do not have sticks on hand, you may cut out rectangular pieces of colored paper(smaller than 1 by 1/2 inch) and use those instead, perhaps even folding them into tents for an easier time picking them up.<br/><br/>If you really like the game, you can also order hard copies of all the assets here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/turning-tides?dept_uri=&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/turning-tides?dept_uri=...</a>;dept_name=.<br/><br/>&mdash; Nastia Garachtchenko<br/><br/>",

Jutland: Battle Analysis 1914 looks at what happened before the Battle of Jutland: Helgoland Bight, the Scarborough Raid, the Yarmouth Raid and more.<br/>Jutland: Battle Analysis 1914' is different from other works on the North Sea campaign, thanks to its ties to our Great War at Sea: Jutland game. We look at how the game simulates the operations, and then we flesh them out with more battle scenarios &ndash; fast-playing actions using just the Tactical Map, where you fight out the battles between ships with guns and torpedoes.<br/>Jutland, the game, has a lot of scenarios: 51 in total. Forty-four of those are operational scenarios, but only seven of them are battle scenarios. So the Battle Analysis adds 26 more of them, based on the surface actions that could have taken place &ndash; or at least one side hoped would take place &ndash; based on the expectations of one or both naval staffs when they sent the fleets to sea. Plus nine new operational scenarios.<br/>Jutland is already a very fine game (our most popular ever, even more than Third Reich) and a good instrument through which to re-play history. The Battle Analysis makes it even more so, while adding more quick fun by fleshing out the battle scenario aspect of the game.<br/>Jutland: Battle Analysis 1914 is a 64-page, large-format book supplement for Jutland; you&rsquo;ll need a copy of the game to play most of the scenarios and Cruiser Warfare to play all of them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The investigation, the negotiations with the rest of the cast and the exchange of information are essential pieces to solve the crime, but do not forget that the murderer is one of you.

The head of a local mafia family is murdered in his mansion shortly before he is rumored to announce his successor. Next to the corpse, there is only a handcuffed man. The movements of the victim's little brother and wife, as well as those of the men in the family, the fortune teller who works for the house and the prostitute who frequents the mansion intertwine over and over again until weaving a dense tapestry that hides the truth.<br/><br/>",

Stepping off just after 6:00 a.m., Company A crossed its line of departure, the road that ran west out of St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle. Some 200 to 400 yards from its line of departure was a long, steep gully that ran 750 yards east to west along the battalion's front, called &ldquo;Purple Heart Draw&rdquo;. Company A did not meet stiff opposition until it reached Purple Heart Draw, then a murderous fire came from automatic weapons emplaced in houses along the road south from St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle and from the south bank of the draw... <br/> <br/>St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: Company A was being pinned down by heavy mortar and artillery fire in Purple Heart Draw; Company C, to its right had moved forward against lesser difficulties thanks in part to the assistance of the engineers of the US 2d Combat Engineer Battalion, who blasted gaping holes in the thick sides of the hedgerows for the support tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion to pass through. The men of Company C quickly followed up and by mid-morning had closed on the small chateau, which seemed heavily fortified and bristling with German machine-guns... <br/><br/><br/>St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: By late morning, the 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment was finally able to cross Purple Heart Draw, but had suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile on the east side of St-Georges-d'Elle, the Germans still held the lower end of Purple Heart Draw. It was decided that in an effort to draw off any Germans from reinforcing their position in front of the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s main effort, the 3d Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment would launch a series of diversionary attacks. Company L, US 23d Infantry Regiment started forward, tasked with the clearance of the eastern half of St-Georges-d'Elle, but no sooner had it cleared the last hedgerow just north of the town, when it too came under heavy fire... <br/><br/><br/>St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: Through out the day, the drive of the 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment, while it had been slowed by stubborn resistance, had packed too much power for the Germans, who fought to hold Hill 192 and their lines near St-Georges-d'Elle. The Germans, in a last desperate attempt to halt the US advance, were forced to commit Fallschirm Sturmgesch&uuml;tz-Brigade 12, Fallschirm Aufkl&auml;rungs-Kompanie 3, and their last reserves, Fallschirm Pionerie-Abteilung 3, in a last ditch counterattack north along the heavily-treed road towards St-Georges-d'Elle in the hopes of catching the Americans off-guard...  <br/><br/><br/>",

Twelve armies of ComStar's Com Guards clashed with twenty-five Galaxies of Clan forces on the hills and plains of the planet Tukayyid. The prize for this battle was the glittering blue gem of the Inner Sphere, the home of humanity: Terra.<br/><br/>A combination of Com Guard ingenuity, Clan short-sightedness, and plain luck allowed the ComStar forces to defeat the Clans one by one -- only Clans Ghost Bear and Wolf managed to win any sort of victory. At the end of twenty-one days of fighting, both forces counted ComStar the victor; Earth was saved.<br/><br/>Tukayyid gives players the chance to change history. More than 25 scenarios represent all the major engagements of the battle of Tukayyid. As the Clans, players may engage in batchall, or bidding, to determine who among them is worthy to lead their forces to the victory that was historically denied them. As the Com Guards, the players must use superior numbers and guerrilla tactics to overcome the Clan's advantage of technology and skill.<br/><br/>Tukayyid is a BattleTech scenario pack that provides historical notes and personal accounts of this epic battle and features a unique point system that allows players to design balanced games and use the Clan bidding system.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>At over a hundred pages in length, with 27 assorted scenarios and details on 4 new ComStar BattleMechs and the unique Wolfhound IIC variant piloted by Phelan Kell/Phelan Ward, it'd be hard to argue that you're not getting your money's worth out of this particular scenario pack. Unfortunately, it's out of print and the current licence holder hasn't shown any indications of making an electronic copy available or re-printing this scenario pack, so tracking one down can be difficult. From a fluff point of view, details within this scenario pack are consistent with other expansions of the time, such as the Jade Falcon sourcebook, but disagree with expansions produced later, which may be one of the reasons for it staying out of print.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Lesser Wrath<br/><br/>By order of her Imperial Highness, by the Grace of God, Empress and Autocrat of All the Russians, you are hereby appointed Generalissimo of all imperial troops currently serving in Finland. Your instructions are to carry the war to the enemy in the manner you best see fit, but not so as to endanger either the realm or the royal purse. If you fail, there will be... displeasure. Your duties commence at once. Do not return without victory.<br/><br/>In 1741, while the rest of Europe involved itself in yet another interminable succession war, Sweden and Russia squared off in yet another of their own squabbles for dominance in the Baltic. The Russian monarchy was unstable, and a cabal of Swedish hawks - whose party was known as the Hats - sought to replace the current empress with one friendly to Sweden. France, Sweden's paymaster, encouraged the plan, hoping to distract Russia from affairs in Europe. The Swedes would claim some of the territory taken from them during the Great Northern War. Either the new empress would grant them the land out of gratitude for their aid, or their armies would simply take it. It was a daring plan, and one beyond Sweden's means. And yet it came very close to success. The coup went off as planned, but the Russian Army, led by one of Europe's best marshals - Peter Lacy of County Clare - struck first, upsetting the Swedish timetable. Instead of the Swedish army managing the palace coup from the Winter Palace, it was floundering in the snows of Karelia when the new regime took power. Now, unable to acquire the territory they desired through negotiations, the Hats foolishly challenged the full might of Russia to a trial of arms...<br/><br/>The Russo-Swedish War of 1741-1743, otherwise called the Hats' War or the War of the Hats, has to be the most obscure conflict Red Sash Games has tackled so far. Measured by the butcher's bill, it was hardly a minor one, however, with something like 50,000 casualties. Historically, it was a fiasco for the Swedes, but partly this was due to bad luck - an epidemic ravaged their fleet - and partly due to internal politics. Surely, as the Swedish generalissimo, YOU can do better? If you choose to play the Russians instead, you will have many, many troops, and excellent commanders to lead them, but you will be faced by deadlines as the diplomats are already discussing peace terms. Will you be able to make a name for yourself before they pull the curtain down?<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>ALW is a two-player operational study of the War of the Hats, fought between the Swedes and the Russians in the years 1741-1743. Included in the game is a set of the latest basic rules, charts, and tables (version 3.75) for the Lace Wars system.<br/><br/>A few key concepts in this system include Operations Points, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. Operations Points are accumulated during periods of inactivity, in order to be spent during the course of active campaigning. If a player is unable or unwilling to spend OPs, his forces suffer attrition instead. The further forces are from their base of operations, the more severe the penalties will be. Whoever has the most OPs also has the initiative.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players alternate moving their formations, laying siege to fortresses and engaging in battle with the enemy field forces. The players have a degree of flexibility in what they do with their forces, but they are constrained by the Campaign Plan or plans that they choose. These dictate what objectives (usually fortresses) must be taken. A successfully completed plan will garner Prestige for a player. At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige wins. In addition, bonuses can be won for victory in battle, and these may be used to buy rewards that improve a player's chances, or be used as influence.<br/><br/>The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.<br/><br/><br/>Sommar Skr&aring;la - The Baltic, 1741-1743<br/><br/>Sommar Skr&aring;la is the second of a set of games covering the Age of Sail at an Operational level. While the War of the Austrian Succession raged elsewhere in Europe, and around the globe, in the Baltic Sweden and Russia faced off in the little known War of the Hats. At one level, the war had been engineered by France to keep Russia from helping Austria, but at another level, it was a war to reclaim Sweden's lost empire. The war was poorly managed by Sweden, and for a number of reasons they suffered a catastrophe of the first water &ndash; especially, the war was begun to help a Russian princess overthrow the current dynasty (in return for territorial concessions that were not forthcoming); a war with such an object was sure to be a confused affair.<br/><br/>Sommar Skr&aring;la also examines the possibility of Danish intervention. In reality, the Danish Prince Royal was an heir-presumptive candidate for the Swedish crown (the Swedes having an elective monarchy), and the Danish King assembled men and ships to help Sweden defend this choice against Russia. But Sweden, in the end chose a candidate favored by Russia (as the price of peace) and the Danes very nearly went to war against Sweden instead.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Sommar Skr&aring;la is a two player strategy game. You command either the Swedish or Muscovite (Russian) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points), and may even have an impact on the land campaign. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organizing your &quot;sail&quot; (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at &quot;battle readiness&quot; is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters in play is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players. A special campaign scenario allows the players to link Sommar Skr&aring;la with its companion Lace Wars game &ndash; A Lesser Wrath.<br/><br/>",

The FW-190 D (nicknamed the Dora) was intended to improve on the high-altitude performance of the A-series enough to make it useful against the American heavy bombers. However, the circumstances of the war in late 1944 meant that fighter-versus-fighter combat and ground attack missions took priority. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft included Franz G&ouml;tz and Waldemar W&uuml;bke. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. Larger maneuver cards (63 x 88 mm) are included with this model, to handle the fast movement of this airplane.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Not all of the stereotypes about Vikings were true. They were more settlers than they were raiders, for instance. They bathed more than most of their European peers, and were quite fond of jewelry and fancy duds. One thing continues to hold true though. They loved to party, and would often hold feasts in mead halls (community longhouses) that lasted many days. The primary drink at these feasts was mead (honey wine or beer), and competitions were held to see who could hold their drink the longest while remaining standing and spouting poetry eloquently (yes, Vikings were some of the earliest poets).<br/><br/>In Don&rsquo;t Fall in the Mead Hall, players emulate a host of Vikings drinking the night away in a mead hall. Although drinking while playing is encouraged, this is more of a party game with a fair share of strategy than it is a straight-up drinking game. Each player controls a table that starts with four Vikings (multi-colored pawns). A six-sided die is placed on the table with the number &ldquo;1&rdquo; facing up. This is the drunk die or &ldquo;Odin&rsquo;s Breathalyzer.&rdquo; <br/> After each player rolls a 20-sided die to determine initiative for the round, they then take turns rolling the action die. The results of the action die vary from taking a drink, to sending a drink to another table, to calling out a &ldquo;skal&rdquo; (toast) to cause all of the tables to drink, to throwing a chair at another table, to challenging another Viking at the battle mat. Each drink the Vikings at your table take causes the drunk die to move up by one. Taking a drink while the die is on six will result in a passed out Viking. The player lays that Viking on its side by the table (that Viking is out of the game), then sets the drunk die back to one. <br/> Vikings are also out of the game if they lose at the battle mat. Battle is performed by rolling the attack dice. Either one player wins, both players get knocked down, or nothing happens (two blanks are rolled) because the Vikings are too drunk to fight. Additionally, Vikings will move from table to table for various reasons depending on the die roll. Players do not have ultimate control over any of the Vikings but rather control a table. Once all of their Vikings have passed out, been knocked out, or have moved onto another table, they are out of the game. They still have a chance to get back in the game if gameplay results in a Viking being sent back to their empty table. The player controlling the table with the last Viking standing in the mead hall is the winner.<br/><br/>Contains small parts for easy traveling (but not for swallowing!). Bring it with you wherever you go and play it anywhere.<br/><br/>",

All these factors give high replayability.<br/><br/>A turn has 3 phases.<br/>Revenue phase: Collect revenue from your starting settlement and expansions.<br/>Build phase: Construct buildings or tile improvements, recruit armies or a hero<br/>Action phase: Move all available units you wish to this turn<br/><br/>Win the game through conquest (conquering the opponent's starting settlement), domination (construct all 4 Fortresses), by constructing a new Stone Portal (by controlling stone mines on the map), trough magic (by reaching level 6 with your hero) or through might (reaching the highest rank with your 3 military units).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Parcel o' Rogues (POR) has been designated the fifteenth volume in Red Sash Games' Lace Wars series. Technically speaking, the game should not be part of the series. It is a completely different animal, and no knowledge of the Lace Wars series is required. However, the package also contains a Charlie's Year module, The Jacobite Card (TJC), which is part of the series and completes the Jacobite 'saga'.<br/><br/>POR is a game for 2-4 players that covers the political struggle to pass the Act of Union of 1707 which brought England and Scotland under a single government. For a hundred years the two countries had been ruled by the same monarch, but with separate governments and laws. The Union was in keeping with the centralizing trend that could be found all over Western Europe. As might be expected, it was not universally acclaimed, especially in Scotland. Coincidentally, a Jacobite rising was being planned in coordination with the French, who were (of course) at war with England and hoped to create a diversion that would draw enemy troops away from their frontier. This plot played into the widespread discontent with the Union, so that when a French expeditionary corps was dispatched to escort the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, to Scotland in March of 1708, the conspirators could count on a massive uprising in support of his claim to the Throne. Unfortunately for them, the plan quickly unravelled due to a variety of causes and the famous Rising of 1708 that restored Scotland's independence never happened.<br/><br/>In POR the object is to gain influence over the key political figures and institutions who can sway the vote for Union, or, if necessary, provide resources for a rebellion. Influence is claimed by the placing of cubes on a board, at locations representing the various personalities and institutions involved. The players are limited in what they can do on their turn by card play, which stipulates how many cubes are available and what sort of locations will accept them. Cards may instead allow players to remove some of their opponents' cubes. Periodically, event cards must be played that affect everyone; these cards also act as a timer. There are two scoring rounds. In the first, the players compare their influence for the Act of Union. If there is no Union, the game will be over, but usually, the Union does occur and the game continues to the second scoring. This one determines who has won the subsqeuent Rebellion and uses different criteria (but the same game mechanic).<br/><br/>If desired, the results of the game can also be used to generate a scenario for the attached Lace Wars module, The Jacobite Card. The final state of the POR board will dictate the resources each player receives for that scenario.<br/><br/>Playing time averages 3 hours, regardless of the number of players.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>1) Play board showing the personalities and institutions involved in the events covered by the game.<br/><br/>2) 120 die cut counters. Half are used as tokens and markers in POR. The other half are used in TJC.<br/><br/>3) 121 playing cards. 90 are Action cards, used to make plays during the game. 20 are Season cards which provide special events and act as a timer. The remaining 11 cards are Aide Memoires.<br/><br/>4) 400 8mm wooden cubes in 4 colours: red, blue, yellow, and black.<br/><br/>3) Rules for both POR and TJC.<br/><br/>4) An historical commentary.<br/><br/>",

Players will take this into consideration when building their armies.<br/><br/>As always, our highest priority is historical accuracy and a large range of settings and options to choose from. <br/>The scope of this game is not limited to the western front! <br/>These rules allow for battlefields set in the Alps of northern Italy, the open spaces of the eastern front, the Gallipoli peninsula, and much more.<br/><br/>The choice is up to you and your imagination.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Roberts Award nominations and awards &mdash; Alexandros and I Am Spartacus. This expanded edition features both games along with their multiple expansions, three in total, to round out this impressive, DELUXE package with two full-size game maps and updated graphics throughout.<br/><br/>Alexandros: Conquest &amp; Empire<br/>This Mike Markowitz design originally appeared in issue 10 of Command magazine in 1991 to immediate acclaim. It earned a final nominee spot for the Charles S. Roberts Award for &ldquo;Best Graphics,&rdquo; and won the award for &ldquo;Best Pre-World War II Game.&rdquo;<br/><br/>It covers all of Alexander&rsquo;s campaigns from 334 to 323 BC. One player commands the Macedonians and the other the Persians. It&rsquo;s easily adaptable for solitaire play. The area map is based on the province boundaries of those times, and game turns are quarterly. Combat can be fought tactically, using a separate battlefield display with units assigned to various sectors of the engagement. There are also special rules for besieging cities.<br/><br/>Play lasts a variable numbers of turns, depending on the course of the larger war. There are several ways to win, including the killing of enemy leaders and conquering a large mass of territory, which can end the game at any time. Otherwise, play continues to the summer of 323, when Alexander actually died historically. An optional rule allows play to go to 318.<br/><br/>BONUS MATERIAL: Also included, are two expansions that were published in later editions of Command Magazine.  <br/>These are Successors: Clash of Generals, 323-301 BC and Xenophon: March of the Ten-Thousand, 401-400 BC.<br/><br/>I Am Spartacus: The Slave Rebellion Against Rome, 73-71 BC<br/>This second featured game design by Mike Markowitz originally appeared in issue 15 of Command magazine in 1992. The game earned a finalist spot for the Charles S. Roberts Award for &ldquo;Best Pre-World War II Game.&rdquo;<br/><br/>This is a two-player (solitaire adaptable) simulation of the Third Servile War, the slave revolt that shook the Roman Republic from 73-71 BC. Barring the capture of Rome by the Rebel player, or the capture of Spartacus by the Roman player, both of which are sudden death victories, the game is won on points for territorial control and other issues. At the end of 17 turns, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>BONUS MATERIAL: Also included is yet another expansion from a later issue of Command Magazine entitled Pyrrhic Victory: Legion vs Phalanx, 280-275 BC, and several historical and informational articles on the period.<br/><br/>Complexity:  Low to Medium <br/>Solitaire Suitability:  Medium<br/>Time Scale: Alexandros is Seasonal &ndash; I Am Spartacus - Monthly<br/>Map Scale: Both are area strategic<br/>Unit Scale: Legions<br/>Players: Two<br/><br/>description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

But how could they convince people to use their services? And which of the two siblings should lead the company?<br/>They found an answer to both questions: The most successful one will be the &quot;Boss&quot;!<br/><br/>In Camel Express!, two players compete against each other to prove who is the better businessperson and should be the boss. After the third new moon appeared, the player who manages to send the biggest Caravan on its journey is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>You can play this game in 3 different difficulties: Basic, Normal, and Advanced. We recommend starting with the Basic version and after just a few games and getting to know the rules, Play the Normal game. Do the same with the Normal game until you feel you are ready for some more challenges in the Advanced difficulty.<br/><br/>Players are dealt 6 cards to each player, then draw and place cards to build their caravan. During the action of drawing cards, if any player draws the New Moon card, the first round immediately ends. The game plays in 3 rounds. After the first round is over, start the second and then the third round exactly the same as the first round. After the third round is finished, the player with the highest total point is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

One player commands the French army under Napoleon's brother, Joseph, the self-proclaimed King of Spain, and the other commands the combined allied armies of Great Britain (under Sir Arthur Wellesley) and Spain (under Captain-General Gregorio de la Cuesta). After his attempt to liberate Madrid from the French was repulsed, Cuesta's army fell back to Talavera, which was covered by the British. Starting with a daring night attack, Joseph repeatedly attempted to push the allies out of their superb defensive positions, to no avail. As the French, can you find and exploit a weak spot in the allied lines? As the allies, can you hold your shaky alliance together and fend off the French (all the while keeping a nervous eye out for a second French army that might unexpectedly show up behind your armies)?<br/><br/>Bussaco 20: Second Edition, from designer Lance McMillan, features the battle occurring on 26 September 1810, during the early stages of the French invasion of Portugal. One player commands the French army of Marshal Andr&eacute; Mass&eacute;na, while the other controls Sir Arthur Wellesley, Viscount of Wellington's combined British and reconstituted Portuguese army. Historically, a distracted Mass&eacute;na launched a series of uncoordinated frontal assaults straight up a steep ridge into the teeth of the British defenses, suffering heavy losses before Wellington elected to disengage and fall back to Lisbon. Can you as Mass&eacute;na avoid the same mistakes, or as Wellington can you use your superior position to achieve a decisive victory?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Liber Militum Tercios is a new historical wargame that will allow us to recreate the great battles of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. The game was developed by El Kraken Released, team, and is edited by Design &amp; Edits WxW Co.<br/><br/>There are 2 different versions of Tercios:<br/>Liber Militum: The full version<br/>Brevis Editio: Short Version, synthesized and free.<br/><br/>Portada-Brevis-EditioTercios is not intended for any specific miniatures scale. All rule design effort was put on allowing the player to adapt the game to any different model basing and scales.. However, we do recommend certain model sizes for units on the rules, but others could be used without compromising playability. Geometry dependence has been avoided as much as possible.<br/><br/>The number of miniatures that is necessary to represent a unit is subject to the sole discretion of the Army Collector, it is up to everyone to decide how many models will be enough to identify our troops. Even so, we suggest certain number in the rules, but just for guidance.<br/><br/>Tercios is a large scale wargame, since each unit in the game represents huge formations that often comprised more than a thousand men. This is why it is a game with more abstraction than others, because at this scale of war reenactment, individual soldier actions has no consecuences, it matters as a whole..<br/><br/>The gameplay is based upon orders execution, that are deployed at a planning phase. Command cards are used (there are 5 different cards), that are placed face down next to our units, and prepare our troops for different tasks: to run, to shoot, charge the enemy or resist stoically.<br/><br/>Units activation is alternated between players. The very command cards allow us to keep track of which units have been activated. The fact that the turns are not complete for a single player, but alternated between the two players, make the game a fluid dynamic experience. Once all the command cards have been executed, the turn will be finished and we will be ready to start a new one.<br/><br/>Cards also allow us to react, under certain circumstances, to enemy activity, what makes commands a complex tactical resource.. Deepening in the mastering of good decisions during the planning phase and managing the unexpected is a challenge for the player; reflective strategic fund is stimulated, what makes the experience very intuitive and agile..<br/><br/>Not knowing what cards your opponent has set and choosing the order of activation for your units, makes a very realistic simulation of the uncertainties of a real battle and delivers an increasing thrill, as the turns pass by..<br/><br/>As usual in wargames, actions are resolved by rolling dices. Tercios proposes a very simple system using six-sided dice; no need to do complex calculations, or having to learn a host of special rules. For a player with minimum experience (or without) it will be a matter of minutes to become familiar with the system.<br/><br/>",

Playing time is normally 2 hours.<br/><br/>Each player represents the Captain of a small in-system spacecraft that has been selected by the authorities to help get the system economy and travel back to normal. As a Captain, you&rsquo;ll need to recruit a crew and good crews don&rsquo;t come cheap. Crews of Eridanus is an open world and there are a number of ways to earn credits: carrying passengers, trading cargoes, mining, exploring wrecks and hunting pirates. All players start with the same size of crew, ship and resources, but they are free to pursue whatever strategy they think best. Each player builds a unique tableau consisting of different crew members and ship modifications.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of rounds, with each player taking their respective turn. A player can usually take 3 actions per turn.<br/><br/>The game starts in a pirate phase, where pirate ships occupy a number of locations on the map.  If most of the pirates are destroyed, then the game shifts to a normal phase. Finally, the game enters an end phase after a pre-determined number of rounds have been played and a boss appears.<br/><br/>There are multiple ways to defeat the boss, but if it is not dealt with quickly then all of the players will lose. If the players are successful in stopping the boss, whoever has the most Victory Points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It becomes a race to Asgard before your fellow Vikings to convince Odin that you should be allowed entry into the glorious golden hall of Valhalla!<br/><br/>On your turn, you can use the power of the gods to guide you through the four realms quicker than your opponents by playing one of the two cards in your hand face down. Still, the other players must choose whether to believe that you played the card you said or accuse you of mischief and reveal the card for everyone to see. If your accusation is successful, you gain a mischief token; if you lie successfully without being accused, you gain a mischief token. Mischief tokens are used to make Loki and his children stronger, giving you an even better chance of arriving at Asgard first.<br/><br/>Will you be mischievous, or will you keep everyone on the worthy path and reap the benefits of their ill-deeds?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fistful of Lead: Reloaded was designed as a quick set of wargame rules for gunfghts in the Wild West. The rules can be learned within a couple of turns and still keep the favor of the period. The play is fast and furious, with a Hollywood fair to it.<br/><br/>Fistful of Lead has been around for over a decade with a small, but loyal fan base. This version has left the core rules intact while adding more scenarios, more examples of play, some house rules that have brewed up over the years, and a simple campaign system.<br/><br/>In most games, each player can control up to 6 gunfighters without much trouble. Games can have up to 8 players without slowing down the game. Experienced wargamers and new players alike will enjoy this game. It's perfect for convention games and just one on one shoot outs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This is not going to be a Dunkirk or Bataan. A retreat to Pusan would result in one of the greatest butcheries in history. We must fight to the end. We must fight as a team. If some of us die, we will die fighting together.&rdquo; &ndash; US General Walton &ldquo;Bulldog&rdquo; Walker, July 31, 1950.<br/><br/>South Korean forces withdrew to a small perimeter centered on the South Korean port of Pusan. By August the North Korean forces, although bloodied by repeated US airstrikes and weakened by stragglers from their swift advance, were massed for what many thought would be a final offensive to take the rest of South Korea. The main focus of the North Korean attack was along the Naktong River where a small bridge head had been secured earlier. Victory here could insure that there would be only one Korea, ruled by Communist leader Kim Il Sung. A UN victory could buy time and set the stage for a counter-offensive that might send the Communists back and free South Korea. Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>Each copy of &quot;Victory in Hell&quot; is composed of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     One 11 by 17 inch map.<br/>     One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet with game tracks and terrain identification.<br/>     80 un-mounted double-sided units.<br/>     6 pages of rules.<br/><br/><br/>Infantry units are regiments, all armor units are companies. A hex is approximately a third of a mile across. Each turn represents one day of time.<br/><br/>Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and determine some game events. A six-sided die is used to resolve game combats and other actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is the second chapter of a trilogy initiated by The Order of Veiel. This chapter gets deeper into the mechanisms of Chapter 1, with a new combat system, new monsters, new heroes and new equipments. Chapter 2 kicks off the story, quests, scenarios and most of all: choices.<br/><br/>The Order of Veiel is a cooperative game taking place in a dark and complex fantasy universe. Intended for 1 to 7 players, the game offers a team of adventurers the chance to face the merciless dungeon master and his corrupt hordes of monsters. You must do your best to overcome the torments of the crypt. Mutual aid, reflection and decision-making will be key for your journey.<br/><br/>You can either play against the game or against another player. If you face a player, he'll become the dungeon master by creating the dungeon, controlling the monsters and launching events at the other players. If you face the game, all the above are automated.<br/><br/>All the other player will take control of one of the 13 characters. You'll be fighting monsters, avoiding traps and curses, opening chest and doors, spending money to the smith or the alchemist. Everything you gather in this adventure is for the entire team. You'll think together to optimize your progression to have a chance to defeat one of the 4 bosses.<br/><br/>Combats are turn-based. Heroes take action first. They can either use their weapons, use their skills or use a consummable object. Once they all did an action, it's the monsters' turn. Monsters tends to attack the hero holding the defender token. Some of them can choose their target.<br/><br/>The dungeon is a layout of 6 to 15 cards (at the end of the games). Heroes enter the crypt by turning a card face up (Monsters, chests ...). They resolve the card before deciding to go back to the camp or going deeper in the crypt and therefore turning the next card face up. Once they are at the far end of the dungeon, they can decide to face the boss or the go back to the camp. At the beginning of the game, being a coward is the only option. At some point, you'll have to face your ultimate nemesis. Beat him and you'll win but fail to do so and you'll lose the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What's New in Mr. President, 2nd Edition. First off, several have asked me &quot;Why a 2nd EDITION? Why not just reprint the original game in a 2nd Printing to get it back in stock as quickly as possible?&quot; Well, we considered that, but after looking at the FAQ document, and with tens of thousands of games being played over the past few months and so many players posting their experiences online (thank you, I love to read your Presidential stories!), we have seen some places we can tighten up to help players understand the game better. There are some &quot;balance&quot; issues that I want to address on the design side as well. We are also using this opportunity to address the first edition errata. So, yes, we could have just reprinted. But because we want to make the game the best it can be, we've decided to take the approach of &quot;fix the bugs and also give the players game enhancements,&quot; which means we're going to do a full-blown 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>This approach means that we are going to have updates to most of the game's manuals, half a dozen cards, and a few counters. Those will all be folded into the 2nd Edition. For you 1st Edition owners, we are also offering what is going to be one behemoth of an Update Kit. The new 2nd Edition will include changes/upgrades to the following items:<br/><br/>6 cards<br/>16 counters (duplicates of those in the 2023 Replacement Countersheet&mdash;note that four of these are very minor errata; the other 12 are helpful reminder counters)<br/>4 double-sided Action Cards (Domestic, Diplomatic, Military, Presidential)<br/><br/>Booklets:<br/>Scenario Booklet ~36 pages<br/>World Peer China ~12 pages<br/>World Peer Russia ~12 pages<br/>Ally/Rogue State ~12 pages<br/>World Charts ~32 pages<br/>Governing Manual ~52 pages<br/>Domestic Charts ~20 pages<br/>Flipbook ~28 pages<br/>Briefing Booklet ~20-24 pages.<br/><br/>That's most of the Booklets and PACs in the game! As I noted above, some of this is to accommodate errata and clearer wording from the FAQ, but it will also include numerous game enhancements to make the game more challenging (especially in years 3 and following) and to add features, importance, and more difficult choices to areas like:<br/><br/>Ally Relationships/Actions<br/>Strategic Capabilities<br/>Combat (Counterattacks, Carrier Support and Combat DRMs based on Strategic Capabilities, Heavy units less useful in Guerrilla War)<br/>Iran at War (including a new Action Table)<br/>Cascading Events (January Surprise)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mr. President is a solitaire game about governing as the President of the United States in the early 21st century. It's not an election game. It begins after you've been elected. It's about sitting in The Chair and trying to advance your agenda while navigating ongoing crises, political enemies, public opinion, your relations with Congress and the press, and keeping your country secure in a world of rival nations and agendas that just seems to keep blowing up around you. Mr. President is a resource management game where you never have enough resources to achieve your entire agenda and the path you take through an always unpredictable storyline rests on the choices you make. Depending on the results of those choices, and on the unfolding of a &quot;different every game&quot; story, you'll either be thinking &quot;POTUS? Piece of Cake!&quot; or &quot;Why was it that I WANTED this job?&quot; many times in each game.",

Together, solos and teams form a crew. Players deploy their crews (usually according to scenario rules) and roll a die to determine who will be the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; at the start of the game. The highest number rolled (re-rolling any ties) is the &ldquo;first player&rdquo;. Each round the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; shifts, switching back and forth in a two player game and clockwise in a game of three or more players.<br/><br/>&quot;The game is played over one or more rounds where each player will have the opportunity to activate and perform actions with each member of their crew. Crew members are activated in order of initiative (highest to lowest). In the case of a tie the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; that round activates one crew member and when done the next player activates a crew member with that same initiative and so on until all crew members for all players with that initiative have been activated. Once all crew members have had a chance to perform actions the round is complete and a new one begins. Crew members may choose to hold their actions until a later point during the round. Activation of crew members that held their actions may be done between any later activations that round. In the case of more than one player wishing to activate a crew member that held their action the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; gets first choice and so on.<br/><br/>&quot;Once activated a crew member may not choose to perform one action and save the other. Any unused actions are lost.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ozerekya Breakout is an  Scenario / Campaign Game pack which offers players the unique challenge of fighting a medium-unit action in the Ozerekya River valley, south of the Black Sea town of Glebovka, Russia, 4-7 February 1943. it contains:<br/><br/>- One colour 24 x 33 inch historical Map of the river valley south of Glebovka,<br/><br/>- Four Scenarios played on various parts of the map,<br/><br/>- An Eight-Scenario Date, Campaign Game; and<br/><br/>- Chapter OzB that includes rules to play the Campaign Game.<br/><br/>The four included scenarios focus on the following situations:<br/><br/>- Glebovka, Russia, 4 February 1943: In the early morning hours, Soviet seaborne forces landed on the peninsula along the west side of the Ozerekya Bay. These forces were led by tank spearheads and quickly advanced towards Glebovka, where they came across a Romanian Mortar position set up in the vineyard of an old manor.... <br/> - Glebovka, Russia, 4 February 1943: In the early morning hours of 4 February, Soviet seaborne forces landed on the peninsula along the west side of the Ozerekya Bay. The Soviet forces were led by tank spearheads of the American built Stuart tanks of the 563rd Tank Brigade... <br/> - Glebovka, Russia, 5 February 1943: By the late afternoon, this force threatened to capture the Axis held town of Glebovka. In desperation, the Romanians, in an attempt to slow the Russians&rsquo; advance, threw whatever units they had on hand. The Engineers of the 58th Battalion located in nearby Krasno Medvedovskaya and the freshly arriving German panzerj&auml;gers of the Panzerj&auml;ger Abteilung 173 were quickly rushed into battle... <br/> - Glebovka, Russia, 6 February 1943: Despite having three barges, four launches, two steiners, one tug, and one patrol boat sunk; and sixteen patrol boats, two tugs and two launches damaged; the Soviets were able to get 1,427 men and 10 tanks ashore before dawn. On the other hand, the landing force had no radio communication with the fleet...<br/><br/>Ozerekya Breakout is not a complete game and ownership of a tactical wargaming system such as MMP&rsquo;s Advanced Squad Leader, Critical Hit&rsquo;s Advanced Tobruk System, or Firefly  WWII Battlegroup Actions is required.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legion is one of the few teams in the Global Slaughterball League that is completely owned by a regional government. In this case the Metroplex Roma subsidiary SPQR. Current SPQR CEO Tiberius Antonius Caesar-Caesar has dedicated vast sums of tax revenues to develop and market Legion into a juggernaut of popularity and success. Thanks to Caesar-Caesar&rsquo;s guidance over the past two decades, Legion&rsquo;s legions of fans have propelled the team to be one of the most financially successful in the league.<br/><br/>Legion is a thoroughly disciplined team of well-armored athletes, each with their own skills to contribute to the team. They excel at cooperating with each other to overcome opponents through teamwork. The cleavers are the foundation of this team unity. They are tactical geniuses who grant all teammates a bonus to their tests, plus they can hand out additional Onslaught tokens!<br/>It will require an experienced coach to fully understand and lead Legion to victory. You&rsquo;ll have to familiarize yourself with their impressive list of skills, and stay aware of every team member at all times to make sure you utilize them to their fullest potential. Legion is one of the most complicated teams to lead to victory, so be sure you are up to the task.<br/><br/>Even though all Legion athletes have strong skill sets, it is the cleavers&rsquo; tactical leadership that propel them to excellence. The value of more onslaught tokens cannot be overemphasized, and you should exploit that ability every turn. Also, do not forget the Leadership bonus that each of your athletes earns from the cleavers, and that you can add up the +1 bonus to tests from each of your cleavers in the pit.<br/>To retain the extra tactical choices that they provide, the cleavers should be protected at all times. Do not expose them to attack or you&rsquo;ll lose them to the Slaughter Box, along with their bonus dice and onslaught tokens.<br/><br/>Also, don&rsquo;t forget the other athletes on the team, who also have great skills and traits. The razor is well-armored, with just a slight reduction in Speed. The slashers can double-team opponents for vicious effect. Even the butcher is better than average with his Awesome Brute skill. And all Legion athletes can stand up adjacent teammates with Help Up. Once you learn how to synergize all these skills, you&rsquo;re well on your way to invincibility!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If rumours are to be believed, the origins of Blood Bowl lay in Lustria, home of the ancient and powerful Slann, and their Lizardmen servants, at the very dawn of time. Though the game has moved on and evolved in the Old World, the Lustrian League is working with the NAF to bring the old and new closer together. The Gwaka'moli Crater Gators have made the leap across the world-pond to match their skills against some of the biggest names in the sport, and their natural talent and unconventional playing style have proven to be a massive hit with fans.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a funky and fresh new twist to the game, Lizardmen teams are where it's at. They have access to the best of both worlds: with players that are strong and tough, plus fast and agile ones. Once you get the hang of using your Saurus Blockers (not to mention Kroxigors if you really want to make an impact) to protect the nimble Skinks long enough to perform some slick plays, you'll find yourself scoring again and again. Add their unconventional aesthetic to the mix, and you've got a team that looks great, plays well and scores big.<br/><br/>This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you need to assemble the Gwaka'moli Crater Gators, a Lizardmen team for use in games of Blood Bowl, containing 6 Saurus Blockers, 4 Skink Runners, and 2 Chameleon Skinks, plus a roster sheet. Also includes a transfer sheet, 2 Slann-statue turn markers, egg-themed balls, and 12x 32mm Citadel round bases which feature holes to place the ball.<br/><br/>The rules to use Lizardmen teams in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in Spike!

Between the Sandtrooper rider's array of weapons and the powerful claws of their mount, this duo is a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Within Star Wars: Legion &ndash; Dewback Rider Unit Expansion, you'll find an unpainted, beautifully-detailed Dewback miniature featuring a Sandtrooper rider with four distinct customization options: Your Dewback Rider can be built carrying their standard shock prod, or you can equip them with three different weapons. On top of the ability to customize the look of your Dewback Rider, this Unit Expansion gives you plenty of ways to tweak how this unit operates in the thick of battle. Six upgrade cards accompany the miniature, letting you modify its armament, training, or the comms systems it carries into battle. Rounding out this expansion are a unit card and all the tokens you need to deploy it as a support unit for your Imperial armies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The heart of the game is the hexagonal game tile, consisting of shapes, numbers, dots and a player Emblem Sign.<br/><br/>You can play Aromat by placing the Game Tiles next to each other. Each special calculation created by the two adjacent sides of the Tiles following the gameplay rules either adds or subtracts a certain amount of points to your Game Score. The mobile app does the score calculation and score keeping for you.<br/><br/>Aromat can be played using Play Field Elements by constructing these elements before the game starts. It can also be played without, which requires more thinking because of the many possibilities present in any given moment during gameplay. Therefore it is recommended to use the Play Field Elements until a player becomes strategically aware of the many possibilities the game has to offer.<br/><br/>Research in neuroscience, human behavior and interaction and music didactics has been conducted in order to construct the methods and mechanisms behind Aromat. It contains beneficial aspects in terms of brain training and musicality training, which are achieved in a fun and engaging way.<br/><br/>Aromat is a collectible game that starts out with the &quot;Basic Set&quot; and expands through a system of &quot;Extension Sets&quot;'<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the tube...<br/>&quot;.. a game which truly simulates real harness racing.  You control your horse's speed, decide when to make your move and make all of the other decisions.  Your driving skill - not just luck - determines the outcome.&quot;     The object is to drive your horse the farthest twice around the track.<br/><br/>Yes the game is packaged in a tube. The &quot;board&quot; is a piece of fabric backed printed vinyl, similar to a place mat.  Players are assigned or pick a horse from a choice of 200 in the Stable book.  Each horse has a movement number that is broken down into quarters (4 numbers), one for each quarter mile (track is a half mile).  These quarter mile numbers are then reduced to 6 numbers, from 1 to 9.  These 6 numbers are printed on cards.  On his turn the player uses one card to move his horse.  The move is modified by: spaces that count as two, variable length lanes in the curves, swaping cards with the draw pile without changing the movement #, holding back a card till the next quarter mile, blocking another from holding back a card, chance cards at the start and on the home stretch, chance dice roll is required to pass thru a space directly in front of another horse.  It is recommended to have a race secretary.  This person should be a fair minded person who will set up and referee the race.<br/><br/>The players try to use all of their movement while causing others to waste movement.  This player has observed that it is easy for all of the players to use all of their movement with only 6 horses in the race.  All of the movement robbing mechanisms are easily avoided with 6 horses.  The race is then determined by the movement number combined with the Start and Stretch chance cards.  The use of 12 horses makes a much more interesting game.  With 12 horses the movement robbing mechanisms can not be totally avoided.<br/><br/>John Campbell is a Hall of Fame driver (not rider) that holds many of the sport's records.  John Campbell did not design the game but has endorsed it.  The 1989 instructions invite players to a yearly tournament where the championship is decided by playing against John Campbell.<br/><br/>The instructions promote another game, &quot;Classic Thoroughbred Racing&quot; which is not currently in the BGG database.<br/><br/>",

Each animal starts on a separate side of the board and is moved across the farmyard (in the form of a grid) by rolling the dice.  When a six is rolled, Old Macdonald and his buckets can be placed in the way of the other players' animals.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ascendance is a sci-fi game set in a grim future, where mankind has discovered a new resource: the Divine Power. Using this newfound power, they gained the ability to control and reshape everything around them. On earth lies the only way to reach Thuria, the place where this power lies. Several alien, or former human, races have come to earth to reach this place and claim the Divine Power for themselves.<br/><br/>The Ascendance - Call of Thuria board game is designed for 2-4 players of ages 12 and above. It is played with decks of cards which the players customize for themselves through the extra cards available on the game box, or future expansions. Players deploy Units, Structures and play cards from their hands, reserving Divine Abilities for when things get tough. The Game Board is used to play Events which harass or assist the players and also to help players choose Advantages, special situations that may turn the tide of battle.<br/><br/>The game is won via one of two ways. You can either destroy your opponent's Fortress by reducing its Hit Points to 0, or gather enough Divine Power to use your Ultimatum and completely annihilate your opponent.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Once players have chosen the cards to use in their Decks, they must choose 5 Divine Abilities for the current match and then the game can begin. The game is separated into Phases, with each player completing their own Phase separately, unless another player intervenes. Players use Production Credits (usually called just Credits) to deploy Armies, play Commands from their hand and any other costs necessary. These Credits can be acquired by the Fortress, or other Structures. Players may also purchase Enhancements on their Structures or Units to make them better or change their use. Divine Power Points are also acquired every turn and the players use them to perform their Divine Abilities, powerful cards that may, if played at the right moment, judge the outcome of a battle.<br/><br/>Each turn, the chaotic landscape of Thuria or the monstrous Zordath pose a threat to the players. Events are drawn every turn and usually harass the players by forcing them to attack the Zordath or face a natural hazard. However, sometimes one can take advantage of these Events and gain the upper hand. Once in a while, an Artifact or a Power Source may surface on the world of Thuria. Claiming these may also grant a bonus.<br/><br/>Finally, each player at every turn chooses an Advantage on the Game Board. Choosing one locks it from the other players, so sometimes it may be preferrable that your opponent does not have a certain Advantage than you having one.<br/><br/>Phases are summarized below:<br/>Event Phase - An Event is drawn and resolves.<br/>Advantage Phase - Players choose their Advantage on the Game Board.<br/>Draw Phase - Players draw Cards, gain Divine Power and pay any costs.<br/>Support Phase - Armies are deployed and any purchases are made.<br/>Assault Phase - Units are sent to deal damage to the opponent's Fortress.<br/><br/>",

The Empire of York has fallen apart after centuries of misrule. Now, many factions have formed, each with a different idea for how the next Empire should be run.  The game plays with 2-4 players in an hour or less.<br/><br/>In this low-luck game, players carefully manage their hands of cards for one of two purposes: adding reinforcements or activating powerful tactics which may aid them in battle. There are no dice in Battle for York, so victory in battle is the result of player decision, planning, and sometimes, a careful bluff.<br/><br/>The game features 4 unique factions, each with unique tactics and abilities to gain the upper hand in the conflict. Every faction plays differently, which provides a deep and varied strategy game in a short amount of time. For first time players, a generic shared faction is provided to help you learn the game and the mechanics before diving into the complexities of factions.<br/><br/>Players take one action at a time, so there is little down time in this fast-paced game. Battle for York is a great light to medium game for game night.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Captains Bold is a game in which the players take the part of a frigate Captain involved in ship-to-ship combat during the height of the Age of Fighting Sail. In the process of playing the game, the players consider the types of tactical decisions made by their historical counterparts and explore the ways in which those decisions may have affected the outcome of single ship combats of that time.<br/><br/>The movement and combat systems in the game have been deliberately kept simple and somewhat stylized, in order not to distract the player from the commander's decision-making process with details and decisions that would typically have fallen within the purview of his<br/>subordinates. Likewise, the specifications of the vessels themselves have been abstracted to avoid making the game too much about the hardware.<br/><br/>The game takes place on a playing area consisting of hexagonal tiles which have a triangular grid superimposed upon them, with lighter colored dots at the vertices. The ships are represented on the playing area by counters, flats or miniatures, and move from dot to dot (referred to in the rules as &quot;points&quot;) along the gray lines of the grid.<br/><br/>Most of the components of the game are included in the files which comprise the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DRK-Das Reich is the capstone game for the DRK-IISS game set.  That is the final game in the 3 game set.  This game builds on the first 2 in the set, DRK-Totenkopf and DRK-Leibstandarte.  This game focuses on the Das Reich sector of the southern part of the salient.  After a good start and rapid movement this sector of the front became quiet.  Das Reich, from 8 July, did little in the way of attacking.  DRK-Totenkopf, at a minimum (and DRK-Leibstandarte is recommended), is required to play this game.  The game system features the representation of units at Platoon and Battery level for the Germans and Company and Battery level for the Red Army.  The Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements are built into this game, just as they are for DRK-Totenkopf and DRK-Leibstandarte.  The Command and Control Enhancement provides Company sized replacement units for the Germans and the representation of communications between HQ (the concept of Radio Line of Sight is used) and the HQ ability to respond on its own initiative when commo is bad.  The Fire Support Enhancement provides for artillery unit missions of Direct Support, General Support, and Reinforcing fires.  This helps to restrict the fire of artillery in the game to something more like what happens in real life.  Artillery cannot be gathered from around the map to support attacks or defense engagements.  It must be planned.<br/>Both of the previous 2 games start the battle from 9 July.  This game does that and also provides a battle start, along the entire IISS front, from 4 July.  The same game design features, from DRK-Totenkopf and DRK-Leibstandarte, are included in this game.<br/>There are 22 scenarios included.  These include the Das Reich scenarios for 9-13 July plus a couple of smaller regimental scenarios, and daily scenarios for each day from 4-8 July for all 3 divisions.  A real action packed monster.<br/><br/>",

Returned to the world, it sets its sights on its true enemy: Sun Wukong, the immortal Monkey King.<br/><br/>As the Yaoguai makes its way down the mountain, Xuanzang spurs his disciple to action:  he must set a trap for the fiend and seal it back within its prison, for if the beast can manage to defeat and consume the Monkey King, then it will steal immortality for itself.  The Monkey King gathers the fiercest heroes and monks and awaits the demon at the foot of the mountain.  He installs seers of great power to seek for the beast, and surrounds the camp with guardians to protect both him and his master.  As Xuanzang prays to the goddess Guanyin for guidance and blesses powerful talismans with the mantra to bind the creature back to its mountain, the Monkey King&rsquo;s generals sit and wait in anticipation of the coming conflict.<br/><br/>But, the Yaoguai brings a corruption that runs deep.  It whispers dark, honey-sweet words of glory and promised enlightenment to those in the Monkey King&rsquo;s camp, threatening to turn many who reside there into traitors.  In its wake follows the shapeshifting Mo Shadow, seeking the flesh of Xuanzang to achieve its own sinister purpose.  Fox spirits emerge to dart about, bringing their assistance to those they choose.  And deep beneath the waters of a nearby lake, unbeknownst to all, a fish begins to quiver and sprout wings, and should this Peng burst forth, it will force an end to any fighting with its brilliance.<br/><br/>You are the Monkey King&rsquo;s generals.  Will you find and seal away the Yaoguai, or turn the power of the Talisman on the Monkey King himself?  Will you weed out the traitors in the camp, or will you be the traitor, sending your men to capture their allies and make way for the demon?  The deeds of this day will be forever recorded and you shall live within them, with either honor or infamy.  The choices are yours.<br/><br/>In Yaoguai, take the role of one of the Monkey King's generals.  Players draw and play cards from hand, simulating the conflict between the various entities in the game.  The goal is to capture the correct combination of cards, or the highest overall point value, while attempting to maintain some degree of secrecy.<br/><br/>Yaoguai is a game for 2-4 people that is playable in 5-10 minutes, and is highly influenced by Chinese literature and mythology.<br/><br/>This game was a finalist in the Geekway to the West and BGG Micro game contest!  Thank you to all who voted for it.  It was a wonderful experience and I learned a lot.  -Eric<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Invasion: Malta uses many familiar game mechanics found in similar scale wargames. Featured here are chit draws for activation of formations and individual unit efficiency ratings. The Axis player uses amphibious landings and airdrops to bring his units into the battle while the Allied player defends with artillery bombardment from behind heavy fortifications. Special rules include heavy tanks and dummy airdrops, and more, as found in a group of random events that players draw in order to obtain special capabilities, such as Deception Measures, Gas, Anti-tank guns, Transport, Smoke Screen, and much more. As you might expect, the game includes the highest quality OoB for both sides for each scenarios; we really dug into various national archives for this game. All scenarios stop after only a few days of campaigning as it is during this time that the battle would be decided.<br/><br/>Our hobby has perhaps a unique ability to explore the great questions of events in history. Here, what if during WWII the Axis actually invaded Malta. Who would win? The answer turns on many additional questions and circumstances. This two-player game explores several of these in three scenarios plus the bonus game covering the historical invasion of Leros.<br/><br/>Fall 1940: The Italians had big talk and many objectives during the war but not enough realistic plans. Perhaps the best time for their invasion would be in the fall, and perhaps timed along with the German invasion of Britain; or, if the Germans do not invade, then perhaps in place of the actual Italian invasion of Greece. Operational plans for Malta were poor but British defenses are weak. Perhaps the Italians could catch the British not reacting in time.<br/><br/>Spring 1941: In April 1941 the Axis had a choice, either occupy Crete or attack Malta. On April 21st Gen. Student, chief of the paratroopers, overcame opposition from the Wehrmacht Operations Staff, and others, in Berlin and persuaded Hitler to attack Crete. But, what if Hitler accepted the alternative recommendation to attack Malta? The Germans and Italians would now have to prepare for a combined operation, air, land, and sea, and do this quickly. The forces arrayed against Malta would have been huge, but the British were far better prepared than a year before and well fortified. The bloody issue would have been in doubt from the start.<br/><br/>Summer 1942: After a over year of preparation and study and agreement on the need to invade, the combined German and Italian staffs had put together an extensive and complex plan for invasion. Its success depended on many factors and lessons had been learned from the battle for Crete the year before had been put into effect. All was as ready as it could be, yet they did not invade. The British were stronger in numbers and weapons but their efficiency was down due to the long siege. Was it just Hitler&rsquo;s nervousness about such an unusual Axis operation, or was it the allure of bigger victories elsewhere?<br/><br/>November 1943, Leros: The possibility of invading Malta had passed but the British had put themselves out on a small island in the Aegean, Leros. Incredibly, a large part of the British garrison consisted of the former Malta garrison, now well rested. In effect, it was a miniature Malta. This time the Germans did not hesitate, they invaded by sea and air. This tough little infantry fight shows just what grit was involved and how the experience of fighting on Malta would have been. The British lost, but the battle was close. All the flavor of the Malta battle is here but at only one-third of the size.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE:        8 hours per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:        600 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:        Battalions and companies<br/><br/>",

It can be treated as a real battle, or as an exercise where opposing sides (Blue and Red) fight for supremacy.<br/><br/>This is one of our games with our original Triangle system. Each piece represent one ship, boat, helicopter... The movement mechanic is simple and very realistic for various types of vehicles, vessels, crafts and different kinds of weapons (guns, missiles, torpedoes...). The system is flexible and allows easy and precise positioning and determination of distance. The board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. The vertices are points where pieces are positioned, while lines determine direction of the piece or marker.<br/><br/>",

Originally designed as 64&ndash;gun by Ignacio Mullan, she left Havana for Cadiz on 1785. Here she was rebuilt and completed as a 74&ndash;gun, following the project of Francisco Gautier, the designer of Nepomuceno class. As a 74&ndash;gun ship of the line, she was armed with 74 cannons and a designed crew of 640. They were armed with 28 32&ndash;Pounder guns in the lower deck, 30 18&ndash;Pounder guns in the upperdeck, 8 32&ndash;Pounder guns and 6 12&ndash;Pounder guns in the quarterdeck, and 2 12&ndash;Pounder guns in the forecastle.<br/><br/>The ship was part of the Spanish fleet that participated in the Battle of Trafalgar, where she was hit by the intense fire of British ships, with 75 killed and 65 wounded. Her commander, Commodore Galiano, died after being struck by a cannonball. After capture by the British fleet, Bahama became HMS Bahama, following repairs in Gibraltar. She sailed to England and was used as a prison ship.<br/><br/>This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish Nepomuceno class &ldquo;HMS San Juan 1805.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

This games plays in 3 rounds, and each rounds ends with a moment of truth that is brutal and short lasted. Mojo Samurai is inspired of the classic Koi-Koi (or Hanafuda).<br/><br/>At the begining of a round, Players deploy their samurais on deployement locations. (either their HQ, or an encampment that was built in a previous round)<br/>Then, they draw 8 cards, the cards ranges from number 1 to three, in 4 different colors, and they contain one of 4 symbols)<br/><br/>8 more cards are placed face up on the table.<br/>The players turn by turn associate card from their hand with a card on the table forming a pair (with matching number and color) If the color they associated is their clan color, they get a free deployment (placing one samurai in a deployment location) and they can make a number of movement with their samurais equal to the number on the cards they associated.  For example, the red player associate a card with number 2 red from his hand, and 2 red from the table, he picks those cards up and places them in front of him. He then moves either 1 samurai of 2 spaces, or 2 samurais of 1 space.  Since he associated a card of his color, he also gets to deploy (before or after movement) a samurai on the battlefield.<br/><br/>After associating a card, the player can spend the cards he accumulated by association using the various symbols on the cards to either destroy the content of a tile, build a fortress, build an encampment, get more movements, or deploy more samurais.<br/><br/>The battles on the field is one for one. Meaning that if a samurai attacks a space with one enemy samurai, both are destroyed, and the tile becomes free.<br/><br/>If the content of a tile is destroyed with the use of card symbols, a fortress (if present) on the targeted tile is sacrificed instead, saving the units present.<br/><br/>Once a round is finished, (with no associations possible, or no card symbols can be spend anymore) 2 victory points are allowed for the players controlling most tiles, the player with the most samurai on the battlefield, the player with most fortress on the field, the player with most encampments on the field, tied players get 1 points. and 1 point for each controlled special locations, and 3 point for controling the center tile.<br/><br/>After three rounds, the winner is the player with the most victory points.<br/><br/>",

In this fun and lighthearted game for the whole family.<br/><br/>Collect and coop same color chickens to earn points. Strategically time the placement of your chickens to maximize your coops value. Different chickens do different things when played. Some may steal other players chickens or even randomly redistribute all chickens in play.<br/><br/>With many different kinds of chickens including; Raging Chickens, Wild Chickens, Fat Chickens, and Roosters. You'll be feeling like a real chicken farmer in no time.<br/><br/>Easy to learn and fun for any age group, a great game for casual players and families.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Players start with a hand of 5 chickens and one dog per player.<br/><br/>On a players turn they will play a chicken into their yard face up and draw a card or coop chickens that are already in their yard which is done by turning the cards over and putting them in a separate pile. Once a chicken is cooped it is safe and cannot be stolen by a raging chicken or rooster. Most of the time you will only be able to coop chickens of the same color but using the dog card once per game, a player can ignore the same color rule.

But not all accepted this new world order, and in August 1940 war returned to Europe.<br/><br/>The Cruel Sea is a truly massive expansion set for Second Great War at Sea. It features the ships, airships, helicopters and airplanes of Imperial Germany, Republican France and Imperial Russia.<br/><br/>There are 740 brand-new die-cut (and silky-smooth) pieces: 380 double-sized &quot;long&quot; pieces and 360 square ones.<br/><br/>The Cruel Sea is intended as the foundation of the Second Great War at Sea; other supplements, like Sword of the Sea, will draw on this set for playing pieces (which lets us put even more new toys in those sets rather than repeating the same pieces).<br/><br/>There are also thirty new scenarios based on the battles waged during the first eight months of this war that never happened, in our popular story-arc format. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bismarck and Arctic Convoy to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>Our Second Great War background book describes the alternative history behind these scenarios.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

You will need special support of defensive weapons in order to hold the city level status.<br/><br/><br/>    NCBC is a collection of mini expansions based on neutral big scale figurines, which are designed to enlarge the immersive Battalia universe, introducing a whole bunch of new strategic possibilities to the players and adding completely new adventure elements to the basic competitive plot. In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replay ability and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files. The miniatures are distributed in small packaging boxes with custom artwork as separate items or possibly in bundles.<br/><br/><br/>",

Ranging far ahead of the main battle line, they prosecute full-spectrum campaigns of domination against the enemy by sabotaging communications, demolishing supply caches, and draining morale with terror strikes. Meanwhile, the devoted warriors of the Daemonkin believe that true ascension is only possible through the willing sacrifice of their living flesh.

Being adventurous and ignoring her parents' warnings about the dangers in the forest, she decides one night to climb out her bedroom window and wander into the forest, hoping to discover hidden treasures to be found only under the moonlight. What she doesn't know is that she is fated to become best friends (the greatest of treasures) with a kind Troll... if she bumps into him before the sun rises. For when the sunlight hits a troll, they transform into a rock for the day. And if this was to happen, Violet would never again have the chance to meet this particular troll.<br/><br/>The grumpy Nisse Torech though, will have no such thing! Aware of what fate has reserved for Violet, and opposing such nonsense as trolls befriending humans, he will do all in his power, to prevent Violet from meeting this troll.<br/><br/>The Grumpy Nisse, is a 2-player card game where one player is Violet and the other is Torech. Torech tries to prevent Violet from reaching the end of the forest before sunrise, in which case he will win the game. Players will play out one card each and compare their strengths to determine who wins the round, if Violet, then she will progress, otherwise she'll have to try again. Some of the spots in the forest will trigger events that can make the game harder for either one or the other player, so players need to be careful in how they play out their cards.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players will draft cards to build the decks that they will play with for the duration of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The 7th Division had spent eighteen months preparing to fight in North Africa &ndash; training as a tank division for hot desert conditions, not as a light infantry amphibious force for arctic island warfare. The commanding General De Witt assured the high command that the Island defences would crumble in three days. It took 19 days of battle and over 500 U.S. Soldiers killed in action with more than 1200 injured. The Battle of Attu, which began with an unopposed landing, would end with unrestrained violence.

Yamasaki Yasuyo.<br/><br/>On June 7th, 1942, Soldiers of the Imperial Japanese invaded Attu in the Aleutians Islands. After the landing the Japanese soldiers began constructing fortifications and an airfield. Realising the need to hold Attu, the garrison was increased to a 2500-man force under the command of Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki. The Japanese were acclimated to the harsh weather conditions, they had prepared their defences, they were utterly devoted to their Emperor and prepared to sell their lives dearly. The US Forces landed 11000 Soldiers on May 11th , 1943 expecting to secure the Island in &quot;three days&quot;. Over the next 19 days the US forces gradually gained the upper hand. Realising that there would be no help or reinforcements coming to help in an increasingly hopeless situation, on May 29th , Colonel Yamasaki, sword in hand, led a massive Banzai charge against the Americans. The Japanese military used the term Gyokusai or &ldquo;Shattering like a Jewel&rdquo; to describe the self-annihilation of the defending force, of which only 29 Japanese survived the battle. This was the only instance of a banzai charge on American soil.<br/><br/>Warfighter: WWII Expansion #61 &ndash; Attu #2 adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Missions, including new US Hostiles, Japanese Soldiers, Locations, Missions, Objectives, and Skills:<br/><br/>4 x Player Soldiers<br/>4 x Non-Player Soldiers<br/>4 x Squad Soldiers<br/>9 x Weapons and Equipment<br/>1 x Service Record Card<br/>4 x Missions<br/>4 x Objectives<br/>10 x Locations<br/>16 x Hostiles<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Errata: There are typos on card 61-22 (Arctic Trained SRC), which does not affect gameplay.

        "description": "Before you is not quite a classic &quot;Imaginarium&quot;. Each card in the &quot;Kind&quot; deck is the fruit of the joint creativity of a child and a professional illustrator. The children &mdash; pupils of orphanages and patients of hospices &mdash; put all their unbridled imagination into sketches, which were then worked on by the best Russian artists, trying to bring the clarity of lines and images to perfection, while retaining the idea and mood of a child&rsquo;s drawing. This is a world of children's fantasy without limits and restrictions. And most importantly, these are stories that children can tell us. In the box you will find a brochure with original drawings and the names of their authors.<br/><br/>You can play Imaginarium Dobro even with preschoolers: the illustrations here are bright, and the images are understandable.<br/>Finally, another feature of the game is that we created it together with the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation and the charitable foundations &quot;LIVE&quot;, &quot;Ship&quot;, &quot;House of Ronald McDonald&quot;, &quot;Vera&quot;, &quot;Sheredar&quot;, &quot;Nastenka&quot;, &quot;Creation&quot; , &quot;Rusfond&quot;. 100 rubles from the sale of each box of &quot;Imaginarium Dobro&quot; are transferred to these organizations to help children.<br/><br/>Want to see what cards are in the deck? You are welcome!<br/><br/>The updated version of the Imaginarium Dobro has a convenient plastic lodgement with storerooms for decks and a special closable compartment for chips. We've made the board removable and added scoring tips to make the game even more enjoyable. Also in the new version, numerators appeared - special tokens that help put the cards in order and make it easier to vote. Winged elephants, however, remained the same: bright, cheerful and transparent, like candy.<br/><br/>",
