Players put spheres in alternate turns and try to occupy the four corners of a tetrahedron with the size of 2,3,4,5 or 6 elements. Three spheres of lower level carry one sphere of higher level. A player succeeding in forming a tetrahedron receives a sphere from the hand of the opponent, so that this player is stalemated at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Crossfire, for it was a daring offensive from two opposite directions focused on a single objective: to free the isolated forces and people of Leningrad before the Germans conducted their own operation to seize the city! The bottleneck area held by German forces was no more than a few miles wide and defended by no more than three divisions. From the East, the Soviets would toss a total of 14 divisions and 100 tanks to smash the Nazi. From the West, across the Neva River, another 2-3 divisions and a tank brigade would conduct an amphibious assault. The battle would last over 30 days and desperate for both sides. At first, Red forces seriously broke through, forcing Hitler to cancel his own offensive to seize Leningrad and divert General Mainstein's forces to save the impending disaster. The battle was also the debut for Germany's new AFV, the Tiger tank!<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>&bull; 11&quot; x 17&quot; map<br/>&bull; 280 counters<br/>&bull; 11 page rules<br/>&bull; 2 page Player aid<br/><br/>",

Game board has a wonderfully lithographed fantasy land where one takes paths to get to the Enchanted Isle.  The center of the board has two castle, woods, bears, a tent, a windmill and a church.  The paths weave along the outside and into the center.  The paths along the outside represent water and has pictures of a steamboat, canoeist, serpent, and whale.  The four corners of board are one city scene, one house scene, one mermaid and one lighthouse. This particular version, with a plain box (likely considered &quot;deluxe&quot; at that time) is later than the first 1876 version, which probably featured a more decorative printed image on the box cover. This version probably dates from around 1900.<br/><br/>",

The owner spends resources to set up the mansion, and the thief tries to steal the treasured item. The behaviour of the guards in the mansion are mostly automated responses.

There are gas, coal, steam and some electrical powered machines. There is also some magic.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Inspired by the various Thief games from Looking Glass Studios that have been part of my favourite computer games of all time.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The rules include tables and instructions for four sample adventures: The Wilderness, Hobgoblin Forest, Hunt for the Tribe, and the Black Pit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Heineken Spin-sation! Game was used as a premium gift in a marketing campaign by Heineken in Singapore during the Christmas season (17 Nov to 21 Dec) in 2007. People who bought Heineken beer gained points and these points could be exchanged for premiums like T-shirts, bags, sound speakers, calendars and this game.<br/><br/>The game itself is completely random. Players spin a cardboard wheel affixed to a board; the board also has spaces to place 4 stacks of cards. Depending on which segment on the wheel ends up next to where the picture of the beer bottle is pointing, the player who spun the wheel draws a chance card, which gives the player positive or negative points. The card may also have instructions or forfeits for the player to follow.<br/><br/>The four types of cards are:<br/><br/>1) Let's celebrate cards<br/>These all give the player +40 points. There's also a date of some festival on the card with some advice for the player.<br/><br/>E.g. +40 points. February 5th (2008) Mardi Gras, New Orleans. Don't come back without some beach.<br/><br/>2) Oops! cards<br/>These all give the player -10 points and have an action for the player to carry out.<br/><br/>E.g. -10 points. Collect an Oops! card from every girl.<br/><br/>3) Spin-sation! cards<br/>These all give the player =10 points and have a forfeit for the player to perform.<br/><br/>E.g. -10 points. Tell a joke that no one in the room has heard before.<br/><br/>4) Heineken cards<br/>These all give the player +20 points and have an action for the player to carry out (always a good thing).<br/><br/>E.g. +20 points. Take 3 Heineken cards from the player on your right.<br/><br/>The game ends whenever any stack of cards on the board is used up. Players then tally their nett scores and the player with the most points wins. The player with the least number of points has to perform the Ultimate Forfeit (sic), which the winner decides.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game comes from that lovable crew that brought you Pirates Versus Ninjas.  This game however, has neither Pirates nor Ninjas.  It involves a hot dog eating contest where the contestants are the players.<br/><br/>Rounds begin with the first player flipping over a hot dog to attempt to eat.  The hot dog has stats that match the five tastes (sweet, sour, spicy, salty, bitter).  Play proceeds to the left with the next player playing a topping card on the hot dog to attempt to make the first player lose their lunch.  Toppings include everything from lemons to fish heads.  Play proceeds until all of the opponents have had a chance to play a topping or pass.  Then the initial player has a chance to play negative toppings such as pepto or antacid to make the hot dog edible.  If they can't (the hot dog has a higher level than the character in at least one state), they lose their lunch.  Play proceeds to the next player who then flips over a hot dog to eat.<br/><br/>Play continues until a player has earned the specified number of points to win.  Each hot dog eaten also offers a bonus to stamina and points toward victory.<br/><br/>By the way, did I forget to mention it has BARF cards?  When played as a topping, the player automatically loses their lunch!!!<br/><br/>Hot Dog Hooligans is now available at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gurkengames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.gurkengames.com</a>.<br/><br/>",

In order to get the pieces, you must be able to react quickly to find matches of good foods with good exercises. There are two decks of cards, and during the &quot;Squeaker Round&quot; one card from each is placed face up. If the two cards are a match, meaning both good for their respective decks, the first player to hit the Squeaker gets to see if they guessed correctly. The cards are placed next to each other, and depending on how the gray bands on the cards match, the cards are either both good, one is good and one is bad, or both are bad. If both are good, the player gets to draw two puzzle pieces from a bag. Other actions let players exchange pieces, and the first to collect all none of their pieces wins. Through the game, children learn about which foods are healthy and which are not, and which activities lead to a healthy lifestyle versus those that don't.<br/><br/>",

Figures can be based individually (a la Warhammer) or based on stands (a la DBx).<br/><br/>Movement is done using command points:  each commander throws a four-sided dice for command points, which can be used to change orders of units within the leader's command radius.  Combat is conducted by throwing a ten-sided dice per figure with a &quot;10&quot; causing a casualty.<br/><br/>The following scenarios are included:  &quot;Supply Convoy Ambush&quot; (Hundred Years War French attacking an English baggage train), &quot;Relief of the Castle&quot; (Hundred Years War French attacking an English force besieging a castle), &quot;Breaking the Shieldwall, the Battle of Brunanburh&quot; (English vs. Scotts and Welsh), and &quot;Grandson&quot; (Burgundians vs. Swiss).<br/><br/>",

The premise of the game is that the rule of the realm has died and many parties are now maneuvering their candidates to take the throne. However, absolute power will be difficult to achieve. To become rule of the realm you must have the backing of the most influential powers in the land, but you should also have support form the Otherworld. There is one way to become the undisputed ruler of the realm, and that is to recover a legendary crown that once belonged to the most powerful rule to have ever ruled the land. Legend has it that the crown was stolen and is now somewhere on the Planes of Damnation. Only a hero of great power and skill could ever hope to enter those lands and return. Alternatively it be just simpler to remove the competition.<br/><br/>",

They were disappointed to discover that their father, knowing how much they all enjoyed games, planned to have his servants hide the coins around the house for a bizarre family treasure hunt.<br/>On Saturday morning the servants hid the antique coins in various locations around the mansion and then the four sons spent the day searching every nook and cranny, desperate to be the one to find the most coins.<br/>By Saturday night one of the sons, much to the annoyance his brothers, had won the game and, having found the most coins, gained a considerable inheritance.<br/><br/>Desperate to get their hands on the inheritance, each of the brothers had the same idea; use their time machines to change the outcome of the game. Based on their father&rsquo;s prototype, their small time travel devices could enable them to travel back no further than a couple of days. Even the winner of the contest, suspicious of his scheming brothers, realised that he should also travel back to make sure that he was still victorious.<br/><br/>The plan was to ask the servants where the coins had been hidden, as it was now Sunday they would be happy to divulge that information. Armed with this knowledge the brothers would then travel back to Saturday morning and claim a coin from its hiding place.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Taking on the role of one of the brothers, you will gain a clue card and then travel back to Saturday to claim a coin. You will have to then return to Sunday to acquire another clue card.<br/>Other players can use game cards to steal coins from you. Stealing can be blocked by using a trap (a Time Twist) which you set up on Friday &ndash; you must of course remember to travel back to Friday to set that trap up or it will never happen!<br/>Avoid being lost in space and time as you manipulate time and use every low down trick you can think of to claim your rightful inheritance.<br/><br/>The necessary game files can be purchased from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=739&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=739&amp</a>;pics=<br/> Players will need to provide a 6 sided die, 14 plastic stands (these are optional).<br/><br/>",

But it is also MUCH more than just a range of well sculpted figures.<br/><br/>The Uncharted Lands will act as the backdrop for all of our fantasy games, including our naval combat game.<br/><br/>The first races to be supported are Iron Dwarves and Orc Raiders. But we&rsquo;re underway with our Humans and Dragon Lords. Shortly we will be making our Halfling Militia available and over time more races from The Uncharted Lands will appear.<br/><br/>We are developing a set of rules for the game and we hope to have more news for you on when these rules will be available. Right now we have 9 packs of miniatures (5 Iron Dwarf and 4 Orc Raiders) complete, each with 4 figures for foot troops or 3 figures for command.<br/><br/>We have greens for new figures, including an Orc commander and his brutish bodyguard and a cannon and crew for the Dwarves. We are busy with the design of our Dragon Lords and Humans, both races we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll like when they arrive.<br/><br/>Over time The Uncharted Lands will grow and new races will begin to unfold. The combination of naval game and land game is a novel one and we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll enjoy both. The Gallery below will give you an idea of what our miniatures look like when painted.<br/><br/>",

As in regular football, the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game uses a custom deck of cards made up of seven types of cards: Run, Pass, Kick, Blitz, Offense, Defense, and Special. Cards are played to gain Field Position Tokens which represent the offensive player&rsquo;s position on the field, from the player&rsquo;s goal line (zero tokens), to midfield (three tokens), to a touchdown (seven tokens). Down Tokens are used to track change of possession on downs, which occurs after the Offensive Player accumulates five of the tokens. Whenever the Offensive Player gains a Field Position Token, all but one of the Down Tokens are discarded.<br/><br/>Each player begins with a hand of five cards, and draws three cards at the start of each turn. The Offensive Player declares whether there will be a regular play, punt, or field goal attempt. The Defensive Player may play a Blitz Card. If the Blitz Card cannot be countered by the Offensive Player, the play is over. If a regular play was declared, the Offensive Player then declares either a running play or a pass play, and plays either a Pass or Run Card. If the card is not countered by the Defensive Player, the Offensive Player can play one additional card to increase the yardage of the play. A Run Card can be used to extend either type of play, but a Pass Card can only be used to extend a Pass play.<br/><br/>When an Offensive Player accumulates seven or more Field Position Tokens, a touchdown is scored and the Offensive Player receives six points. The point after touchdown attempt is governed by a die roll, as are punts, field goals, and kick offs.<br/><br/>",

The basic WILDFIRE game is designed to be played either in two 45-minute sessions of one move each or in a single 90-minute session with a short break between moves. A short introductory exercise is designed to be worked through in advance.<br/><br/>The game has three separate parts- an introductory exercise and two &quot;moves&quot;. The introductory exercise covers the fundamentals of the problem and some basic facts (like who has nuclear arsenals today) and gets players thinking about the overall issue. The first move is a crisis control exercise in which players take on the roles of top officials in five nations that are wrestling with a future nuclear crisis involving India and Pakistan. The second and final move is a post-crisis negotiation exercise in which players seek a long-term solution to the conflict between India and Pakistan,<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Released toward the end of the Great Depression in 1937, The Big Board, like many games released during this time frame, reflects an America, and the world, pulling itself out of economic chaos. The lure of trading large sums of cash with the possibility of striking it rich ran deep in the collective unconscious across the globe.<br/><br/>The box includes 835 shares of stock in each of nine different corporations with the following denominations/counts: 1/10, 5/5, 10/5, 50/5, 100/5. This is at odds with the instructions which call for 435 shares. It also includes approximately $110,000 in paper money in the following denominations: $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $1,000 and $5,000. Again this is at odds with the instructions which call for $147,600. Included is one pair of standard dice, a dice cup, 9 wooden Price markers, and one large board marking the rising stock prices.<br/><br/>The Big Board  &ldquo;represents the quotation board as used in a broker&rsquo;s office&rdquo;, and attempts to &ldquo;represent in a realistic manner the fluctuation of stocks, as on the New York Stock Exchange.&rdquo; Nine stocks are available for trading. Each player starts with $5,000.00. One player is selected as the supervisor of the treasury and stock certificates. The instructions suggest that this player throws the dice and moves the price quotation markers, but is &ldquo;not the banker and does not participate in the profits or losses of the BIG BOARD.&rdquo;, effectively removing the player from the game. For those who don&rsquo;t wish to be left out of the game, an easy house rule could fix this by allowing one person to be banker and perhaps shifting the throw of the dice from player to player.<br/><br/>The game begins with the price markers on each of the stock spaces marked PAR. The market is now open and all players may purchase one or more shares of as many stocks as they wish. The dice are then rolled for the first stock, with the operator moving the marker upward the matching number of spaces rolled. If the marker lands on a value space, the price is set, if it lands on a &ldquo;Down To&rdquo; space, it is moved to the corresponding lower value and the price is set there. Players may now buy or sell values of this stock. These phases are continued for each stock, with the dice returning to the first stock when the others have been set. During intervals, transactions can occur at the current price of any stock.<br/><br/>The game can end in several ways: at a set time determined by all players at the start of the game (suggested by the game designers as a more realistic simulation of stock activity from day to day), or when 1 player has lost all money or the treasury is exhausted, or even when 1 player has made a &ldquo;certain amount of money over and above that which he started with&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From online description:<br/><br/>Simple, yet realistic, fun board game that employs the principles of sailing and sailboat racing. Visualize sailing into the windward mark on a starboard tack, calling for right-a-way at the mark, or getting a big puff downwind to slip past several boats. Play by yourself or with up to eight players. Play your own boat by starting behind an imaginary line sailing to windward, tacking to avoid the head wind, rounding the mark, reaching to the second mark and on to the downwind leg of the course. The basic strategy involves port and starboard tacking and staying clear of the competition. Fun and instructive for the new sailor and a challenge for the experienced skipper. The whole family will love to play as there are no complicated wind changes and the game moves along at a pace that will keep everyone interested. Game is boxed and includes a playing board, eight pewter boats, chance cards and dice.<br/><br/>",

The basic planes move 2d6 inches each turn. The number of dice or distance rolled will be modified if the aircraft dives, turns, or performs special maneuvers (stall, climb, barrel roll, or loop).<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by the attacker rolling machine gun dice and the defender rolling maneuverability dice. For the basic planes, each player rolls 3d6, with a hit being scored if the attacker rolls a higher total. A plane is shot down after taking six hits.<br/><br/>Advanced rules cover gun jams, sun position, rear gunners, custom planes, pilot skill levels, and damage effects.<br/><br/>Variant rules suggestions are included for Star Wars dogfights.<br/><br/>",

On subsequent turns, the Spider player may move the Spider in addition to their normal move.<br/><br/>Once the spider has collected a number of flies equal to the number of opposing players, the Spider is returned to its place at the opposite Goal and another player may become the spider simply by being first to move a fly into the center of the board.

        "description": "The Future Art of War is a science fiction wargame, self-published by Leonard J. Meloche.<br/><br/>The game map consists of 26 planets (one starting with each letter of the alphabet).<br/><br/>Players start with one planet, and a small force of ships.  They occupy/conquer planets, collect and trade resources, build ships, supply their planets and attempt to discover Battleship technology.<br/><br/>Players are eliminated when their home planet is conquered, and victory is achieved through the elimination of all other players.<br/><br/>The Future Art of War includes a creative movement mechanic which adds to the &quot;fog of war&quot; effect.  Ships travel from planet to planet via &quot;hyperspace&quot;, and a chart indicates the number of turns (1-6) required to travel between each pair of planets. When a ship departs for a planet, the controlling player secretly writes the first letter of the planet and the number of turns required on the bottom of the ship counter, and places it on the first space in the hyperspace track.  Each turn, all ships in the hyperspace track move one space further down the track, and, when a ship has reached the appropriate space, the controlling player reveals the ship's destination.  Therefore, while players know how many ships their opponents have in hyperspace, they do not know the ships' destinations, or when they will arrive.<br/><br/>The components of this game are quite good for a self-published game.  The map is poster-quality, and the cards, reference sheets, and money are comparable to many commercially published games.  The one component that clearly identifies the game as &quot;self-published&quot; is the ship counters, which are cut rectangles of flat plastic.  These, however, with a whiteboard marker, serve the &quot;hyperspace&quot; mechanic very well.  The game is packed in a large tube.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;It was during World War I that the airplane became an important weapon of war. At the start of the war the planes were unarmed and were used for scouting. Soon the pilots were taking weapons with them on their flights. These early efforts were crude, but Dutch inventor Anthony Fokker eventually succeeded in synchronizing a machine gun with an engine so the weapon could fire through the propeller. This led to the &lsquo;Fokker scourge&rsquo; as the Germans used the new invention to dominate the skies. The Allies soon followed suit and battled the Germans for control of the skies over no man's land. Successful &lsquo;aces&rsquo;, like the Red Baron, were lionized by the press and became living legends. By the end of the war the airplane's role in combat had expanded to include reconnaissance, artillery spotting, trench strafing, and bombing.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A simple historical miniatures air combat game designed for classroom use in grades 6-8. The game may be played by eight players using 1/72 scale models on a Battle Masters mat (4x4 feet with five inch hexes).<br/><br/>Each player uses an aircraft model (Allied or German) on a stand, a deck of maneuver cards, a laminated record card (for tracking damage and victories with a dry erase marker), and 5 six-sided dice. Each record card includes the name and picture of a World War One ace, his victory total, and brief biographical information.<br/><br/>",

If you couldn't take it by trickery or treachery your best option was to wait for disease and starvation to force the garrison to surrender.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If the castle was well provisioned, or the attackers were in a hurry, then a direct assault might be attempted. The tactics used were basically unchanged since ancient times. Moats could be filled, a ram could bash in the gate, and catapults and trebuchets could knock down the walls. Ladders or a siege tower could also surmount the walls. Another popular (and dangerous) tactic was to undermine the walls with a tunnel.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted one per stand.

Select the board of the dinosaur you wish to dig for and the fun begins.  Using the excavation tool, turn up any two cards on the game board. Now peek at the cards that are underneath.  If a card shows bones to your dinosaur, place it on your board.  If not, cover it back up for the other players to find. Finding a ruby give you an extra turn but uncovering a snake might help your opponent.<br/><br/>In addition to sharpening memory skills Dig that Dinosaur features real dinosaur facts.

        "description": "On March 15, 1848, mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda enabled Hungarian reformists to push through a list of 12 demands. Faced with revolution both at home and in Vienna, Austria first had to accept Hungarian demands. Later, under governor Lajos Kossuth and the first Prime minister, Lajos Batthy&aacute;ny, the House of Habsburg was dethroned and the form of government was changed to create the first Republic of Hungary. Initially, the Hungarian forces (Honv&eacute;ds&eacute;g) defeated Austrian armies. To counter the successes of the Hungarian revolutionary army, Franz Joseph asked for help from the &quot;Gendarme of Europe,&quot; Czar Nicholas I, whose Russian armies invaded Hungary. The huge army of the Russian Empire and the remnants of the Austrian forces proved too powerful for the Hungarian army, and General Art&uacute;r G&ouml;rgey surrendered in August 1849.<br/><br/>Ne engedj a negyvennyolcb&oacute;l! is a card game based on the theme of political unrest and the Hungarian freedom fighters during this turbulent time in Hungarian history.<br/><br/>",

This novelty has been prepared with this in mind. First, the Top is Spun and when &quot;dead&quot; the handle points to one of four numbers. A Peg is then inserted in a Hole at one side of the board to register the player's score and the first player having PEGGED IN over his course of 30 HOLES WINS.<br/><br/>(From the instructions. All capitalizations are as they appear in the rules.)<br/><br/>The game is very basic. It has a shallow metal cup in the middle of the board. You spin the top in the cup and when the it stops, the player the top's peg is pointing towards gets a point.<br/><br/>",

Its a Euro-style game, no die rolling for mechanic resolution. Playing the tiles builds your castle, situates the cannons, and when a sufficient number of flag-tiles are played, fires the cannons.<br/><br/>Starting with the player holding the cannon and proceeding clockwise, each player should take one territory<br/>tile from the face-up pile in the center of the board and add it next to another tile in their kingdom.<br/>The tile may be rotated when being placed.<br/>Only when an area is completely enclosed by walls, however, is it considered &ldquo;secured&rdquo;. If an area has one or more gaps, it is considered &ldquo;under siege&rdquo; until all of the gaps are filled.<br/>Each tile will generally have one or more special symbols on the tile. Adding three commander (red flag) symbols to one&rsquo;s kingdom will trigger a round of attack. The player will score during this time as well.<br/>At the end of the round, refill the center play area with new tiles from the territory tile stack<br/>The player with the highest score when no tiles remain in the center of the play area wins.<br/><br/>Is freely available from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.vbasementgames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.vbasementgames.com/</a> after you create an account.<br/><br/>",

Survivors often claim that the experience is quite rewarding! But beware those doomsday plans&hellip;<br/><br/>You have to complete missions set by the major villains. The first player picks the plan the villain wants accomplished, and then the players play henchmen to try to complete the mission. They commit henchman to resolve the evil plan. Players take one henchman card from their hand and commit it face down. These henchmen form the mission pool. <br/>All Players Simultaneously Reveal Henchmen in the Mission Pool. All the better to determine which henchmen to undermine &hellip; er &hellip; help&hellip; during subterfuge. Players Play Subterfuge Cards. These cards can help and hinder in the efforts. Then you see whether the plan worked. If the plan succeeded, then the highest unique number on the henchmen will count for points (be promoted to the back office). <br/>You repeat till 3 rounds or a doomsday plan has been completed. If a doomsday plan was enacted, then the player whose henchman made it succeed is ineligible for victory.<br/>Each eligible player totals up the henchman value for all henchmen promoted to the back office. The player with the highest total is the winner.

Elan is designed to have each player controlling roughly an augmented division of troops.  <br/>&Eacute;lan Deluxe is the latest and final evolution of these tactical-level Napoleonic wargame rules designed for 15-25 mm miniatures.<br/><br/>The Deluxe version also includes campaign rules Etat-Major, new optional rules, and also included in the rules are extensive unit ratings for over twenty nations and over 40 Army lists for every nation that took part in the conflict including multiple theatres.<br/><br/>&Eacute;lan is a flowing game that accurately reflects historical tactics. Players are placed &quot;on the table&quot; and granted wide historical latitude to control their units.<br/><br/>The rules sequence features both simultaneous and alternate actions, resulting in an intuitive and balanced game that captures the feel of the period strongly. Individual units represented are the battalion and regiment and players can do sub-unit actions such as company and squadron actions. Players can use any basing system and the default scale is 1:50, but players can use any ratio such as 1:20 or 1:60.<br/><br/>It is a game that replicates the tactics of the period and enables gamers to play the period and not get bogged down in complex rules! The game can also be adapted for other Horse and Musket periods from the SYW to the Crimea War.<br/><br/>The game will appeal to players who enjoy tactical nuance and want a game that grows with them in subtlety and tactical complexity. &Eacute;lan is written in a clear, concise style. The rules are well indexed, logically laid out and easy to comprehend.  The PDF file also has bookmarks for ease of navigation and players can print out just the sections that interest them.<br/><br/>",

The optimum amount of time allotted to play is four hours to ensure proper facilitation and personal engagement, but the game can be played in a minimum of three hours. The goal is to achieve &quot;enlightenment.&quot; To do this, the active participants move their pawns around the game board and respond to statements on the playing cards. After a set period of time, the two groups switch roles. At the end of the game, all players participate in a reflection and group discussion period to synthesize the game experience for each participant.<br/><br/>More information can be found here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.naspa.org/publications/books/the-game-of-oppression\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.naspa.org/publications/books/the-game-of-oppress...</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ddak-ji is a popular Korean childrens game played using specially made cardboard disks.  The disks resemble Pogs but are perhaps thinner and slightly curved.  Unlike the games played using Pogs, Ddak-ji uses no 'slammer' piece.  Only the ddakji themselves are used.<br/><br/>In the basic version of the game the throwing player is chosen by 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' and the losing player places their disk on the table.  The active player throws their disk down on it in an attempt to make the inactive player's disk flip over.  The curvature of the disks makes finesse an important part of the technique.  If a disk is flipped, the player who flipped it gets to keep it.  Variants of this play style exist.<br/><br/>The modern disks are decorated with pictures of characters from popular culture (TV, animation and video game characters are extremely popular).<br/><br/>Modern ddakji is the descendant of an older game that was adopted from Japanese culture.  In Japan special illustrated cards (Cf. 'menko'), similar to modern sports cards, were thrown down in an attempt to flip and claim the cards.  The old Korean version that descended from this was played with handmade folded paper or pasteboard squares.<br/><br/>The early history of Ddak-ji in Korea is briefly mentioned in Lee E-Wha's History of Korea, Vol. 14:<br/><br/>&quot;in addition to these games, there was a slap-match (ddakji chigi) which came from Japan in the nineteenth century.  The goal of this game was to flip the pasteboard card (ddakji) on the ground by slapping it with another pasteboard card.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The year is 1792, and only a decade earlier this secluded glen was the scene of a grisly battle during the American Revolution where a Hessian soldier lost his head to a stray cannonball. Since that fateful day the residents of Sleepy Hollow live in fear of nightfall when the Headless Horseman returns and &lsquo;rides forth to the scene of battle in a nightly quest of his head.&rsquo;<br/><br/>Sleepy Hollow is based on the legendary tale of Sleepy Hollow as penned by Washington Irving in 1820. During the game players control residents of Sleepy Hollow, recently shaken by the disappearance of Ichabod Crane, now living in fear that the Headless Horseman will come for them.  Game play is divided into the 10 days leading up to All Hallows Eve, each separated into day and night. During the day, the residents move freely about the glen, finding a safe place to hide before nightfall. At night, the Horseman makes rounds in the village killing residents where they hide. <br/>    <br/>Each building gives players distinct benefits, but also distinct criterion dictating who is killed if targeted by the Horseman. Sometimes it is wisest to risk leaving yourself exposed, other times it is safer to stay hidden. By the time the sun rises on All Hallows Day, the player with the most points and fewest fatalities wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is themed as &quot;deputies chasing a bandit&quot; - one player is the bandit, the remainder are deputies.  The game ends when the bandit is either captured or becomes trapped (by certain spaces on the board).<br/><br/>Star of India is also roll-and-move, with players this time attempting to secure the precious &quot;Star of India&quot; ruby from the House of Gems and return it to the Maharaja.  The game features a cardboard ring that the player can hang around their pawn's neck to show ring ownership - the winner is the first player to return home with the ring.  Alarm spaces and thefts from other players add some complications.<br/><br/>",

The Pacific 1942 SunRise extension cannot be played without the basic version of the game.<br/><br/>It adds new elements to the basic game and thus makes the game more varied.<br/><br/>To play the Pacific 1942 SunRise extension, it is necessary to know the rules of the basic version.<br/><br/>Contents of the extension: <br/>- Five randomly selected hexagon sextets (i.e. tiles)<br/>- Three extra battalions of the marines, three bomber squadrons and three fighter squadrons<br/>- Six extra prisms, which, in the Pacific 1942 Admiral game, stand for the power and speed of ships. In Pacific 1942 SunRise extension, you will have also another use for them.<br/>- Eight completely new island tiles<br/>- 21 risk cards<br/>- A typhoon triplet consisting of three tiles<br/>- A night card<br/><br/>What does Pacific 1942 SunRise change?<br/><br/>Firstly, there is a new goal. To win the basic version, you had to seize four islands in the Pacific. Now, the task becomes even more demanding: You have to push your enemy out of all islands.<br/>In the basic version, a player could seize an island and that was it. In Pacific 1942 SunRise, some islands can be turned into powerful bases. (See more below.)<br/>Apart from the new island tiles, the risk cards represent another extremely important novelty. At the end of his or her turn, every player can decide to take a risk card instead of producing a new battle unit. (The use of these cards is specified below.)<br/><br/>Eight new island tiles<br/><br/>Eight new island tiles comprise two sets of four tiles. Every player receives a set of four tiles. The new island tiles are of the following types:<br/>- A tile with a trench.<br/>- A tile with an airfield.<br/>- A tile with a harbour.<br/>- A tile with a fortress.<br/><br/>Risk cards<br/>There are 16 types of risk cards in the game. Before every game, they have to be thoroughly shuffled and placed with their face down. At the end of each turn, instead of production, a player can take one risk card. You can encounter the following risk cards:<br/>1.Minesweeper<br/>2.Rudder hit<br/>3.Typhoon<br/>4.Submarine<br/>5.Paratroopers<br/>6.False token<br/>7.Extra production<br/>8.New ship<br/>9.Lifeboat<br/>10.Reconnaissance<br/>11.Fleet<br/>12.SunRise<br/>13.Open Card<br/>14.Waves<br/>15.Night<br/>16.Last moment<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Pacific 1942 Admiral<br/><br/><br/>",

They came from all corners of the world past the Lady holding the torch of freedom to Ellis Island. People came to NYC forming segregated sections like Chinatown and Little Italy. As years passed and the country grew, the city became one and we all became Americans in the Land we call the Melting Pot.<br/>Liberty Island is quite simple. A player chooses a ship and a bag of deeds naming them the nationality of their choice, like Irish or Italian. They must move these ships to obtain as many rows of city squares as possible(a row consists of 3 horizontal city squares). The nationality with the most rows(12 rows in all) at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

This is not to say that the historical integrity of this era in warfare has been compromised, It has not.&quot;<br/><br/>The rules are designed for 15mm miniatures, but has general conversion notes for 5mm and 25mm. Turns equal 15 minutes of real time, with castings representing approx. 60 individual troops. Units are rated with Quality Points (QP) and have a typical number of castings (marked as lost as combat occurs). It has a basic &quot;orders&quot; system and units fatigue if given too many attack orders in a row. Unit types have a set number of performable functions in a turn for movement, formation changes and other actions.<br/><br/>The rulebook itself is 32 pages, including eight pages of general troop listings for the major conflicts of the period. There is also a four page discussion of unit organizations and tactics for the armies listed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this all luck cricket game the pitch is represented by a  6 by 6 grid on which the fielder places his nine men. The bowler uses a spinner to determine the outcome of the bowl. If it's a hit further spins determine which square the ball lands in. Should there be a fielder in that square the batsman is out, otherwise the lower of the two numbers on the spinner is the number of runs scored. After each over the fielder can reposition his men.<br/>Play continues until all eleven batsmen have been dismissed. Then the other team (player) have an innings. The winner is the player who scores most runs.<br/><br/>",

It's games like this that made some people take the magic use in D&amp;D way too seriously.<br/><br/>From the tube:<br/><br/>&quot;Mystic Master is a unique and enjoyable adventure designed by a research psychologist to test, challenge and help develop the fantastic powers of the mind. Join forces with Merlin in mastering mystical mental powers of ESP. It's fun and easy to play. The game comes complete with:<br/><br/>&quot;A long-lasting, attractive, vinyl game board, 18 specially designed mystic image cards and easy-to-follow multiple game instructions.&quot;<br/><br/>No designer is actually credited in the rules or anywhere else. It also comes with two gold plastic tokens.<br/><br/>Movement is literally governed by guessing (erm, divining) what card(s) is being held up, is closest to the top of the deck, etc.<br/><br/>",

When you have read and played everything this booklet contains, you will be prepared to design a Civil War game which has all the simplicity necessary for a great game.  The first version described is called the TRAINING GAME because it is designed to teach the basic mechanics of recreating Civil War battles with miniatures soldiers.

        "description": "This French-language educational game consists of 16 sets of 3 tiles each depicting important French leaders from Vercingetorix to Napoleon III.  Each set of tiles displays the head (plus name and birth and death dates), torso, and legs of the leader in question.  All three cards are marked with the same identifying number (1-16).  The game also comes with a 4-page biographical survey of the depicted leaders.<br/><br/>For the under-6's, the game is simply one of putting the tiles together to form the leaders.  In the solitaire version, the child attempts to correctly construct all 16 figures. In the two-player version, children flip tiles one at a time by turn, trying to build the leaders.  The child with the most complete leaders wins.<br/><br/>The game for 6-and-overs plays with a simple Go-Fish mechanic where 2-3 players take turns trying to reconstruct the famous leaders of French history by asking each other for specific body parts and pulling from the draw pile if they don't get them.  Again, the winner is the player who has reconstituted the most historical personages before the draw pile is gone and someone has run out of tiles.<br/><br/>",

Cause it's a strategic game, where you need to fight and conquer territory, by strangle your enemy in a prison of holes. Ok. Now here is the rule.<br/><br/>As told above, the only things you need, is Pencil and Sheet grid, That's right, no eraser just that. Its a game which is simple to do, to play, and to explain. Just few rules to understand and you can play.<br/><br/>What about the story ? Imagine that you are in a limited zone, with a chosen draw as player. You move and shoot each turn. When you move, you blacken your old player and place a new one at movement range. When you shoot, you blacken the place you shot from which is in Attack Range. A place which is Blackened cannot be passed through and is considered as an empty box. When the players ( all players ) aren't connected ( divided by empty boxes. ) The game ends, and the winner is the player with the most space. This game maybe looks  boring but it isn't!  Try it, its cost you nothing.<br/><br/>A lot of variants can be made, from the mines to Multiplication Artifact and Invisible Shield. Same for the Mod, Capture Flag, Zombie mod, Team, Werewolf. Infinite possibilities.<br/><br/>",

A card is read from one of four decks: Chakra, Life, Angel, or Block. Following the instructions on the card, halos are collected (or sometimes forfeited) and stored on the player's pewter angel. Seven halos may be exchanged for one jewel. The first person to earn all their 8 jewels is the winner, however players may choose to continue until everyone achieves enlightenment.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ideograph is a party game about ideographic / pictographic association. Players create meanings for combinations of symbols (graphemes) based on associations of the (combined) meanings of those symbols. The player that comes up with the best / most creative / most humorous / most plausible explanation of the meaning of a combination of symbols wins that round. This is decided by means of voting. Hence, whether plausibility or humor is prioritized depends on the players and the situation.<br/><br/>The game is based loosely on the structure of Chinese characters. The selection of symbols (card/graphemes) in the game is based partly on frequently occurring 'radicals' and other graphemes in Chinese characters, but also on Anna Wierzbicka&rsquo;s theory of semantic primes (natural semantic metalanguage).<br/>The shapes of the symbols are for the most part completely unrelated to those found in Chinese characters. Ideograph is not intended to be an educational game or to be helpful in learning Chinese characters. It is merely intended to be fun (within the right context), although playing with language in this way might be a rather geeky type of fun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It was another fishing game, `Pike Attack' which was the the most promising new game on display at the &quot;Death Row&quot; at the London Toys Fair of 1994. <br/>The aim of Pike Attack is to collect and keep a full set of five fishing tackle cards, which are laid face up on the board. <br/>A full set of tackle allows a player to fish, with the object of landing the heaviest catch. If the player holds a bite card, then the player is able to take a fish card. If the player's tackle matches the ratings for both line and hook, as shown on the fish card, then the player lands the fish. <br/>However, if only one of the ratings match, the player must throw the `fight dice'. The throw determines whether the fish is caught, gets away, or whether a penalty is suffered, such as loosing your hook or breaking your line.<br/><br/>Lurking amongst the normal fish is the Pike. If a player draws the pike card then it is possible to catch the pike if a Pike Buster card is held, otherwise you are likely to lose either part of your tackle or part of your previous catch.<br/><br/>The game has been sponsored by Shimano, a fishing tackle company, but the inclusion of their logo in the computer generated graphics is very discrete and does not distract from the appearance.<br/><br/>Very appealing game components make a good and light family game.<br/><br/>",

With training and supervision, they also collated and packaged the Landmark Cards, Investment Cards, and money.  The final product was then assembled and put through a shrink wrap machine.  It is the hope of Villa Esperanza that &quot;The Pride of Pasadena&quot; will provide ongoing and meaningful work for the handicapped adults, along with representing our city in an entertaining and aesthetic way.  We at Villa Esperanza are proud of Pasadena and our contribution to the city.<br/><br/>Object:  The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through purchasing the controlling interest in cultural and historical landmarks of Pasadena.&quot;<br/><br/>Not from the rules:<br/><br/>A monopoly variant.<br/><br/>",

The game ensues in a clockwise direction with each person in turn flipping a card onto the table for all to see and responding to the action on the underside of the card. But beware, the rest of the players must all be attentive as there are 'reaction' cards like the 'HIJACK' card which requires every player to respond to the card as soon as possible.<br/><br/>There is no winner to the game, only one poor unfortunate sod, who will have the misfortune of flipping the fourth and final GROG card. As the game progresses, every time one of these cards are flipped, the 'flipper' will pour a tot of his/her beverage into the glass in the middle of the table. So by the time the fourth GROG card is flipped, there should be an alcoholic concoction of at least 3 tots of whatever the respective GROG flippers' beverages were. The fourth GROG flipper (the loser) must then pour a tot of their beverage into the glass and down it (OUCH!!!) That terminates the game and you may then gather all the cards together and play again until you have had enough... (or fallen down)<br/><br/>",

Players start in a randomly determined town and race to complete a circuit through the other five towns on the very abstract map of Germany. Players can choose between a &quot;career path&quot; and an &quot;alternative path&quot; for their trip. Special fields may force a change of path, and players may influence the game by placing bridges and barricades.<br/>One of the crude attempt at humorous games that were typical of the time, but this one is extremely simplistic and offers next to no gaming fun.<br/><br/>",

You get 20 circular discs in a tin (like a traditional shoeshine tin, see image gallery); each disc shows a black-and-white picture and is sliced into three sectors. Three very similar game variants are described in the small rule leaflet: Free for all, team play, group play. In all variants, the disc sectors are mixed and placed on the table face down. Now players openly look at some pieces (3 per player in free for all, 2 per partner in team play); if the pieces match, i.e. show a complete picture, the player/team may keep them, otherwise they are turned face-down again and play passes to the next player (in traditional &quot;Memory&quot; fashion). At game end, each complete picture disc scores one point.<br/>The pictures come in 5 groups of 4 discs each: Symbols (zodiacs, wiring schema, sports, signals), Fonts (musical notes, handwriting, typewriter, Japanese), Small Things (buttons, paperclips, matches, tacks), Structures (millimeter grid paper, wood, knitting, honeycomb), Currency (coins, bills, stamps, cheques). A rule &quot;for experienced players&quot; recommends to award extra points if more than one picture of the same group has been collected.<br/><br/>",

If the asking player does not get a fairy from an opponent they draw from the deck. If they get the fairy they had asked for, they place the pair in front of them and continue their turn.

The game was first described by Henry Parker in 1909. It is almost exclusively played by women, especially at the season of New Year. An average game takes about 30 moves.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board called olinda-poruwa has 14 holes (wala) arranged in two rows (pila). Between them are two rectangular hollows serving as stores for the captures. <br/>Initially there are four seeds (indiya, pl. indi) in each hole, usually from the Olinda creeper (Abrus precatorius).<br/><br/>On his turn a player sows (ihinawa) the contents of one of his holes one by one into the following holes. The direction of play (clockwise or anti-clockwise) is decided by the first player and then adhered to throughout the game by both players. <br/>The first turn of the game must be commenced from one of the two end holes. <br/>A seed may not be placed into a hole containing three seeds except it is the last one sown. <br/>If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole (any number but three) its contents are picked up and distributed in another lap. <br/>If the last seed is dropped into a hole containing three seeds, its contents including the last seed sown are &quot;eaten&quot; (innawa) and the turn ends. The captures are collected in the store. <br/>If the contents of an end hole are captured, this hole is said to be &quot;tied&quot; (baenda). A baenda is owned by the player who effected the capture. A move or lap cannot start from a tied hole. When a player sows his last seed into a baenda, his turn ends and the player &quot;sits down&quot;. Any seeds sown into a tied hole are owned by the player who made the baenda. <br/>The game is finished when a player has nothing to move with at the start of his turn. The remaining seeds that are not yet captured or trapped in a baenda are won by the player who could move last. <br/>The game is won by the player who won most seeds. &quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Billed as &quot;the fun game that lets you explore your feelings &amp; values&quot;, this TV show-inspired game seems to be in keeping with its Ungame ancestry.  The goal of the game is nominally to collect a set of cards which match your &quot;Winning Ticket&quot;, where the four types of cards correspond to the four main characters from &quot;The New Zoo Review&quot; (Freddie the Frog, Henrietta Hippo, Charlie the Owl, and their human friend Doug).  However, the clear focus of the game is for the players (ideally children and their parents) to discuss various emotions and values in response to scenarios from the show described on the cards.  For example, by landing on a Charlie the Owl space, the player may receive a card which reads:<br/><br/>Charlie is disappointed when his oil well isn't a big &quot;money maker.&quot;<br/>TELL ABOUT ONE OF YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS.<br/><br/>One odd element of the game is the Gift Exchange spaces, which require a player landing on them to use a large spinner to select a &quot;gift&quot;, which can vary from &quot;if you have any cards, give one away&quot; to &quot;apologize to somebody for something&quot; to &quot;scratch someone's back for 15 seconds&quot;.<br/><br/>The game comes in a &quot;Christian Version&quot; which includes two pages of notes on how to enhance the religious education aspects of the game.<br/><br/>",

From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Tchadji\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Tchadji</a>:<br/><br/>Tchadji is a game played, at least, in Island of Mozambique (Ilha de Mo&ccedil;ambique in Portuguese, the official language; Muhipitti in Makua, the local language). It has been studied by Abdulcarimo Ismael, a mathematician from Universidade Pedag&oacute;gica, Maputo. It is played mostly by men. <br/>Except for the initial position, and for the fixed length of the board, tchadji is identical to mefuvha and moruba.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Tchadji is played in a wooden board with four rows of eight holes each. At the beginning there are 2 seeds (Caesalpinia bonduc) per hole. Each player only uses his side of the board, which consists of two rows. <br/>At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two seeds, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side. <br/>If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction, and so on. <br/>The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole. <br/>If the last seed is put into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of the opponent contains seeds, these enemy seeds are &quot;eaten&quot; (odj&aacute;). <br/>Additionally, the seeds of the outer hole directly behind it, if any, are also eaten and the contents of another (any) enemy hole. The eaten seeds of the opponent are removed from the board. <br/>When a player has only singletons (ompwech&aacute;, &quot;divided into pieces&quot;), he is permitted to move them, but only into empty holes. <br/>The winner is the one who captures all the opponent's seeds. <br/>Other data<br/>Talking about habitual players, the first move is made without counting, as they know beforehand what are the best moves. Usually the first move is made from the last but one hole in the outter row (the second from the right). On next moves players do count. <br/>According to the study made by Ismael, a game lasts a mean of 146 seconds, and 38 moves per player. The shortest (in time) recorded game lasted 62 seconds. The shortest in moves, 16. The longest, 4 minutes 39 seconds and 73 moves respectively.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The publisher provided a round board consisting of 37 circles arranged in four concentric rings and split among two colours, and two sets of checkers (12 in each colour). As in traditional Checkers, the players' goal is to capture the opponents' checkers or to force the opponent into a position in which any legal move will allow the moving piece to be captured.<br/><br/>The rules approximate traditional checkers, with only six circles in the outermost ring serving as &quot;Kinging Circles.&quot; (These are the three rings for each colour that are farthest removed on the board from the opponent's home territory.)<br/><br/>The construction of the playing area into a series of rings comprised of circles creates the necessity of several unique rules, specifically redefining &quot;forward movement&quot; (the motion of a checker toward its opponent's central kinging circle, the &quot;Rules of the Nearest Circle&quot; in movement and jumping that define which circles a checker may move to from its current position, and a &quot;Single Combination Jump&quot; which allows one checker jumping another within its ring to change directions and end in a separate ring.<br/><br/>",

Players spin the dial to kick off. After placing the ball on a square according to directions in squares one to six, the head linesman piece is placed 20 squares ahead of the ball. Each square represent &frac12; a yard with the object being to gain 10 yards or twenty squares within 4 spins. If a player should not succeed in advancing the ball 10 yards in 4 downs, the opponent takes possession of the ball. If the ball lands upon a square marked &ldquo;opponent offside&rdquo; no count of that down is taken. Should the ball land for two successive spins upon &ldquo;forward pass incomplete&quot; within a period of 4 downs the spinner is penalized 5 yards or 10 squares. The squares of the game have results in them which direct the person spinning the spinner to go to different squares on the board which might add yards or cause a fumble or score a touchdown.<br/><br/>",

The leather creaks and steel clangs as you gird yourself for war. Overhead, storm clouds gather and the lightning slams into the earth in great forking bolts all around you. A howling north wind scourers the lands clean in preparation for the final conflict that will decide the fate of the world.<br/><br/>You know in your heart that of all the battles that have come before, this will be the last, and greatest. This is Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods of men and the dark forces of the night.<br/><br/>With a wave of your massive hand you summon forth the heroes and Valkyrie that will fight at your side. The ground trembles under the footsteps of your mighty foes. There they are! On the horizon, grim giants, fell beasts, and the undead of countless battlefields approach in unending waves. Above the clatter of their weapons and armor a clear deep note pierces the sky. It is Heimdall&rsquo;s horn! He is calling forth the gods and heroes to stand fast at the rainbow Bifrost Bridge and do battle.<br/><br/>Without hesitation, you stride forward to stand at his side with your brothers and sisters. You are an Aesir, a god and defender of humanity, and this is the time of legends!<br/><br/>Game Play&hellip;<br/><br/>A few years ago, we realized that the core action-reaction card mechanic of Down In Flames would also be perfect for other interactive combat situations, but we could never think of the right setting. Finally, a couple months ago, we came up with the idea of designing a game based on the Norse gods, their foes the Jotun, and the mythical battle to end all battles, Ragnarok. In this game, we&rsquo;ve given the action-reaction system a twist in that the turn sequence is interactive, so as each attack is played, the next card played is actually a counter-attack that can inflict damage. This makes for a very intense battle system where every card can both attack and defend.<br/><br/>In this fact-paced card game, you take on the role of one of Norse mythologies greater gods such as Thor, Odin, Heimdall, or one of their Jotun enemies like Thrym, Fenrir, or Loki.<br/><br/>Once you are girded for battle, you will hack, slash, thrust, and grapple your way to victory!<br/><br/>Ragnarok is designed and packaged to be an economical social game. Instead of our normal 9&rdquo; x 12&rdquo; box, this game comes in a 4&rdquo; x 6&rdquo; box. This is an ideal game for people who would like to socialize while playing a game. Each game takes only 30 to 60 minutes, so the game play is fast and furious.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s components are designed to be language independent. The card titles are in English, but all the other game information is represented with iconic symbols and numbers.<br/><br/>Scheduled Components: <br/>110 Full color cards (63mm x 88mm)<br/>1 Full color counter sheet<br/>Rulebook (Full Color)<br/><br/>Players: 2 to 6 <br/>Play Time: 30 minutes<br/>Complexity: Low<br/><br/>",

There it even might be cheaper but the money spent is out of the game. Money used to buy at local producers could boomerang back to the players and remains in the game. At the end of the game (two to three rounds) players check whether there is more money in the region or outside (the game). If latter one happens, all players lose together.

These rules can be used selectively to tweak the game a bit, or to overhaul the entire look and feel of Olde Chess. While playing, you will learn valuable US Army tactical concepts like Relative Combat Power, Combat Resolution, Decision Points, High Payoff Targets, Fragmentary Orders, Named Areas of Interest, Priority Intelligence Requirements, Fragmentary Orders, flank and rear attacks, counter-attacks, supporting an assault by fire, and the positive effects of good Non-Commissioned officer leadership. You will have a greater appreciation for the effects of terrain, and a greater understanding of the contributions of the various Battlefield Operation Systems. The effects of Murphy&rsquo;s Laws of War will ensure that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong... and level the playing field between new and experienced players.<br/>And you don&rsquo;t have to play all the rules all the time! Negotiate with the Enemy Brigade Commander and play just the rules you want.<br/><br/>Description taken from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://s2company.com/chess/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://s2company.com/chess/</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Billy Whiskers is a spin-and-move game circa 1925. The box says it's a &quot;fascinating game&quot;.<br/><br/>Each corner or the game board is marked - Bill, Button, Nannie, or Stubbie. There is a double-armed spinner.<br/><br/>Each player selects two men of the same colour and places them in the corner to his right on the board. The aim is to get both men into the centre of the board first.<br/><br/>The player with lowest sum total on the spinner starts the game.  Each player must spin a 5 on one arm of the spinner, or a total of 5, to move. Double 5s means he can move both men.<br/><br/>A man moves out on a 5, then forward as many spaces as shown on the other arm of the spinner. Once out, the man is moved according to the numbers on one or both arms of the spinner. Certain spaces on the board allow a player to split the total of his spinner count. Exact count on both arms of the spinner is required to bring a man home.<br/><br/>Landing on an opponent means he is &quot;butted off&quot; and has to start again, while the &quot;butt-er&quot; man moves forward 20 spaces. Like Ludo, if a player manages to get both men on the same space it is called a Block and no other player can pass. There are penalty spaces on the board (miss a turn, go back). Spinning a double allows a second turn. Three consecutive doubles sends the man closest to the centre of the board home again. And there are a few other rules to apply during play.<br/><br/>",

On turn, a player would roll the dice and pick up one of the disks, attempting to MATCH the number underneath with the value of the dice roll.  The disk would then be replaced on a different spot than the one it was picked up from.  If successful, the player would move the same colored tile down one row towards the bottom and go again.  Get 3 tiles off the board to win.<br/><br/>The numbers on the disks were 4 to 10.  Rolls of 3 and 11 permitted a peek underneath any disk.  A roll of 2 would allow a match of any low numbered disk (4,5,6) and a roll of 12 allowed a match of any high numbered disk (8,9,10).<br/><br/>",

Regional powers like the Mongol empire, the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Nippon, Annam, Nanchao, and several Chinese dynasties can be depicted in the game.<br/><br/>The game uses plastic playing pieces to represent armies, fleets, temples, monuments, cities, independent kingdoms, and tribute collected from a conquered province. The map uses area movement with terrain features including the Great Wall, forests, and mountains.<br/><br/>Protector of the Empire is not intended to be a strict simulation of history but it attempts to capture the flavor of this fascinating period.<br/><br/>The game contains familiar concepts common to many strategy games and is slightly more complex than Risk or Axis &amp; Allies. However, rules which might seem quite simple can often present subtle challenges to even the most experienced wargame players.<br/><br/>",

Each rombo has twelve identical faces.<br/><br/>Start: The game starts with two White and two Black rombos joined together in a cluster.<br/><br/>Play: Each turn the current player must add a rombo of their colour to the cluster. The new rombo must exactly meet at least two faces of existing rombos. It is not allowed to form closed holes which would make the cluster hollow.<br/><br/>Aim: A player wins by splitting the visible enemy faces into two or more disjoint sets. If neither player achieves this before the pieces run out then the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

The other teams try to guess what characteristics of the wine the pouring team has chosen. Everyone discusses the wine and then teams take turns choosing cards that match what they feel will best match the pouring teams decisions. Unlike many wine games, this is not a trivia game where you are asked questions; You only need to place your marker on the game board to indicate the following questions: Where is it from? What's the grape? How old is it? How high is the alcohol? Naturally, you have to guess. Whoever guesses best gets the most points for the bottle, and you play as many bottles as there are teams.<br/><br/>This game is a blast and wines is always great!<br/><br/>",

Players take the roles of commanders of huge armies in a game that&rsquo;s never played the same way twice, even if players use the same army over and over again.<br/><br/>In Realms of War, cards represent units, commanders, magic, random events and terrain.  The key to the game is not only getting the right cards at the right time, but playing them at the right time much like a general must recognize and take advantage of his opportunities.<br/><br/>Unlike other card games that represent fantasy battles, there are no contrived effects or cutesy, gamey rules.  Realms of War plays like a real, epic battle with units, flanks and tactics.  There are no cards to collect as Realms of War is NOT a CCG; each set contains everything you need to immediately begin fighting fantasy battles.<br/><br/>One of the big attractions of this game is the free, downloadable armies from several popular fantasy genres such as D&amp;D, Warhammer, Dragonlance and coming soon - Middle Earth!<br/><br/>Available at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://biagamesonline.tripod.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://biagamesonline.tripod.com</a><br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "DOGFIGHT @ ALAM HALFA<br/>Rommel's Strike for Cairo, Sept. 1942<br/><br/>Rommel's last offensive in the desert was a compelling one. He knew his past successes were waning for a variety of reasons and that unless<br/>something changed, he would be at the end of his logistical tether. By August, 1942, he was fast approaching a turning point and he feared<br/>his luck might run out. Thus, once he secured promises of adequate fuel supplies that would be delivered by the Italian Navy and Luftwaffe,<br/>this Fox planned for a knock-out blow that some call Gazala II in strategy. A wide sweeping ride though sands of the desert during the<br/>night, a ride some 40 miles in the moonlight to rear of the British forces at Alam Halfa. Rommel chose the night to hide his movements, his<br/>intelligence indicated the mines were nil and no British forces were so far south. The Italian armor divisions, the Littorio and Ariete,<br/>with over 150 M13 tanks (its 47mm gun could knock out most of the British tanks) would help seal the flanks of the 15th and 21st Panzer<br/>Divisions (with over 100 tanks) along with the 90th Division. Rommel was banking on the British performance at Gazala, which showed when<br/>cut off, the British acted in a confused state. Once the pocket was dealt with, each panzer would strike for the Nile, Cairo and<br/>Alexandria. Besides, Hitler insisted Rommel attack.<br/><br/>Each hex is one mile.<br/>AFV units equal 8 AFV<br/>Each turn is 4 hrs.<br/><br/>",

For clever merchants it is a time of great potential. Attempt to accumulate, trade, bribe, trick and manipulate your way to becoming the richest and most influential Merchant Prince in Byzantium.<br/><br/>Summary: Players assume the role of an inspired merchant in ancient Byzantium, determined to develop a trading empire across the region of Anatolia during the upheavals of the time. Each player has a different character and special power taken from a range of different neighbouring cultures. Players buy trade goods in far off markets to sell in the bazaars of Byzantium, while doing their utmost to undermine and obstruct their rivals and avoid the various historical hazards of the time. Players use Trader markers to purchase and move goods appearing across the board, avoiding dangerous local events and rival player skulduggery. Later in the game players can attempt to secure influential government roles worth bonus victory points but require each role to be voted upon by all players so bribery and deal making is a must! The player with the largest and most influential merchant empire at game end is given the title of Merchant Prince of Byzantium.<br/><br/>",

Players own two sorts of pieces, called stones (round) and columns (square). The stones are able to move, the columns stay on their places, until a player breaks the game, then all columns of this player go to the hand of this player for new placing. A player is not allowed to break the game twice, the hostile side must break the game also. Object of the game is to form geometrical positions of four on the board, which are formed of the two sorts of pieces.

Eat with the noble knights and lead the ladies to dance&quot;, you need to collect specific sets of cards (in the case of a feast: juggler, vegetables and roast).<br/><br/>You draw cards until you can complete one of three outlying tasks, then take the task-card, adding the worth of tasks once the pile of cards has been emptied.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the current player rolls a special die (featuring the numbers 1 through 4, a plus, and a minus).  If a number is rolled, the player moves forward; pluses are re-rolled, and minuses cause a turn to be lost.  Some spaces have special actions (roll again, go back to start, etc.), while others require the player to answer a question about first aid.  If the player is unable to answer correctly, he or she must stay on the square and continue answering questions on subsequent turns until successful.  Special &quot;first aid station&quot; spaces give &quot;first aid fact&quot; cards which may be used as references when answering questions.

The first team to have all players successfully roll a 6 wins.<br/><br/>Face-Off = 2 players go head-to-head rolling one die each.  Low roller pays the high roller the difference in chips.  Ties are paid by both players into a common pot in the center.<br/><br/>Dealer's Dice = Players take turns being the &quot;dealer&quot;.  The other players put a number of fingers on the table to guess what the dealer will roll.  If you are right other players pay you their own finger-count in chips.<br/><br/>Wild Ride = A push-your-luck game where you keep rolling and add up the total of the dice for your score, but if you ever roll a six you bust and lose all your points for that turn.  A double-six loses all your points you've accumulated for the entire game.  First player to 75 points wins.<br/><br/>12 Down = Players write down the numbers 1 through 12 on paper and then take turns rolling to cover up as many numbers as possible.

        "description": "Harigana is a tile-laying word game for Japanese for 2 or more players. Tiles have hiragana syllable symbols rather than letters. The game is similar to Scrabble, but has some differences in the scoring system and some other differences to accommodate the Japanese language and the hiragana writing system.<br/><br/>The game was designed with Japanese language learners in mind, but can be played by Japanese speakers just as well. Japanese language learners should not hesitate to use a dictionary to help find words, and are advised to use an optional rule that awards bonus points if they can write kanji versions of words correctly (without looking them up, of course).<br/><br/>",

Once here, it is the Mercenary's job to rescue a Prisoner and then both Mercenary and Prisoner escape from their captors.<br/><br/>What makes the game unique is the mechanic that enables the player's pieces (a 'Mercenary' and a 'Prisoner') to move through the dungeons. To pass through passageways players must have a Skeleton Key in their possession that matches the door they are passing. Beware though, because not only must players avoid the ever present dungeon Guards, they must avoid traps that have been set within the dungeon.<br/><br/>A player's Prisoner begins the game in a locked cell, within the dungeon, that must be opened to free him. It is the Mercenary's job to assist the Prisoner in his escape attempt. The first player&rsquo;s Mercenary and Prisoner to escape from the dungeons wins the game. An escape is made when a player&rsquo;s pieces enter the Guardhouse.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guerilla - Universal Rules for Warfare by Iain Dickie, Rules by Jim Webster<br/><br/>(Webster seems to have authored the rules for actual combat, while Dickie apparently authored the rules for determining the forces and deployment.)<br/><br/>Simple miniatures rules for guerrilla warfare in a wide range of eras.  (A list of guerrilla wars going back to Scythians vs Persians in 516 B.C. is included.)<br/><br/>The forces for each side (State and Guerrilla) are determined randomly.  A d6 and a d100 is rolled for each side.  The d6 determines how many officers(state) or leaders(guerrillas) are present; the d100 result is the number of troops.  The two rolls together determine the force's mission.<br/><br/>For example, a roll of 3/13 gives the state forces one major, two captains, 3 lieutenants and 13 troops.   Their mission reads, &quot;You have captured one important guerrilla leader and must escort him, alive, from one corner of the table to the opposite for a show trial. Convoy.&quot;  A roll of 6/50 gives the guerrilla forces 6 leaders (and, as a 6 was rolled, one of them must be secretly designated the chief leader of the war) and 50 troops.  Their mission reads, &quot;Funeral of a fighter, now a martyr, being used to whip up support.  The three most senior leaders are at the graveside with both parents of the victim.  Next the enthusiastic fighters form a ring, surrounded by the reliable and unreliable fighters mixed, who are in turn surrounded by the fanatics and remaining leaders. Company.&quot;<br/><br/>The way in which troops are deployed on the board is determined by cross-indexing the mission type of each side on a table.  In the above example, the state's mission type is &quot;convoy&quot; and the guerrillas' is &quot;company,&quot; which gives &quot;deploy company first then start convoy.&quot;<br/><br/>A d10 is rolled to determine the location, which can range from &quot;Steep hill country&quot; or &quot;dense woodland&quot; to &quot;city back streets&quot; or &quot;market town, market day, very crowded.&quot;<br/><br/>",

I know little about the game except that I did see an artist's rendition of the game being played in the book &quot;SAFE RETURN DOUBTFUL - The Heroic Age of Polar Exploration&quot; written by John Maxtone-Graham. The game is about racing sleighs to the south pole and uses pencils to map out the route. From page 259 of the book. &quot;The game was played on a large circular papier-mache board, painted white and grooved with concentric ridges of miniature sastrugi   (SASTRUGI = Wind eroded snow, which often looks rough, like frozen waves. Usually found on windward slopes). Each player assumed the identity of a famous explorer and, equipped with special magnetic pencils, coaxed miniature sledges through the maze of tracks toward the central pole, False leads led to dead ends, and any player thus stymied could extricate his sled only by using a magnet of reversed polarity marked &quot;Dr. Cook&quot;&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of the game is to build a collection of the deepest oil drills. <br/>Each player will first place a bid on resources buying order. After placing the bids the resources are rolled and players in bid order can buy resources. <br/>Using the bought resources the players can deepen their oil shafts. Usually a player can only do one build action but with the help of their train workers and helpers they can have more build actions.<br/>At the end of the turn players can sell oil in order to gain money to help them build deeper shafts.<br/>At the end of the game the player with the best shafts depth combination wins. However, if a player catches a place of a possible deep shaft and does not build it as deep as possible he will get a penalty. Remember, money is just a tool in the game and not a goal!<br/><br/>",

If the Knight and Dragon of the led suit are played to the same trick, the Knight wins.<br/><br/>- There also two special cards: The Supreme and The Void Card.  They cannot be led but can be played to any trick.  The Void Card voids out its trick, so no one wins it, though the player who played it still leads the next trick.  The Supreme wins any trick it is played in unless that is not Voided.<br/><br/>- Of the 62 cards in the deck, 14 are dealt to each of the 4 players, and the remaining 6 are laid aside unseen, so people are not sure what is missing.  Players pass 3 cards, similar to Hearts (left / right / across / no pass).<br/><br/>- Each player bids once on the number of tricks they'll take (minimum 4).  The winner names trump, and gets one point per trick if he makes his bid, otherwise he subtracts his bid.  Others must take 3 tricks each for 3 points or lose 3 points if they don't; unless they bid &quot;Low&quot;, and if they take no tricks they get 6 points, or lose 6 if they fail.<br/><br/>- Winner is the first to 23 points.<br/><br/>",

Plus there is one Mardi Gras card, which counts as the highest trump; and two FATuesday cards, which can always be played and count as the lowest cards (if led, a suit is declared).  The 68 cards deal evenly with 4 players; with other numbers, leave out enough &quot;1&quot; cards so it goes evenly.<br/><br/>Each player bids the number of tricks he'll take -- the goal is to take exactly that many.  If you make your bid you get 10 points per trick (a successful bid of 0 earns 10).  If you go over, you get 1 point per trick taken; if under, you lose 10 points times your bid.  Play until a pre-assigned total, such as 200 point.<br/><br/>The advanced Challenge game has extra rules: The Mardi Gras card can be declared when played as the highest or lowest trump; when led, each player must play their highest trump in hand.  Bids are in secret, written down and revealed simultaneously.  A Nil bid goes for 0 tricks and earns or loses 50 points.  Finally, after the bids each player has a chance to double their own bid, to double the points at stake, except you also lose if you go over your bid.<br/><br/>",

(They are in opposite corners, but in each corner you see one letter, its value, and the letter in the opposite corner.)  Of the 105 cards, 8 of them have a are wild cards in one corner, and four are wild on both ends.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 8 cards, and the top card of the draw pile is used to start the discard pile.  In a turn, a player makes a word starting with either letter of the top discard, and using cards from his hand for the rest.  The letters' values -- ranging from 2 to 20 -- are added for the word's score, which is added to the player's total.  The word is then discarded, the player fills out their hand back to 8 from the draw pile, and the next player takes a turn, using the new top discard to start a word.<br/><br/>Players pass if they cannot make a word from their hand.  The game ends when every player passes in turn, typically after the draw pile is exhausted.  The lower value of each card in hand is subtracted from the players' scores, and the highest total wins.  Optional rules allow bonus points for long words.<br/><br/>",

Over 650 individually rated players representing all 30 teams are yours to command.<br/><br/>Fast Action Hockey plays quickly because it focuses on the &quot;fun stuff&quot;--shooting and scoring--while eliminating time-consuming elements that add little or nothing to the excitement such as face-offs, puck passing, penalties, line changes, time-clock tracking, etc. What makes FAH even better is the ease and quickness of play. You won&rsquo;t have to spend an hour or two playing a single game. Instead, once you are familiar with the play sequence and the charts, you can play a game in 20 minutes or less, and easily replay the entire Stanley Cup finals in one evening!<br/><br/>Basic Sequence of Play<br/><br/>There are three phases to FAH:<br/><br/>1) Select 18 players and 1 goaltender from each team and list them on the score sheet.<br/><br/>2) Determine the number of shots each player will take during the game and write down in the &quot;SOG&quot; column of the scoresheet.  To do this, check for the player&rsquo;s shots grade (&quot;Sh&quot; on the roster sheet), roll all 3 dice and consult the &quot;Player Shots&quot; chart.<br/><br/>3) Resolve the shots for each player (i.e., determine the outcome of each player&rsquo;s shots on goal.) and assign assists (the number of assists for each goal is indicated on the goal scoring chart).<br/><br/>Fast Action Hockey will produce lifelike statistical performances over the course of an entire replay season when playing schedules similar to the actual.<br/><br/>(Game was marketed on a limited scale in 2001 only, and sold primarily through Ebay).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game's deck has 60 cards, in 5 colored suits: black is all vowels, while red, blue, yellow and green have one 'E' and the rest consonants.  In most of the games, black is considered wild, belonging to any color.  There four games described.<br/><br/>Al Pha Bet: All are dealt 7 cards.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, lays down a word or passes, and discards down to 7 if needed.  Each word scores 5 per black vowel (there must be at least 1 per word), plus 1 per colored letter if there are at least 2 of them and they're all the same color; all doubled if the word is a palindrome (spelling another word backwards).  Game ends after the draw pile's gone and all pass; highest total wins.<br/><br/>Alpha: Deal 7 face up to each player.  In a turn, a player draws 1 and makes a word or passes and discards down to 7.  If a word is played, each other player in turn gets a chance to add cards from their hand to the played word to make a different word, without changing the order.  The last to add to the word wins it.  Words score 1 per letter, doubled if monochrome, doubled if a palindrome.<br/><br/>Beta: A solitaire game.  Deal 6 cards out in a line, starting 6 columns.  You may move individual cards to the top of bottom of another column, removing words as completed.  When done moving, deal another card to the bottom of each column (or empty slot if a column is empty).  Continue until the deck is gone, trying to eliminate the whole deck.<br/><br/>Capa: A bridge-like partnership trick-taking game.  Players first bid the number of words to make, along with a color (not black).  Highest bid gets his color as trump, and his partner is dummy.  Player to his left leads first.  All plays must follow suit if possible, unless black is led.  If a word is made in the color led, the leader wins the trick; if a word is made in a different color or multiple colors, the one who added the last card to it wins; if no word is made the leader wins.  If the contractors get as many words as bid, they score for all words won, else the opponents score for all the words they won; words are scored as in Alpha.<br/><br/>",

Rules for several games are included:<br/><br/>Poker-WhizORD: Like draw poker with 7 cards and one draw per hand.  The player with the highest-scoring words adds it to his total.  Alternate rules add chips and betting typical to poker, with up to 3 rounds of betting.<br/><br/>Soli-WhizORD: A solitaire game.  Player deals himself 10 hands as if in Poker-WhizORD -- including one draw -- and scores their best word.  The goal is 300 points.<br/><br/>Rummy-WhizORD: Players have 7-card hands, and in each turn they play and score a word or pass and discard any number of cards; then they draw back up to 7.  Winner is the first to an agreed total.<br/><br/>Thirty-WhizORD: Players start with 7-card hands, and in their turn draw 1 and discard 1.  The first player with a 30-point word in hand calls &quot;Thirty!&quot;, lays it down and wins the hand.  Play to an agreed number of hands or wins.<br/><br/>Hangman-WhizORD: Players each think of a word with the same number of letters, and pick their letters out of the deck, laying them out face down in the opponent's reading order.  Take turns guessing letters, correct guesses being revealed, incorrect guesses being noted to avoid repeats.  You may guess the word but if guessed wrong you lose; otherwise the first one to expose all the opponent's letters wins.<br/><br/>Match'Em-WhizORD: 12 or more matching pairs of letters are pulled from the deck, suffled and laid out on the table.  Players reveal 2 cards in their turn, keeping matches, as in Concentration/Pelmanism.<br/><br/>Precitd-WhizORD: One card is revealed.  Each player reveals another card in turn, but first predicts whether their card will precede or follow the first card.  The player who predicted correctly, and has the letter closest to the first letter, captures all the cards; no one wins if a tie or a card matches the first one.  At the end of the deck, the most cards captured wins.<br/><br/>",

(There is an elephant on the back of each card, and a donkey on the front of the jokers.)  An extra deck is recommended if more than 3 play.<br/><br/>Players are dealt 10 cards, and the top of the draw is turned over to start the discard pile.  In a turn a player draw one from either pile and discards one.  If they think they have a winning hand they &quot;call a vote&quot;, and everyone lays down their hands to score.  The player with the highest-scoring hand adds its points, plus a 10-point bonus, to their total.  Play to 150 points for the win.<br/><br/>One or more words can be formed from the hand when scoring, but the points favor longer words.  Each word scores the &quot;triangle number&quot; of the number of letters it contains: <br/>1 - 1<br/>2 - 3<br/>3 - 6<br/>4 - 10<br/>5 - 15<br/>6 - 21<br/>7 - 28<br/>8 - 36<br/>9 - 45<br/>10 - 55<br/><br/>There are several possible bonuses: a player who can use all his hand to spell words may &quot;vote his hand&quot; (similar to going Gin), automatically winning the hand and getting a 20-point bonus.

        "description": "From the box...<br/><br/>The Adult Jigsaw Grossword Puzzle Game<br/><br/>WUPS! is a game wherein some words of Anglo Saxon origin may be formed which are considered slang or vulgarisms.  While it is the object of the game not to form such words, it frequently happens.  These words may refer to body parts or body functions.<br/><br/>The game comprises a box containing a shelf with a round hole in it and a 36-piece jigsaw puzzle.  The jigsaw puzzle has sixty four letter words on it in a crossword puzzle grid.  Some of the words are repeats.  The same sixty words are on each side of the puzzle and the puzzle is cut so that the words are divided in half.  Many of the edge pieces may be interchanged and all of the interior pieces are interchangeable. The corner pieces are unique.  As players take turns reassembling the puzzle with pieces chosen at random, some embarrassing words may be formed.  The winner is the player who makes the fewest &quot;naughty&quot; words.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A very early word card game.  Its deck has 36 cards, all with letters except for two Blockade Cards, which just take up space in the hand without being usable.  It also includes cardboard chits labeled &quot;5 Points&quot; or &quot;10 Points&quot;; some editions include a pocket dictionary.  The rules describe five games:<br/><br/>Original Bild-A-Word: 5 cards each are dealt.  In the first round, each player in turn lays 1-2 words of 2+ letters on the table, or adds letters to an existing word (rearranging if needed) to make a new word, or passes.  From then on, a turn starts by drawing 1 card and ends with discarding 1 card; if the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discards to restock it.  The hand ends when a player empties his hand, and he scores 5 points per cards held in others' hands -- the point chits are used to keep score.  250 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Bild-A-Word Triplets: Like the Original game, except that after the deal, 3 cards are placed in separate rows on the table.  Players may not start new words, but only try to add to the existing rows to make new words.  Letters may be rearranged within a row but not moved between rows.<br/><br/>Bild-A-Word Marathon:  8 cards are dealt to the table.  In each turn, a player makes a word out of any 2 or more letters on the table.  They may not repeat previous words, and have only 1 minute per turn.  When a player is stumped they are out; the winner is the last player to come up with a word.<br/><br/>Bild-A-Word Wits: Like 5 card draw poker with words.  Players start with 100 points worth of Point chits, and win on getting 300 points worth.  Hands are ranked by the length of the words in them: 5 letters; 4; 3&amp;2; 3; 2&amp;2; 2.  Ties are broken by the letters earliest in the alphabet.<br/><br/>Bild-A-Word Quinto: Like gin rummy.  Players start with 5 cards, and in a turn draw 1 and discard 1.  The first to make a 5-letter word from his hand calls &quot;Quinto&quot; and lays his hand down.  All other players lay down their hands and make the longest word they can; the winner gets 5 point for each unused card.  Game is 250.<br/><br/>",

[The rules were in German, but I believe I have the gist of it.]<br/><br/>The game is for two players or teams.  There are 2 decks of 60 cards, one red and one blue.  Each has 45 letters and 15 blocks -- which show a checkerboard but stand for the filled-in squares between the words in an actual crossword puzzle.<br/><br/>Each side shuffles their letter cards and draws a hand of 10 cards.  The first player lays out a word from their hand horizontally, places a block card at either end of the word, and draws back up to 10.  The opponent then places a word vertically, using one of the existing letters as part of it, also capping its end with block cards.  Play continues in this manner, one side doing horizontal words, the other vertical, forming a typical crossword.  Only one word can be done per turn.  A word may be lengthened instead, the block being removed and replaced at the end of the longer word.  If a player cannot play he passes.<br/><br/>The game ends when a side runs out of cards, or neither side can make a new word.  The winner is the one with the most cards played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A word card game, whose deck has 85 cards, each with a letter and its value.<br/><br/>In the basic game, a player's turn consists of turning over 3 letters face up in order, and naming as many words as they can that contain those 3 letters in that order.  Example: with PAT, you could name sPAT, PArT, sePAraTe, etc.  Then the score is the sum of the cards' values time the number of words stated.  There is a maximum of 5 words, and a time limit is recommended for the turns.  If the player thinks no word is possible he declares a Stymie, and if no one else can think of a word he gets 100 points; if someone can, she gets 50 points while the declarer loses 50.  After the deck runs out, highest total wins.<br/><br/>There are several variations:<br/><br/>1. Juniors - For younger players, use 2 cards instead.<br/><br/>2. Sliders - use 2 cards, and only 5-letter words with both letters adjacent are allowed, one each of XXxxx, xXXxx, xxXXx, and xxxXX.<br/><br/>3. Twos - Use 2 cards, and think of any number of words (up to ten), of any length, with both letters adjacent.<br/><br/>4. Famous Names - Use 2 cards, and try to think of a famous name with those initials.<br/><br/>5. Initials - Use 2 cards, and think of a phrase, or two related words, the begin with those two letters.  (E.g., with MD, Medical Doctor.)<br/><br/>6. Solitaire - use 3 cards, and find only 1 word per triple; try to find one for each triple dealt.<br/><br/>7. Charades - Use 2 cards, and act out a phrase starting with those two letters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a quasi-word game that is unique in several aspects: the words used are personal names; the cards stand only for vowels; everyone is working on the same word at once.<br/><br/>It has a 52-card deck, each of which has a vowel (AEIOU) or semi-vowel (WY), a number value, and a list of names that use that vowel.  The 52nd card, though, is a Substitute card which can stand for any vowel.<br/><br/>Seven cards are dealt to each player.  On his turn a player declares and spells a personal name, and then everyone must discard the vowels in that name.  For example, if he says &quot;Andrew&quot;, everyone in turn must discard an A card, then each must discard an E, then each must discard a W.  Any player who cannot discard the current letter must draw from the draw pile, and discard it if it's the right letter, or keep it if not.  The discard pile is reshuffled to replenish the draw pile, if needed.<br/><br/>A player goes out on playing his last card in hand, except that the caller cannot go out until the name he called is finished.  When a hand is over, each player scores the sum of the cards still in hand.  Play until someone reaches an agreed total, at which point the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>",

A connection game, where you race to build you worm up to 5 squares long.<br/><br/>2. Cross Word: Each card has a letter, which you may play on any space, occupied or not.  If you complete a word across or down, you get 1 point; if you complete a word in both directions, you get 3 points.  Most points when the deck runs out wins.<br/><br/>3.

Each ADVENTURE GAME STARTER SET contains ten paintable plastic action figures in the standard 25mm size, a set of non-toxic water-based paints with instructions and brush, and a complete set of fast, playable rules for playing out your own fantasy adventures.  Even the gaming die is included. (For two or more players, ages 10 and up).&quot;<br/><br/>Each contains two leaflets, one containing the rules and adventure; the other, a painting guide for the miniatures.  Though each game has a unique background story and series of encounters, the rules of play are identical.  On the last page of the rules leaflet is a promotion for Heritage's soon-to-be-released (at that time) RPG, Swordbearer.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of running two characters through a series of four encounters (combats).  Each side in a combat takes turns.  During a turn, all characters on the active side fight, then all characters on the active side may use magic, pick up or throw things, or run away.<br/><br/>Fighting is resolved by cross-indexing the roll of a six-sided die with the letter code of the attacker's weapon (A, B, C or D) on a table corresponding to the defender's armor (which may be light, medium, or heavy) in order to find how much damage, if any, was done to the defender.<br/><br/>The miniatures aren't necessary to play, and aren't even mentioned in the game rules.<br/><br/>",

The rules are extremely flexible as to the types of miniatures used, i.e. superhero action figures can compete against medieval fantasy figures. Most rules are designed around the size of the miniature figure - for example, figures can move 3x their standing base length in a turn. Combat rules are resolved around a simple rock-paper-scissors method for hand-to-hand combat and shooting rubber bands or rolling balls for ranged combat.<br/><br/>Throughout the rulebook are reminders that this is a wargame for young children so it is appropriate to let them reshoot misfired shots or make forgotten movements. The goal of the game is to have fun with your children - not slaughter them with your superior gaming skills.<br/><br/>",

They also have to manage the ship's power, which must be allocated each turn to various systems.<br/><br/>At the start of the game the monster player gets to allocate points to various areas: strength, movement, concealment, life level, and defense against each possible kind of attack - which is why the crew player does not know how effective a weapon is until they try it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designers' notes:<br/><br/>&quot;Panzertaktik is a platoon level game covering the major powers in the ETO/MTO between 1939-45. It takes the hardware approach to design, allowing players to make the best (or worst) of the best situations: unlimited intelligence, tireless troops, everlasting ammunition and fuel.&quot;<br/><br/>Panzertaktik is a fairly detailed game. Many units (generally representing 5 or so vehicles) have primary and secondary weapons, with separate classifications, strengths and ranges for each. There are rules for artillery, air power, night fighting, minefields, and specialized tanks (Rhinos, flail tanks, etc.), among other things.<br/><br/>Tables of organization and equipment are provided for the American, British, French, Soviet, German, and Italian forces for 1939-45.<br/><br/>",

Still it took three more centuries to conquer the remaining kingdom of Granada, but from this battle onwards the Muslim armies weren't in position to defeat the christian kingdoms any longer.<br/><br/>On one side were the Almohades with their Califfa and his army and his famous bodyguard of chained slaves. On the other were the Kings of Castilla and Navarra with their armies. Sancho &quot;el Fuerte&quot;, King of Navarra, himself cut with his sword the slaves chain in order to reach the Califfa's tent. Still nowadays Navarra's shield is a set of chains on a red field remaining this fact of arms.<br/><br/>It was the first modern wargame ever published in Spain by the Spanish company NAC. It's print run was minimum, and it's impossible to find even a picture of it.<br/><br/>The game system could be considered &quot;classic NAC&quot; hex-and-counters with combat and movement factors and a dice with no 1 or 6 instead two 3 and two 4. You multiply the dice by the combat factors involved in each side and eliminate the looser side. All other wargames published by NAC in the following year used this system just changing the pictures.<br/><br/>Fue el primer wargame publicado por NAC, lo tuve en mis manos a los nueve a&ntilde;os, pero me compr&eacute; un Colditz, cuando volv&iacute; ya no estaba.<br/><br/>Si alguien lo tiene por favor haga algunas fotos y las cuelgue aqui.<br/><br/>Siempre lo busqu&eacute; y nunca lo encontr&eacute; por eso dise&ntilde;&eacute; mi juego sobre esta batalla<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Twilight City: Dark Mysteries is a game of investigation and lovecraftian Mythology. Each player represents an investigator that was summon to the city in order to uncover a mystery. Each mystery is a game in itself for there is a set of original events that describe something that is happening as well as an original background different from the other stories. This is a game of story telling as well, because beyond the generic encounter the investigators will  be able to interact with the system in several ways: bribing, buying, paying, taking buses, walking, fighting, healing. Also there is the mechanic of Day and Night that make the encounters relevant both in information and in danger.<br/><br/>All the stories will be written so they lead to a thrilling conclusion and each event will have as much atmosphere as possible. Players will feel as their investigator is wounded and need to move to the hospital, or if they need to reach to someplace at a specific time of the day to retrieve some information. Still finishing a story won't mean to render that story useless. Since the puzzle the investigators have to complete is random, the replayability is unlimited.<br/><br/>The nights in the Twilight City are very dangerous but there is no time to waste for the evil forces are always plotting for the doomsday and if you take too much time you will certainly fail.<br/><br/>The board has generic places that will be referred in the events with their own names. For example: &quot;Go to the abandoned &quot;WAREHOUSE&quot; and meet Herb &quot;The Rat&quot; at 5 o'clock (AFTERNOON). He knows what's going on in the house of the terrible old man (OLD HOUSE)&quot;. This way you know you have to go to the WAREHOUSE at any time in the AFTERNOON. But you won't find Herb &quot;The Rat&quot; at any other time. So time is essential to the plot. And the board serves to shape a new city with every dark mystery.<br/><br/>",

On the back is the letter or number, on the front the same with an illustration (e.g. Z &quot;zebra&quot; with a picture of a zebra; or &quot;5 balls&quot; with a picture).<br/><br/>Simple games include:<br/><br/>- Simple Spelling Game.  Spread out the letter cards, and pick out the first and last letter of a common word, e.g. C-T.  Let the child figure out what goes in between, with help if necessary.<br/><br/>- Easy Counting.  Have the child count the items out loud on the illustrated side, or have two numbers and have them figure out what the sum is.<br/><br/>Some editions have rules for advanced games:<br/><br/>- A.B.C. Rummy.  Deal 7 cards to each player.  In a turn, draw 1, lay down 3 or more consecutive letters or numbers and/or add to existing sequences, and discard 1.  First one out cards wins 5 points per card in others' hands.<br/><br/>- A.B.C. Kasino.  Deal 4 to each player and 4 face up in the middle.  In a turn a player plays a card to the table, capturing other cards if adjacent to them, or leaving it there if unable to capture.  After the cards are played out, deal 4 more each, etc., until all cards are played.  Remaining cards go to the last capturer.  Most cards captured wins.<br/><br/>- Snip &amp; Snap.  Deal the deck to 2 players, who take turns exposing the top card in their pile.  They &quot;Snip&quot; each time, unless the card is adjacent to the opponent's last card, when he says &quot;Snap&quot; and captures his whole face-up pile.  Continue until someone has all the cards.<br/><br/>",

Penalties include: +10 points for not going out; +10 for each unused vowel, or Vowel or Consonant card; +5 for each unused consonant, except for J, K, X, Z which are +1.

Galaxias takes the basic principles of classic war games and modernizes them to fit the 20th century.&quot; <br/>Essentially 'Risk in Space': countries have become planets, continents are now galaxies, armies are squadrons. Controlling an entire galaxy entitles you to extra squadrons on your turn. Conquering a planet nets you a card with one of three symbols: A space shuttle, a ring-type space station, or a spaceship similar to the one from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Turning in a set of three gives you more squadrons. The squadrons are triangular craft beads that can be stacked.<br/>There are also 2 'Black Hole' cards, 1 'Death Ray', and 1 'Laser Shield'.<br/>Instead of a folding board, the universe is represented by a roll-up mat, which is stored in a cardboard tube, along with the cards and squadrons.<br/>There are four dice total: two each of two colors.<br/>The game was designed and manufactured in Tulsa, Oklahoma.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Octaquad is a print and play space combat game.  The game is fairly simple to learn and involves some rather unique rules.  The board itself is essentially made from the space ships.  Normal rules allow for 1 player per ship, but the players can mix and match however they want.<br/><br/>Each ship is an octagon-shaped tile, and each tile must always be touching the rest of the tiles.  Players can perform special tricks to position themselves in different places on the board, but these tricks can fail to succeed.  Positioning, facing, planning, and luck are all part of the game.<br/><br/>The basic rules right now are just for normal ship-to-ship combat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The deck is modeled after the traditional card deck: there are 52 cards, with the suit and rank in the corner, along with a letter and the letter's value (1 to 15, rarer letters higher).  There are also 2 &quot;Intelex&quot; cards which act as jokers/wild cards.  Rules for 4 games are included:<br/><br/>Word Rummy: Deal 10 each for 2 players, 7 each for 3-4, 6 each for 5-6.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, lays down words, adds letters to others' words, and discards 1.  The player who goes out scores the total of the letters' values in front of him; the others subtract the values of letters still in hand.<br/><br/>Discovery: Hangman for 4 players.  Deal out the whole deck (without the Intelex cards).  Each player makes a word out of his cards and lays them face down in a row, with his word spelled in order among them.  In a turn, a player repeatedly asks 1 other player if they have a specific letter; if they do, they expose all copies of that letter they have.  The turn ends when a request fails.  During a turn one may also guess what a word is: if wrong, he loses 5 point; if right, he gets the word's score and the guess-ee is out for the hand, which ends when all words are discovered.  One may bluff and have no word; if that is correctly the guesser gets 20 points.<br/><br/>Solitaire: Like Klondike.  Deal out 7 stacks of cards, of heights 1, 2 ... 7, the top card of each face up.  Move cards around to form words and word fragments, removing words as they are formed, exposing face-down cards as revealed, filling blank spots with letters or fragments.  Then go through the deck 3 cards at a time, combining letters as before.  The goal is to use up the whole deck.<br/><br/>Poker: For 2 to 7.  Deal 5 per player.  Each in turn may exchange any or all of their cards for an equal number from the deck, and make their best word.  Highest-scoring word wins.  (Betting and bluffing are mentioned as on option &quot;for added excitement&quot;.)<br/><br/>",

No more than 4 cards can be played in a turn, and all cards played must be in the same row or column, forming a typical crossword pattern, so all adjacent letters form a word.  The hand ends when a player empties his hand, and all others add the values of their remaining cards to their total.  Game ends when someone reaches 100 points, and the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>Speed Game: Like Cross Words, except that a 4- or 5-letter word is place on the table to start, and there are no turns: when the signal is given, players add words to the array, or discard and draw, when they wish.<br/><br/>Solitaire 1: Make 12 piles of 3, all face up and fanned to see the lower cards.  Discard cards by forming words from the top cards of the piles -- but you can use a lower card if the card(s) above it are also used in the same word.  When you've done all you can, take the remaining cards and turn them up in 3s, using them to make more words with the rest.  You can go through the deck as often as you want.  You win if you use all the cards.<br/><br/>Solitaire 2: Deal out 6 cards face up, and expose the top card of the remaining deck.  Make words out of the cards, discarding them when made, and fill in empty slots from the deck.  You lose if you get stuck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is one of many competing crossword card games of the late 1930s.  Fairchild had two versions: Lingo used bridge-size cards, and Patch Word had small cards to more easily fit on the table.  The deck has 54 cards consisting of 2 jokers and 52 letter cards.<br/><br/>The rules for the Cross Word game: Deal 11 each for 2-3 players, 9  for 4-5, 7 for 6 or more.  Each player lays down a word in their turn, using no more than 4 cards, and adding to the growing crossword arrangement.  If they cannot play a word, they discard 1 and draw 1 from the draw or discard pile.  The hand ends when a player goes out of cards, and players add the values of their cards in hand to their total; commoner cards have higher values.  When a player reaches 100 total points, the low score wins.<br/><br/>The Lingo version had rules for 3 other games:<br/><br/>Lingo-Anagram: For 2-4 players.  Deal 10 each.  In a turn, a player either lays down a word of 3+ letters, or adds letters to an existing word to make new words, or does neither; the turn ends by discarding 1 and drawing 1 card.  Adding simple endings (-S, -ES, -ED) is prohibited.  The hand ends and the game scored as in the cross word game.<br/><br/>Scrambled-Lingo: Have all agree on a length of word to make.  Spread all the cards on the table, and players draw that number of cards for a particular word.  Then they scramble its order and pass it to the left.  Players announce when they have unscrambled the word and lay it down.  The order of correct unscrambling is the order of winning.<br/><br/>Lingo-Solitaire: Take the cards that make your full name, or a short phrase.  See how many ways you can rearrange all the letters to make a phrase that makes sense.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A crossword card game of the late 1930s, that also includes rules for several other games, a few of which were not seen in its competitors. The deck has 54 cards: 2 &quot;Sub&quot; cards which act as wild cards, and 52 cards with a letter and its value on each. Rules for 8 games are included:<br/><br/>1. Crossword Game: Deal 10 each to 2-4, 7 each to 5-7 players.  In each turn, a player lays a word from his hand to the table in a crossword fashion, the first word alone, other words intersecting the growing array.  If unable to play, a player discards 1 and draws 1 from the draw or discard pile. A hand ends when a player goes out; players add their hands' value to their scores; when a player reaches 100 the low total wins.<br/><br/>2. Word Solitaire: Lay all the cards face up in 3s, fanned so as to see all the letters.  Make and discard words from the topmost cards, though if a card is used in a word the letter just underneath it can also be used.  You win if you use all the cards.<br/><br/>3. Letter Patience: Like Klondike, deal 7 piles of heights 1-7, and turn up the top card of each.  Make and discard cards, exposing the new tops of each pile; empty spaces may be filled in with vowels.  Turn up the remainder of the deck one by one, and use the top letter of this pile with the others to make words.  You win if you use all the cards.<br/><br/>4. Crossword Solitaire A: Deal out 6 cards face up.  Use these cards to build a crossword array, one word at a time, filling empty spaces in the 6 from the remaining deck.  Then turn up that deck one at a time and continue -- you can only use the top of the turn-up pile.<br/><br/>5. Crossword Solitaire B: Similar to A, but start with a hand of 12 cards, which is not replenished; the deck is still gone through once, one card at a time.<br/><br/>6.  Anagrams: For 1-6 players.  Everyone is dealt one card.  In a turn, a player either: places his card in the center of the table; makes a word with that card and other cards in the center, placing the word in front of him; or adds the letter to an existing word, rearranging letters to make a new word, and taking the word if it belonged to someone else.  After the deck has been gone through, the player with the most points in front of him wins.<br/><br/>7.  The O-U-T Game: For 4-8 players.  All the cards are dealt face up.  In a turn a player places one card in the middle of the table, while thinking of a word of at least 9 letters that starts with all the letters placed so far.  Once such a word is finished, the player who does it gets a letter (O, U or T), the word is discarded and the process starts again.  On getting all of OUT, a player is out of the game.  A player may pass if they think they don't have a letter to add to the growing word; if someone else points out a letter and word he could do, he earns an E for excellence, which can cancel out one other letter.  Players may challenge a play that doesn't seem to lead to any word; whoever is wrong earns a penalty letter.<br/><br/>8. Guess-O-Gram: A type of hangman for any number of players.  One becomes the Thinker, thinks of a word, and lays it face down in order.  Other take turns guessing letters; if a letter is in the word it is revealed and the guesser earns 2 points per letter.  A player who guess the whole word or the last letter gets 2 points times the length of the word.  Play to an agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>",

Player one places one in front of them, and rolls the die. The die roll tells them which letter will be in play this game. 1 = top letter, 2 = second letter down, and so on. (Optional: Place a coin or token next to this letter to mark it, or write it on your paper.)<br/><br/>Player one sets the second tile down to the left of the first. They roll the die again, and the letter from the second tile is chosen as with the first. Player one then takes the second tile and overlaps the first, so that the two active letters are side by side.<br/><br/>Player two determines their active letters the same way. The timer is started, and players list as many words as possible that start with the left letter and end with the right.<br/><br/>When time runs out, the player with more words scores the difference in the number of words between the two players.<br/><br/>If player one makes 10 words and player two makes 7, player one scores 3 points.<br/><br/>For the next round, each player must rotate a tile, change the order of the tiles, or perform any combination of the two.<br/><br/>First player to 20 points wins.<br/><br/>To increase the intensity, increase the required number of letters per word to 4, 5, or 6.<br/><br/>Created by indigopotter for Reprint's contest, February 2009.<br/><br/>",

They can touch, or not touch, opponent piece in any manner as long as there are no overlaps.<br/><br/>One player gets the two L pieces, the other the T and the S. Again, like in Blokus, players start from opposite corners. However, unlike Blokus, once a player has placed his two pieces down, he will replace the piece that was not the one last played. The replaced piece must be moved into a different position.<br/><br/>Scoring occurs as follows. For every square of any opponent piece that the newly replaced piece touches, the player scores one point. (For example, if the green player just played the T, he scores two points.)<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has reached 40 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A traditional game played the Pequot Indians of North America.  Each player starts with 5 scoring sticks and tosses five sticks or rocks in a bowl.  If all five land with a colored side up a player wins 2 points.  If three pieces land with colored side up, a player wins 1 point.  Any other combination yields no points.  If you win any points, you get to go again. If you don't win points, play passes to the other player.  For every point lost, you must give the other player 1 scoring stick.  The game ends when one player has no sticks left.  During play it is traditional to shout &quot;Hubbub&quot; out-loud.  This is where the name of the game derives from.<br/><br/>This game is similar to All-tes-teg-enuk<br/><br/><br/>The American Heritage Dictionary possibly attributes the origin of the word hubbub to this game. Quote:<br/><br/>It has often been remarked that the early Celtic inhabitants of Britain contributed very little to the stock of English words. Perhaps this should not surprise us, given the difficult relations over the centuries between the people of Germanic stock and the people of Celtic stock in England and Ireland. It seems likely that a certain English contempt resides in the adoption of the word hubbub from a Celtic source, which is probably related to ub ub ubub, a Scots Gaelic interjection expressing contempt, or to abu, an ancient Irish war cry. In any case, hubbub was first recorded (1555) in the phrase Irish hubbub and meant &quot;the confused shouting of a crowd.&quot; In addition to the senses it has developed, hubbub was again used, possibly in an unflattering way, by the New England colonists as a term for a rambunctious game played by Native Americans.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A crossword card game from the late 1930s during a craze of such games, published by a newspaper company.  Its games are a slight twist on the usual rules of its rivals.<br/><br/>There are 54 cards in the deck.  52 of them have a letter and a value from 10 to 50 (the Q card actually has two letters, QU); there are also 2 jokers (wild cards) worth 100.<br/><br/>The rules to 6 games are given:<br/><br/>Cross-O-Grams: For 2+ players (but if 4 or more, 2 decks are recommended).  Deal 12 each.  In a turn a player either makes a word on the table from his hand, or draws one and passes; if his hand only X, Y or Z he may discard one of those before drawing.  Words are at least 2 letters long, and after the first word, new words must intersect or extend previous words, crossword fashion.  A hand ends when a player goes out or the draw pile runs out.  The value of the cards in hand goes to the winner of the round, and the highest total wins after an agred time; or, players get their own totals in hand at the end of a round, and when one player reaches 500, the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>An-O-Grams: For 2-8 players, but use 2 decks for 4+ players. Deal 12 each.  In a turn, a player: plays a word of 3+ letters to the table in front of him; or adds 1+ letters to a word on the table to make it a new word (without changing the letters' order), taking the word to himself; or draws 1 card and passes.  Simple endings (-S, -ED, -ER) are forbidden.  The round ends when a player goes out or the deck runs out.  Each player scores the points in front of him minus the points in hand; a player who goes out before the deck runs out doubles his table points.<br/><br/>Casino-Grams: For 2-4 players.  Take out the jokers and deal 4 to each player and 4 face-up to the table.  In a turn a player plays one of his cards to the table and does one of the following: A) makes a word with it and other table cards, placing the word in front of him; B) builds toward a future word, combining 1 card with table cards, announcing the letter(s) he has that will be played later; C) steals a word from someone else by adding a letter to it and making a new word; D) leaves it on the table with the other table cards.  After the cards are played, 4 more are dealt to each player (but no more to the table), and play continues.  After all the cards are played, the one who made or stole the last word gets the remaining table cards.  Each player gets 1 point per card he has on the table; the game is won on reaching 100.<br/><br/>Cross-O-Gram Solitaire: Like Klondike, 7 piles are dealt out of height 1-7 cards, the top one exposed.  Combine the visible cards to build words into a crossword array.  When stuck, start turning the remaining deck 3 at a time and use those cards to continue.  (Or, do it 1 at a time, going through the deck only once.)  You win if you use up the whole deck.<br/><br/>Cross-O-Gram Double Solitaire: The solitaire above played with 2 players, with decks of different colored backs.  Take turns playing until you can play to the table.  The game ends when neither can add anything to the crossword, and the one with the most cards out wins.<br/><br/>Canister Solitaire: Deal the whole deck into 8 columns face-up, fanned vertically so you can see what's coming.

        "description": "This was Milton Bradley's entry in the crossword card game craze of the late 1930's.  The deck has 60 cards, 2 of them Keystone cards which act as wild cards, and the rest having 1 letter and an associated value.  The rules describe three games:<br/><br/>1.  Crossword Card Game: For 2-7 players; deal 10 each for 2-4, 7 each for 5-7.  In a turn a player plays up to 4 cards to make a word (of 2+ letters) on the table.  The first word is alone, but all later words must intersect a previous word, crossword fashion.  If unable to make or extend a word, a player discards 1 card and draws 1 from the draw or discard pile.  The hand ends when a player goes out of cards; the rest add the sum of values in their hand to their running total.  When someone's total reaches 100, the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>2.  Solitaire Lettergrams:  Deal 6 cards face up, and place the rest in a pile, with the top card exposed.  Make and discard words from the face-up cards, filling in blanks from the deck.  You win if you use up all the cards.<br/><br/>3.  Lettergram Anagrams:  Spread the cards loosely on the table, face down.  In a turn, a player: draws cards (3 their first turn 2 thereafter), and either lays down a word (2+ letters), lays down a word fragment, or adds letters to a fragment, or adds letters to an existing word to make a new word.  When a player lays down a 2-letter word fragment he says what word he is aiming to make; any player may complete it.  Words that are completed or extended are placed in front of the player who did it, even if it was in front of someone else.  When all cards have been played, the player with the most words wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Mexican War is a simple, card-driven game of the war between Mexico and the United States that was fought from 1846 to 1848. It is a two-player game in which one player plays the military forces of the United States, and the other plays the forces of Mexico. The U.S. player attempts to conquer Mexican territory and to compel Mexico to surrender, while the Mexican player attempts to avoid this outcome long enough for public war-weariness and regional divisions to compel the U.S. withdraw.<br/><br/><br/>Prominent military leaders, army strength points, U.S. naval forces, and political concerns and conditions are all represented. Historically, although many contemporary foreign observers thought that Mexico had the advantage, the war was one of the most one-sided victories in U.S. military history. This game allows players not only to explore what conditions contributed to this outcome, but also whether the Mexicans might have been able to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Played on an authentic 19th-century map of Mexico, Mexican War includes both introductory and standard rules. Based on the rules system of the popular introductory game We The People, it is ideal for introducing youngsters and new players to the hobby, yet substantial enough to attract the veteran gamer. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).<br/><br/>",

Each auto move may result in additional auto moves, hence each player move will usually result in multiple tile placements.<br/><br/>Aim: A player wins by completing a region of their colour more complex than a circle.

        "description": "Empires of Iron is a game of diplomacy, war and intrigue set during the period of roughly 1871-1918. Two to eight players compete to create alliances, develop the latest weapons, and become master of Europe. There are multiple paths to victory - military, economic, diplomatic, or any combination thereof... which will you pursue? But beware, enemies can become friends in the blink of an eye, and allies can turn on you without warning. Nothing can be taken for granted, and anything can happen.<br/> Played on a map Europe at the turn of the 20th century, Empires of Iron includes several scenarios based on the number of players, each playable in an afternoon. The game includes both introductory and standard rules. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).<br/> Home page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.blueiguanagames.com/eoi.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.blueiguanagames.com/eoi.htm</a><br/><br/>",

The numbers after office titles indicate their location on the city map (see insert inside rear cover). Players endeavor to progress up the structure by killing (or arranging to have killed) the player holding the office immediately above them, and then ensuring that they (rather than the other potential candidate) are elevated to the vacancy thus created. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the 'meat' of the game lies in the necessary wheeling and dealing between players that is found to produce the desired result - all kinds of bribery, promises, treachery and the like can be used; in fact, unless expressly forbidden by the rules, it can be tried.<br/><br/>",

In a turn, a player draws 1 from either pile and discards 1.  The hand ends when a player can lay down a 7-letter word from the hand.  Then everyone scores for the longest word they can spell: 100 points for 7 letters; 60-30 points for 6-3 letters respectively.  Spelling &quot;Chicago&quot; earns 500 points, which is the goal total of the game.<br/><br/>Alphabet Rhummy: Start as above.  In a turn, a player: draws 1; lays down a word of 4+ letters, or adds to either end of an existing word, or substitutes letters in an existing word; and discards 1.  The letters substituted for are taken in to the hand, and must be at least as many as were just played.  The hand ends when a player goes out; he then gets 1 point per card in others' hands.  The game ends when a player reaches  52 points.<br/><br/>",

The upper left corner has the letter used in upper case; the lower left has the other letter in lower case, so you can tell whether you want to reverse the card to use the other letter.  The game also includes four two-piece foot-long wooden racks to hold cards.<br/><br/>There are enough cards that the instructions say don't bother shuffling.  Deal 15 each, and players have 3 minutes to form them into words.  In a turn a player draws 1 from the top of the draw or discard pile, and discards 1 unless they go out.  A player goes out by making all 16 cards into words of 2 or more letters; any player may claim the top discard out of turn if they can use it to go out.  When a player goes out, the hand ends and others have 3 minutes to make the cards they have into words.<br/><br/>Words are scored according to length: 2-3 letters gets 1 point; 4 gets 2; 5/4; 6/7; 7/11; 8/16; 9/22; 10/30; 11/40; 12/52; 13/68; 14/90; 15-16/120.  The one who goes out gets a 30 point bonus if they go out with 1 word; 20 with 2 words; 10 with 3 words.  If a word has 3 or 4 letters (e.g. paraLLeL, SciSSorS), it gets a 15 or 25 point bonus respectively.  Two-word couplets that are grammatically correct (&quot;spring flowers&quot;) get a 10-point bonus.  Play an agreed number of rounds, and the high total wins.<br/><br/>The rules say you can register the game and get rules for the advanced game Academie Royal.  They also say this is &quot;Part I of the Cavendish Academie System&quot;; I don't know if other parts were published.<br/><br/>",

When an orange card is placed atop and at right angles to a yellow card, the letters combine to form a potential word.<br/><br/>In the main game, players are each dealt 2 yellow cards.  In a turn, a player draws 1 orange card from the draw or discard pile, and lays it on each of his yellow cards, pronouncing the &quot;word&quot; aloud.  Each yellow card that is part of a real word is turned down and saved, and replaced from the yellow deck; finally the orange card is discarded.  At the end of the game, the player with the most won yellow cards wins.  Players may be challenged if they fail to speak a word aloud, pronounce it wrong, or declare a nonexistent word; the loser of a challenge gives the winner one of his won yellow cards.<br/><br/>In the Tic-Tac-Toe game, 9 yellow cards are dealt into a 3x3 array.  In a turn a player draws 1 orange card and lays it on an empty yellow card to form a word, placing one of his tokens on it; if it cannot be placed to make a real word, it's discarded.  A player wins on getting 3 tokens in a row; then the cards are discarded and a new yellow array is dealt.  Presumably, play continues until a certain number of games is won or time is expired.<br/><br/>",

On the front it has the letter and its value (1-5), and on the back it has its value and all letters of that value: <br/>1 - AEIOU<br/>2 - HLNRY<br/>3 - CSTVX<br/>4 - BDFGZ<br/>5 - JKMPQW<br/>There are also 7 Clue Cards - &quot;1st Letter&quot; thru &quot;6th Letter&quot;, and &quot;Any Letter&quot;.  The game board has 6 spaces for cards with an elastic to hold them in place, and a scoring dial.<br/><br/>A dealer is chosen, who thinks of a word of 4-6 letters, takes the Letter Cards that spell it, and places them face down under the elastics, showing the points and possible letters of each.  The Crypt-O Number for the word -- twice the sum of its letter values -- is set on the dial.  Each other player is dealt a random Clue Card.<br/><br/>In a turn, a player either: asks a general yes/no question, asks a yes/no letter question (&quot;is the 4th letter R?&quot;), guesses the word, or gives the dealer his Clue Card and peeks at the front of the card indicated.  The turn continues until a &quot;no&quot; is received or the Clue Card is used.  Whatever the answer, for each question the scoring wheel is decreased: for a general question, 1; for a letter question, the letter's value; for a wrong word guess, 2.<br/><br/>If a letter is guessed it is turned face-up; if the word is guessed or the last card expose, the round ends.  To score, if the word wasn't guessed, the dealer scores its Crypt-O value, other wise the guesser gets the value on the scoring wheel and the dealer gets the Crypt-O value minus that amount; and each player gets 5 points for each Clue Card they hold.  If the word is unknown to half or more of the players, the round doesn't count.<br/><br/>Rotate the dealer with each round; the game is won by the player who first hits 150 points.<br/><br/>",

In a turn a player asks another player for a needed letter, and lays a word down to the table if possible.  The game ends when one player goes out, or if everyone is stuck; the player with the most words wins.<br/><br/>Number Game: As above, except the players are trying to form a set of 1-10 in a suit, played in order as they are received.<br/><br/>Cross Letter: Deal 6 each.  In a turn a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, lays down up to 4 letters to make a word, and discards 1.  The cards must be played to a growing crossword array.  When one player goes out, everyone adds the total of points in their hand to their total.  When one player reaches 100, the one with the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>",

This is a game conceived by Kreeda, and follows the footsteps of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita through the forest. Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. In the forest they have many adventures and face many hardships. Vanavaas - The Adventures in the Forest lets you understand their experiences and brings you face to face with the demons they meet in the forest.<br/><br/>In the game, the footsteps are pictured as sandals or padukas - the old and traditional footwear worn by forest dwellers and rishis. The game is played with long dice which are the traditional dice in India.<br/><br/>This game begins with Rama and Lakshmana leaving Ayodhya and follows their adventures in the forest. The game takes you through the stay at Chitrakoot, Bharata&rsquo;s encounter with Rama, the meeting with Shoorpanaka and the incident of the golden deer.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to introduce the characters of the epic to children in a fun package which is easily absorbed and retained. It is suitable for children over five with some adult guidance. Now available with paduka shaped coins.<br/><br/>",

Players sit opposite a honey-comb board (side of 3 hexagons) where corners have 3 numbers (1 to 5 or blank) next to them. The 3- and 4-hexagon rows nearest a player and the central row of 5 hexagons are considered that player's playing field and the object of the game is to roll the dice and circle corresponding numbers at hexagon corners, with the first player completing a hexagon (circling all numbers in that hexagon) winning the game.<br/><br/>",

Cut out the four square tiles and reassemble them to create a larger square.<br/>2. Player one begins by selecting a corner, circling the dot in that location with a colored pen or pencil, and placing his token on that dot. Player two then does the same thing in the opposite corner using a different color pen or pencil (Fig a).<br/><br/>Fig a<br/><br/>Game play<br/>1. At the start of each turn, a player has the option of (1) moving to an open adjacent dot (a dot is considered to be &ldquo;open&rdquo; if it has not already been circled by an opponent), or (2) turning one of the four squares one quarter turn, either clockwise or counterclockwise.<br/>2. If a player chooses to moves his token to an adjacent dot, the player then circles that dot, and draws a line segment of his/her color between the two dots. Tokens may only be moved vertically or horizontally, never diagonally.<br/>If a line segment created by a player&rsquo;s move creates a closed box, the player places his initial in that box to claim it. If a box is unclaimed at the start of the next player&rsquo;s turn, that player may initial it, thereby stealing it.<br/>Players may choose to hop between adjacent cards, but lines are never drawn between dots of adjacent cards. Players are simply hopping to the other card without creating a line<br/><br/>Players may move to a dot that they have already claimed, but they may never move back along a line segment that has already been created. A line segment of any color represents a blocked path<br/><br/>3. If a player chooses to rotate a card, the player does so and the player&rsquo;s turn ends. A card may never be rotated in one direction by one player and then back in the opposite direction by his opponent on the following turn.<br/><br/>4. The game ends when both players agree that it is impossible for either player to create any additional legal line segments. If only one player is unable to move or create a legal line segment, his/her opponent is allowed to continue if he/she can move/rotate squares in such a way that additional line segments can be made. When no more line segments can be created, players tally their points to determine a winner.<br/><br/>5. The game is also brought to an end if one player either moves or hops onto another player&rsquo;s token, thereby capturing his opponent. If a capture occurs, players still tally their points to determine a winner.<br/><br/>Part of the 4 Tile Contest:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408</a><br/><br/>Freely available: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3169070#3169070\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3169070#3169070</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Repent or Die! is a set of miniatures rules for wargaming Renaissance period battles (the game is subtitled &quot;Rules for the Wars of Power &amp; Religion 1492-1660).<br/><br/>The game is designed for 25mm scale figures, though rules for basing 15mm and 6mm are given.  No figures are removed, so it is not critical how figures are based.  Suggested basing is 2 figures for infantry skirmishers and cavalry, and 4 figures (in two ranks) for non-skirmish infantry.  The typical units are 3 stands of cavalry (regiment) or a mixture of pike and shot stands for infantry (1 pike and 2 shot for a Swedish/Dutch regiment and up to 36 figures for a Tercio).  The scale is 1 figure = 50 men and 1&quot; = 50 yards.<br/><br/>Significant features of the rules:<br/><br/>- Each command group of units is given a standing order which it must follow.  Units continue to follow these orders until a new order is sent from the overall commander.  If the overall commander is too far away from the command, there will be delays in adopting the new order.<br/><br/>- No figures are removed when damage occurs--units simply receive Disorder Markers (DM).  When ordinary units have accumulated 2 or more DM's (Tercios 4 or more DM), the unit becomes &quot;unformed&quot; and is unable to move at full speed and is less effective in fighting (e.g., unformed pikes are no longer at an advantage vs. cavalry).  Units automatically rally off disorder markers at a rate given by their morale and other attributes, and additional DM's can be rallied off if the unit remains stationary or has an attached commander.<br/><br/>- Melees are resolved in multi-round battles until one side routs or is eliminated.  Losers of a round will accumulate Disorder Markers and be pushed back.  At some point, one side or other will rout and begin to retreat off the board.<br/><br/>- Once a player loses a certain percentage of its units (depending on the army), units begin to retreat towards their board edge.<br/><br/>No army lists are included, but scenarios are included which may give examples of typical units.  Scenarios included are: Seminara (French vs. Spanish, 1495), Barletta (French vs. Spanish, 1502), Otumba (Spanish vs. Aztecs, 1520), Pavia (French vs. Imperial, 1525), Breitenfeld (Sweden vs. Catholic League, 1631), and Rocroi (French vs. Spanish, 1643).<br/><br/>",

Once a player collects ten letters they must yell out, &quot;Go, Matria!&quot; to be safe from having their letters stolen by another player. They then race the timer and each other to create as many words as possible with the highest point value, using each letter only once.<br/><br/>The duration of the game depends on the pre-determined number of rounds players set for themselves. It&rsquo;s up to the players if they want to play a short game or a longer one! Each round is 4 minutes in length.<br/><br/>The Go, Matria! letter tiles come in a bag and remain hidden during each round. Players can only see and use the letters they pull out of the bag to make words. The tiles are placed on a stand to keep their letters hidden from their opponents!<br/><br/>Components: Letter Tiles, Tile Stands, Six-Sided Die, Drawstring Bag, 4-Minute Sand Timer, Score Pad.<br/><br/>",

In a turn, a player draws from either pile, starts or adds to a sequence if he can, and discards.  He may lay down cards if there  are 3 or more from the same sequence.  When the sequence is complete, he must arrange them in order; others may dispute the order if they think it's wrong, and the group decides what is right.  If it is wrong, the player is out for the rest of the hand.  The first to finish a sequence in correct order wins.<br/><br/>",

The chasers can move along the field in one direction only and need to tag a waiting runner if their team needs to change direction. The chasees try to avoid being caught.

The rusting progress is simulated on a rust-o-meter by 50 grommets and after each round one six sided die is rolled and that number is removed. If all are removed before the last barrel of waste is uncovered the players have lost.<br/>The gaming area is set up by mixing all brown cards face down including the five toxic cards and forming a 5x6 pattern. On these the yellow action cards are placed face down as well and finally all green landscape are placed on top face up. The game uses a currency of power beans of which each player gets one six sided dies worth each round. These are used to remove landscape cards 10 for a small card and 20 for a big card and players are allowed to pool power beans. If an action card is unearthed it is turned and the required action is read. This action then needs to be executed in order to remove the yellow card to gain access to the lowest layer of brown cards. Once the brown cards are accessible they may be turned without additional cost.<br/><br/>",

You can adjust the fan blades to adjust the speed of the propeller as it &quot;falls&quot; down the corkscrew sticks. (Basically you are adjusting how much resistance the air is making against the blades.)<br/><br/>The game is played by not letting the propeller fall off the end of a stick; as the propeller goes from one stick to another, the top stick is moved to become the new bottom stick.  When playing with two people, one person is responsible for moving the stick, while the other is responsible for the stability of the stick the propeller fan is currently on. If you are playing solo, you have to try and do both of these functions, which would be very difficult.<br/><br/>",

Did you know that many kinds of sharks don't really have to keep swimming all their lives at all, but can rest happily on the ocean floor, pumping water through their gills? Or that the average shark replaces about six thousand teeth every year?<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first shark to reach either of the coral reefs and then swim back to the island in the middle of the board.  The first back to the island wins the game.  It's as simple as that!<br/><br/>But on the way you might be hunted by sports fishermen, or you might eat an old drum by mistake, or you might have to hide in a mangrove swamp to escape a bigger, meatier shark!<br/><br/>The more you play SharkPit, the more you will find out about sharks; their habits, lives, adventures and struggles.  By the end, you'll know just what it's like to be a shark!<br/><br/>",

Emigrants can move one space in any direction; diplomats can move any number of spaces in any of the (eight) directions. Diplomats have special powers which, dependent on their type, affect the movement of emigrants. No piece ever captures another.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move all seven emigrants into the embassy, just beyond the opponent's end of the board.<br/><br/>",

It has a game board, 54 letter cards, 2 rule cards, 5 blue chips and 5 red chips.<br/><br/>To start, deal 6 cards to each player and nine on the 3x3 grid.  In a turn, a player either: makes a word using 3 or more cards from the hand and one from the board, placing a chip of his color on the board card used and discarding the hand cards used; or simply discards as many cards as desired.  Then he draws back up to 6; if he used all his hand to make a word he draws 1 extra.  The first to get 3 chips in a row wins.  (It doesn't say anything about chips of both colors on the same card; presumably it's not allowed.)<br/><br/>",
