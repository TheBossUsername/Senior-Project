        "description": "Hurry Up! presents players with six dice-y challenges &ndash; for example, collect three pairs, assemble a straight, roll all six dice for a sum of 20 or less &ndash; that they must try to complete. You have only 30 seconds for each challenge, and if time runs out before you meet that round's winning condition, then you score nothing. If, on the other hand, you succeed, then you score both the points for that specific challenge (5-50 points) and the sum of the pips on the dice that you collected. After six rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Included with five regular dice is one blue die, which is wild for some challenges and laden with restrictions in others. In the &quot;dice sum to 20 or less&quot; challenge, for example, the blue die must be a 6 and all the dice must be rolled together. Fail to get that 6 or break the 20 threshold, and you'll have to roll, roll, roll again...<br/><br/>",

Players divide into two teams and decide on a time limit for each round. Team A selects a player to give them the clues for a word printed on their word card. The player picks a card and places it in the holder so that they and Team B can see it but team A (the players team) can't. They then try to describe the word on their card without using any of the forbidden words. If one of the forbidden words is used and Team B spot it Team A don't score and play passes to team B. If team A correctly guess the word they score a point. The team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     40 x Word cards<br/>     Team score pad<br/>     Card holder<br/>     Rules <br/><br/><br/>",

Cards of a higher rank typically take cards of a lower rank, though there are some exceptions (Spies, for example, take both the Bazooka and the Mortar, while Shooters can sometimes be &quot;turned&quot;).<br/><br/>A player first deploys his cards by placing them, 1 and 2 at a time, into the 13 spaces on his line.  Once all cards have been deployed, players take turns advancing their cards into the combat zone.<br/><br/>What makes the game interesting is the ability for players to switch two cards before advancing one into battle.  Each player can do this exactly 5 times.<br/><br/>The goal is to win 7 of the 13 battles in the combat zone, or win 4 adjacent battles.  The winner will almost always be the player who most skillfully utilizes his troops, as there is very little luck involved.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, try to find a card in your hand that shares an attribute with the top card of the discard pile.

        "description": "Ascot is a horse race betting game for 2 to 18 players.<br/><br/>The game consists of the game board (six racing lines &ndash; one for each horse, numbered columns, representing forwards or backwards movements), 6 horses in 6 different colors, 108 betting slips (each 18 in the colors of the horses), and 72 movement cards in a neutral color. For each horse, there are 12 cards (3x &quot;+&quot;, 2x &quot;++&quot;, 1x &quot;+++&quot;, 3x &quot;-&quot;, 2x &quot;- -&quot;, and 1x &quot;- - -&quot;). The start position of each horse is the field of its respective line in the central column.<br/><br/>Each player receives six betting slips (one of each color) and an amount of the 72 movement cards (previously shuffled and distributed amongst them). The objective of the players is to give adequate movement cards to the player nominated as the game master in attempt to best influence the position of the horses during the race. Simultaneously, the players may change betting slips with each other, trying to achieve the best winnings. For that, the players are free to communicate among them and change both betting slips and movement cards. During the race, the players may give movement cards (face down) to the game master. After the game master plays five cards, they move the corresponding horses according to the played movement cards. The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds are played and the players receive points according to their bets. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Originally published in spielbox 1992 #5.<br/><br/>",

The game board depicts a game convention's dealers' room (in 3-D, if the provided booth backdrops are mounted and placed on the board). The players move around the board and attempt to purchase new games. Games can be taken from players by Game Zombies or Gilly the Perky Goth. This can be prevented by leaving the room to stow purchases, but this of course takes time.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the value of each game is determined randomly, but the games are divided into tiers so that there is some predictability: third-tier games are generally worth less than second-tier games, which in turn are probably worth less than the one first-tier game, but there are bonus die roll possibilities, so that will not always be the case. Furthermore, the first-tier game has a very small chance of being a total bust which causes anyone owning it to lose the game.<br/><br/>",

When you win a kiss, you use the special 'kisser' stamper to stamp your boyfriend's photo.  But hey, life's not always great, is it?  Sometimes you can lose kisses, take kisses, or even have to trade boyfriends.  The first player to collect five kisses wins the game. It&rsquo;s that easy and tons of fun!<br/><br/>",

Unplayable if you are not familiar with the German language in general and Viennese dialect in particular.<br/><br/>Aim of the game: Bribing the attendant of the &quot;G&auml;nseh&auml;ufel&quot; (a forested sand island in the Danube with a large open-air bath) into giving you the last of the almost-sold-out lockers. The player who is first to successfully bribe the attendant wins the game.<br/><br/>How it is played: To bribe the attendant, one needs to collect three &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; (inn/restaurant cards). These are gained by moving one's player token to the &quot;Wirtshausfelder&quot; (inn/restaurant spaces) on the board. When a player lands on a &quot;Wirtshausfeld&quot;, he has to interpret a &quot;Wuchtel-Karte&quot;. Each of these cards contains a lighthearted comments in Viennese dialect and four sentences in standard German. The active player first tries to interpret the comment. If he is successful, he gets to draw a &quot;Wirtshauskarte&quot;. If not, he may pay 200 &quot;Kaiserm&uuml;hlentaler&quot; (game money) to have one of the four possible translations read to him and to guess if the translation is correct. If he is successful, he gets to draw a card. The &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; have alcoholic strengths printed on them. If the card has the same colour as the player's secret task card, he/she can try to bring it to the attendant to bribe him. But at the bath's entrance, there is a policeman conducting alcohol checks. Depending on the alcoholic strength of the active player's cards, he either has to pay a fine, or the other player/s who initiated the alcohol check have to pay the cost for the check.<br/>Other special fields on the board let players win or lose money (through gambling, staying at the office, selling or auctioning off &quot;Wirtshauskarten&quot; etc.)<br/><br/>",

These blocks come in four colors, and all the blocks of a single color can be assembled into a 333 cube, although some are more difficult to construct than others. Each player receives a hand of five cards from the deck of 55 cards. Cards come in two types:<br/><br/>&bull; Block card &ndash; which shows a color and a number from 3 to 5. By playing this card, you choose a block that matches the specifications on the card and add it to your collection of blocks.<br/><br/>&bull; Function card &ndash; which allows you to take a special action on your turn: taking an opponent's block or forcing a swap with an opponent, choosing a block of your choice, forcing all players to return a block, and cancelling one of the aforementioned special actions.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, all players reveal the block cards in their hands, and the player with the lowest sum of numbers chooses blocks first, then the next player, and so on. Thus, each player will start with a different collection of blocks and possibly a different number of cards in hand. On a turn, a player first draws a card. If he has two or fewer cards in hand, he can play one card or end his turn. If he has 3-5 cards, he must either play a card, discard a card, or discard a block from his collection. If he has six cards, he must play a card.<br/><br/>The first player to assemble a 333 cube with no extra blocks and no protrustions or holes in the structure wins the round. The first player to win two rounds wins the game. If you assemble a 333 cube from nine blocks or in a single color, then you win the game instantly.<br/><br/>",

Each subsequent player who retires with one card also takes half the pool (of course, it will get smaller as each player retires from the game).

        "description": "The Game At A Glance:  Appalachian Rails is based on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad and its march across the coalfields of West Virginia.  The railroad went into receivership after trying to burrow through difficult terrain.  It was up to Colis Huntington, one of the &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; in the transcontinental railroad, wanted to use the C&amp;O as a railroad to link with his West Coast empire.  Additionally, West Virginia and surrounding states in Appalachia had a large reserve of natural resources which would form the revenue stream for the C&amp;O for years to come.<br/><br/>Your object is to mimic (and beat) the C&amp;O's success.<br/><br/>The game starts with the player taking a loan for money to pay for track and locomotives to haul goods.  Play consists of rolling dice for each commodity in the board.  Some commodities such as coal are more plentiful than manufactured goods.  After the commodities are placed, track is built, link by link, using the railroad's treasury.  Locomotives may be purchased which have a range of anywhere from 5-10 links.  After this is complete, if a player is able, he may transport cubes to any market expecting them.<br/><br/>There are also markets in the game which decide the price of a commodity based on how often it is delivered and how often cubes are placed on the board.  These values are staggered for different cities.<br/><br/>For those who have played a number of train games, this game could be described as a cross between Silverton and Age of Steam with a little bit of Prairie Railroads thrown in for good measure.  The main challenge of this title was to create a compelling solitaire railroading experience.  The game is extremely difficult to beat.  I think it lives up to the challenge.<br/><br/>",

Now is the time to decide where the wall will run.<br/>Each player plays the leader for one side, vying against each other to get the most value to their side. You are using your influence to convince the undecided to join you, have important places on your side and important events in the city&rsquo;s life happen there.<br/>However, you need to find the right ways to exercise your influence. Will you find the inspiration at the right time? You will have to roll the dice to know and choose the ideas (Decktet suits) you keep wisely to take the advantage over your opponent.<br/><br/>In The Wall, players throw a bunch of dice, and then decide to use those for either taking influence counters or paying the influence value of one of three cards available at that time. The card then goes into one of three categories (People, Places, Events) on the player side, to try to take control of that category.<br/>Players also have identical Action-card decks, giving them a random special action every turn.<br/>In the end, whoever controls more categories wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Points are earned by correctly answering questions.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The starting player takes a card from the card stack, chooses a letter and reads the corresponding question and its answers. There are two types of questions:<br/><br/>- Questions with one to three correct answers: For each question, there are four answers. One to three of them are correct, at least one is wrong. When all the answers have been read, the players place their chip(s) on the betting boards for the answer(s) that they think is/are correct. Each player (including the one who read the question) can place up to three chips. Players who put their chips on one or more wrong answers don't get any points this round. Players with exactly one correct answer get to advance their pawn one space, 2 correct answers means advancing 2 spaces, 3 correct answers 3 spaces.<br/><br/>- Questions whose answers have to be put in the correct order: For each question, there are three answers. When all the answers have been read, players put their chips in the order that they think is correct (the chips are numbered 1-3 on one side).

        "description": "In the adventure, you and your friends (tha' be players later on) take on the roles of legendary privateers, shrewd buccaneers and other kinds of bloodthirsty scallywags. All of whom are tied together by the code and honour amongst pirates.<br/>Both code and honour will be betrayed multiple times as the players plot and make mischief for and against each other. One adventure takes approximately one to two hours, including all preparations and planning, such as shuffling the cards, creating characters and making up the premise. The game is playable with just the cards, but you might find the game easier to follow if you use paper to make notes and count the crosses in the Davy Jones Counter. The game is all about having fun. Push your characters into complicated and fun situations. Curse like a scallywag. Cheat fate, act like a legend, and if the inevitable cold grave calls you - go with a bang.<br/><br/>Each player has a character. After creating the characters, you may use the cards and the adventure-o-matic to create a grand,<br/>challenging adventure. All scenes start from a plot twist. The twists might be positive, helpful, funny or they might come in the shape of a challenge. Players respond to challenges by using cards from their hand. A player may play as many cards of the same suit as he likes, but the sum of their values must be at least equal to the challenge card&rsquo;s value in order to beat the challenge. If the character is unable to resolve a challenge with the cards in hand, the situation might call for a betrayal. A challenge from another character&rsquo;s action can kill a character, if the challenge winning player calls for it. However, challenges between characters do not need to be deadly: a character might try to seduce another or steal his hat.<br/><br/>Pirates never betray each other, or the pirate code, Well... at least if it&rsquo;s not a matter of life and death ... Or if it&rsquo;s not about love ... Or if there is no gold in it ... Or&hellip; well, you get the picture. A player calls for a betrayal, and asks for a suit. Even if the characters cannot die directly from the challenges, there is a price for failure and betrayal. Sooner or later the cold arms of the grave will welcome all pirates of the sea. There should be 12 empty slots in each character sheet. These slots are used to keep score of the character&rsquo;s failures and betrayals. Each time the character fails a challenge, two X&rsquo;s are added to the counter.<br/>Each time the character betrays the others, one X is added to the counter.<br/><br/>And each time the character gets one or more X&rsquo;s - a card is drawn. If the value of the card is equal or less than the number of X&rsquo;s on the character sheet, the character&rsquo;s days are numbered and he is doomed.If a character already has 12 X&rsquo;s on the sheet, he is immediately doomed, when he gets the 13th mark.<br/>A doomed character will die in any of the next three scenes. Players should not feel too attached to a doomed character. He might look pale or even ghostly or see omens of his death for he knows that the day is his last.<br/><br/>When and how does the game end?<br/>The game should end if<br/>&bull; Adventure has reached its conclusion,<br/>&bull; You reach agreed time limit (Professional pirates recommend using 2 hour time limit)<br/>&bull; Players are too tired (of drinking Rum) to play on.<br/><br/>",

They can sprout horizontally or diagonally upwards, but must not break or tangle unnaturally.<br/><br/>Aim: All players win by placing the thirtieth ball, thus completing the pyramid, without losing the game in the process.<br/><br/>Setup: Place all 48 balls (16 of each color) in the bag. Each player draws a ball at random and holds it so that everyone can see it. The player who first recites a haiku or poem about beauty plays first. Choose difficulty, Easy, Medium or Hard<br/><br/>Play: When a player's turn comes, he must place the ball he holds on any hole on the Shibumi board or on top of a 2&times;2 platform created by balls. He then draws a new random ball and play continues counter-clockwise.<br/><br/>In Sprout, unlike other Shibumi games, dropping a ball is not allowed. You never remove balls from the pyramid you build as branches of a cherry blossom tree cannot be cut by themselves.<br/><br/>Game Loss: The players lose the game in two ways<br/>1) If, at any time, two balls of the same color on the same level are diagonally next to each other (break)<br/>2) If, at any time, a ball is placed on an upper level and there are two balls of the same color adjacent to one in the lower-level platform (tangle)<br/><br/>Wish: During their turn, any player may use one of the team's wishes to put the ball he holds in the bag and draw a new one of the color of his choice. If you chose the Easy difficulty, the team has 3 wishes. If you chose Medium, the team has 2 wishes, while if you chose Hard you have only 1 wish<br/><br/>Etiquette: The players are generally not allowed to speak about the game, suggest moves and interrupt a player's thinking.<br/><br/>The exception to this are the ancestors. After a ball is placed, any player other than the player who placed it is allowed to appeal to an ancestor and explain, in a few words, why this is a bad move and suggest a better one. The player who placed the ball then chooses to take the ball back or leave it be.<br/><br/>Each player may only appeal to his ancestors twice per game. Beyond that he must silence out of respect.<br/><br/>This game is an entry for the Shibumi Challenge<br/><br/>Beautiful the trees<br/>When winter leaves, spring arrives<br/>Colors fill the land<br/><br/>",

Roll 1 die and go forward the spaces indicated on the die, then follow instructions on each of  the rocks.  There is only 1 die used in this game.<br/><br/>Only one dinosaur can occupy any space on board at one time.  The only place that more than one dinosaur is allowed to occupy, is the Dino-Bath.<br/><br/>Dino-Bump: When you land on a space that is already occupied by another dinosaur, that dinosaur goes back to the Dino-Bath and your dinosaur stays on that space.  This move is called a Dino-Bump.<br/><br/>On a Safe rock, however, you are safe from a Dino-Bump.  See additional rules for Safe rock.<br/><br/>How to Win<br/><br/>The first player to enter the Dino Cave is the winner!   You can only enter the Dino Cave with an exact roll of the die.  If you roll a number that is greater than the number needed to enter the Dino Cave, do not move forward.  Wait until your next turn and try again to enter.<br/><br/>The rule is different, however, for the last Dino Jump rock.  From here, if you roll a 1, then you enter the Dino Cave.

        "description": "Dice Bowl Football is a two-player game where opponents coach teams in a battle of wits.<br/><br/>The game comes with twelve special dice representing offensive plays, defensive formations, and special teams. Each coach calls a play, and dice are rolled depending on the calls. The offense chooses a play based on risk vs. reward. If the defense anticipates the play correctly, they roll more dice and have a better chance of stopping the offense.<br/><br/>There are no complicated charts to search through after each play is called. The outcome of the play is read directly from the dice. Quickly the coaches move on to the next play, and the action is never bogged down.<br/><br/>Despite this simplicity of play, the game contains all the moves and strategy of a real football game. Everything that can happen in football can happen on your game table, from Onside Kicks to Long Bombs. Aside from offense and defense, there are also dice for special plays, penalties, and kicking.<br/><br/>Includes everything you need to play a game: 12 dice with customizing stickers, card decks representing the playing field, scoreboard, and game clock, 4 scoring rings, 2 field markers, a large cloth bag, and instructions for playing.<br/><br/>The field is built by laying out the provided standard-size cards, which means that all components fit into a large cloth bag. This makes it easy to take Dice Bowl along to tailgates, picnics, and parties. Dice Bowl is a great family game with a nice mix of strategy, gamesmanship, and a little luck!<br/><br/>",

Two players, white and red, take turns placing a ball of their colour either on a empty board hole or stacking on a 2x2 platform of existing balls.<br/><br/>A player, as an alternative, can choose to remove a ball (white or red) belonging to a 2x2 platform that supports not more than one other ball on each higher level. If a ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. The removed ball must return immediately to the board in the place left free by the top ball just dropped (spinout rule, as for a car out of control!). A player is not allowed to remove a ball if the other player just removed a ball in his turn.<br/><br/>Aim: the goal of the game is to create the most three-in-a-rows on the surface of the Shibumi pyramid (4 triangular faces). Rows can intersect but do not wrap around corners or edges. <br/>The game ends when the board is full with the 30 balls. Players are not allowed to pass and if a player has not legal moves the other player ends the game by placing his remaining balls to complete the pyramid.<br/>In case of a tie for number of three-in-a-rows, the winner is the player who has the least number of balls on the surface of the pyramid.<br/><br/>",

And what's the best kind of STUFF? You guessed it! NEW STUFF! You have just inherited a somewhat successful, multi-national corporation with access to a handful of cutting edge patents that will help you build some AMAZING NEW STUFF! Of course, it just so happens that your friends have also all suddenly (and suspiciously) inherited their own companies as well. Now, you must race to finish and begin production of as many prototypes of NEW STUFF as possible. The inventions are bizarre, corporate espionage is inevitable, and the profit to be made is unfathomable!<br/><br/>Proto-Typical is played with two different decks of cards:<br/><br/>     The Blueprints Deck contains double-faced cards with the invention and its value in millions of Globos (The global currency of the future) on the reverse, and blueprints for the invention on the reverse.  The blueprint also lists component types needed from the Resources Deck.<br/>     The Resources Deck contains single-faced cards, which are either component inventions listed by type, or other resources (Scientists, Venture Capitalists, Celebrity endorsers, Advertising Agencies).<br/><br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>     Player performs one of three actions:<br/>         Obtain resources - Draw one resource card from Resources Deck<br/>         Build a prototype - The player plays all the resources needed for one buildable idea (this may include resources in the public domain and resources from your hand modified by scientists), along with any value enhancing resources. Player takes the buildable idea OBVERSE-SIDE UP and any cards used from the player&rsquo;s hand and places them as the completed prototype into the player&rsquo;s asset pool<br/>         Kill an idea - Permanently discard (obsolete) a buildable idea by placing it and one or more resource cards needed for it from player&rsquo;s hand into player&rsquo;s assets, REVERSE-SIDE UP.  This is a liability. (Liability amount is the value of the idea less the resources used)<br/>    <br/>     Discard or draw cards so that player has exactly 5 cards<br/>     Reveal blueprint if any are still available so that exactly 3 show.<br/><br/><br/>Ending the Game:<br/><br/>     Play continues until there are no more buildable ideas, i.e. all blueprints have been prototyped or obsoleted.<br/>     Each player then tallies the total of their assets by adding the $G values of completed prototypes (as modified by human resources), $G4 for each resource card and subtracting obsoleted ideas.<br/>     Highest score wins the hand.<br/><br/><br/>",

The Squishy Squashy Dough Modelling Game!&quot;<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;It's charades... but not as you know it!<br/>Every mime must be acted out with the help of your trusty friends Morph and Chas - plus the aid of a lump of dough, of course!<br/>It's a terrific team game, where everybody does their bit in a frantic race against the clock.<br/>Do you go for the easy 'mime' that will ensure you move forward - or gamble it all on a difficult one that could all go horribly wrong?!<br/>Racing around the board, it will be the first team that can catch and overhaul their opponents that'll be the winners... no time to waste, get moulding!&quot;<br/><br/>Morph and Chas are stop-motion plasticine characters produced by Aardman Animations (who later went on to make Wallace and Gromit), who appeared with Tony Hart on childrens' TV in the UK in the 1970s and 80s, notably on the programmes Take Hart and Hartbeat.<br/><br/>The game is played by two teams. One team gets the Morph pieces and the other team the Chas pieces, and they start 6 spaces apart on the 12-space board track. Each card includes 6 words or phrases describing an action or pose (3 on each side, ranked 1/2/3 in order of difficulty).<br/><br/>The active player chooses one and in one minute has to get their team to guess the action or pose using their figure, the modelling dough, and Yes/No answers to any questions their team asks. Depending on success or failure, they then advance or retreat a number of spaces along the score track equal to the difficulty rank of the item they chose. There are also two &quot;All play&quot; spaces.<br/><br/>The winning team is the first to catch up with the other team on the track.<br/><br/>",

These problems may be of bodily, social and/or mental nature. To solve these issues, there are numerous solutions (or at least approaches) and helpful people covering all aspects &ndash; bodily, social and mental.<br/><br/>This easy to pick up, educational yet fun-to-play card game tries to recreate these aspects of our living reality in a more or less abstract manner. The game should be a cooperative experience, in which not one is declared winner and the others losers in the end. Not selfishness and only striving for one&rsquo;s own benefit, but rather helping each other should pave the road to victory. All players win TOGETHER. Nobody should be left behind. Thus the name of the game!<br/><br/>In &quot;Together we are strong!&quot; players cooperate to solve their problems or problems of other players by playing &quot;solution&quot; cards which can be boosted by &quot;helper&quot; cards. At the beginning of his or her turn, the active player draws cards from a shared 60 card deck containing problems, solutions and helpers. For each problem a player solved on his or her own, he or she receives two smiley-chips (Victory Points). If players work together to solve a problem, each player involved gets one smiley-chip. When the draw deck is depleted, all players must have reached a minimum of smiley-chips / Victory Points (depending on the number of players) in order to win the game. If one or more players have not reached that goal, everyone loses.<br/><br/>Developed by a studied social worker, this game is ideal for social workers and other people working in the social sector as well as for people/families who have experience with psychosocial problems, while still providing a pleasant gaming experience for other interested gamers as well.<br/><br/>Fran&ccedil;ais :<br/><br/>L&rsquo;UNION FAIT LA FORCE !<br/><br/>Un jeu de probl&egrave;mes et de solutions, pour 2 &agrave; 4 joueurs.<br/><br/>Nos vies quotidiennes regorgent de probl&egrave;mes de toutes natures, psychologiques, relationnels ou physiques, de sorte qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;est pas toujours facile de conserver notre &eacute;quilibre et notre confiance en nous.

Il n&rsquo;y aura ni vainqueur ni vaincu dans ce d&eacute;fi avant tout coop&eacute;ratif ; l&rsquo;entraide, et non l&rsquo;&eacute;go&iuml;sme, sera la cl&eacute; de la victoire. Nul ne doit &ecirc;tre laiss&eacute; pour compte !<br/><br/>Les joueurs doivent utiliser et &eacute;changer des cartes de Solutions et de Soutiens pour r&eacute;soudre leurs Soucis et ceux des autres. Chaque probl&egrave;me surmont&eacute; rapporte deux pions Sourire, que l&rsquo;on partage si l&rsquo;on s&rsquo;est fait aider par un autre. &Agrave; la fin de la pioche, chacun doit avoir gagn&eacute; un minimum de Sourires qui d&eacute;pend du nombre de joueurs, sinon tout le monde est perdant.<br/><br/>D&eacute;velopp&eacute; par un professionnel du secteur social, ce jeu sera id&eacute;al pour vos coll&egrave;gues, votre famille, ainsi que pour quiconque conna&icirc;t, ou a connu, des exp&eacute;riences difficiles.

        "description": "Information from the publisher's website.<br/><br/>How to play BOULOMANIA:<br/>First of all, each team throws one dice to see which team starts. The one with the higher number goes first (Team A). Team A throws on dice to determinate the position of the jack (one of the spaces 1-6) and so places the jack. Then, throwing a choice of two or three dice, Team A determines the position of its first bowl - the total number of points indicating which space its first bowl should be placed in. If the total number of points thrown is less than seven, the bowl counts as dead and is removed from the game.<br/><br/>Now it is Team B's turn to place its first bowl. If Team B is better here, in other words, if its bowl is nearer to the jack - then it is Team A's turn to go again. If Team B doesn't succeed on the first go, then it throws again until on of its bowls is nearer to the jack than the opponent's best-placed bowl or until Team B has no more bowls left. Then it's Team A' turn again... and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>There are extra rules for things like trying to remove an opponent's well-placed bowl and other stuff that a Boules player might expect.<br/><br/>",

But even though the common threat has finally passed, few believe they have seen the last of war. As the combined realms and Clans of the Inner Sphere struggle to rebuild, a new balance of power has begun to emerge.<br/> Field Manual: 3085 updates the military and political state of the Inner Sphere in the years following the end of the Jihad and the formation of the Republic of the Sphere. This report includes a brief history and overview of recent developments in the BattleTech universe (including the formation and organization of the Republic of the Sphere), as well as current TO&amp;Es for all of the major &rsquo;Mech and mercenary commands employed by the realms and Clans of the post-Jihad Inner Sphere.

        "description": "The game of Al-Jabar is based on concepts of color-mixing familiar to most of us from childhood, and on ideas from abstract algebra, a branch of higher mathematics. Once you are familiar with the rules of the game, your intuitive notions of color lead to interesting and often counter-intuitive color combinations created in gameplay.<br/><br/>While the mathematics involved uses elements of group theory, a foundational topic in abstract algebra, understanding the game is not difficult and requires no mathematical background. A game involves reducing your original hand of colored pieces before the other players.<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn by exchanging any combination of 1, 2 or 3 pieces from his or her hand for a set of 1, 2 or 3 pieces from the Center having an equal sum of colors. After the exchange, pairs of like-colored marbles are canceled from the center and replaced by a black marble, and the other players receive black marbles as well.<br/><br/>",

The person to make the last legal move wins.<br/><br/>Triplets: players take turns placing a white and black piece on an 8x8 board with the intent to make groups of the same color. Winning is determined by how many groups have the same number of pieces in them.<br/><br/>Color Scheme: this can only be played after a game of Triplets, by taking turns removing one piece at a time that is in the same row/column/diagonal as the last piece moved. What color is removed last determines the winner.<br/><br/>Alternating Colors: this is a more advanced version of Color Scheme. It involves removing a piece each turn that is the opposite color of the previous piece moved, but also must be in the same row/column/diagonal as the last piece, and also must have been connected to it. Winning is determined by how many pieces one is able to remove.<br/><br/>Order and Chaos: this is basically Pente played on a 6x6 board, save for one player wins by making a 5 or 6-in-a-row, while the other player wins by blocking this.<br/><br/>Black Holes: players bid on how many empty spaces will be left after a game, the person with the closest bid wins. Turns are placing a white or black piece on a 6x6 board. Spaces that would make a 3-in-row of either or both colors cannot be played on (this is the black hole).<br/><br/>Board Building: players lay colored tiles on a 6x6 board, making sure their tile is not in the same row/column as a tile of the same color. Last person to make a legal move wins.<br/><br/>Knight Rider: connect all 6 of each colored tile by a knight's move as in chess.<br/><br/>Swithcraft: involves switching tiles around a 6x6 board to achieve goal picked by players.<br/><br/>Quadrants: this is a 3-in-a-row game with each section of 3x3 colored tiles being treated as separate boards to play on. Pieces can only be played on a tile that is adjacent in the rainbow spectrum to the last tile played on. Winning is determined by how many 3-in-rows are made in each section.<br/><br/>Off Limits: pieces are played a knight's move away from the last piece played. How many pieces land on red tiles determine winner.<br/><br/>BRY vs. GOP: this is a simpler version of Off Limits.<br/><br/>Size Matters: basically Triplets played on colored tiles, by playing pieces on the same color.<br/><br/>Endies: goal is to make pairs of the same color by playing pieces on tiles of different colors. Players bid on how many pairs will be made; person with closest bid wins.<br/><br/>Cross/Link: this is a connection game, by placing pieces on same-colored tiles to connect both sides of the board.<br/><br/>Row vs. Column: another connection game that allows placing pieces on tiles adjacent in the rainbow spectrum.<br/><br/>Together: this is the same game as Quink. The tiles are laid in 5 crosses and the goal is to make 5 pentaminoes of the same color within 32 moves.<br/><br/>The 42-page booklet also includes dozens of variations for each game.<br/><br/>",

Fleets are moved from system to system on a star map. New events occur, and new items and allies are found, along the way. Conflict between competitive aliens is likely, and combat between starship fleets is almost certain. All such interaction is handled by brisk card play.<br/><br/>Infinite Space Explorers is based on the award winning indie computer games, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space and Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space and features the same disgusting aliens, peculiar artifacts, exotic starships and artwork by Bill &quot;Phosphorous&quot; Sears. Infinite Space Explorers is designed to set up and play easily and quickly, yet provide the essence of a star spanning galactic adventure. Discoveries are randomized so each game is different. -We think variety is the spice (and the spice must flow) and that replayability = value.<br/><br/>Please note that because of the particular board configuration used, Infinite Space Explorers is played as either a two player game or as a four player game. Rules for solo and three player games are not included.<br/><br/>Also, Infinite Space Explorers was made to be easily modified. We encourage you to try out your own ideas for new starships, weapons, artifacts, alien races, rules -anything! That's why, for starters, three custom cards are included with the game.<br/><br/>",

This is the part of the invasion when you use your major assets to smash your enemy, this isn't about pretending you are taking a planet with 10 tanks - this is the part when you tactically deploy waves of armour to clear the way before you, pulverising any fool who stands in your way. We call this PLANETFALL and it will be presented using 10mm scale miniatures.<br/><br/>Source: Publisher blurb<br/><br/>Planetfall is a miniature tabletop wargame, set in Firestorm Armada universe. Game uses 10mm miniatures and dice to reproduce future combat during plant invasion. Planetfall if one of three game systems (second is Conquest and third Spec Ops), and focuses on big battles between tanks, and heavy mechs.<br/><br/>Firestorm Invasion: Planetfall is designed to be a fast and furious game of massed armored combat. The game mechanics have been kept simple and easy to learn, allowing players to quickly get to grips with the tactical use and deployment of their key military assets.<br/><br/>Dice are an integral part of FI:P, adding an element of chance to represent the many varied factors present on the battlegrounds of the far-future. Generally, players will be asked to roll a number of D6 and add up the total number of &lsquo;hits&rsquo; or &lsquo;successes&rsquo;. In most circumstances each roll of 4, 5 or 6 will be a success, although various effects can cause this &lsquo;to hit&rsquo; number to change.<br/><br/>Every Squadron in FI:P has an Activation Card. These cards are used to add an extra level of tactical game play. These are supplied as blank cards, so that you can mark them to distinguish between your Squadrons. Activation Cards have two purposes in the game; they are used to control a player&rsquo;s Order of March and are also used to plan a player&rsquo;s reserves.<br/><br/>Each Turn during a game of FI:P each player will have a number of Command Points. The number available is calculated at the beginning of each Turn. These are then used throughout the Turn to improve Command Tests, play Game Cards and to allow Squadrons to perform more complex actions.<br/><br/>Game Cards in FI:P are used to represent a wide range of unplanned events, electronic warfare systems, direct command intervention and sheer luck! They add an<br/>additional level of tactics and learning when and how to use them brings a dynamic element to the game.<br/><br/>A game of FI:P consists of a number of Turns, with each Turn broken down into the following main phases:<br/><br/>1. Command Point Phase<br/>2. Order of March Phase<br/>3. Turn Card Phase<br/>4. Initiative Phase<br/>5. Squadron Activation Phase<br/>6. End Phase<br/><br/>END OF GAME<br/><br/>At this point, players should check to see if the Scenario&rsquo;s Victory Conditions have been satisfied by either player, if the Time or Turn Limit has expired or if the roll for Variable game length should be made. If the game has ended, then Victory Points should be calculated for both sides, depending on the Scenario played, and the winner should be determined.<br/><br/>The winner of a game of FI:P is normally decided by comparing Victory Point Totals after the final Turn has been played, unless a Scenario is being played that gives alternative Victory Conditions.<br/><br/>MULTI-PLAYER GAMES<br/><br/>Although it is preferable for everyone to have their own deck of Game Cards, it is possible share a deck. Each player will need to draw from a shared deck and discard to a shared Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Important Note: If a deck is used by more than one player, where possible, allies, rather than opponents, should use a shared deck.<br/><br/>You may not play cards on your allies&rsquo; models unless the card text specifically allows you to. In games with more than two players per side you may ONLY play cards to benefit models you control or to hinder enemy models.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A soccer replay/simulation/management game in which dice rolls and charts are used to simulate the management and gameplay results of soccer teams.<br/><br/>Paraphrased from the Owzat site:<br/><br/>Team Squad Ratings, attack and defence are used separately, reflecting the squad strengths of the teams. These are constructed on a goals scored and conceded basis using the final league table to ensure an accurate statistical base. Individual team ratings are used for Injuries and Suspensions, for Injuries reflecting the effect of an injury to a key player of players on the Squad strength of the team, thus ensuring that the teams with smaller and less flexible squads will suffer more severely from injury absentees, for Suspensions penalising those teams that have proved over the season that they are rarely able to field a full strength side because of this reason (e.g. Arsenal, Leeds). Cash is allocated to each club, allowing the rich to enter the transfer market more freely than their less wealthy rivals, provided the right player comes along of course. Transfers in and out, injuries and suspensions are dealt with in a fairly abstract way, as is necessary in a game that is about teams and not individuals. Opportunities will arise to strengthen the Attack/ Defensive Squad Values, players may have to be sold which have the reverse affect, all without names but all having an immediate effect on team strengths and performances.<br/><br/>A day's fixtures, whether it be just a couple of mid-week matches or a full Saturday/Sunday programme, are valued as a complete package before any match is resolved. This involves checking for Injuries and Suspensions on a team-by-team basis and then assessing which Goal Card to use for each time by deducting one team's Defence Squad value from the opponent's Attack Squad value and rounding the result down to a figure divisible by ten. When all matches have been valued, a roll of two pairs of coloured dice per match will produce a half time score line, a second roll for each will give the full time result. Book keeping consists of marking up the result on the Results Matrix and up dating both the Cumulative Points and Goals For and Against Charts.<br/><br/>",

Out of the 49 games submitted, Wings of Lightning won 8th place overall.  It also won the Best Paragraph Game and Best Large Game categories and was first runner-up for Best Sci Fi/Fantasy Game.<br/><br/>Unlike most gamebooks, Wings of Lightning eschews dice in favor of a system based on poker cards.  The combat system seeks to emulate such video games as God of War, Dante's Inferno, or Shadow of the Colossus. The game takes additional inspiration from the Legend of Zelda game series.<br/><br/>In Wings of Lightning, you play as Skoros, a soldier of Daleko desperate to defend his city from a massive siege by Ahdeen, the demi-god of deceit and his armies.  Molina, he demi-goddess of lightning, in love with you and desperate to keep you alive, grants a portion of her divine power to you, hopefully making you strong enough to defeat Ahdeen's armies and free your people.<br/><br/>In combat, you divide a deck of poker cards into 2 smaller decks, one containing all the face cards, the other containing all the number cards.  You use the face cards on your turn and the number cards for the enemy turn.<br/><br/>On your turn, guess the color (red or black) of the top card of the face card deck and reveal it.  If you guessed the color correctly, add the card to your strike pile.  If you were incorrect, add the card to your maneuver pile.  Continue this process until you decide to stop or until you have cards in your maneuver pile equal to your Speed.<br/><br/>The number of cards in your strike pile then determines which combo abilities you can activate, as well as the amount of damage you deal to your enemies.  Your maneuver cards are saved and used during the enemy turn to cancel their hits.  But be careful!  If you gain maneuver cards equal to your Speed, you take an automatic hit from the fastest enemy.<br/><br/>The number cards are used during the enemy turn.  For each enemy, draw a card.  If the number on that card is equal to or less than that enemy's Aim, you take damage from that enemy.  You can prevent this damage if you have a maneuver card of the same suit.<br/><br/>The contest version is a 78-page gamebook with a very linear storyline.  A post-contest version is in the works that will address some of the problems of the contest version, including weapon balance and replayability.<br/><br/>",

Action chips are collected by landing on an action space on the board and completing a task from that category.

        "description": "Boxed set of units for Malifaux. This crew includes the Dreamer (leader), Lord Chompy Bits, Coppelius, and 2 Stitched Together.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/><br/>The Dreamer is a child Earth side of the Breach whose dreams take him to Malifaux where his powers manifest in the ability to warp reality to his every whim. But he is not aware that the lives he plays with are those of living humans, he thinks it is all a dream and plays &quot;games&quot; with them. Noticing the child's immense powers, the primordial Nightmare came to him and attempted to drain him of his powers but found he was unable to. Given the name Lord Chompy Bits, he now protects the child and follows him around in his adventures in the &quot;dream land&quot;.<br/><br/>The Dreamer &amp; Lord Chompy Bits (LCB) have one of the most unique playstyles of any Master in Malifaux. Much like Viktoria you have 2 models for your Master but that is where the similarity stops. The Dreamer's main strategy is burying and unburying his Nightmares, letting him quickly move them across the field completely protected and drop them on your opponent when he least expects it. But for that power, the Dreamer trades any real kind of combat ability himself. He has a versatile but weak ranged attack but it is good for little more then harassing your opponents models. This is where Lord Chompy Bits comes into the picture; he can't move the Nightmares around like the Dreamer can, but he is one of the most dangerous melee Masters in the game. The Dreamer or Daydreams can unbury him, letting him deliver LCB to a desired location.<br/><br/>The Dreamer's crews are almost always made up exclusively of Nightmares as those are the only models he can bury and unbury with his abilities. He is not restricted to only bringing Nightmares, but there are very few non-Nightmare models that are worth taking over another Nightmare model. So this does make the list of models for his crews a bit small, but it doesn't hurt him. The models in that list have a variety of uses for them and really none of them have only a single use, they can all be useful in a variety of ways and play styles. So with very little variety compared to other Masters, The Dreamer certainly does a whole lot.<br/><br/>As a word of warning, The Dreamer is one of the most complex Masters in Malifaux and often requires a very firm grasp of the core rules to fully understand.<br/><br/>The Dreamer's starter box contains The Dreamer, Lord Chompy Bits, Coppelius, and 2 Stitched Together. Regardless of the type of Nightmare force you want to run, your first purchase must be a box of 3 daydream totems. They are the linch pin to The Dreamer's burry/unbury style of play and the master functions quite badly without them. Adding the daydreams gives you a starting crew of exactly 25ss. While The Dreamer does have a cache of 0, his Master of Dreams rule means he gains 1ss to his pool per non-master nightmare in the crew up to max of 5. The starter set plus daydreams has 6 nightmares giving him the max 5ss pool<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fishfry Deluxe is a fishing dice game using 6 custom laser engraved dice. It is the expanded edition of the original Fishfry (which was sold out) and it includes an extra BONUS die and a nifty pencil.<br/><br/>In the game, players have three rolls to catch a fish by rolling a HEAD and a TAIL (worth 10 points together), and various sized BODIES that add to the score of the fish.  The BONUS die adds its value to each fish caught.  Players have to choose which dice to keep and which dice to re-roll on their second and third rolls.  One side of the dice contains a small PANFISH, which is worth only one point, and cannot be re-rolled. However, if a player manages to roll 5 PANFISH, the player proclaims a FISHFRY!, and the other players have to &quot;FRY-UP&quot; their fish. Players often have the choice to push their luck, and try for larger fish.<br/><br/>In a single round game the goal is to catch and score the single largest fish possible, in a tournament players record their score and try for the largest grand total.<br/><br/>The game is light, quick, and easy to learn. Included are rules for one-round games, as well as multiple round fishing tournaments.<br/><br/>The dice are custom engraved in the USA by Chessex.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "this expansion includes the Steampunk Arachnid Swarm, a Minion for the Arcanists.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica wiki site:<br/><br/>The Steampunk Arachnid Swarm is the primary workhorse for crews led by Ramos, but you can utilize them with any Arcanist crews, and even in crews led by C. Hoffman or Leveticus. This model is typically well worth the 9 SS cost, and overall has good survivability, a good attack, and consistent damage output.<br/><br/>Overall, the Arachnids are pretty straight forward, and are basic melee attack units.<br/><br/>On the other hand Scatter uses a Summon technique, so if you plan to do the Scatter action, always be sure to use 1 general AP for something else first, and use your (+2) Melee Master and probably Self Repair or Disruption Field as well. Then when you Scatter, if you activated Disruption Field, it will automatically pass onto each of your newly summoned individual Arachnids. When they come into play, since they are Summoned, they are treated as new models, each with their own activation, but they will be Slow during that turn which they were summoned. The Scatter action is also different from Swarm Together, in that the individual Arachnids do not activate immediately, as in the Swarm Together scenario.<br/><br/>Against models with high Df, as mentioned above, Latch On is typically a good approach. One thing that works well is to move a Swarm up to the opponent, as long as it's less than 4&quot; total, attack twice with (+2) Melee Master, activate (0) Disruption Field, and then use the Swarm's last (1) to Scatter. Since you have to put the individual Arachnids in base contact with the Swarm, you should be able to place at least two of the new Arachnids in base contact with your target. Then, when those individual ones get to activate (thus, good to do this at the end of your turn, after your opponent has activated all their models, if possible), you start out with the one not in base contact to move into base contact and (0) Latch On. Then your two Arachnids in base contact can (0) Latch On and attack vs -4 and -6 Df. If you can manage to set this up where your Steamborg Executioner or another Arachnid Swarm still need to activate after all of this, then you should be able to really do some damage. This is one of the best ways to handle high Df opponents like Lilith, Perdita Ortega, or the Coryphee Duet (if you can get them to stand still, that is).<br/><br/>Lastly, the Overwhelm trigger, as mentioned above is one of the most dangerous things about the Arachnid Swarm, and it is worth learning how to utilize it well, both in the game itself, and as a psychological tactic. If your opponent knows that you have not yet activated a Swarm or two in range of some of his better pieces, he may be cautious about playing higher cards from his hand earlier in the turn, because he wants to keep those for cheating up his Df against the potential Swarm attacks. So there are some good mind-games that can be utilized with the Swarm.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion includes 3 Necropunks, which work as minions for the Resurrectionists.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactics Wiki site:<br/><br/>Twisted little undead, Necropunks are used for their mobility and resilience.<br/><br/>The Necropunk is much more mobile than most Resurrectionist models. Though it only has a move of 4, it has the (0) Leap spell allowing it to move its charge distance of 7 for a zero action. In addition, it is an Arachnid, so it can get through terrain very easily.<br/><br/>Necropunks generally work out best for Strategies where a Master needs to get minions to multiple objectives quickly. Their leap ability for (0) means that you can move 7 inches and then still have two actions to interact with an objective, such as a dynamite counter. Its best to hold a the Mask you will need rather than depending on it to come up in the turn you need it, if you can afford to do so. Note that because leap is their only 0 action, you might as well try each turn and flip for it. Be careful however about getting your Necropunks spread out all over the place, as leap isn't going to go off on a flip all that often. The unpredictability of leap is the greatest frustration you will have with these models, making a lot of what looks good on paper about them not work out in actual practice. However even with a single model, the leap ability can be used very effectively in conjunction with Flurry, allowing them to hop in and gain three attacks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card game in 8 rounds with 7 trick-taking rounds and one competitive patience round. A standard deck playing card game is used but with a number of players different from 4, one or more cards are removed so the total numbers of cards is a multiple of numbers of players. The cards to be removed and the order of these are:<br/>2 of diamonds, 2 of hears, 2 of spades and 2 of clubs. In the first 7 trick-taking rounds Ace count as highest card and as lowest card in the 8th round.<br/><br/>All cards are dealt out so each player and the player to the left for the dealer lead the round. The dealer changes clockwise for each round.<br/>Round 1 to 7 are played as normal trick taking without trump colour and each player must follow suit if possible. If a player has no cards in the suit led, a card of any other suit may be discarded.<br/><br/>Round 1: Avoid tricks : -10 pts for each taken trick<br/><br/>Round 2: Avoid King of Diamonds : -50 pts<br/><br/>Round 3: Avoid Queens       : -25 pts for each Queen taken<br/><br/>Round 4: Avoid Hearts       : -10 pts for each Hearts taken<br/><br/>Round 5: Avoid Jacks           : -25 pts for each Jacks taken<br/><br/>Round 6 Variant: Avoid first, fifth and the last trick: -25 pts for each of first, fifth and last trick taken<br/><br/>Round 7: Most trick    : +10 for each trick taken<br/><br/>Round 8: Competitive Patience: First card to be played must be a 7. If the leading player does not holds a 7 he must pass and<br/>the turn goes to the next player who also must pass if he does not hold a 7 etc.<br/>A player is not forced to play a seven hold in his hand after the first seven has been played.<br/>After the first 7 is played each player in turns lay down cards in incrementing or decrementing order around the 7 on the table (8 to king on the top and 6 to ace below the seven card). If a player is unable    to lay down a card he may pass.    For each pass a    player receive -10 pts.    When a player lay down his last    card the game is over and the remaining    players    receive    -5 pts for each    card they are holding.<br/><br/>The player with    the most points    has won    the game<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cards4 you is a set of 37 cards (cards numbered 1 to 7 in 5 colors and two wild cards, &bdquo;Jokers&rdquo;) published with 4 rulesets, one of them being Top Trumps (the cards with franchise themes have all the necessary information printed on them for this) and three of them being never-before published designs by Reiner Knizia. The games included:<br/><br/>1.    Aufw&auml;rts (Upward, age 4+, in some editions 5+) <br/>Players race to empty their hands. In turns, players attempt to play a card in a strict ascending order: you can only place a 2 on a 1, a 3 on a 2 etc. (card colors do not matter) with the exception of playing a 1 on a 7 (the highest card) on the discard pile. Jokers are used as wild cards. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile. The player who gets rid of all their cards first wins the game.<br/><br/>2.    Trumpfen (Top Trumps, age 6+)<br/><br/>3.    Zw&ouml;lf (Twelve, age 7+)<br/>A game resembling the designer&rsquo;s Foodie Forest and Poison with some twists and important differences. It is also a sort of a trick-taking game, but instead of everybody playing one card and seeing which one wins the trick, everybody takes turns adding cards until the total would add up to more than 13 (you can&rsquo;t place a card when the total would increase over 12) and the player who can&rsquo;t add a card takes the whole pile. But the total grows only when a player plays a card that is of a different color than the last card played. And when a Joker is played, the total goes back to zero again. In the end of a round, your score is the total of the cards collected (the less the better). After a pre-determined number of rounds the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>4.    Hamstern (Hoarding, age 8+)<br/>A simplified Cheeky Monkey-like game with cards drawn from a deck instead of a bag (and cards in the discard deck are reused later) and two wild cards. On a turn, a player may draw cards until either (1) he chooses to stop or (2) he draws a number that he has lying in front of him from a previous draw this turn. In this latter case, he discards all new cards in front of him and the next player then takes his turn. In the former case, he keeps the cards (in the order they were collected. If a player draws a number that matches the number on top of an opponent's deck AND/OR the card on top of the open discard deck in the middle, the player can steal this card, adding it to the top of the deck currently in front of him. The player with the most cards in the end wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Robert R. Lee&rsquo;s forces outside of Richmond to participate in the Seven Days Battles that decisively defeated the Union Army of the Potomac. One player plays the Union, and the other player plays the Confederate. The Confederate player will primarily be the attacker, but an observant Union player may have plenty of opportunity to counterattack.<br/><br/>Each combat unit generally represents 250 men or two artillery pieces; however, adjustments have been made to reflect individual unit levels of &eacute;lan, proficiency, command control, etc. Each game turn is equivalent to one hour of actual battle time.

The players also place gems on top of these tiles to claim them for the final scoring. Some of the tiles have special actions that the player claiming that tile can use.<br/><br/>SQUAR3 is similar to games like Isis &amp; Osiris or Go as the placement of tiles and player pieces is crucial for scoring the most points. A further depth of play stems from the orientation of each tile, the layering of tiles and the management of the actions available to each player.<br/><br/>Games of SQUAR3 can last for only a couple of turns or up to 30 min and can be quite mind-burning.<br/><br/>",

Hoffman crews play like a machine full of complex moving parts with Hoffman as the clockwork heart of the whole amalgamation. He both grants power to his constructs and borrows their own, creating powerful synergies between himself and his metal bodyguards. His low speed is offset by his ability to catch a ride (from Drawn to Metal) with a nearby construct. Hoffman does not fight the enemy directly, instead he enhances his Constructs to fight for him even taking temporary control of them with Machine Puppet to make a Strike. But all of this power and synergy with his crew comes at a price, as he is very reliant on his crew for his success and if you are too careless with them you will soon find Hoffman stuck in the middle of the fight without anyone to help him.<br/><br/>Naturally, C. Hoffman's synergy with Constructs makes them the best choice for his crew. The Guild offers these in the forms of the Guardian, the Hunter, the Peacekeeper, the Watcher, and Ryle. C. Hoffman's Arcanist Ties ability gives him access to the Steampunk Arachnid, Large Steampunk Arachnid, the Steamborg Executioner, Joss, and the Soulstone Miner.<br/><br/>Minion constructs included in Hoffman's starter box:<br/><br/>The Guardian - With potent spells like Shield Wall and Protect, plus the ability to armor nearby enemies, a healing flip that can be Assimilated, and a way to keep up with the rest of the crew, the Guardian is a stellar addition for any Constructs of Order crew. His weapons include a Sword and Shield, the latter granting a damage flip (with 2 negative twists) even on a miss, guaranteeing a minimum of 2 damage when used in tandem with Machine Puppet.<br/><br/>The Hunter - With the ability to shadow speedier models, the Hunter offers a much needed independent Construct to guard objectives and chase down models. It's not going to stand up to a lot of punishment, however, so make sure to utilize Ambush when possible, and keep it at range of your foes.<br/><br/>The Watcher - It not only has an invaluable set of deck maintenance abilities, it also has some great abilities for C. Hoffman to Assimilate, notably Slow to Die.<br/><br/>",

The rulebook comes with it&rsquo;s own board and paper models to allow for quick start to play; however, since gameplay takes place on a hex board, scale is not limited.<br/><br/>Players use a system to record their actions each turn and perform them in the order of a contested Initiative, which is determined by a roll off with modifiers for gear based on weight. Although Actions are recorded, maneuvering takes place in each turn as players perform counter strikes and have chances to maneuver in response to their opponent. Guard and Facing play a role in this.  Gladiators use their Fortitudo (used for striking), Agilito (used for defense and movement), and Virtus (used for stamina and as a resource pool) to perform their Actions each turn through the phases. As wounds are dealt, Gladiators become weaker.<br/><br/>Weapons have different effects against different armor and carry their own advantages and disadvantages in relation to the fighting styles. For example the Thracian's Sica is able to reach behind a Myrmillo's shield more effectively.  Striking takes place with models either targeting specific areas of the body or attacking untargeted areas with both players rolling in Attack/Defense. Armor for specific areas hit are taken into account and then if the attack passes through the armor the player rolls on a Wounding Table which can lead to anything from a Stun to a Fatal Wound. Fatal Wounds are worked up to, Stuns count as Modifiers to Abilities and subsequent rolls on the Wound Table. Gameplay invloves combatants striking, counter striking and working each other over in the process.<br/><br/>As this action is taking place, a Gladiator can attempt to ask for Missus, i.e. Mercy (if the match allows!) and depending on his performance and roll on the Missus table he could prolong his fighting career before being seriously wounded.<br/><br/>",

These either show a flower or a beetle on one side. <br/>The tiles are laid out face down. Players take turns rolling the die and flipping over a tile. If it shows a flower in the color matching the die, the player gets to keep it. If not, the tile is flipped back. The player with most flowers at the end of the game wins. <br/>As tiles come in four different shapes (because the flowers have a different number of petals) and each color/shape combination exists only once, there is a deduction element - if there is only one tile left with a given shape, it must be the beetle.<br/><br/>",

Choose another consultant (without the other players seeing which one).<br/>- Pay 2 points and a consultant. 'Upgrade' this consultant to a principal of the same color. Show other players this principal.<br/>- Pay 6. Same action as above, but withouth showing any card to the other players.<br/>- Pass.<br/><br/>A project has 5 phases. Consultants have to be placed first at the 1st phase. Only then can a consultant be placed with the second phase. And so on.<br/>The last or the last two consultants always have to be principals.<br/><br/>If a project is finished (that is consultant for phase 5 has been played) it is scored, the project and the consultants are put at the discard pile. A new project is then placed on the table.<br/><br/>Once all players have passed, the playing round is over and points are scored.<br/><br/>Every project is scored. Points being awarded 6/4/2/1 (later 10/6/4/2). The further towards the end of the project a consultant lies, the more points it generates.<br/><br/>After scoring all cards remain with the projects. Players can therefore score multiple times for the same consultant.<br/><br/>IT's All In The Game in a few words: <br/>- Lots of interaction. <br/>- Tactical choices. <br/>- Basic game with two expansions. <br/>- Unexpected depth.<br/><br/>For now it is only available with Dutch game rules.<br/><br/>",

In the basic included scenario, players are locked inside of the mall and searching for keys to unlock a door and a radio that will allow them to call for help and be rescued.<br/><br/>Zombie Mall can be played as a cooperative game, with all players working together toward the end goal of being rescued.  Zombie Mall may also be played where it&rsquo;s every man for himself (sometimes you have to sacrifice a friend to keep from becoming zombie food).<br/><br/>While searching the mall, players will come across Loot (random items &amp; events) and will find Objectives (hopefully one of those keys that will unlock something important, but possibly something not helpful &ndash; such as a swarm of hiding zombies).<br/><br/>That mall map is constructed from Map Tiles which may be configured differently each time you play Zombie Mall.  Sample layouts are shown in Sample Tile Layouts.  The size of your mall directly affects the difficulty, as larger malls will take longer to search and increase the odds of running into hordes of hungry zombies.<br/><br/>One thing that makes Zombie Mall different from many other games in the zombie genre is that players aren&rsquo;t forced to constantly scrounge for weapons.  Basic combat takes into account that players are grabbing whatever is handy and using everything possible as a weapon.  In addition, the players are not treated as ninja trained since childhood, so those randomly grabbed items are more than likely thrown or lodged into a zombie when used.  There are weapons to be found, but the odds are good that a given weapon won&rsquo;t be durable for more than a couple of uses.<br/><br/>",

The members of the Syndicate trapped him and made him their lab pet. All this time, they try to reform his mind but they do not know that another group of people was watching his moves and knows what he wanted to achieve. On the side of the city this team plans to rescue the detective. A couple days later, the team tries to penetrate the Amytiville Asylum and they achieve it. They found the detective tied on a bed, drugged and they save him from his torture. Thanks to their plan, they managed to take him and transfer them to their hiding. There, the mastermind of the team has a plan. He has built a dangerous device capable of entering the detective's mind. The team agrees that they will try to awake the detective from his Lethargos but they must first come to same state as the detective through the new device and there is a high possibility that they will die from the pressure their minds will suffer.<br/><br/>In Lethargos you lead the members of the team trying to find information and awake the detective. You enter to his dream asylum and there you have to face several Ghosts, trapped memories of the detective inside his own mind which try to kill you but occasionally to help you. The Ghosts which own several abilities, are managed by an extra player who takes the role of the detective. Your purpose here is to open the 6 of the 12 Asylum Tiles and then to find the real exit in order to escape. When the last tile is revealed, several walls and one real exit are placed around the tiles and you must find the real one. If one of the team reaches the real exit, then all the team escapes the dream world.<br/><br/>In each round the players follow some certain actions: Movement and Search. Each player can move 1 space inside an Asylum Tile and can search the different rooms on that tile by drawing cards. These cards give different abilities which allow to the players to reveal new Asylum Tiles and trap the Ghost. At the end of each player's turn the Detective-Player rolls a special 6-sided die and based on the result he can activate a Ghost and hit a player. The Detective-Player handles an Event Deck and activates such a card for each new revealed Asylum Tile and he also owns the Phobometer. The Phobometer includes several numbers and each time a Ghost hits a Player, the Phobometer is increased. If the Phobo token reaches the last number, then you lose the game. In this game all the players must work together in order to survive and escape the Detective's Dream World. Be prepared to face your worst living nightmare!<br/><br/>Fear is your only god!<br/><br/>",

Now, armies are on the march, war has erupted on every front, and the Republic of the Sphere&mdash;once a sign of mankind&rsquo;s hope for a brighter future&mdash;has retreated behind its fortress walls to prepare for the inevitable.<br/><br/>Field Manual: 3145 updates the military and political state of the Inner Sphere as it stands in the year 3145. This report includes a brief history and overview of recent developments in the BattleTech universe, as well as current TO&amp;Es for the major &rsquo;Mech forces and mercenary commands employed by the realms and Clans of the Dark Age Inner Sphere. Special era-specific rules are also included, enabling players to create characters and forces for use in campaigns set in and after this critical point in BattleTech history.<br/><br/>",

Each card is specific to a certain chess piece and when played will modify that piece's move, capture, and/or add a special effect. Every round a player may use a card or move as normal. Once the card is played, the player discards it and draws a new one.<br/>These cards are placed face up and everyone knows exactly what each other can do. In this way, you're still basically playing chess. Strategy is still king. However, you now have to play on your toes and by the seat of your pants. Rogue Chess will challenge your ability to adjust strategy much like actual battle. Because no plan survives contact with the enemy.<br/><br/>",

Their turn ends immediately if they are sent to their cell, and a cell search will mean that one of their collected items may be confiscated by the prison guards (and discarded).<br/><br/>Instead of rolling the search dice on their turn, a player can opt to roll the &lsquo;Steal&rsquo; dice to try and take an item from another player&rsquo;s cell. This option comes with its own set of perils; your opponent may stop you with a &lsquo;shank&rsquo;, you may be sent to the &lsquo;Hole&rsquo; (you remain in the hole on each subsequent turn until you roll to leave), or there may be a cell transfer meaning that all your items change hands.<br/><br/>When you have collected all the items on your escape plan you win the game.

The locations' special effects may or may not be activated depending on the cards drawn. The player then sets these cards up on a timeline, following certain number restraints. After seven days have been completed this way, the player may choose to end the game and count points, or to loop the week to try to improve his points by adding and/or replacing cards on the timeline.<br/><br/>The completed games forms a &quot;story&quot; of the last week of the world, which characters the player encountered, and what finally happened.<br/><br/>Last Seven Days allows for cooperative play if two card sets are available.<br/><br/>",

The Great Houses, using Minions as ark and peculiar as the town itself, vie for control of Hemoch's districts.<br/><br/>The Long Night is ending, and you have precious little twilight remaining to assert you House's dominance over the city's 4 districts. In 8 nights, the sun rises, and in that time, you must use the Spoils of the Vault of Darkness to draw as many minions to your side as you can, while thwarting the rival House's plans.<br/><br/>One of Small Box Games' most anticipated reprintings, Hemloch has received an overhaul; both graphically and mechanically, drawing from the mood, theme, and mechanics that made Hemloch a well regarded two player game and melding them with new mechanics and more dynamic gameplay.<br/><br/>While this game is specifically Hemloch: Vault of Darkness (a game of 2 players), as a bonus in this limited edition, the material needed to play an additional game, Shadow of the Sun (a game for 3-4 players), is included.<br/><br/>This limited edition print run is limited to 500 copies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the Eastlands of Dothmora, a realm riven by intrigue, feuding lords and warbands fighting in the secretive Shadow War. It is a land steeped in rune magic and blood, yet one where the various races &ndash; humans, elves, dwarfs, fauns, trolls, ogres, orcs, goblins and halflings &ndash; live in harmony, owing allegiance not to race but to one of the mighty factions that make up this war-torn kingdom.<br/><br/>Twelve Elements of War is a 28mm Tabletop skirmish wargame. A typical warband will include between 7 - 12 models (depending on your faction and style of play), activating one model at a time. Players alternate turns activating models, keeping both players engaged and thinking. Despite only activating one model at a time, it successfully simulates combined attacks with multiple models; the first attacks in a round weaken and lock-down a model, making it easier to finish off by attackers later in a round.<br/><br/>It uses a multiple D6 dice, one-roll system for all rolls during a battle. Roll a number of dice equal to the Model Statistic that you are using to attack/defend/employ, add bonus dice if you have an advantage of some type, like charging. Compare the result of this roll to the enemy model's statistic or enemy model's roll to see if you succeed. The dice system does not use charts or tables &amp; is used for all rolls, making the game extremely easy to learn.<br/><br/>The broad range of Faction Lists each bring something special to the battlefield, and each faction choose from the 9 fantasy races. Each Faction is balanced to each other, despite having multiple fantasy races and at least 6 roles per Faction to choose from. Successfully employing a variety of different races performing melee, shooting or magic roles on the battlefield is the key to winning.<br/><br/>Over 20 different mission combinations ensures that each game of Twelve Elements of War will different from the next. Creating a balanced warband is only the start; quick thinking, using the right model at the right time &amp; an assertive battleplan is the key to completing your objectives while denying your opponent theirs.<br/><br/>The fun with Twelve Elements of War doesn't finish after one game. Twelve Elements of War has a complete Campaign system that sees your models gain experience, better abilities, new skills, money and magical runic items as they play battles and also explore the world of Lumria acquiring strange and unique items. You will also have the option to visit a town after each game. In town you can choose to go to the Tavern to recruit new members and heroes, The Market to purchase new items and equipment, the Arena to watch pit fighting and maybe pick up a few pointers. Lastly the Temple, where you can prey to the gods to heal your wounds or ask for their blessing in future battles. In addition to visiting these places, you roll on one of four unique &ldquo;random encounter charts&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Games can be played on a vast variety of battlefield types, from cautious tactical advances in the snow covered Forest of Sighs, to fast paced skirmishes leaping from building top to building top in the sprawling Port City of Arcadia.<br/><br/>Lastly, with 100's of magical  item combinations to try out and over 36 unique runic spells to cast with your magic users, this game has a large amount of re-playability.<br/><br/>Factions in the core book include:<br/><br/>- The elite soldiers of Highguard, vying to restore their city-state to its former glory.<br/>- The tough, guerrilla warriors of the Mining Guild, seeking to control valuable mineral resources across the continent.<br/>- The Geniocracy of Toth, who strive to expand their knowledge of technology, science and magic &ndash; by sword&rsquo;s edge if need be. <br/>- The sorcerers of the Shadow Hold, adepts at runic magic, and served by thrall workers and brainwashed fighters. They scour the land for lost runic artifacts and raid other factions to capture   slaves. <br/>- The stern Keepers of Talon Crag Citadel, who have vowed to the gods to hunt down all who dare toy with the more dangerous aspects of runic magic.<br/><br/>With more to follow n the future.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In ancient legend the mythic Tuatha d&eacute; Danann arrived on the shores of Ireland and there they met the mighty Fomor, they of chaos and nature. And there ensued at Mag Tuireadh a terrible battle for control of the lands and their treasures...<br/><br/>The Fomorian War is a card game for 3 or 4 players lasting about 30 minutes. Players secretly choose Tuatha deities to help them in battle as part of a clan as they fight for control of the lands and treasures of Ireland. They can also appeal to the Fomor for help of an underhanded sort or use the power of sacred items. Winning a battle for their clan gains Victory Points.<br/><br/>The game continues for a series of rounds or until all the lands and their treasures are held by one clan. The player with the most Victory Points is then declared the winner.<br/><br/>Needed to play - The deck of 54 cards and 2 eurocubes per player. Players may elect to keep score with pen and paper.<br/><br/>Play:<br/><br/>Each round of the game is played in the same order of phases.<br/><br/>Phase 1 - Battle Area. Depending on their chosen detiy, a player will choose which two cards in the Circle of Cards which will be the Battle Sites. The two cards chosen must show different Clan Holding Icons in the lower left. The cards must be adjacent to each other.<br/><br/>Phase 2 - Choose Tuatha Ally. The current start player will shuffle the Tuatha Deck and discard two cards face down to the center of the Circle of Cards, and then choose one of the remaining cards from the deck, keeping it secret from the other players. They will then pass the rest of the deck the player to their left to choose a card from those that remain. The deck will be passed this way until each player has chosen a card. Any remaining cards are discarded to the center.<br/><br/>Phase 3 - Reveal Warrior Cards. Each player, beginning with the current start player, will now play one or more Warrior Cards in front of them, face up for all other players to see. These Warrior Cards will add Battle Point Values, for their clans, to the respective Battle Site cards and their initial Battle Point Values.<br/><br/>Players of the same clan are trying to beat the combined Battle Point Value of the other clan.<br/><br/>Phase 4 - Reveal Tuatha Allies. Now each player will, in turn, reveal their hidden Tuatha Ally. The current start player will call out the numbers in order (from 1 to 7) and the player possessing that numbered card will reveal it and the power of that card may be used by the player. Tuatha allies are resolved in order.<br/><br/>Phase 5 - Resolve Battle. After the Tuatha, and Sacred Item and Fomor powers have been resolved, total the Battle Point Values for each clan and compare. The winner is the clan with the most Battle Points. The losing clan&rsquo;s Battle Site card is flipped over to the other side to show the winning clan&rsquo;s alignment icon. In the case of a tie, no Battle Site cards are flipped and no Victory Points are awarded in Phase 6.<br/><br/>Phase 6 - Victory Points. All players of the winning clan receive Victory Points as stated by the chart at the bottom the winning Battle Site card. Track Victory Points on the Score Card.<br/><br/>Phase 7 - Discard and Draw new Warrior Cards or add Cattle Herd.<br/>Discard all used Warrior Cards to the discard pile.<br/><br/>Phase 8 - New Start Player. The player to the left of the current start player is now the new start player.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/><br/>The game ends in one of two ways:<br/>A. After 8 rounds if playing with 4 players, or 9 rounds if playing with 3 players.<br/>B. If all of the cards in the Circle show the same Clan Holding icon.<br/><br/>At this point the player with the most Victory Points is the winner. In the event of a tie the player with the most Cattle Herd Cards played is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to move your checkers from a starting point to one of the available exits (the opponents' starting points).<br/><br/>During your turn, rolls the dice, then moves one of your checker by the corresponding number of cases. Whenever possible introduce a new checker on the board.<br/>Checkers movement is limited by simple rules: 1) moving back and forth during the same turn is also prohibited; 2) moving through other checkers is not permitted; 3) finishing the movement on an opponent's checkers removes it from the game; 4) finishing the movement on a blue case removes your checker from the game.<br/>Also, having one of your checkers being removed while standing on one of the white cases surrounding your starting point allows you to recover the removed checker.<br/><br/>The game ends when there is only one player with checkers left on the board and scoring is done as such: 1) saved checkers: 2pts each; 2) checkers on the board: 1 pt each; 3) removed checkers: 0 pt each.<br/><br/>The length of the game can be shortened by starting with fewer checkers.<br/><br/>",

The most anticipated event, of course, is the legendary lunchtime battle! No one wants to be sent off on an errand to buy lunch for all the others, so brace yourself and fight for your monster's dignity!<br/><br/>In Monster College: Lunchtime Battle, each player chooses one monster from his hand to join the &quot;counting circle&quot; each turn. Based on the die roll and a counting process, 1-3 unfortunate monsters are fingered to buy lunch for others (earning minus points along the way for the corresponding players) &mdash; but these candidate monsters are so childish that in later turns they'll use their special abilities to bend the counting rules in their favor. In the end, the player whose collected candidate monsters show the most overall &quot;hunger&quot; loses the game and must go buy lunch (or whatever else they agreed to before the game) for everyone else!<br/><br/>一年一度的進修日又到了，平時在各大遊戲扮演稱職壞蛋的魔物們再度回到校園，認真複習各種魔物必修技能。好不容易撐過早上的課程，魔物們最期待的午餐時間終於到了！今年究竟是哪個班級的魔物要當跑腿小弟去幫大家買便當呢？這場年度便當大戰即將揭開序幕！<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A traditional Dutch game from the Zeeland region, very similar to the version of the Danish-Norwegian game Gnav or the Swedish Kille, played with wooden pawns rather than cards, of which it is a derivative; all of these games are actually reimplements of the 16th century French 'hazard' card game Coucou, later popularized in 17th century Italy as Cucc&uacute; (Cuckoo).<br/><br/>A set consists of 42 wooden pawns with a number or picture hidden under the base. Each of the 21 subject occurs twice: the numbers from 0 to 12, the trumps &quot;Rider&quot;, &quot;Bird&quot;, &quot;Cat&quot; and &quot;Inn&quot; above the numbers, and &quot;Whitebread&quot;, &quot;Mug&quot;, &quot;Pot&quot; and &quot;Jester&quot; below.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player recieves a number of point tokens. In each round, each player draws one pawn from a bag and secretly looks at its value. Then the players in order decides whether to keep their pawn or trade it with the following player. If that player holds a trump, special rules for each trump applies, otherwise the pawns are traded. At the end of the round, the player with the lowest valued pawn loses one of their point tokens.<br/><br/>A player who runs out of point tokens is out of the game. The last remaining player is the winner.<br/><br/>It is not known exactly when this little known variant first appeared. It must be after the the wooden pawn variant of Gnav &ndash; originally a card game &ndash; gained popularity as an effect of a ban on playing cards by the pietist king Christian VI of Denmark-Norway (1730&ndash;1746). On the other hand it probably did not happen very much later, as it lacks a couple of the developments otherwise separating Gnav from other games in the Cuccu family.<br/><br/>",

This game, based on Josh Howard's Image comic book series, has players taking on the role of the main character Nara and her friends. They will have to collect and use an arsenal of weapons that can range from knives to powerful magic. These weapons are used to push back the seemingly endless army from Hell. One player will use an evil avatar to summon these minions. Using characters right out of comic they will attempt to open portals to Hell at locations around the town of Darlington Hill.<br/><br/>The struggle between the factions plays out in the supply deck of cards as well as at the locations. Each card that the players acquire has a use for either the good or the evil player. The more powerful cards for one is a weaker card for the other. Players may take on aggressive or defensive strategies while building their decks. The game concludes as one player opens the gates to Hell or the other banishes them to the darkness.<br/><br/>",

Each of these artists have traded in their pencils and brushes for battle armor and wands in an effort to embrace their inner swordsman, warrior, and healer. This exhibition of artwork celebrates each artist as a creator, individual, and a modern-day art hero and role model.<br/><br/>Each artist's self-portrait represents a character in the game that players use to outwit their enemies, form their ranks, battle against foes, define their allies, and go to battle in the hope of obtaining influence and, ultimately, power over the fallen land of Vyk'Tornaahl.<br/><br/>At heart Rolemodels is a poker variant with additional rules and flavor. Players start the game with five cards in hand. Three cards from the deck are revealed to form the Adventurer's Tavern. At the start of a round, the dealer rolls a d20 die to determine the amount of influence up for grabs. Each player then takes one of two actions on his turn:<br/><br/><br/>    Draw two cards, one from the Adventurer's Tavern and the other from the face-up cards or the deck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Declare battle, which takes place in two phases:<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Scout Phase: Whoever started the battle plays two cards (called &quot;Scouts&quot;) face up in front of him. Each other player in turn decided whether to pass or join the battle; in the latter case, they also play two Scouts face up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Reinforcements Phase: First, a player can choose to surrender and withdraw from battle. All players who don't surrender, then simulaneously play and reveal three cards as reinforcements. Whoever has the strongest cards wins the available influence; in games with three and four players, the second best hand wins half this amount of influence.<br/><br/><br/>After discard all played cards, the player who initiated battle draws two cards, then a new round begins. When one player has fifty or more influence, the game ends and he wins.<br/><br/>",

Ariadne the daughter of King Minos of Crete and his wife Pasiphae, fell in love with the dashing Greek hero Theseus. Now according to the myth, it was Ariadne who helped Theseus to escape the Labyrinth by supplying him with a sword to kill the Minotaur and a ball of thread to navigate the tangled passages&hellip;<br/><br/>THREAD&ndash; An orthogonally connected group of five or more like color cards.<br/><br/>The goal is to have the most points within your color threads.<br/><br/>THE DECK &ndash; Remove the 10s from a 52-card deck and divide the rest of the deck into red suit cards and black suit cards. You will also need one Joker card with a different color back and a way of keeping score. Aces can be either high or low. An Ace can beat a King but a King cannot beat an Ace. Cards are ranked in this order (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-J-Q-K-A) A=1 or 14, J =10, Q=11, K=12.<br/><br/>PLAY&ndash; Player 1 has the black suit cards and Player 2 has the red suit cards.<br/><br/>Thoroughly shuffle each other&rsquo;s decks and return them.<br/><br/>The decks are placed face down in front of their respective players, these are now the draw decks from which the players will draw cards from during the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in 2 rounds.<br/><br/>The back side of the Joker card will be the Minotaur and the face of the card will be our hero Theseus.<br/><br/>At the start of the first round the Joker card is placed face down at the center of the tableau and at the start of the second round the Joker card is placed face up at the center of the tableau.<br/><br/>Each player at the start of a round draws 3 cards from their draw deck to their hand.<br/><br/>In round 1 the player holding the black suit cards plays first, while in round 2 the player holding the red suit cards plays first.<br/><br/>Players take turns.<br/><br/>On your turn you may take 1 of 3 actions:<br/><br/>1.Play a card from your hand face up to the tableau or<br/><br/>2.You may swap out the last card played with a higher ranking card from your hand as long as the lower card does not divide evenly into the higher card or the lower card is not one number below the higher card. Then flip over and move the swapped card to a different spot on the tableau or<br/><br/>3.Swap out the Joker card with a card from your hand and then flip the Joker card over and move it to a different spot on the tableau.<br/><br/>Players then draw a card from their draw decks returning their hands to 3 cards, this now ends a player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>&bull;Once players run out of cards in their draw decks they continue to play the cards that are left in their hands.<br/>&bull;The game ends when all the cards have been played to the tableau.<br/>&bull;The round is then scored.<br/><br/>CONSTRAINTS &ndash; All cards must touch at least one other card either orthogonally or diagonally.<br/><br/>Cards may not be played on top of other cards.<br/><br/>You may not play a card from your hand to the tableau so that the playing area exceeds 7 cards in any direction, this also applies to moving a card.<br/><br/>SCORING &ndash; The point values of the cards are as follows: Aces are worth 1 point, (2-9) are face value and (J-Q-K) are worth 10 points each.<br/><br/>To score a round, add up all the threads in your color suit.<br/><br/>If the Joker card is face down and is orthogonally adjacent to one of your threads you subtract 10 points from your score. If the Joker card is face up and is orthogonally adjacent to one of your threads you add 10 points to your score.<br/><br/>Finally players add up their scores from both rounds and the player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>If after scoring both rounds there is a draw, play another round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ever wondered what it's like to work in the stressful environment of a hospital? Do you have what it takes to ensure the health and safety of your patients who have needs that can change from minute to minute?<br/><br/>Acute Care is a co-operative board game in which players take on the role of nurses staffing a busy medical/surgical unit in a hospital setting. Through one 12-hour shift, they must work together to provide care for their patients and deal with emergencies and complications as they arise &mdash; ideally achieving a high level of quality while doing so.<br/><br/>The most precious and limited resource for real-life nurses is their time, so in Acute Care time &mdash; in the form of &quot;time cubes&quot; &mdash; is exactly what you must spend in order to complete tasks and care for patients. Each hour, you have six times cubes (each representing ten minutes of real time) to allocate to various tasks; cards that require you to spend time cubes have little boxes on which to place the cubes to indicate that you're performing that action.<br/><br/>Since the players are all working together, the Challenge Deck provides the opposition to the players throughout the game. Each card drawn from it represents some challenge or opportunity that the nurses must face in order to care for their patients and manage the unit.<br/><br/>Gauging success in a healthcare setting can be difficult. Having patients get better and discharging them home are the main goals, but the quality of care provided is also important, regardless of the outcome. Quality care includes patient satisfaction, staff cooperation, timeliness, performance improvement, and effective patient and family education, so in Acute Care, success is measured on a scale of quality points earned or lost, eventually leading to either Commendations (for high quality) or Deficiencies (for low quality).<br/><br/>",

At any time, a player may spend one of their two veto chips to veto another player's move, announcing a new restriction under which that move is illegal (such as &quot;players may not move more than six stations in a turn&quot;). In doing so, the players gradually build a set of restrictions for how the game is to be played. Play continues until a player is able to reach Mornington Crescent without having their move vetoed.<br/><br/>By framing all discussion of additional rules as mere &quot;reminders&quot; of a deeper, undisclosed ruleset, the game appears to an audience to be a fully-formed boardgame rather than something that the players are largely inventing on the fly.<br/><br/>",

If both players choose the same counties they will have to bribe and negotiate with each other until one backs down.<br/><br/>Then, each county is resolved individually. The active player will choose pairs of tiles secretly arranged by their opponent.

        "description": "Typhoon is a set of miniatures rules for modern jet combat, specifically designed as an introductory level game for those gamers who wish to use the most current aircraft, but to not get bogged down in the complexity of hi-tech jet warfare. The game&rsquo;s systems allow each player to control several jets in a fast paced game that can be easily completed in a few hours.<br/><br/>Modern jet combat, particularly with aircraft such as the F-22, Eurofighter, and SU-35 can be extremely complex with the wide variety of radars, ECM, DDS, weapons, etc., which can bring a game to a crawl when using these planes. Typhoon attempts to incorporate the technology into the various game systems which lets the players fly and fight their jets without having to worry about whether or not you have enough chaff or flares still left in your dispensers to defeat the enemy&rsquo;s next attack.<br/><br/>This makes Typhoon an ideal way to get new gamers into the modern jet combat era as they can focus on the basics of jet<br/>combat instead of memorizing a two page sequence of play. The game is designed to be used without a hex mat or special stands, so this will let gamers use any miniatures that they have and however they are currently mounted for the game.<br/><br/>Hopefully, Typhoon will introduce gamers to the exciting world of hitech jet combat and let them use some of the most powerful aircraft in aviation history in a fun and fast moving game.<br/><br/>",

In an attempt to avoid this plague, Prince Prospero and a thousand of his closest friends have shut themselves inside the seven rooms of his castellated abbey. One night, the prince decides to throw a masquerade ball to keep his friends entertained. But while this ball is in full swing, a masked figure, of who had not been seen before, has started to make its way throughout the rooms of the abbey. Angered by this figure&rsquo;s mask of a plague ridden corpse, the prince tried to kill the figure but was killed in the process. Now the prince&rsquo;s nobles are hunting for the masked figure that at some point covered its mask with another. Now nobody knows who is who in this game of bluffing, deduction, and hand management.<br/><br/>In this game for 2 to 6 players, the game begins with the abbey of seven rooms being built and each player receiving one role card. The roles are kept hidden as they will be revealed during game play. Each player then selects one of the seven rooms where they will start the game. On each player's turn they will have a variety of actions that will allow them to trap, kill, or reveal other players, move throughout the abbey, or use a key to unlock a trap. They can perform these actions by using the cards that they draw. The goal of the game is to be the first collect five victory points and can do so by being a Noble alive at the end of the round or by not being trapped at the end of the round if playing as The Red Death.<br/><br/>Awards<br/>2014 MicroGame Contest Best Theme<br/>2014 MicroGame Contest People's Choice - 4th Place<br/><br/>",

This is the story of its Uprising...'<br/><br/>In Uprising, players take on the role of either the King of Enderlin or one of the Rebels working towards toppling the Empire. In this all vs. one scenario, players must defeat the opposing forces through the use of influence and diplomacy - swaying the ten unique Districts of Enderlin to their cause by the actions that they take. The Districts of Enderlin are the key to victory. Only through his influence on the people can the King squelch the rebellion that has arisen. Only through their influence on the masses can the Rebels hope to topple the tyrant. Who the player influences determines their bonuses and abilities as well as the ultimate fate of Enderlin. Use your Influence wisely to sway the Districts of Enderlin for your forces!<br/><br/>",

Henchmen are the backbone of society but they&rsquo;re never appreciated and are often killed, strangled, beat up, or even shot off of high ledges...and this game won't be any different!<br/><br/>3 to 6 players will work with or against each other to earn as much ca$h as possible before the end of the game in order to please Da Boss but watch out, taking on a job could alert the Super Jerk who won't think twice to kill half of everyone's henchmen! If 5 Super Jerks are revealed, the game will end and the player with the most ca$h will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>Henchmen! is a fun, easy to learn game that is fast paced and has great replay value. The art was all done by the game's designer Daniel Lanza and was styled to be a call-back to famous television shows and movies of the 80's and 90's that truly emphasized the henchmen stereotype we all grew up loving.<br/><br/>We hope you enjoy this truly unique game!<br/><br/>",

With the world, art, and visual designs created by artist John Hathway, and game system designer Takashi Sakaue, this is JH Lab's latest attempt to expand &quot;true understanding&quot; of otaku culture.<br/><br/>The game is set in a possible future world where science and spirituality have merged, causing a certain regression of technology. Mainly, it is found that spirits could be contained in now-defunct vacuum tubes, which could in turn be used to power various robots and androids. Human beings could transfer their consciousness into androids, and man-made androids could develop human intelligence. The world has embraced this discovery, doing away with any national, religious or ethnic segregation. Instead, people are identified by their intelligence.<br/><br/>The game utilizes 4 different types of cards. 1, The Android Cards are your main cards which are built up and strengthened by the other cards. 2, The Resource Cards strengthen the androids. 3, The Unique Resrouce Cards are one time use cards capable of changing the properties of gameplay. And, 4, Assist Cards are one time use robots that have the ability to shift the flow of battle! Using these cards, your goal is either to destroy all your opponent's androids, or completely deplete their main card deck.<br/><br/>",

With no one else, the Doctor's past regenerations have been gathered to help. Whoever finds the Black Scroll and escapes first wins!<br/><br/>TARDIS Run is a 3D printed, Print 'n Play, two-player game as inspired by Backgammon, Parcheesi and Senet, a game played by the Ancient Egyptians. This game turns the standard &quot;roll and move&quot; upside down by making you choose which character to move before you throw the paddles and add them up to move the piece you've chosen. But the very uneven distribution of the paddles means you can rely on the pieces probably moving 3 spaces. However, when the black scroll of Rassilon is found (by rolling all blanks) with it's 2x multiplier on one side the statistics become considerably harder to predict.<br/><br/>The board for this game is designed to fold into a neat carrying case that holds everything necessary to play inside.<br/><br/>",

Anno Domini: Bern focuses on the capital city of Switzerland. Like all Anno Domini sets, this game can be played as a standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>In Anno Domini: Bern, each player receives nine cards (or fewer, if you want the game to be shorter) and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/><br/>If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement &ndash; receives three cards. The first player with no cards remaining in hand wins.<br/><br/>",

You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals.

        "description": "Imperial-Orion is a print and play derivative of Imperial 2030 by Mac Gerdts.<br/><br/>It  takes the basic premise of Imperial, that the players are amoral financiers and twists it so that players are shadowy 'powers' in a grand space opera. The game takes its name from the Orion Nebula which is used as the backdrop to the central (neutral) region of human (known) space.<br/><br/>At some time in the future humans have expanded among the stars. In the more densely populated areas colonies are connected by wormhole networks whilst vast fleets span the trackless expanses of the void. Contact has been made with a number of alien races around the periphery of human space but for the most part this has been peaceful and limited to scientific missions and the exchange of ambassadors. As a generalisation humanity is content, inward looking and exploited - by you, the players of the game.<br/><br/>This game is played on a board composed of 7 hexagonal tiles, comprising 6 regional powers and a central neutral zone that may have different configurations depending on the episode of galactic 'history' the players choose to replay. Additional part-tiles are arranged around the edge of the board to make the playing area into a regular hexagon. These part-tiles are of 2 different types and can have a significant effect on the topology of the game board.<br/><br/>In Imperial-Orion the players do not take turns, the six regional powers do, in an order that is determined randomly at the start of each game. The players are shadowy organisations who exercise power through unspecified means to further their own ends. By gaining control of the population of the regional powers,<br/>the players influence the politics. The player with more control over a region's population gains control of that power's government and decides what the it will do. As control of a government can change with each new surge of controlled population, players may be able to manipulate several governments at the same time. As investors, players should not get too attached to a particular regional power, but rather focus on where their 'investments' have the best rates of return. Essentially the game is about power, in all its form: economic, cultural, military, biological&hellip;<br/><br/>",

The board has been enlarged from 8x8 to 10x10, and in addition to two more pawns, each player is given two of a new piece, the camel, which jumps two spaces in a straight orthogonal line (i.e. it is an orthogonal counterpart to the elephant and significantly weaker than the rook). The camels have variously been placed in the corners, in the fourth and seventh columns, and possibly in other configurations. The rules and pieces are otherwise the same as in Shatranj. The word &quot;kamil&quot; does not refer to the camel piece, but instead means &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;complete&quot;.<br/><br/>This game should not be confused with Tamerlane Chess, which is also referred to as Shatranj Kamil; most likely there were several other variants being ascribed the status of higher perfection.<br/><br/>",

This set of rules lets players begin their campaigns with small warbands of 10-20 miniatures of any scale and develop their forces over time, building them into armies hundreds strong. A unique system of command points and the need to carefully manage resources or risk becoming vulnerable to counter-attack have to be finely balanced against the need to gain objectives throughout the game, creating a challenging, but enjoyable environment for your armies.<br/><br/>",

It employs hidden team affiliations, asymmetric player powers and inter-player combat using a rock-paper-scissors resolution.  In addition to the Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoots, each game also incorporates a set of neutral factions: so the agendas of each player are never clear.<br/><br/>Players manage a hand of six cards: all different; each with a faction symbol (Mushroom, Bamboo Shoot or Neutral) in addition to the image of a rock, paper or scissors hand gesture. In a player's turn she may:<br/><br/>    Pass a card from hand secretly to another player to inquire as to their faction loyalties.  For the most part, a player responds &quot;yes&quot; if their affiliation matches the card, and &quot;no&quot; otherwise.  Some player affiliations require a false response to any query!<br/>    Attack another player.  Both players select a card from hand, then reveal together.  If tied, another card is played.  Cards played are unavailable for re-use until all six cards have been played: at that point all are reclaimed.<br/>    Reclaim one played card to her hand.<br/><br/><br/>The various player powers affect the actions:  some are strong one-shot powers; others more modest powers that always apply.<br/><br/>The game continues until one faction has achieved their victory.<br/><br/>",

Also, the cards may have arrows in one or more 8-way directions (up, diagonal up-right, right, diagonal down-right...) Each player starts with a 3x3 grid, 10 points of life and a deck of 25-40 cards. With the flip of a coin is decided the order of playing, at the first turn you must draw 5 cards and play 1 card, for the rest of the match you must have 5 cards in your hand (except when you have 0 cards on your deck)<br/><br/>The purpouse of the game is to combine at least 2 cards to produce a combination of at least 3 symbols. To combine the cards you must put them in the 3x3 grids and achieve to match the arrows (for example, a card in the second row and second column with an up arrow matches with a card with a down arrow that is in the first row and second column). The effect is determined by the greatest symbol value (except neutral, that haves no effect), in case of draw (for example, 2 sword and 2 crosses) the player chooses what effect it should be. Attack effect (sword) deducts 1 point of defence from the life of the opponent for each sword in the combination OR you can disable a card in the rival's 3x3 grid. Defence adds to the player 1 point of life for each shield in the combination. Revitalization can undisable 1 card in your grid.<br/><br/>There are 2 ways to win the game: by reducing the rival's life to 0 OR when the rival have cards in the hand and cannot play a card (the grid is filled with 9 cards that cannot combine in this turn) It should be noted that when a player haves 0 cards in its deck, losses 1 point of life at the start of his turn.<br/><br/>",

Each roll of the dice represents a single at-bat; the game information is then recorded with your own pencil and paper.<br/><br/>Advanced rules are included to permit for stolen bases, extra bases, and double plays.<br/><br/>",

No longer relegated to the shadows you and other Necromancers like you may emerge; offering understanding and defeat over death itself to the fearful people in exchange, merely, for their unquestioning and total obedience.<br/><br/>Your goal is to destroy all your opponents' villages and be the last necromancer left alive. Utilize the deaths of your enemies&rsquo; servants or even sacrifice your own to fuel your dark magic. Use your cards to build up your villages and summon afflictions and monstrosities to set upon, attack, and destroy your opponents&rsquo;.  You win when every other player is undead. Become the last in power and leave destruction in your wake. Nevertheless, beware your fallen foes--for, as a Necromancer, death is but a tool.<br/><br/>In Ritual, you always have a chance to come back and steal the win. It&rsquo;s a fun and unpredictable cutthroat card game for 3-5 players which is easy to learn and quick to play, yet offers significant strategic depth. How can you best use the cards you've drawn? Who shall you attack first? When will you make your final move and crush all who oppose you?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What&rsquo;s been missing in every wild-west shootout game you&rsquo;ve ever played? That&rsquo;s right: you don&rsquo;t get to point guns at one another.  Well, now you can!<br/><br/>Stetsons &amp; Sixguns is a fast-paced card game played over 8 rounds. Channelling iconic characters from classic Western adventures, 2-8 players compete to become the most notorious gunslinger in town.<br/><br/>Beginning with 4 Action Cards, you secretly select an Action to play, then draw your gun and point it at your target.  Decide whether to tough it out or dive for cover and reveal your Action Card.  Every Sixgun has Bullet counters loaded into its 6 chambers.  Flip a Bullet to see whether you hit your target.  They may be protected by Cover or the Action they played, but you can counter this with your own Action or a wily Special Ability unique to each character.  Those of you still standing at the end of the round gain a new Action to play.<br/><br/>Players gain Notoriety for shooting other &lsquo;slingers and holding valuable cards at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Expect lots of bangs and laughter: Stetsons &amp; Sixguns is fast, furious fun that puts the &lsquo;gun&rsquo; back into &lsquo;gunfight&rsquo;.<br/><br/>",

You're attempting to go out onto the mushroom mountain and bring back the most mushrooms, while also selling them for the best price at market. Mushroom Hunters is played using colored meeples, curved mushroom cards, and flat price cards. Who will be the best mushroom hunter?!<br/><br/>Initial setup of the game requires mixing up all of the curved mushroom cards and kind of shoving them into a big pile (aka mushroom mountain). Then shuffle all of the market / price cards and deal the top five face up and place the rest in a deck face down (which I messed up for this picture, oops!). Each player gets all 5 of their specified meeple color.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, they can take one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1) Place one of your meeples on any ONE mushroom card on mushroom mountain. The meeple must have both feet touching the card and must be STANDING in order to count. If it falls, I think you must remove it from mushroom mountain and your turn ends with no properly placed meeple mushroom hunters.<br/><br/>2) Return any ONE of your meeples, along with the card it is standing on, to your play area. The number of mushrooms on the card is the number that you have collected.<br/><br/>3) Return ALL of your meeples, along with the cards that they were standing on, to your play area. The number of mushrooms on ALL of these cards is the number that you have collected.<br/><br/>At any time during your turn, you can cash in any amount of mushrooms you have collected during the current or previous turns for a market / price card.<br/><br/>The game continues until either all of the market / sell cards have been taken by players, or all of the cards from mushroom mountain have been taken. Once the end is triggered, players count up their money and the player who has earned the most from their mushroom hunting adventure is declared the winner!<br/><br/>",

The Player Soldiers will attempt to gain Merit Points in order to advance in rank throughout various Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. Player Soldiers can be assigned to a Cavalry or Infantry Regiment serving in the British or French Armies. This game is especially suited for fans of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe Series, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Brigadier Gerard Series and Richard Howard's Alain Lausard series.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>The Objective of the Game is to have your Soldier be the first to complete his Career during the Napoleonic Wars. Career Progress is tracked by moving your Soldier&rsquo;s Counter along the Game Board&rsquo;s Career Track. The Career Track consists of Garrison Duty and Campaign Duty Assignments. These Assignments will result in a variety of situations and encounters including Skirmishes, Patrols, Battles, Encampment, Headquarters, Siege Assaults and Special Missions in which the Player&rsquo; Soldier must resolve. The outcome of these Encounters and Situations determine whether the Player&rsquo;s Soldier advances along the Career Track. While the Soldiers conduct Challenges, they might gain or lose Merit Points, which are used to improve their Attribute Ratings and Rank. The Player Soldier with the Highest Rank after reaching the Ending Space on the Career Track, is the Winner. If this is tied, then the Soldier with the most Merit Points remaining is the Winner. If this is tied then the Soldiers may conduct a Duel to determine the Winner.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to earn victory points by expanding your territory while making your opponent lose their territory.<br/><br/>You initially control a territory with three hexes and one robot token on the hexagonal grid board. Each turn, you move one of your robots to expand or secure your territory. A robot can move to any hex within your territory or one hex outside, including hexes marked by your opponent, except for a hex adjacent to or occupied by your opponent's robot.<br/><br/>After movement, place one of your occupation markers on the destination hex if there isn't a marker there already. This hex is now part of your territory. If the hex was your opponent's, they lose control of it, and if this causes their territory to be split, they lose control of all hexes not connected with their robot. Discard all their occupation markers on these hexes.<br/><br/>Your opponent's robots cannot move to one of your hexes adjacent to or occupied by your robot, so secure your territory by moving your robot wisely.<br/><br/>Some hexes have a higher value but have a special requirement to control. As you expand your territory, you will be able to deploy more robots and fulfill the requirement to control these hexes.<br/><br/>The game ends when either player uses up their 30 occupation markers. Add up your victory points earned by hexes you control and occupation markers your opponent discarded. The player with higher total wins the game.<br/>English rulebook is now available.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>２人用アブストラクト陣取りゲーム<br/>研究所の地下で２体のロボットが戦うゲーム。<br/>勝利条件：どちらかのプレイヤーの歯車タイルが０枚のとき、勝利点の多いプレイヤーが勝利。<br/>勝利点はボード上の歯車タイル＋獲得した相手の歯車タイル。<br/>ヘックスのボード上でロボットを動かし、自分の陣地を示す歯車タイルを置いて陣地を広げていく。<br/>ロボットは陣地の周り１マスに移動でき、相手の陣地も攻められる。<br/>ロボットの周り１マスの同陣営の歯車タイルは相手のロボットに攻められない。<br/><br/>",

Find the set that&rsquo;s right for you... or mix together characters from different sets to customize your own game!<br/><br/>A Trickster set has 49 cards with seven heroes, each with their own simple effect on play. A hero appears in seven different suits, each a color of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Each hero and suit combination appears once in a set.<br/><br/>The first player of each round may play any card from her hand. The second player in the round is called The Trickster, who may also pay any card from her hand. Any subsequent player that round must play a card that follows the pattern set by the Trickster. (If the first two cards are Yellow, then everyone must play a Yellow card.)<br/><br/>If you cannot follow the pattern, you must collect cards played this round into your personal scoring area. If everyone was able to play one card, then the Trickster collects the cards.<br/><br/>The goal of Trickster is to have the fewest cards by the time any player has emptied her hand. Whoever has the fewest cards is the winner... with one exception! If you have more cards of a suit than any other player, you may ignore those cards when scoring.<br/><br/>",

Together, gather colorful dots for her new outfit. And whoever has the ladybug at the end of the game wins and gets to fly around the room.<br/><br/>Getting started:<br/>Put the 12 colored dots on the leaf and place it in the middle of the table well within everybody&lsquo;s reach. The youngest player receives the plush ladybug and die. That&lsquo;s it! Now you can start the game.<br/><br/>Take turns in a clockwise direction. The youngest player slides on the plush ladybug over his or her right or left wrist. Then roll the die. Depending on what is showing on the die, here&lsquo;s what happens next:<br/><br/>- Hurray! A new color!<br/>Pick up a matching colored dot from the leaf and stick it on any free circle on the plush ladybug. It doesn&lsquo;t matter who has<br/>the ladybug around his wrist.<br/><br/>- Oh, oh. There are no more dots of this color!<br/>Are there no more dots on the leaf maching the color you just rolled? No problem. The player to your left tries his luck and rolls the die.<br/><br/>- Ladybug, change hands!<br/>You already have the ladybug on your wrist? Great! You can keep it! You don&lsquo;t have the plush ladybug? Then the player who has it has to give it to you. Slide the plush ladybug over your wrist.<br/><br/>- End of game:<br/>Have you attached all the colored dots onto the ladybug? Then the game is over. If you have the ladybug around your wrist, you&lsquo;ve won the game and get to fly once around the room! Ladybug, ladybug, flyyyyyy!!!<br/><br/>",

Each lake tile depicts 1 to 3 fish that players are trying to catch during the game by placing the highest value of like-colored lures around them.  A player&rsquo;s turn consists of two phases: movement and placement.  In the movement phase, players must move their boat token 1 or 2 spaces to a new unoccupied lake tile.  In the placement phase, players must select an available lure tile from their tackle box using a unique rondel mechanic and place it adjacent to the location of their boat.  After a set number of rounds, each of the lake tiles is scored and the player who caught the highest value of fish is the winner!<br/><br/>",

As you progress in telling the path you took, hour by hour other players will have a chance to interrupt, and change the sequence of events in their favor.  There is a lot of storytelling fun to be had and of course an incredible amount of strategy in what information you reveal or keep hidden from other players.<br/><br/>In the game, players will plot out their movement from area to area strategizing on what type of 'catch' they want to collect. If no one contests, they have first pick.  As the story progresses, other players will jump in to alter the events provided that they were in the location at or before the current player.  These interruptions allow the other players to sneak in and grab 'catches' that they want.  At the end of the game, players will total their catches and declare a winner!<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with three cards; and each turn, players must play one card onto a patron, and then draw one card.<br/><br/>It is most important that the patrons are kept happy. A happy patron gives generous tips. Each patron favors or dislikes some of the services that the entertainers provide, so serve each patron in a manner to make them most happy.<br/><br/>You entertain the patrons by playing cards onto a patron of your choice, which adds the promise of a tip. The amount of the tip increases as additional entertainment cards are played on the patrons. A player can only collect the accumulated tips on a patron by playing a &quot;Collect Tips&quot; card.<br/><br/>Once a player has collected enough Yen to end the game (based on number of players), they may choose to end the game by saying: &ldquo;I win.&rdquo; All players finish the current round, and the player with the most Yen is the winner. If players are tied for the most Yen, they share the victory!<br/><br/>Winner of the August 2015 24-Hour Game Design Challenge!

Ask smart and listen how the nut cracks.<br/>Not a game for people with brains like bricks#<br/><br/>16 cards with the values of 1 to 8. One card is placed face down - the aim is, to identify this card) The active player asks another player about a value between 1 and 8 (a game with all 16 cards (2x8) is quite complex...). The value has to be on his hand either as single card or as sum. The others answers either with &quot;No&quot; (no card/s with this value on my hand) or with the value in one or more cards. The other players just see the number of exchange cards, not their values.<br/>I.e. if one askes about a 6 and passes one card, is HAS to be the Six. If the other player passes two cards it might be 3/3, 4/2 or 5/1.<br/>Whoever indentifies the face down card correctly, wins.<br/><br/>Bauab &ndash; Buildown<br/>For 2 players<br/>It&acute;s a rough play amongst the building contractors. Save building sites for you, plan buildings, kick the others and force them to retreat.<br/><br/>Sorry, Folks, but this here is too complex, to explain it some sentences. Two players try to save construction areas for their own buildings, by placing planning-chips or reservation-chips on a variable board. Every player tries to take the last free area of his opponents chips - reminds me a bit on Go..., but of course, the game is faster and the value of the chips is important too.<br/><br/>Raufer &ndash; Upper<br/>For 3-4 players<br/>Chase the others through the staircases and take their opportunities to move. But take care that you are not sticked by yourself&hellip;<br/><br/>20 cards with values of 1 to 20. Quite easy card game. The active player plays a card and commends to the next &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;, which means to react with a higher or lower value. If possible, the player gives the next command to his neighbour. If not, he has to take an additional card. Bad luck, if nobody can react properly - than the first player has to take additional cards. So, recall all played cards. <br/>Winner is the player, who played his last card.<br/><br/>Misd<br/>3-8 Players<br/>Which symbol is missing? Is it missed really? A game for fast thinkers.<br/>Kids will blame you&hellip;<br/><br/>Everything planned?!<br/>For 3-4 players<br/>Is there a plan? Change places? Change Cards? Plan the use of your cards?<br/>Who plans with lack of plans, wins.<br/><br/>Schollenschubser &ndash; Floe pushers<br/>For 2-4 players<br/>Be the first to cross the icy sea over swaying floes to safety. Charity begins at home. Shurely not a game for the kindhearted&hellip;<br/><br/>Schlauraff &ndash; Smartsnatch <br/>For 2-4 players<br/>Use your dice perfectly and get the uppermost points. More than simple but never the same<br/><br/>Just a remark: since the producer delievered us... eh... somewhat insufficient dice (from our point of view...) we ordered better dice, and pass them with every sold box.<br/><br/>And another remark: authors of the games in this box are: Till Meyer, Klaus-Peter Rudolph and H.&amp;W. Fuhr<br/><br/>And another one: there only one language-based game in the box, but for this and all other games we offer an english rulesbook as download. It may need some time, since Christian enjoys his holidays and we want to present you grafics too - not just plain text. :-)<br/><br/>",

Every attempt to establish an outpost on its metal shores failed and just one survivor returned, telling tales of horror ad riches beyond imagination. The Emperor himself tasked the bravest and most resourceful nobles to claim the island in his name with the promise of eternal power and glory.<br/><br/>To win the game you have to develop your faction according to several different aspects: military power, territory, knowledge, fame and influence over the imperial court. To fulfil this objective players have to explore the island and exploit its resources to support the growth of their settlement and armies. The resources are found on tiles that are randomly spread across the game board.<br/>Turn by turn you have the opportunity to make wondrous scientific discoveries or exploit the natural magic of the island to unlock new structures for your settlement or units for your army. Exceptionally gifted individuals, heroes, will become your field agents, discovering the deepest and darkest secrets of this island.<br/>Conflicts over territory or resources are common between factions and, far from imperial supervision, what really matters is the end not the means to reach it. The island itself, however, reacts to human presence, trying to reestablish order by cleansing the land from all living beings.<br/><br/>What pathway will you choose to become the Emperor&rsquo;s favorite? Force, wealth, fame or knowledge?<br/><br/>Will you cultivate science or rediscover lost magic?<br/><br/>All this and much more is Nadaras!<br/><br/>",

You count the face value of the cards you have placed within it, bonuses granted by the Druids you have called, and you also gain bonus points for suit or number matches you have created.<br/><br/>Team play adds chances to meaningfully cooperate with your teammates, and to read and respond to the other team's gameplay as it unfolds.<br/><br/>",

In each floor, there is treasure whose value is hidden until someone explores that floor. You collect that treasure if you commit most effort to exploring that floor.<br/><br/>The game is played like blind auction, but six floors are auctioned simultaneously. You may play an exploration card, which indicates how much effort you commit, face-down on your current floor or on a deeper floor, but once you explore a deeper floor, you may not go back to an upper floor.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, count up the treasure values players have collected.

There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn. This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card.

        "description": "Savage's Station is the third game in the Blood Before Richmond series, following Gaines's Mill and Glendale &amp; White Oak Swamp; it actually takes place between those two.<br/><br/>The story of the Seven Days is the story of bizarrely incompetent leaders and badly-timed attacks, but Savage's Station really takes the cake. The usually wily Rebel general &quot;Prince John&quot; Magruder is charged with leading an attack on the lightly-defended Union rear, to be supported by three divisions under Stonewall Jackson. Jackson got confused and never showed (surprise-surprise), and Magruder, stoned out of his gourd on morphine, dragged his feet all day before finally launching a half-hearted assault after 5PM, which was ended by a sudden thunderstorm.<br/><br/>This is the smallest (and weirdest) of the games in the Blood Before Richmond series (only a half-sheet of counters this time around), and it's all about taking chances. The Confederate Player can bring in extra units, such as the famous Land Merrimack (a rail-mounted naval gun), but at the cost of precious VP. Will he have enough time to make up the difference, or will the game be called on account of rain?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eons ago, Plague was a preeminent alchemist in Malifaux, well respected in his field of study. He developed a fascination with decay and aging, focusing his research on the manipulation of both. A tragic accident during an experiment involving the aether and a plague rampaging through Malifaux City nearly killed him. Drowning in his own blood, the alchemist tapped into the aether desperately. Screaming in agony, his eyes closed. The next day, Plague's eyes opened.<br/><br/>Few records remain from the years of the Tyrants of Malifaux. The only certain thing is that they were locked away, trapped because they could not be killed. Plague slept millennia in the necropolis deep below Malifaux City. He was awoken by Hamelin the Rat Catcher, a pitiful bully on the run from the Guild. Hamelin's death was messy and horrific, reminiscent of Plague's first rebirth. Immediately, the Tyrant went after His ultimate goal, only to be prevented by Kirai Ankoku who shattered His physical form. It took months, but Plague eventually reformed Himself. Now, He acts more slowly to ensure His victory in the long run, searching for a new method of ascension into the aether- and the acquisition of true immortality.<br/><br/>Plague is the most aggressive of the active Tyrants. He holds to a strange view, that all of the Tyrants are playing a great game, one which is only worth playing because existence itself is the gamble. While His first attempt at ascension, harnessing the power of the Red Cage, failed miserably, He has discovered new methods to try. With everything on the line, He refuses to admit defeat.<br/><br/>Hamelin&rsquo;s box comes with ten models, including Hamelin himself. Four of those models are Malifaux Rats, the skulking vermin who invariably follow in Hamelin&rsquo;s wake. Also present are the Stolen, Hamelin&rsquo;s totems, who serve him either as a gamble to prolong his own life when killed, or as fresh meat to lure more Malifaux Rats into the battle. The Obedient Wretch helps her master by throwing rats at her enemies, some of which even survive to scurry away into the shadows. Hamelin&rsquo;s dog, Nix, is also present, if only as a festering plague-ghost who excels at locking down groups of enemy models.<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to place the pieces of the other players in a way that satisfies certain conditions for their own pieces.<br/>Players seek to have their tiles surrounded by a specific number of other tiles, earning one to four points with corresponding tiles needing the same number of other tiles to border them. When this condition is met, the tile is removed and the player gets that number of points. There is also a special fist tile that only comes to the player after another tile being removed leaves the fist no longer touching any other tiles, which is worth five points.<br/>Players start with five tiles for each opponent they have in the game, plus their equal share of 12 total Mystery tiles. Players then place one tile at a time, until all players have placed all of their tiles. Whenever a tile is touching the exact number of other tiles that it indicates, it immediately goes to the player of that color for points. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Devil Tree Station: Skin That Smokewagon! each player takes the role of either a Wanted gang outlaw or justice fueled Posse member in a lead filled shootout in the dirt covered streets of the Wild West town of Devil Tree Station. Out think your adversaries through decisive actions and straight shooting.<br/><br/>Each player selects a character card to portray them, either a Posse Member or Wanted Outlaw and teams emerge The Posse and the Wanted Outlaws. Each team has a four card action deck from which each player on the team selects an action to play each turn. Also of interest is each character has a action card that if played by them allows them to reroll any or all of their action dice once. This is their &quot;tell&quot; as the other side sees this as well. Will you follow you tell and risk the other team playing an opposing card or do you avoid it and surprise them but forfeit the chance to reroll. If the other team plays the correct corresponding action they steal half of your action dice, so the risk and rewards are very real.<br/><br/>Each player plays an Action Card face down and places some or all of their dice on the action Card becoming their Action Dice...the remainder goes on the Character Card. Play then proceeds from fewest Action Dice to most...there's the fast and the dead.<br/><br/>The Active Player flips over their Action Card while designating a target on the other team who flips over their card. If the Active Players Action Card counteracts the Targets, the Acting player immediately steals half the Target's Action Dice and places them on their Character card.<br/><br/>Next the Active player rolls their Action Dice looking for icons that match their Action Card. For example, if they played the Cover Action they look for Cover icons on the dice. Each rolled die that matches the Action card allows the Active Player to move one of the Target's Action Dice to the Active Players Character card. Then the next lowest number of Action Dice goes and so on...Last Team of Player with dice remaining wins!<br/><br/>The real beauty of this game is that it can be played as either an every player for themselves free-for-all or as a team based battle fighting for dominance of the town. Each version of the game supports up to four players, but feel free to combine two games to have up to eight players fight for supremacy!<br/><br/>",

The &ldquo;Open Market&rdquo; is only open for so long and you have to get everything you need quickly while prices are ever changing.<br/><br/>When you arrive you notice that your competitors have also had similar issues and are here for the same reason. Now is your chance to keep your restaurant open and maybe stick it to the competition and make some money off of them while you&rsquo;re at it.<br/><br/>Welcome to the &ldquo;OPEN MARKET&rdquo;<br/><br/>Draft your list of Orders from the restaurant with the other players at the market. Each Order has a payout of different amounts, but be careful not to spend more on your ingredients than you get by completing the order<br/><br/>. As the amount of ingredients goes down the prices go up so make sure to keep track of what everyone is buying and look for ways to trade and barter to complete your orders. You have to be fast and clever because the market is only open for so long don&rsquo;t get stuck not completing an order.<br/><br/>In the end the person who has the most money when the market closes has proven themselves a successful restaurant owner and Open Market guru.<br/><br/>Seize the Supply to Deliver the Demand<br/><br/>Educational Goal: <br/>This game is meant to teach and experience the basic economic concepts of Supply, Demand, Net Gain, Monopoly, Oligopoly, Production Possibility Frontier and Opportunity Cost while enjoying a fun game with cute Food.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A competitive skirmish nano card game by Charles Ward.<br/><br/>SUMMARY<br/>Players play on a card size board with 9 spaces. The spaces are not connected equally and some spaces have an advantage when doing a ranged attack. Players move tokens on the board trying to eliminate the opponent's pieces and be as close as possible to their opponent's picnic spot at the end of the game. Players take actions by playing their hand of 8 cards, or both sides of the four cards. The game ends at the end of round 8, or after all cards have been played.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Players choose 1 card from their hand (either the top or bottom half of that card) and simultaneously reveal them. The player with the highest initiative number (in the coin) goes first, and each player either takes 1 of the 2 actions on their card's chosen half or passes. Cards that have been played once are flipped from the silver coin side to the gold coin side and return to the players hand; cards played twice are discarded.<br/><br/>On their turn a player may move 1 or more of their tokens, attack in the same location or a target location, block, hide, taunt, or add 1 reinforcement. Although the actions are resolved in order (highest number card), a block or hide can cancel a certain type of attack as a reaction or preemptively.<br/><br/>The game ends after 8 rounds, when all cards have been discarded. Equidistant tokens are removed after which the player nearest to the opponent's star wins.<br/><br/>",

(&quot;To the attack!&quot;) is a Soviet-era board game described as being for secondary school students clearly has its roots in chess, with a mapboard laid out in squares, 15 across by 20 deep. There are three terrain features: a six-square box at the centre of each side representing the headquarters that must me captured; a river (which slows movement) across the middle, two squares wide in the centre and one square on the sides; and four yellow squares on each side closest to the players, which are reserve areas in which pieces may be placed but not attacked.<br/><br/>Each side starts with 21 pieces: 8 infantry, 4 tanks, 4 artillery, 3 missiles and 2 airplanes. As in chess, each piece moves differently and destroys an enemy piece by moving onto its square.<br/><br/>All moves are orthogonal, and pieces may attack in any of the four directions. Infantry may move one or two squares. Tanks may move 1 - 3 spaces. Missiles may move up to 5 spaces but when attacking are destroyed along with their target. Artillery moves one space but may attack a target up to 3 spaces away (without moving to that square). Airplanes may attack up to 10 squares away. Finally, each player may record one space that is mined and will destroy an enemy piece that moves onto it.<br/><br/>There is a screen that allows players to make their initial placements in secret. The first player makes a single move; his opponent then makes two; the first player makes two; and then the opponent makes three. Thereafter each player's turn includes three moves, enabling a variety of assaults, probes and counter-attacks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Superior Defender Gundam Collectable Card Game gives you the chance to command an army of Superior Defenders to conquer dangers in an epic struggle for planetary supremacy. Armed with a Force Deck of 30 cards (consisting of SD Cards, Weapon Cards, and Mission Cards), 2 battleships, and 10 points worth of Power Supply Chips, each player&rsquo;s objective is to win battles among SD Gundams and move their 2 battleships to collect Power Supply Chips and advance into enemy territory, ultimately destroying their opponent's 2 battleships or conquering their opponent's base.<br/><br/>The game is played on two connected game mats with a Battlefield where SD Cards fight, a Command Board where battleships move to attack their opponent, activate Power Supply Chips, or Capture their opponent's Base, and an area where support SD Cards, Mission Cards, and Weapon Cards are played. Gameplay consists of five stages that are repeated until a player either destroys their opponent's 2 battleships or moves one of their battleships onto their opponent's base.<br/><br/>Supply Stage:<br/>Draw one card from the Force Deck into your hand.<br/><br/>Advance Stage:<br/>Move a battleship one connecting space on the Command Board, flipping over any Power Supply Chips it lands on.<br/><br/>Operation Stage: This stage is skipped during a player&rsquo;s first turn.<br/>Choose a Weapon Card with a range capable of attacking your opponent&rsquo;s battleship from your hand and place it on the Weapon Card area in the Force Sector.  Its Power Supply Requirement must be paid and the SD Symbol on the Chip must match the SD Symbol on the card being put into play. Weapon Cards are not sent to the Discard Pile until the Battle Stage is finished.<br/><br/>Battle Stage: This stage is skipped during a player&rsquo;s first turn.<br/>1. The player that initiates the attack goes first by choosing one of the SD Cards on their Battlefield and flipping it over. In order to attack, the chosen SD Card must have must have a target grid that highlights an area where an opponent&rsquo;s SD Card is placed.<br/><br/>2. The ATTACKER and DEFENDER compare SD Powers. The SD Card with the higher Power, taking into account all Effects in play, wins the battle. The winning SD Card stays on the Battlefield face up. The losing SD Card gets sent to that player&rsquo;s Discard Pile. In the event of a tie, both SD Cards remain face up on the Battlefield for the next turn. Face-up SD Cards can no longer be used to attack but can still be attacked by your opponent. They remain on the Battlefield until they have been defeated.<br/><br/>3. The DEFENDER is now given the chance to attack. Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 with the DEFENDER now as the ATTACKER.<br/><br/>4) Repeat steps 1-3 until a player defeats an opponent&rsquo;s battleship. A player defeats their opponent&rsquo;s battleship by defeating 3 of their SD Cards thus sending them to the Discard Area. If there are not enough SD Cards on the Battlefield for a player to defeat 3 of their opponent&rsquo;s cards, the player who defeats more of their opponent&rsquo;s SD Cards wins the battle.<br/><br/>5) The winner sends their opponent&rsquo;s battleship back one space on the Command Board and moves their victorious battleship to the previously occupied space.<br/><br/>     If the losing battleship cannot move back a space due to another battleship obstructing its movement, the losing battleship is destroyed and removed from the Command Board.<br/>     If the losing battleship cannot move back because it is at the back (1st Row) of the Command Board, the losing battleship is destroyed and removed from the Command Board.<br/><br/><br/>Assign Stage:<br/>Place one SD Card from your hand face down on any unoccupied space on the Battlefield. One Power Supply Point is required when placing an SD Card on the Battlefield. The SD Symbol of the chip must match the Symbol of the card being placed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a complex horseracing game that includes the purchase, sale and training of individual horses, choosing the best horses and jockeys for each race, establishing betting odds for each horse and trying to win money both by having a horse finish well and by winning bets.<br/><br/>Players each start with GBP250,000 and one horse, all with the same form rating. While at the Auction Ring each turn, a player rolls a D6 three times, to determine the mix of actions he may take: 1=Sell a horse for Form rating times current Auction Price; 2/3=Buy top horse on the deck on the same basis; 4=Read the Ascot Bulletin (draw event card); 5=Change the horse up for auction; 6=Change the Auction Price by drawing a new Auction card.<br/><br/>Then the players take the next card in the Race deck to see the distance, entry fee and prize money. Some races are restricted to horses of a certain Form Rating, or apply handicaps that help low-rated horses. Each player chooses a horse for the race and hires a jockey (better ones cost more). The combination of horse Form and jockey results in a number of tokens for each player. These tokens allow a horse to be moved extra spaces during the race.<br/><br/>The Form ratings of the horses are totaled and each horse uses it rating against the pack to establish betting odds. Players then place their bets and the race begins. Each move is based on an 8-sided die. Horses can move forward or diagonally, but not into a space with another horse. Tokens add one space, but only one can be used per die roll.<br/><br/>After the race, the prize money is paid out, bets are settled, and the game moves to the next Auction phase. The game may be ended after any number of races, with the player holding the most money combined with horse value (10,000xForm) being declared the winning trainer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nights of Reckoning is an expansion set for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, released by White Wolf in 2006. Unique among V:TES sets, the cards in Nights of Reckoning didn't feature any vampires or Disciplines; instead, they introduced the imbued hunters of Hunter: The Reckoning and their powers to the card game. No starter decks were produced for the Nights of Reckoning expansion, only booster packs; additionally, all cards in the set are new cards, with no reprints.<br/><br/>This set's break with the mainstays of normal V:TES deckbuilding and gameplay proved to be controversial, and its sales reflected its mixed reception. As a result, no further cards were produced for the imbued or their powers, and the handful of later cards that explicitly interacted with the imbued only did so as an additional function on top of their use in a typical V:TES deck.<br/><br/>",

Explore the people and places that make the United States such a unique country.<br/><br/>Question cards teach kids interesting facts about the geography and history of the fifty states, while Travel cards add a fun twist - moving players forward or backward on their adventure.  Additional facts are included on the cards to make the topics more interesting.<br/><br/>Addition information:<br/><br/>Players spin to determine which type of card to draw. Three of the four decks include questions about history, geography, or state flags. Answering correctly means the player can move forward. Drawing a travel card simply moves a player forward or backward. The player who circles the board first wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red X: Facility 342 is a hidden role playing game where team loyalty is constantly changing.<br/><br/>Players are either part of an alien race that reproduces by taking over the mind and body of a living host, or part of the research team that is attempting to assemble a purification device that will cure the infected players, ultimately saving the entire human race.<br/><br/>Red X: Facility 342 requires multiple playing areas that allow players to go on missions in order to collect parts, but BEWARE, when left alone with an alien you are in danger of being infected yourself. Two players start off already infected. The rest of the players are human researchers, by the second round you don't know who you can trust anymore.<br/><br/>Roles are assigned by passing out DNA Verification Cards at the start of the game. Players choose a Head Researcher and then get sent on a mission with one other player. Mission Rooms are isolated areas located in other parts of the house. Decided by a dice roll researchers may be infected by the alien they were unknowingly paired up with or the researchers could possibly return with a part to the machine needed to kill off the aliens. The aliens win if they can infect the entire research team; the researchers win if they can collect all the parts needed to build the purification device. Either way this exciting hidden role playing game will keep you guessing the entire time.<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>&quot;There's a lot of social deduction games out there. What makes yours different? What makes your game special? Why do you enjoy it?&quot; - Aaron<br/><br/>Great question Aaron,<br/>What makes Facility 342 different from what is out there?<br/>I created my game for a couple reasons.<br/><br/>First was because of the number of players current social deduction games can have. We found ourselves with 10-15 players (5-7 couple) quite often. The Resistance cannot be played with that many people. We could play Werewolf but I do not like how you eliminate players.<br/><br/>Second I wanted to add a new element to the social deduction game. Players loyalty can change during game play in Facility 342. What better scenario than body snatchers.<br/><br/>Lastly I wanted a social deduction game that had a role playing feel to it. In my game you have to physically leave the game table to go on a mission with another player. This allows things to happen in private that can affect the whole game. This also allows players to talk in private about their plans and they can use this time to figure out what is going on, or trick players without the interruptions of other players.<br/><br/>",

Glimpsing through those manholes might give you an idea what awaits you down there...<br/>This allows you to make an educated guess about which way might be the best path through the cave while still allowing for surprises along the way.<br/><br/>The second part of the cave is the hidden information track that is used to store everything that is hidden and happening below ground in the chambers of the cave you haven&acute;t discovered yet.<br/>The track is not only used to store the items of the still hidden chambers but also to move the cave&acute;s inhabitants through those chambers as well.<br/><br/>During the game when you gradually explore the cave you will fan out the cave tiles along the hidden information track to get a two dimensional representations of the cave that makes all chambers and possible routes between them visible.<br/><br/>The Bears (the AI of the game)<br/>The rumours were right: There is indeed living a bear in this cave &ndash; and not only one, but three..<br/>Those bears will roam the cave while you&acute;re busy exploring.<br/><br/>They are steered by their own desires. Each bear&acute;s desires are represented by a cup filled with wooden cubes of different colours.<br/><br/>Each colour stands for a different desire. The composition of those cubes represents what goes on in the bear&acute;s head and will change during the game according to what that bear experiences. <br/>The bears will either be tired &ndash; doing nothing,  hungry &ndash; searching for food, angry &ndash; looking for things to destroy, or bloodthirsty &ndash; coming for you..!<br/>During the game you will draw cubes form the bear&acute;s cup to determine what the bear wants to do and in which direction and how far it will move.<br/><br/>Yourself and your actions<br/>On your turn you can climb through the cave, open crates, carry and use items. <br/>For all this you need energy. Like the bears you also have a cup with wooden cubes that represent your energy reserve &ndash; and also your fear that will get in the way of your plans from time to time . <br/>Each turn you draw as many energy cubes as you like &ndash; the amount drawn equals the amount of energy you can spend on this turn. But if you draw a black cube you are instantly paralysed with fear. You could still make your body move but only for a certain cost  - or you have to stand still shivering in the dark, hoping that the bears will not find you..<br/><br/>Experience<br/>Certain key moments during your adventure will help you unlock hidden (one time) powers that you never knew to possess.<br/><br/>The Items<br/>Dr Humboldt has stored away his belongings in a huge number of crates that can be found all over the cave. Those crates contain items that will help you survive on your quest. <br/>Some make you stronger, some help you deal with the bears. <br/>But to carry those items around in the narrow cave takes concentration. You have to set aside the necessary energy to be able to do that.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hogswallow is an open ended, mythical storytelling game for 2 to 6 players. Players use the primitive imagery on the cards to guide the creation of a cohesive tale. The glyphs on the cards do not have any fixed meanings. They are purposefully pliable, designed to jump start the imagination, and may be interpreted differently from player to player and game to game.<br/><br/>Hogswallow is wonderfully adaptable and suitable for any age and any group, as the stories told are created completely by the participants. The rules provide the three most common variations of play, including one cooperative method, and two competitive ways to play.<br/><br/>In the cooperative version &quot;High Hogswallow&quot;, the players take turns adding an element to the story, building off what has come before until one of them wins by bringing the story to  satisfactory conclusion.<br/><br/>In the competitive versions, players play only with their own hand of cards to either trump the single card that was played before them in a storytelling battle (Dilly Dallying) or to tell the best story using a limited hand of cards, argue it's merits compared to the other stories, and ultimately vote on whose was the best (Low Hogswallow).<br/><br/>",

Rulers of the Continent permits you to replay entire tournaments, with scorers, in just a few dice rolls per match.<br/><br/>Individual sets are available, each including the base rulebook necessary to play, for the European Champions Cup, Cup Winners Cup and  UEFA Cup.<br/><br/>For each match, teams are rated based on the number of goals they scored and conceded in the historical tournament, and these ratings are compared to identify a column on a chart.  Along with a 2d6 roll, this determines the initial number of goals scored.<br/><br/>Teams have a &quot;third dice&quot; stat ensuring that those that did well in the actual tournament have a better chance of advancing, while still allowing for shock results and giant killings.  A d10 roll determines whether or not each team gets to adjust the initial goal results, with the &quot;better&quot; teams more often gaining this advantage.<br/><br/>A percentile dice roll provides the name of the scorer of each goal, again based on the historical results of the competition.<br/><br/>With just a handful of rolls per match, an entire Tournament can be completed, and a Champion crowned, in a single sitting.<br/><br/>Builds on the game engine of the designer's World Cup soccer game, Dream To End All Dreams.<br/><br/>",

You returned from the banks of the Styx feeling that you could now enjoy summer life with more treks and more beaches...but you can't relax just yet. Fate doesn't like when people tamper with her whims, and the angel of Death is stretching his hands towards you slowly but surely. Will you be able to escape his clutches for another week? It's a desperate, shared struggle for survival.<br/><br/>Final Deathweek is a cooperative card game. Players hold cards that symbolize &quot;death flags&quot; (death warnings) of certain colors. Each turn, each player in order must select one of the available events for the day, trying to NOT match the colors of the event with the color(s) they have in hand. While not matching colors, they should also try to form chains with the events they take. If the colors do match, the player takes damage, eventually being killed if too much damage is taken.<br/><br/>The game lasts for seven days, and if all players survive, they beat the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Nemesis Crown was a global narrative campaign created by Games Workshop for their Warhammer Fantasy setting, that started in late June 2007. The Mordheim Nemesis Crown development team led by Mark Havener authored the supplement. It was last official Mordheim expansion featuring some of the game's original contributors to be published digitally by Games Workshop. It followed the same story composed by Andy Hoare for Warhammer, through a series of campaign scenario concepts designed by Stuart Cresswell.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Great Forest where the race for the artefact known as the Nemesis Crown has begun. Lying deep within the heart of the Empire, the locale presents a problem for the Vampire Counts, the Skaven Lords, the Chaos Champions and the other warlords who would search for the fabled relic. Marching an army roughshod through the lands of the Empire would be a foolish and inefficient use of resources. If these races are to scour the very heart of the land then stealth and subterfuge will be required. And being a dark, dense, tangled and vast area of wilderness, the Great Forest contains many areas too wild and remote for even the Empire's own armies to access. Thus the responsibility for scouring for clues will often fall to small foraging parties, operating beneath the gaze of the armies who march upon the region.<br/><br/>The Mordheim Nemesis Crown development team were; Ian Davies, John Severn, Chris Templin, Mark Havener, Mike Kitch, Stuart Cresswell, Terry Maltman &amp; Tommy Muller. Story-telling by 'Rev' David Warrington.<br/><br/>Artist credits for the Nemesis Crown global campaign; Markus Trenkner, Alun Davies, Alex Boyd, Paul Dainton, David Gallagher &amp; Nuala Kinrade<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first player to successfully find, seed and mine three unique asteroids.<br/><br/>The gameplay changes depending on your starship and various upgrades you may attach to it such as Engines, Drills and Storage.<br/><br/>These upgrades can affect your the number of cards you may draw, how many minerals you can mine and how many cards you can hold in your hand.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing from the draw pile or discard pile.  The goal is to draw a small, medium and large asteroid from the deck and play them face up in front of the player.  Once at least on asteroid is played, the player can then begin to seed the asteroid with mineral cards (also found in the deck).<br/>  <br/>There are six unique minerals, and each asteroid has a requirement of how many minerals are needed to seed it.  Once a player has the correct number of minerals for the asteroid, they play them on top of the face up asteroids they have discovered so far.<br/><br/>The final step for the player is to mine the minerals on a fully seeded asteroid.  Players only seed and mine their own asteroids.  To mine an asteroid, the player must use a pricing contract card (found throughout the deck).  These pricing cards have various values from 20 to 120 and are an important part of the scoring.  The player is allowed to mine one mineral for each drill on their starship per contract card they hold.<br/><br/>Once the player fully depletes an asteroid of minerals, they turn it sideways to score additional points. The first player to mine all three of the asteroids wins the hand, and all players tally their score up to that point.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 4000 points wins the game. This usually requires a multiple hands of play to achieve.<br/><br/>",

Once a player has set the score, it's up to the rest of the players to beat it--and then become the holder of the score themselves.<br/><br/>Players start with eight six-sided dice and roll them all at once, then must set aside at least one of the dice rolled.  They may then stop or reroll all dice not set aside.  The caveat is that the same face value may not be claimed more than once per turn; once you've set aside two sixes, for example, further sixes you roll cannot be used.  If you roll and cannot set aside any of the dice due to them matching previously-rolled values, you bust.<br/><br/>Octo is one of several games Reiner Knizia describes in his book Dice Games Properly Explained.<br/><br/>",

The round ends when more than half of the players have revealed their cards or when a bomb is revealed, at which point everyone scores points if they have collected the gifts wanted by their characters.<br/><br/>The twist comes from the bombs: only one of the character scores highly if she collects bombs, but other characters score nothing for the round if they have one.<br/><br/>After an agreed number of rounds, the player with the highest total score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The Tora find it hard to understand or trust anyone who won&rsquo;t fight for their ideas or express their emotions with passion. Honor is of extraordinary importance to the Tora, and they pursue it and defend it with the utmost of their fiery passion.<br/><br/>The Tora have applied their fiercely competitive nature to the arena of the mind in the same way that they compete physically. Combined with their mountainous homeland, this inquisitive competitiveness has shaped the Tora into the preeminent smiths and alchemists in all Kagejima. Tora weapons are finely forged and their understanding of alchemical reactions is unsurpassed, leading them to make, not only the first firearms on the island, but the finest as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stalin&rsquo;s Final War: 1953 What If? (SFW) is an alternative history wargame intended to investigate the strategic parameters that would&rsquo;ve been in place during the first 10 weeks of operations had that dictator lived long enough to put in motion his plan to start World War III in 1953. Had he lived, the most likely start date would&rsquo;ve been one closely coinciding with the signing of the Korean War armistice in July (in order to achieve a surprise effect).<br/><br/>His main goal in starting such a war wouldn&rsquo;t have been immediate global conquest; rather, in Europe he would&rsquo;ve been seeking to seize or thoroughly wreck the Ruhr &ndash; then, as now, one of the world&rsquo;s main industrial regions &ndash; or otherwise abort the still young Federal Republic of Germany (&ldquo;West Germany&rdquo;) as an effective member of the Western alliance. In Asia, the then already long-sought conquest of the Korean peninsula would&rsquo;ve been the objective, thereby putting Japan into what would&rsquo;ve amounted to a geo-strategic vice, given the USSR already possessed Sakhalin Island to its north.<br/><br/>There are atomic warfare rules, but their use by the Communist side is constrained by the limited availability of the bombs themselves, as well as by their historic lack at that time of a fully dependable means to deliver them. On the Allied (a.k.a. &ldquo;United Nations&rdquo; or &ldquo;UN&rdquo; or &ldquo;US&rdquo;) side, the limitation is a cultural one. That is, the early 1950s marked the full blown emergence of the anti-imperialist (a.k.a. &ldquo;hate America&rdquo; of &ldquo;third world&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-aligned&rdquo;) movement onto the global media stage. If, therefore, the Americans were to try to win the war by using enough a-bombs to simply blow to bits the attacking Communist hordes, they would do so much damage to the environmental and socio-political ecologies as to undo that battlefield victory in the broader grand-strategic sense. One map covers West Germany and its immediate environs; the other covers the Korean peninsula south from the Pyongyang-Wonsan &ldquo;neck.&rdquo; Each hexagon on both maps represents 10 miles (16 km). The Communist units of maneuver are armies and corps, while those on the UN side are mostly divisions along with a few corps. Air power is represented abstractly, with counters and rules showing the effects of one side or the other gaining temporary air superiority above one or both theaters of operation. Each full game turn represents one week of &lsquo;real time&rsquo; from late July to early October 1953.<br/><br/>Product Information <br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10 <br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10 <br/>Time Scale: 10 one-week turns <br/>Map Scale: 10 miles (16.2 km)  per hex  <br/>Units of Maneuver: armies, corps &amp; divisions<br/><br/>Players: one, two, three or four Playing Time: four to eight hours Two 34x22&rdquo; large-hex maps Two counter-sheets of 9/16&rdquo; (16mm) units (456 total) One rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Another tropical variation based upon the classic KV47 series, the L model, or Anatoly, mounts two very efficient Tesla guns, derived from the Red Lightning support weapon. The Anatoly&rsquo;s capacitors allow it to fire both Tesla weapons in rapid succession, but this leaves it defenceless until the capacitors recharge. Being a Tesla weapon, it incapacitates its targets, even if it does not destroy them outright.<br/><br/>Using pack tactics, the KV-47L Anatoly can take on much larger walkers. Like its cousin the Aleksei, the Anatoly&rsquo;s small size makes it perfect for special operations. It can easily be air-dropped, put on a landing craft, or travel through a dense jungle with equal facility.<br/><br/>",

Polish unit of Lieutenant Colonel Stefan Grabowski attacked outnumbered force of Lieutenant Colonel Lewiz. The insurgents lost the clash. Board war game &ldquo;Niemenczyn 1794&rdquo; gives you the opportunity to lead Polish and Russian forces that fought against each other. An alternative scenario allows players to see how the battle could have turned out if more insurrectionary cavalry had taken part. Will the Poles enter the enemy camp? Or will the Polish attacks be stopped by Russian musket and artillery fire? The outcome of that battle is in your hands.<br/><br/>Rules of the game utilize the proven mechanisms of the games of the battles of the Kosciuszko Uprising (&quot;Raclawice 1794&quot;, &quot;Szczekociny 1794&quot; and &quot;Maciejowice 1794&quot;). Due to the small amount of counters, &quot;Niemenczyn 1794&quot; is a good introduction to these games.<br/><br/>",

As they do so, their krill swarms emerge and grow. Players can place krill swarm tiles to build their krill swarm and to block other players, they can play special tiles to move, rotate or remove krill swarm tiles from the game board, or they can place krill knights instead to protect their krill swarm from the effects of special tiles. At the end of the turn, the players can relocate their krill knights for the best protection or suit their strategy.<br/><br/>The game is over when the whole game board is full, and it's scoring time.

        "description": "Consta is a square grid connection game with a new and simple idea: to use stacked pieces and to resolve crosscuts with a majority mechanism based on the number of stones in the crosscut.<br/><br/>BOARD<br/>Consta is played on a 11x11 square grid; bigger boards can be used for more strategic gameplay. The left and right edges of the board are colored white; the top and bottom edges are colored black.<br/><br/>DEFINITIONS<br/>A piece is a single stone or two stacked stones in a single space.<br/>A weak pair is a set of two like-colored, diagonally adjacent pieces such that there is no like-colored piece orthogonally adjacent to both.<br/>The rank of a weak pair is the number of stones in that weak pair. This value can range from 2 to 4.<br/>A crosscut is a 2x2 set of pieces consisting of two diagonally adjacent black pieces and two diagonally adjacent white pieces.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>The goal of Consta is to form a connected chain of your pieces linking the opposite edges of the board marked by your color. I.e. White should connect the Left and Right edges and Black should connect the Top and Bottom edges. A corner is considered to be part of both adjoining edges.<br/><br/>You win when you have a connected chain at the end of the opponent&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>Two pieces are considered to be connected to each other if they are:<br/>- orthogonally adjacent or<br/>- diagonally adjacent and: the weak pair doesn't belong to a crosscut or the weak pair is the highest rank weak pair that belongs to a crosscut.<br/><br/>No draws are possible in Consta.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The game begins with an empty board. Each player has an allocated color: Black or White. Black plays first, then turns alternate.<br/><br/>Black plays first, placing one black stone on one space. After this move players take turns placing two stones on two different unoccupied spaces or placing two stacked stones on one single unoccupied space.<br/><br/>It is not allowed to form a crosscut of weak pairs with the same rank.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>     Against Stephen Tavener's AI at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/</a> (Java 8 required)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>CABARET CONFIDENTIAL is a 3 player only game from Japan. It uses the mechanic known in Japanese gaming as 'butting', where equal values negate each other and the next player down gains.<br/><br/>Each player acts as an owner of a Cabaret, and headhunts dancers. Dancers have three needs: Fame, Money and Love. For each dancer dealt up from the deck each round, players try to negotiate to get the dancer to join their troup.<br/><br/>Negotiation is done by simultaneous blind-bidding on one of the dancer's needs. Each player chooses a card of one type and places it face down. When the three cards are turned up, the player who didn't match the others wins the bid and takes the dancer to their tableau. For example, Alice and Brenda bid on Fame, Cathy bid on Money, so Cathy wins the bid. When the game ends, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Dancers may have special abilities. Some may be triggered when turned up from the deck, some may have one-off effects when placed on your tableau, some may have permanent effects. There is also a &quot;management policy&quot; card which is drafted before the first round, and activated before counting points at the end. This might mess up the other players' scores.<br/><br/>The special effects on the dancers add some language dependancy to the game but the game is still playable with crib sheets or paste-ups for the cards.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>In Paris, end of 19th century.<br/>Each player is the owner of a Cabaret, and negotiate with the casts to bring success for your stage.<br/><br/>But beware. Casts are artists, and artists have mannerisms.

Each player would get 10 cards.<br/><br/>BAITING<br/><br/>Each player selects and place 5 CARDS that would serve as BAITS for the fight. These cards are chosen based on the player's choice on elements such as high number, HUT colour etc).<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/><br/>1. At their turns, players try to eliminate other player's BAIT by placing a higher number HUT (with the same colour) on the BAIT to be eliminated.<br/><br/>For instance, if a PLAYER has baits with number 9, 9, 8, 7, 8, an active player (player whose turn it is) who places a card with higher number of the same colour as the BAIT collects the BAIT and other cards on it if BAITS has been HEXED, DEFENDED or INVADED (see below).<br/><br/>HEX:<br/><br/>Players can use their turn to HEX any BAIT (either theirs or another players). They do so by placing ANOTHER HUT COLOUR with the same number as the BAIT to change the colour. This is a very important in the game strategy.<br/><br/>DEFEND:<br/><br/>Players can DEFEND their BAIT by placing another card with HIGHER NUMBER but MUST be the same HUT colour as their BAIT. This is a strategy for defence in the game.<br/><br/>INVADE:<br/><br/>ACTIVE PLAYER can weaken another players BAIT by INVADING. This is done when Active Player place a card with LOWER NUMBER on another player's BAIT but must be the same COLOUR. This makes the BAIT weaker and easier to eliminate at next run by any player.<br/><br/>WHEN GAME ENDS:<br/><br/>The game ends when any player has EXHAUSTED their FIVE BAITS.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN???<br/><br/>THE PLAYER WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF BAITS AT THE END OF THE GAME WINS.<br/><br/>In situations where there is a TIE, the players FIGHTS and the FIRST to lose a BAIT gets ELIMINATED TILL THEIR IS ONLY ONE PLAYER LEFT.<br/><br/>",

Unlike War, Battles will be over in 10 minutes and actually presents simple but meaningful choices for the players.<br/><br/>Battles is a 2 player game played with a standard deck of cards. The game consists of 7 battles, each of which has 3 skirmishes. Whoever wins 4 battles wins the game.<br/><br/>SET UP<br/>Shuffle the deck of cards. Deal 21 cards to each player. Set the remaining 10 cards aside.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>The game consists of 7 battles, each consisting of 3 skirmishes. To play a battle, each player draws the top 3 cards from their deck. Both players simultaneously choose one of their cards and presents it face down. After both have chosen a card, they turn it face up. The player who played the highest card (aces are high) wins the skirmish, and moves the 2 cards to their side. If the cards are of equal denomination (a tie) then the 2 cards are set aside in the middle. After all 3 skirmishes are played in this fashion, the winner of the battle is determined. The player who won the most skirmishes (typically 2 or 3) wins the battle and takes all 6 cards and stacks them in a set. Players then draw the next 3 cards from their deck to begin another battle.<br/><br/>RESOLVING TIES<br/>Typically winning 2 or more skirmishes will win a battle. However, if 2 skirmishes end in a tie, then only 1 skirmish is needed to win the battle. However, if both players each win 1 skirmish, and the other is a tie (or if all 3 skirmishes are tied) then the battle is unresolved. In this case, a 4th skirmish is needed and both players draw 1 card from the set of ten set aside at the beginning of the game. Whoever draws the highest card wins the battle. If the 4th skirmish is also a tie, the youngest player wins the battle.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>After all 7 battles have been played, the winner of the most battles (4 or more) wins the game (and the war!)<br/><br/>",

A compellingly playable set of fast play rules provide entertainment and challenge for both the novice and veteran players alike, entwined with glorious pictures of the Bicorne English Civil War miniature figure range. The rules have been extensively developed from the author's and friends' house rules. These were purposefully designed to provide a fast, fun and challenging game for wargamers of all abilities, whilst encouraging the education of the readers into the troops and the realities of warfare in the 17th Century. There are many parts to the book in addition to the rules, including an introduction to the Civil War written by Linda Doyle, and a section detailing troop types and uniforms. This has all been designed alongside the catalogue of Bicorne troops where the reader is encouraged to collect and paint an army of model soldiers, with a view to playing enjoyable wargames with friends. To this end there is a section on how to build up your army if you are new to the period, as well as a couple of scenarios to give the reader a good idea of what can be achieved with this fun to play set of rules.<br/><br/>",

If it does the game is over.<br/><br/>How it works: <br/>The land is a landscape of dark (shadow) and light (no shadow) spaces. <br/>You can move freely as long as you do not use a dark connection (dotted line between spaces in shadow) or enter a dark space. <br/>In the last case you would become scared and have to add a despair cube to your cup of action cubes.<br/><br/>These cubes are drawn during the game and placed onto an action display. <br/>9 cubes arranged into 3 by 3 grid define what might happen:<br/>Each round you will choose one column or row of cubes in that display. The cubes chosen will define whose turn it is: Yours (white cube), a tower&acute;s (yellow cube) or the Inhabitant&acute;s (black cube). <br/>In your turns you can either move from light space to light space or modify the board by pushing towers to the left or right. <br/>This will change the distribution of shadows on the board an through that your movement possibilities.<br/><br/>3 x 6 &quot;end game rule tokens&quot; provide 216  possible different end game scenarios you will have to prepare for in the first half of the game.<br/><br/>",

Players represent a political faction, and spend political influence to gain control over centers of power and to resolve the many crises that threaten to derail the revolution.<br/><br/>Control of centers of power can provide special abilities and generates political influence among the four main demographics: soldiers, workers,<br/>peasants, and bourgeoisie.  Helping to resolve a crisis generates victory points in the form of votes, and can slow the growing chaos level that weakens the political factions.  Votes are also gained at four randomly occurring &quot;elections&quot;.<br/><br/>A faction wins by gaining an absolute majority of votes by game end. Revolutionary factions also have the option of staging a high-stakes military coup.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Madagascar, hidden in the foliage of the dense jungle, secluded and shy, lives an extremely rare chameleon family. All members of this family are either orange, green or purple. Through elaborate and time-intensive observations, researchers now have discovered how the chameleons come to their extraordinary color.<br/><br/>Cham&auml;lange is an unusual tactic game for 2 people. Each player draws a chameleon color (orange, green, or purple) secretly without showing it to his opponent. The third card is put aside and unknown to both players.  Each player is trying to get as many chameleons in his color as possible in the course of the game.<br/><br/>Therefore it is necessary to play the egg cards in the colors red, blue and yellow cleverly. The egg cards have the values of 1 &ndash; 3. If two cards with different colored eggs are laid on one another, the already lying card is reversed. From the mixture of the egg colors the new chameleons originate. If, for example, red and blue eggs lie side by side, a purple chameleon is produced. The chameleon, which is produced by touching the eggs, is marked with a stone, in our example the purple one.<br/><br/>Whoever could collect the most eggs under his chameleon color wins this extraordinary game.<br/><br/>",

Cards include children, proposal cards (to marry couples) and break-ups. By playing an affair card, a player can split up two couples from other players and take a partner from each to form a couple for themselves.<br/><br/>The impact of the 'tale that' element of the game is moderated by the fact that scoring is continuous rather than end of game; so couples that are broken up are those for which a player has already scored.<br/><br/>The game box gives this game a 17+ rating but there is nothing risqu&eacute; about the game.

The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully!

The more your set matches, the more points you get, and more your set matches the King's Mood at the end of the game, the more points you get!<br/><br/>Each Playwright will start with an Act I, Act II, and Act III card of a random genre, and one Play Card. Playwrights use these Play Cards to try to collect matching sets and undermine their opponents. Each turn a Playwright draws one Play Card, and then plays one of the two in their hand!<br/><br/>It's that simple! The game ends at the end of the turn wherethe last play card has been drawn!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first of the final 3 trilogy games in the Shadows Upon Lassadar world<br/><br/>This is a short, two player, battle-line style game in which the remaining Elder Wardens of Lassadar and their followers try and stop the incursions of Shadowmajik from the boundaries between dimensional planes. Events take place after the wars against the Grayking and Raven Consort and the invasions of the Barons of the South. Damage due to spell casting has caused rifts and tears between dimensions.<br/><br/>Setup: <br/>Players choose who will be the Shadowmajik player and who will represent the Wardens of Lassadar. The Location cards are shuffled and 7 are dealt face up in a row between the players. Rotate the Location cards as required so they are all in the same orientation with the Location name readable to the Warden Player. The remaining 2 cards are removed from the game.<br/><br/>A Player card is given to each player. They should orient it toward their side of the Location cards - Wardens or Shadowmajik.<br/><br/>Players each take 4 dice and all 4 of either the white or black cubes.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Players take simultaneous turns in a round, competing in battle at the current Location card (as designated by the yellow cube marker) and contesting over it. Both players place one hand at the top of their Player card and then players roll their respective 4 dice and keep them hidden behind their hand. Dice are placed adjacent to the four corners of their Player cards.<br/><br/>2 Dice are Battle dice and are added together as the base Battle Number in that location.<br/><br/>1 Die is the Power die and may be used to gain additional Mana or Shadowmajik points on a player&rsquo;s track (the die value is divided by 2 and rounded up for the total Mana or Shadowmajik gained). A player may never possess more MP or SP than the maximum (6) listed on the track.<br/><br/>1 Die is the Casting die and may be used to cast a spell as listed on player card. A player may cast a spell equal to the die value or exactly one value below die value and must pay the listed MP or SP to do so. Certain spells show a Resonance icon next to the die face. If the current location has a matching Resonance icon those spells cost 1 less MP or SP.<br/><br/>You may not use a Power and Casting die on same turn. Only one of these dice will be placed on a corner as an active die.<br/><br/>Both players then reveal their 3 placed dice.<br/><br/>The player with the stronger Battle Number will place and/or move a cube on their respective track on the current Location card a number of spaces. This is calculated based on a nomograph table.<br/><br/>Players only have 3 cubes so, with 7 Locations, they must decide where to deploy forces and which Locations to contest.<br/><br/>Once a Location is won (when a player&rsquo;s cube moves to highest space on their track) that card will be slid towards the winner and they gain control over it. That Location will not be contested over again. The players take back their cubes from the card to their general supply. Location cards should be slid to fill in the gap left by the now controlled location.<br/><br/>After each round, the losing player decides the next location to move the yellow cube to.<br/><br/>Game End: <br/>Play continues until one player has gained control over 4 Locations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal is to make the work items finish as soon as possible at the end space. A lot of set-backs will appear on cards drawn from a deck. The set-backs have names that people within the software development are familiar with.<br/>The cooperative game is won if the group manages to overcome all the trouble caused by the event cards, by choosing from the development cards and implement them in a proper order.<br/>In each turn the players make up a short-term plan for which developments to go for, and which work items to progress. There are dice used for progress during the &quot;testing phase&quot;, the middle part of the track where the work items can be stuck if the group has bad luck.<br/>&quot;Continuous Delivery - The Game&quot; is a cooperative board game for 3-5 players who together will try to transform a traditional software development way of working into a Continuous Delivery pipeline.<br/>Each player represents a department, for instance Development, Test or Operations. Together they can discuss and plan how to improve the software development process.<br/>The goal of this game is to create awareness of what implementing Continuous Delivery can be about. This game can be played by anyone and does not require any prior knowledge or experience of Continuous Delivery.<br/>&quot;Continuous Delivery - The Game&quot; is the first of its kind and unique in how it mixes the fun of a board game and the teachings<br/>of Continuous Delivery.<br/><br/>",

Each other player in turn either moves one tile from the top of the column to the bottom (or vice versa) while keeping the column in the same position relative to the break-even line or moves the column up or down by one level. The starting player for the round does this action last, then this position rotates clockwise, and the next starting player begins another round.<br/><br/>After eight rounds, the game ends and the point values of all tiles above the break-even line are revealed.

The ice wall must be set up with the color-coded blocks in a specific order. Players then roll a die to determine which color piece they need to remove. Instead of using their hands, players must use the snowflake wand to remove the blocks. After a block is removed, the player lifts the balcony, and stacks the block to build the palace on top of the ice wall. Players beware because if the balcony falls at any point during your turn, you are out! The first player to build the ice palace 10 blocks high, and then place the Elsa figure in the balcony, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "UNDEAD ROAD is a cooperative card game for 1 to 2 players*, where the participants cross an inhospitable road, represented by the deck of cards, in which they must survive to endless waves of zombies as much as possible, managing the limits resources they will find in a strategic and convenient way for the group.<br/><br/>UNDEAD ROAD is defined as a &quot;Endless survival game&quot;. Each game lasts until the players are defeated by the zombies in the deck. The goal is to endure the most &quot;waves&quot; as possible. Each wave is the full use of a deck. When all the cards of the deck have been played, are shuffled again and start another &quot;wave&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>    Each deck allows games of 1 to 2 players. You can play games of 3 to 4 players with an additional deck. You can play games of 5 to 6 players with a third deck, taking out the Resources Cards of it.<br/><br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>In Undead Road, players (up to two with each gamebox set) collaborate each other trying to go as far as they can through a common deck of cards that represents a dangerous road, full of danger and zombies.<br/><br/>Each player has a card that represents a survivor. That card is used to record the life points of the survivor (turning the card clockwise) and equipping up to a maximum of two objects (one on each side of the card).<br/><br/>During his turn, each player draws a card from the deck and all the players try to resolve the situation that the card presents. From the decks can come out zombies, objects of different types (weapons, healing stuff, ammunition, resources) or multiplying cards that force you to draw huge number of cards at once. Players must agree together how to solve the situation (eliminate the zombies, equip or use the objects, exchange them, etc).<br/><br/>Gradually, the game ends up beating the players. The idea is to try to go through the entire deck as many times as possible.<br/><br/>",

Sports fans, families and casual gamers alike will enjoy the back-and-forth card play while trying to anticipate your opponent's next move! Features three game modes: Full Game, Solo, and Overtime.<br/><br/>In Micro-Football, players take turns each quarter on offense and defense. The offense has the goal of reaching the Goal Line of the defense for a Touchdown, or get close enough for a Field Goal, while the defense has the goal of stopping them. Each player has seven cards to choose from (only four will be played), and as they are played simultaneously with your opponent, the results of the combined yardage moves the marker along the football field. If one player can consecutively guess their opponents' next card 3-times, they will trigger a Big Play like an automatic touchdown or a turnover. The player with the most points after four quarters wins!<br/><br/>Components<br/>  - 18 cards (7 offense, 7 defense, 4 football field)<br/>  - 4 cubes (2 blue, 2 red) <br/>  - 1 coin<br/>  - 1 gem (football marker)<br/>  - rulebook<br/><br/>",

They realized that in order to keep the pests away it's best to mix the crops they grow onto the same field. The challenge is that the farmers can't agree on who should plant which crops.<br/><br/>Players use seeds (coins) or dice to move their tractors (pawns) around the board while trying to form patterns with the seeds. Successful patterns are rewarded with prizes from the county fair and collecting enough prizes wins the game. The seeds grow four different crops: arms are almonds, crowns are corn, moons are melons, and suns are sunflower seeds.<br/><br/>On your turn, choose whether you're going to move using a seed or a die. Seed - Pick a seed from your hand, and show the value to the other players. Play the seed suit side up on the board space under your tractor, and move the tractor. The seed's suit tells you which direction to move and the seed's value tells you how far to move. Die - Choose the die for the direction you want to move. Roll the die to determine how far you move in that direction.<br/><br/>If you finish your move on a space with a seed, pick it up and place it in your hand.<br/>If you finish your move on another player's tractor, pick it up and place it in any empty space on the board.<br/>If you created a diagonal, vertical, or horizontal line with three seeds of one suit, take the prize tile of that suit from the county fair. A line of four seeds with one of each suit collects the grid tile as a mixed harvest prize.<br/><br/>Collect three prizes to win.

        "description": "Based on WWII mechanics, Deep War is a fast paced strategic card game. The 2 players have to choose their faction, one Commander and than build their own armed forces.  Every Commander has its own skills and values around which specific and focused strategies can be built.<br/><br/>Each player must create their decks using 30 cards for the main deck and a certain amount for the Reserve deck (if requested by certain cards).<br/>They can choose from a huge variety of classes and types. Players can use in the same deck every combination of units they wish, like: infantry, artillery, reconnaissance vehicles, AA guns, tanks, SPG, fighters, bombers, aircraft carriers, submarines and many others.<br/><br/>Units have a certain deployment cost, attack and defense values, skills and historical descriptions.<br/>When the battle begins, both players start with 0 Manpower. This value is necessary for card deployment and skill activation and it grows up by 1 each turn, but it can be lowered or increased even more using powers (like a well performed bomb-raid or a supply vehicle deployed).<br/><br/>Units fight each other and can attack the Commanders. <br/>Ground units cannot attack the Navy, except for some special cards like coastal defense guns. The Navy can attack ground units only if the fire is coordinated by a spotter. Like in real life, the Aviation is a crucial part, planes are capable of attacking every other card on the field and can be attacked only by other planes or Anti-Air capable units.<br/>The player who most wisely creates his deck and uses the synergies between its cards to beat the enemy commander will win the game. Beware...there are secret weapons, which can overturn even the most desperate situation.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Frog Pig Pug is suitable for players as young as six. Borrowing mechanics from the classic card game Set, the game has been updated with fun animal art, new game play, and new rules - it takes 10-15 minutes to play and each game is totally different.<br/><br/>The goal of Frog Pig Pug is to identify a Proper Unit Group or 'PUG'. Each PUG consists of three cards that are all the same OR all different in their individual traits. There are three traits on every card of Frog Pig Pug: type of animal, color of animal, and number of animals. Six cards are dealt on the table face-up from the deck into the community pool, and each player is dealt one card that only they can utilize. Once a PUG is identified, a player yells &quot;PUG&quot; and gathers the cards in the PUG once confirmed by the other players.<br/><br/>Any used community pool cards or cards from the player's hand are replaced and play continues until all the cards from the deck are spent.  The player with the most PUGs wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Best described as chess with a sprinkling of D&amp;D, Random Coping Chess is the result of bedtime roommate chat being taken much too seriously and much too casually simultaneously. Randy (Our affectionate name for the game) adds components of storytelling and randomness to your average game of chess. You might encounter blizzards, landslides, or outlandish parties at which all your sliding pieces get drunk and their movement is best described as Brownian until they sober up. Assassins, tricksters, and temptresses may appear to thwart your plans.<br/><br/>If you play a lot of chess, Randy can freshen the game with it's new spin. If people of two very different skill levels are playing chess, Randy can level the playing field and make the game exciting for all players. If you never liked chess, maybe... just maybe... you'll like RANDOM COPING CHESS!!!<br/><br/>Random elements are added to the game when cards are drawn. Cards are not played by individual players - rather, a player rolls a die before each turn. If the die comes up a 1, a card is drawn. The card describes the elements that are added to the game, changing the rules of the game as it is played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mosaic is a two-player board game like Go and Othello. However, what differs from Go and Othello is that it is a 3D game that extends the position not only in the plane but also in the vertical direction. You can solidify your footsteps first, expand the territory, or hold down the upper floors early to divide the opponent's piece or develop a complex bargain. And from the middle to the end of the game, the pieces of each other pile up at once, and a dynamic reversal play occurs. Once you play it, you should be able to understand the benefits.<br/><br/>The game board has 7 x 7 = 49 holes, and a neutral piece is fixed at the center from the beginning.<br/><br/>Two players each have 70 pieces. The game is as follows.<br/><br/><br/>     Starting with the first player, place your pieces one by one in the empty hole of the game board.<br/>     If four pieces are lined up in the smallest square shape adjacent to each other, pieces can be placed on them.<br/>     If four frames are arranged in a square, and three or four of the four are occupied by the same color, the frame of that color is automatically placed on it (apart from the turn).<br/>     The piece fixed from the beginning to the center of the game board becomes a neutral piece which is not that of either player. When a square containing neutral frames is created, frames are automatically placed on top of the square only if the remaining three frames have the same color.<br/>     Automatically placed pieces will create new squares, and if 3 or 4 of the squares are occupied with the same color, pieces will be placed automatically as well. In this way, pieces are stacked in a chain reaction. The pieces to be stacked may not only be the pieces of the active player, but also the pieces of the opposing player.<br/>     In this way, the person who put the piece in turn alternately and who finished all his pieces first wins.<br/><br/><br/>The fun of the game called mosaic is in the rule that &quot;pieces are stacked in a chain reaction by putting one piece&quot;. From the middle of the game, development accelerates at a stretch, and the situation changes rapidly. In the early stage, even if you allow the opponent to lead, I think that the feeling when the development of one-shot reversal at the last moment is reached is unique to mosaics.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Mosaic is identical to Margalith Akavya's Upper Hand, but with the action taking place on a larger initial playing area.<br/><br/>--user summary<br/><br/><br/>Laplace is a two-player abstract strategy game in which your goal is to play all of your pieces before the opponent can.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 7x7 grid, and the players each have pieces of a different color. A piece of a third color is placed in the central square on the game board. On a turn, a player places one of their pieces into an empty space on the grid. If a player creates a square of four pieces and at least three of those pieces belong to that same player, then the player immediately places another piece on top of those four pieces; if the placement of that piece also creates a square meeting the same condition, then they place a piece on top of that square.<br/><br/>Thus, as more pieces are placed, they collectively form a pyramid, with the bottom layer being 7x7, then the next layer 6x6, and so on. Whoever places their final piece first wins!<br/><br/>Gameplay in Laplace is identical to Margalith Akavya's Upper Hand., but with the action taking place on a larger initial playing area.<br/><br/>",

Help your Family to defeat the diabolic forces that are threatening its quiet life.<br/>But be careful, the enemy hides inside the walls!<br/>There are four card types: Family characters (green), Objectives (white), Demons (red) and Power-ups (blue).<br/>The 72 cards deck features two games in one:<br/>- War at home: for 3-6 players, the complete game<br/>- Run for the Prad&uuml;n: a basic version using only 46 cards, for 2-4 players<br/>Each player takes the role of a character (one of the family members), possessing a special ability (for example increase power of her/himself or of a fellow family member). However, one of the players is secretly possessed by the Prad&uuml;n demon: his goal is to score points without being caught while the other players must find out who is it.<br/>On her turn, a player can decide to attack one of the Demons and if she succeeds (having cards that grant a power greater than that of the Demon) she collects the Demon as a Victory Point (VP). During the fight, other players can help or interfere by playing additional cards. Alternatively, the player can draw additional cards to strenghten her hand.<br/>VP can be spent to attack another player, hoping to reveal its objective card: if it is the Prad&uuml;n, the player wins; if not, the game continues. However, if the Prad&uuml;n scores 2VP, the player controlling it wins the game.<br/>The game is very funny, with Demons like the &quot;Damned alarm clock&quot; (whose power is equal to the time of the day, in hours) or the &quot;Were-elevator&quot; which tries to crush and block you.<br/>Power-ups can be temporary or permanent and they include things like &quot;Bunny's kiss&quot;, the &quot;Garbage sack&quot; or the &quot;No-purpose knife&quot;...<br/>In the simplified version, character's special abilities are neglected and the family members simply race through the house fighting demons to be the first to beat the Prad&uuml;n; however, other players can also be attacked and slowed down.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ZnajZnak. Feliszmered? is an educational game designed for two players, who acquire knowledge automatically while playing. ZnajZnak allows even 32 persons to play with the use of one set of cards. While playing the ZnajZnak game, players learn to recognise symbolic characters, dates, figures, places and objects of the Polish history.<br/><br/>The game is composed of 132 cards. Each of them presents 12 different symbols concerning the contemporary history of Poland and Hungary. If you take a closer look at any two cards, you'll find out that they contain a common character. 132 cards, 133 symbols and always only one common character. The aim of a player is to notice the character on two other cards on the table and to tell its name as fast as possible. If the player succeeds to do that, he/she passes his/her card to another player. If he/she does not know the name of the character, he/she turns the card, reads the definition of the symbol, puts a new card on the table, and the game goes on. The winner is the person who first gets rid of all the cards in hand.<br/><br/>The fates of Poland and Hungary have been linked together for centuries. Examples may be found not only in the distant past, but also still so close to us, in the 20th century. Poles and Hungarians could also count on each other&rsquo;s friendship and support in the face of threats from the greatest totalitarian regimes of all times &ndash; German Nazism and communism.<br/>The stories of both nations are filled with symbols, so when preparing the game, we had to make a selection, limiting the timeframe mainly to the 20th century. This is how a set of 133 symbols shown on the cards of the game was created. We hope that it will give both nations a chance to take a closer look at each other&rsquo;s stories. After all, the Polish-Hungarian celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of the 1956 events, organized in 2016, were held under the slogan &quot;Poles and Hungarians, we all remember together&quot;.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Japanese attack on the Island of West Timor, in the Dutch East Indies, was anticipated by the Allies as early as late December 1941. Soon after the start of the war, Sparrow Force, comprised mostly of Australian troops as well as some from the Dutch East Indies and Great Britain, occupied West Timor and began preparing defensive works.  This would allow a defensive island fortress between the expanding Japanese Empire and Australia.<br/><br/>To assault and secure the island, especially the airfield at Penful, the Japanese planned an amphibious assault supported by an ambitious paratrooper air-assault by the 1st and 3rd SNLF (Special Naval Landing Force) Battalions. The resulting fight for West Timor resulted in a confused and bitterly fought battle that ultimately resulted in the destruction and capture of the majority of Sparrow Force, one of the largest and most tragic defeats in Australia&rsquo;s military history. The Japanese paratrooper force was also savaged in the fighting, with nearly half of their number killed, seriously wounded, or missing. Those surviving paratroopers were dispersed throughout the Pacific in different commands and never performed another combat jump in the war.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

There are seven regular suits (Warfare, Legends, Landscape, Treasure, Roles, Religion, Stoneworks) which are captured by matching cards of the same suit.  There are two special suits:  Shamrocks and Dark Cards.  Shamrocks are free points and extend a turn.  Dark cards are discards against another player.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of an action followed by a discard.  The action can be either capturing a same suited card on the Tableau with a card in a player&rsquo;s hand or flipping over a card.  The flipped card is now the only card that can capture: either a card from the player&rsquo;s hand or one from the Tableau.  Captured cards are moved to a player&rsquo;s point field.  A discard ends the turn which is either a regular suited card on the tableau or a dark card against another player.<br/><br/>Complexity and strategy is created by determining when to play Shamrocks to extend a turn, when to capture cards that can be effected by Dark cards, saving wild cards or other counter cards to combat a dark card, and strategizing to capture the cards that are part of a sc&eacute;al (story).   <br/> The goal of the game is to amass the highest points after four rounds.  Points are counted on individual cards as well as in combinations of sc&eacute;alta (stories) that are depicted by matching icons.  Dark cards are negative points and have special effects that can target other cards.  Any cards left in a player&rsquo;s hand at the end of a round are counted against them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On a hexed isle far across a shining sea, wizards duel for magical supremacy and the fate of the island itself.<br/><br/>Mystery Wizard is a game for 2 to 6 players that takes around an hour to play, starring 8 unique spellcasting characters, each providing a radically different strategic experience. When each player chooses a wizard, they are selecting a totally unique set of spells and abilities which will flavor their strategic choices and paths to victory.<br/><br/>Each wizard begins the game in their village, in a corner of the hexagonal board. In the center of the board is a tower filled with ancient secrets. The objective of the game is to loot the tower and return two of its Mysteries home to your village. However, Mysteries are scarce, and in order to secure your own, you&rsquo;ll need to take them from someone else. Fierce opposition from rival wizards will take the form of fireballs, cyclones, wild animals, lightning bolts and more, leading to a chaotic capture-the-flag brawl where alliances can form or dissolve in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>Players must also navigate the effects of villainous priests, friendly goblins, burning desert sands, civil war, and more. A dynamic and engaging quest system brings the hexed isle to life with events and monsters, and provides a way for wizards to earn enchanted gear and powerful spells by seeking out lost temples and buried treasure. However, a creeping madness threatens to corrupt the land if the wizards do not move fast enough. The tension and difficulty slowly increase throughout game and lead to an end game characterized by knife&rsquo;s edge decision, where making one wrong move could spell doom.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players draw tiles, place fish on them either lying or telling the truth, and score more points for having all 3 colors of fish / tiles in a particular horizontal row.<br/><br/>When a player draws a tile, they examine it and then place it face down on the next open spot in their player's monk fish display. They then place a number of fish of one color on top of the tile. This claim can be either true or a lie. Going around the table, check whether another player wants to challenge the active player's claim. If challenged, the active player reveals the tile. If they were truthful, they keep the tile, but the challenger loses their most recent tile. If caught in a lie, the active player gives the tile and the bluff fish to the challenger, who places them in their next tile slot on their player board. In addition to the normal fish tiles, there are 2 special tiles which change up some of the results of the bluffing.<br/><br/>Play continues until all but one player has filled up all their slots, or until out of tiles.<br/><br/>Players score each horizontal row. In each row, they look at the colors of the fish (tokens or fish on tiles).  If all 3 colors are represented, then they score the number of all fish in that row. Otherwise, the row scores the number of tiles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Orc teams are very hard-hitting, concentrating on pounding an opponent into the turf to create gaps through which the excellent Orc Blitzers can run. Indeed, if any fault can be found with Orc teams in general, it is that they sometimes spend a little bit too much time pounding the opposition, and not enough time running the ball to score!<br/><br/>Expand your roster and add variation to your line-up with this booster pack! It contains 4 resin miniatures &ndash; 1 Blitzer, 1 Thrower and 2 hulking Black Orcs, each covered in detail and posed dynamically, as well as differently to the plastic models from the Blood Bowl boxed game. They're the perfect way to add variety to your Orc Blood Bowl team.<br/><br/>These 4 resin miniatures are supplied with 4 32mm Blood Bowl bases. Up-to-date Orc team rules can be found in the Blood Bowl Almanac 2018.<br/><br/>Key Features<br/>New players for your Orc team<br/>Add variety to your lineup<br/>4 gorgeously detailed miniatures<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To do this, each player has the same 8 cards as their opponent.  Each player is trying to out think their opponent to swing the personality meter all the way to their side of the brain and take total control.<br/><br/>Turns are played simultaneously by choosing the card to play each round and then revealing them together (along with each cards special Trait chosen that turn).  After applying the Traits, the final Power values are compared to affect the Node track (score).  Cards have a cool off period before returning to the hand.  Choosing the right Power value and right Trait becomes a mind game against your opponent.

All that with cards, dice and a board. And a little bit of negative interaction.<br/><br/>In the box (nicely finished in matte), you get a 4 page instruction, a board with 57 squares, 4 cardboard pawns (with plastic clip-on bases), 50 &quot;Musician&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Music piece&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Musical instrument&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Event&quot; or &quot;Occurrence&quot; cards, 18 &quot;Concert&quot; tokens, 18 &quot;Golden treble clef&quot; tokens and a six-sided dice. The goal of the game is to get 5 &quot;Golden treble&quot; tokens (or 3 in the shorter game variant). <br/>Players actions consist of a dice roll, movement (either clockwise or counter clockwise), and performing the action listed on the space of the board (kind of like in Talisman  ). The board spaces consist of actions like: draw a card from indicated pile, gain or lose a token, use a shortcut, exchange a card with other player and so on. The &quot;Event&quot; cards change the course of the game. You can use such card as soon as you draw one, or leave it for later (depending on the card). Example: &quot;Thanks to your hard work, the orchestra will play at a festival abroad. You get a 'Concert' token&quot;. <br/>&quot;Music piece&quot; cards should be matched with &quot;Musicians&quot; and &quot;Instruments&quot; - for example &quot;Music piece: Chopin - Prelude in E minor. Instrument needed: piano&quot; -&gt; you have to find a musician who plays piano, like &quot;Miss Wanda. A piano expert&quot;, and a &quot;Instrument&quot; card with a piano. One musician can often play more than one instrument, but there's a twist: for example you can get a pianist, but he only plays one composer's pieces, or he doesn't play Chopin's or Mozart's or someone's music. &quot;Instruments&quot; cards (50 cards, but 16 types of instruments) include some technical/historical info; &quot;Musicians&quot; cards are quite funny in polish. If you get 3 such matching cards (music piece, musician, instrument), you get a &quot;Concert&quot; token. Then you have to get to a &quot;Practice room&quot; field on the board (there's two of them; roll a dice or use a shortcut). When you get there, you discard the &quot;Concert&quot; token and get the &quot;Golden clef&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You and 1 to 3 other players are masters of herbal remedies and potions who have come to make new lives for yourselves in a small town. Will you be a helpful addition to the community, becoming the Apothecary, or will you be a snake oil salesperson, only in it for a quick buck before moving on to the next town?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Apothecary is a medieval-themed game of medicine-making and disease management for 2-4 players. You and your friends play competing herbalists who have set up shop in a small town. You will buy resources (represented by cards and tokens) and use them to treat sick villagers (represented by cards). You will have the choice to actually treat or filmflam the villagers with snake oil&mdash;but watch out&mdash;too much lying and you&rsquo;ll get run out of town. Do it right and you&rsquo;ll be made the Apothecary!<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of phases, (A-E).<br/><br/>- In Phase A (Auction), players will bid for turn order, and the prices for the herbs players will use will be set. <br/>- In Phase B (Barter), players will buy supplies from the market, forage in the woods, or trade with other players.<br/>- In Phase C (Collect), players will select villager cards for treatment.<br/>- In Phase D (Disease), players will use their resources to treat their villager cards, either honestly or dishonestly. <br/>- In Phase E (End), the market will be reset, and disease tokens will be added to villager cards, bringing them closer to death!<br/><br/>In order to win the game, players must either accomplish a unique objective they've been dealt at the beginning of the game, or treat enough villagers honestly so that they land on the Apothecary space of the Apothecary track. If one player is Run Out (the other end of the track), the player(s) who were not Run Out and who have the most money win the game.<br/><br/>",

It can also use counters from the SPI game Spitfire and the map from the Avalon Hill game Flight Leader.  Fighter Duel covers combats between 2 to 4 fighters per side, and focuses on simple but realistic modelling of formation tactics, aircraft energy and situational awareness.  It now includes unique solitaire rules allowing any or all fighters to be placed under AI control.  In 2023 the simpler spin-off Fighter Duel Lite was posted, with just 2 pages of rules and no luck after initial deployment.

        "description": "In Japan, there are summer festivals known as Nebuta Matsuri. The most famous one takes place at Aomori, and is considered as an intangible national treasure in Japan. During the festival, huge floats (Nebuta) are paraded through the town, depicting brave warrior figures or kabuki style heroes and gods or just local celebrities, and dancers walk alongside dressed in special costume (Haneta). They perform a sort of bouncing dance as they walk, and call to the mass of tourists to join in. The call is a sing-song, Rasserā (ラッセラー), and they sing &quot;Rasse ra, Rasse ra, RasseRasseRasse ra&quot;. In addition, there are Crow Dancers, Karasu-zoku (カラス族 &quot;crow gang&quot;), who act to disrupt the festival.<br/><br/>Nebuta Beat is a party game to simulate the rhythmic chanting and dancing. Each player gets a specific dancer card, showing their colour and their own dance move. The players stand around the table, taking turns to play a card from their hand to the centre in rhythm with the chant. All the players keep up the chant, Rasse ra, Rasse ra, RasseRasseRasse ra, and according to which cards are played (by colour and form), different players must perform their correct slow bouncing dance steps. If they make a mistake, they get cards as a penalty, until a score is reached.<br/><br/>Publisher's description<br/>&quot;NEBUTA BEAT&quot; is a card-driven, real &quot;dancing&quot; game.

        "description": "There's a central deck of cards from which players dig fossils. Most of these cards are dinosaur fossils. Some of these are too big and hence broken into 2 or 3 parts. On each fossil card, you'd find three main attributes of that dinosaur - it's type, time period and region. It also has a face value assigned on the top right corner. Players dig fossils from the central deck and exhibit their finds in different sections as per their type, time period or region. A section with at least 2 dinosaurs is considered complete. While digging 1 card is free, players can pay and dig more in the same turn. For this, they may gather money by selling fossils that they may not use to the market. Other players may also find what they need in the market and can buy from there as well. If a player completes 3 different sections or exhibits 5 dinosaurs within 1 section, the game ends. To determine the winner, all players calculate the total value of their exhibited fossils plus any remaining cash plus bonus points for the diversity of their collections.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grikk the Gremlin is a promotional Character card for Witchful Thinking.<br/><br/>Grikk's first Character Ability, Mischievous, represents every gremlin's instinct of ruining peoples lives and sabotaging their dreams. This Character Ability allows Grikk to force a witch to swap 1 Potion card of his choice with him or another witch when he plays a Sneaky Witch card. In Witchful Thinking, the winner of the game is the player who has collected the most Potion cards. If there is a tie, all tied players must add their own Potion cards together, and whoever has the greatest value wins. This means that players want Potion cards with positive numbers instead of negative numbers to ensure their own victory. So for example, if a witch has the Elixir of Life which has a value of +18, Grikk can use his Character Ability to take that valuable card away and give it to another witch instead, or he can take it for himself.<br/><br/>Grikk's second Character Ability, Trickster, represents every gremlin's desire to play tricks on others. This Character Ability allows Grikk to force a witch to swap their entire hand of Ingredient cards with another witch or himself when he plays a Sneaky Witch card. Forcing other players to swap their cards with each other can be a useful tactic because you can interrupt what the players were planning to do next. Alternatively, Grikk can use this Character Ability to get new cards if his own cards are no good.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;La Grande Arm&ecirc;e: Napoleonic Warfare at Divisional Level 1800 - 1815&quot; is a set of miniatures wargame rules designed for full army engagements between the French and Allied forces of the Napoleonic period. Armies are subdivided into Corps, with the Corp Commander giving orders to elements of Brigade or Divisional size for cavalry and elements of Divisional size for infantry and the artillery reserves.<br/><br/>The bound sequence is based around Corp command actions that allow the individual elements to execute actions, whilst opposing elements may react to these actions. Has the battle progresses the elements will start to become disrupted and will obtain a number of disruption markers. This disruption will hinder the elements in their actions and give advantage to elements that are less disrupted.<br/><br/>These Napoleonic rules are designed to give a generic battle with little or no detail below Divisional level. Troop classes are subdivided into infantry, cavalry and artillery, whilst troop class are split into guard, seasoned and garrison. As with most of our rules we have tried to make the rules fun, but still maintaining the realistic feel of the period... so enjoy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Pickets, fines, taxes, protests, corralitos, looting, devaluations and other endless problems will be presented to you every day. But now let's talk about the game ... Well, it's similar, only much more fun and it will also help you see reality in a different way. To achieve your mission you have 5,000 pesos in your pocket, 5 cards and a chain of businesses ready to open.<br/><br/>On your turn, you must choose one of the following options:<br/>a) Advance, as many boxes as the dice indicate.<br/>b) Charge, the State will pay you 100 times what the dice say (and well, it's a game!).<br/>c) Draw a card.<br/><br/>There are three kinds of cards: problems, solutions and bonds. With the problems, you can stop the other players by devaluating them, fining them, looting them or corralling their money. With the solutions, you can solve the problems that your competitors threw at you (but unfortunately these solutions only work in the game). With the bonds (and this may be strange for everyone) you can take advantage of their value and exchange them with the state for money.<br/><br/>On your way to the end of the year, you will land on empty lots where you can put your business, listen to the National Chain, collect privilege pensions, pay extraordinary taxes, sell pots and many other things that will make you think that you have always been a great player of this game and that nobody else will be able to win.<br/><br/>This game references the 1998-2002 Argentine Great Depression.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the translated<br/><br/>Su objetivo es llegar a fin de a&ntilde;o, claro que esto no es tarea f&aacute;cil.

Con las soluciones, Usted puede resolver los problemas que sus competidores le arrojaron a Usted (pero lamentablemente estas soluciones s&oacute;lo sirven para el juego).

With the Nine Realms shattered, however, Ginnungagap has been left unguarded and unspeakable horrors now await those who wish to cross it.<br/><br/>Ragnarok: The Abyss includes new scenarios for Ragnarok as well as new monsters to vanquish in glorious battle. New mechanics introduce something once barely recognized by war clans--Fear--and present entirely new challenges for them to overcome in the telling of their sagas.<br/><br/>",

It featured a cycle of double-faced cards (originally used in Innistrad) that have a legendary creature on one side representing the character before their transformation, and a planeswalker on the reverse face that represents them after gaining their new power.<br/><br/>The set introduced the mechanics of renown, spell mastery, and menace. It also features cards with the prowess mechanic, which was introduced in Khans of Tarkir block, and the scry mechanic, which was introduced in Mirrodin block.<br/><br/>In February 2015, Wizards of the Coast said that it would be an introductory product &quot;like a core set&quot;, and it was published in the time period that a core set would have taken up during the pattern established by Magic 2010. After Origins, Magic switched to a new schedule where each year contained 2 blocks, and each block contained 2 sets. With the new schedule, there are no announced plans for a major &quot;standalone&quot; set like Origins that is not part of a block.<br/><br/>",

We must send them back to where they came from before they destroy his tower!<br/><br/>Brawlings is a modular card game for 2 to 4 players that consists of 54 cards divided into 4 modules. At the start of the game, build the deck with cards from the modules you wish to use, then divide them equally among all players.<br/><br/>In the middle of the table you'll have Brawls, which are groups into which any player will be able to play other Brawlings from their hand, to fight those already in play and try to knock them down.<br/><br/>Players collect any Brawling they knock out during their turn, by laying it face up in three piles in front of them. Brawlings on top of those piles are called Champions. <br/>At the end of the game, players calculate their score by using their Champions score multipliers. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A well trained, well armed, but unprepared Israel must defend herself against a multinational coalition lead by Egypt and Syria that is bent on her destruction. 1973 highlights the highly mobile nature of this campaign, and adds a realistic treatment of air operations.  Some support units are included in the OOB as to give players a chance to experience how new weapons systems for the time had an impact on the battle space. Moving the PCS series to a desert environment gives mechanized and motorized units a huge level of freedom in terms of maneuver.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But, alas, the Ring comes with a terrible curse that destroys anyone who wears it for too long!<br/><br/>In your turn you take a character either form Midgard (the main deck) or from your hand and then, you put him (or her) in your Great Hall. A Great Hall can contain up to six characters. Heroes and villains can kill each other or even fall in love, changing greatly how the Great Halls look. Also, each character has a &quot;Ring&quot; value that allows you to take the mighty Ring from whoever is wearing it right now.<br/><br/>Having the Ring allows you to take treasures. Treasure cards may give you victory points or, even better, old artifacts with amazing powers. But beware!! If the curse affects you, you will lose a treasure and one of your own characters will die. You can, however, give up the ring before this happens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players use both defensive and offensive moves to tilt and roll their own balls into the center goal while keeping their opponent's balls out. The first player to sink all five of their balls wins.<br/><br/>Alternate play includes adding up to eight pegs to the board for an added obstacle challenge. Players navigate their balls through these obstacles and into the goal.

        "description": "In Deluxe Poker Rummy there are two sets of 4 different color tiles (black, red, yellow and blue) each numbering 2 through 10 plus Jack, Queen, King, and Ace; plus 2 jokers. The games comes with rules to play both the American Way and the International Way.<br/><br/>How to play Deluxe Poker Rummy the American Way:<br/><br/>Each players picks 14 tiles and must have a total of 25 points in one or more sets or runs in their hand in order to place those tiles on the table. After you place your initial tiles down you are ready to play the table (i.e. add to sets or runs already played) but if during your turn you are unable to play on the table you must pick a tile from the remaining ones. Jokers are wild.<br/>     <br/>     The first player who gets rid of all the tiles in his hand is the winner.  The other remaining players must total all the points left in their hand.  Each tile is worth the number of points as valued on the tile.  The jokers are worth 25 points.<br/>     Your objective therefore is to keep as few points in your hand as possible.<br/><br/>How to play Deluxe Poker Rummy the American Way:<br/><br/>The bricks are laid face down, shuffled and arranged - still face down - in one stack of 8 bricks and fourteen stacks of 7 bricks each, starting from left to right. The opener starts the game by turning face up the top brick of the last stack on the left which then becomes &quot;Trump&quot; for the round.<br/><br/>The stacks are then dealt until each player has 14 bricks, except for Player #2, which will have 15. Player #2 takes an unwanted one from his hand and puts it on the table to his right, face up.<br/><br/>The first stage of the game is to arrange the bricks on your stand in Sets of &quot;Runs&quot; or &quot;Groups&quot;. Players draw a brick from the pool and then discard either it or another brick from their stand. You can meld any Sets from your stand onto the table, provided their total value is 50 or more. Once a Set has been melded it may be added to, but not changed or taken back.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "八人の魔術師 (Hachi-nin no majutsu-shi) Eight Wizards is a two player fantasy card game from Japan.<br/><br/>In the distant past, two rival beings possessing unimaginable magical power clashed for control of the world. In the end, their conflict triggered an incredible explosion of energy, resulting in the mutual destruction of these god-like beings. This explosion was so powerful, it twisted the very fabric of reality in upon itself, ripping the world in two and leaving time to flow in an infinite loop. Those who survived the brutal conflict soon realized the energy of these dead gods was slowly being drawn to the central point where the two worlds now met. Skilled in the art of energy manipulation, those known as Summoners are now able to harness the power stored in this central point, referred to as The Node, to conjure Wizards and Monsters to do battle. By defeating a conjured being in battle, Summoners can capture energy in special Gemstones. Only through the use of these energy-filled Gemstones can the loop finally be broken and order restored to the world. However, there is a catch. Only the side with the greatest amount of stored energy will survive when the two halves of the world merge once again. With the fate of their world at stake, the battle between the Summoners thus began.<br/><br/>A game consists of 4 rounds with 5 battles. Each round is played as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     The Attacker chooses one card from their hand and plays it face-up on the table. Activate any abilities that apply.<br/>     The Defender then chooses 1 card from their hand and plays it face-up in front of the Attacker's card. Activate any abilities that apply.<br/>     After all relevant abilities have been applied, compare the cards' Power levels. The card with the higher value wins.<br/>     Turn the losing card sideways to the defeated position. (In the case of a tie, turn both cards sideways.) Note: A card is not considered &quot;defeated&quot; if the battle ended in a tie.<br/>     Assign the role of Attacker to the player who won the battle, and Defender to their opponent. (In the case of a tie, the roles of Attacker and Defender remain the same as the previous battle.)<br/>     Repeat steps 1-5 until all 5 battles have been played OR the special win condition is met.<br/><br/><br/>After all 4 rounds are finished, the player with more points showing on their Gemstones is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

It is set in another dimension that is known as Black Sun, located somewhere in an alternate jungles of Cambodia in the year 1968. The rules are designed to give you an authentic feel for warfare in the Viet Nam War and could certainly be used for this purpose. However, the game also includes some fantastic events from the alternate dimension of the Black Sun. These rules include unpredictable events &ndash; sudden rushes, explosions, ambushes, and malfunctioning weapons along with more far flung environmental and strange atmospheric manifestations &ndash; that will challenge your strategy and tactics as a tabletop general. The terrain can be as elaborate or as simple as you like; but the game is best played with lots of cover (jungle, trees, jungle, rocks, downed helicopters, ancient buildings and yet more jungle). The playing area can represent anything from an ancient city to an alien jungle canopy to a Bug-infested tunnel complex! <br/>Each player controls a Force about the size of a small squad (6-15 models). Some Forces may involve more models than others since they consist either of less skilled troops (like NVA militia or poorly armed and trained conscripts) or weird alien Fury Bugs whose strength lies in their overwhelming numbers. As players become more experienced, they can control larger numbers of troops as well as vehicles and incorporate more advanced rules for Viet Nam era warfare. At its most basic size (squad level), a game of Black Sun should take an hour or less to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pippinzip is a square board connection game for 2-3 players. Various sizes of boards are possible, from short games on a 5x5 grid played with pencil and paper, to longer games on a Go board (9x9, 13x13, or 19x19). <br/><br/><br/>THE BASIC IDEA:<br/><br/>The game begins with an auction phase -- a sort of mini-game of chicken (reminiscent of Unlur), in which an initially empty board is gradually seeded with a growing number of initial stones.  The auction phase determines who will play the role of &quot;Pip&quot; (using black stones) and who will play the role of &quot;Zip&quot; (using white stones).<br/><br/>After the auction phase ends and the roles are thereby determined, the players take turns playing stones of their color to the board.  Play continues until a winning condition is reached. (Draws are impossible.)  Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides of the board via a chain of orthogonally-adjacent black stones.  Zip wins connecting all FOUR sides of the board via a chain of 8-way-adjacent white stones. (&quot;8-way-adjacent&quot; = either orthogonally or diagonally adjacent.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>IN MORE DETAIL:<br/><br/>There are two varieties of play, &quot;Zipline&quot; and &quot;Pipline&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>Pipline:<br/><br/>This is the standard version of the game. The game begins with an empty board and an &quot;auction phase.&quot; In this phase, on his/her turn a player places 1-3 BLACK stones onto empty points on the board. (Each player has a free choice of whether to place 1 black stone, or 2 black stones, or 3 black stones on his/her turn.) Players alternate turns, playing black stones exclusively in this phase of the game, until one player on his/her turn says &quot;Take&quot; instead of placing any stones.  This taker is henceforth known as &quot;Pip&quot; and will play a SINGLE black stone on each future turn.  The opponent (i.e. the non-taker) is &quot;Zip,&quot; who will play a SINGLE white stone on each future turn.<br/><br/>Immediately after &quot;take&quot; is announced, the non-taker (i.e. Zip) has his/her turn and places a single white stone, followed by a single black stone from Pip, then a single white stone from Zip, etc.  Turns alternate in this fashion until one player achieves his/her win condition (or until one player resigns). Zip wins by connecting all FOUR sides of the board with a chain of white stones that are orthogonally and/or diagonally adjacent; Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides with a chain of black stones that are orthogonally adjacent.<br/><br/>Pencil-and-Paper Play: Pipline is the recommended version of the game for pencil-and-paper play (draw four vertical lines and four horizontal lines to make a 5x5 grid, as depicted here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5173760/cdunc123\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5173760/cdunc123</a>)<br/><br/><br/>Zipline:<br/><br/>This is an alternative version of the game. To start the game, on each turn a player places 1-3 WHITE stones in the auction phase. (Each player has a free choice of whether to place 1 white stone, or 2 white stones, or 3 white stones on his/her turn.) Players alternate turns, playing white stones exclusively in this phase of the game, until one player on his/her turn says &quot;take&quot; instead of placing any stones.  This taker is henceforth known as &quot;Zip&quot; and on future turns Zip will play a SINGLE white stone per turn.  The opponent (i.e. the non-taker) is known as &quot;Pip.&quot; On future turns, Pip will play TWO black stones per turn, with the following restriction:  Pip's second black stone of a given turn is NOT allowed to be placed orthogonally adjacent to the first black stone of the turn. (Placing two diagonally adjacent black stones in the same turn IS allowed. Also, note that in the extremely rare case where ALL remaining empty cells are orthogonally adjacent to first black stone, the second black stone is forfeited.)<br/><br/>Immediately after &quot;take&quot; is announced, the non-taker (i.e. Pip) has his/her turn and plays two black stones, followed by a single white stone played by Zip, then two black stones from Pip, then a single white stone from Zip, etc.  Turns alternate in this fashion until one player achieves his/her win condition (or until one player resigns).  Zip wins by connecting all FOUR sides of the board with a chain of white stones that are orthogonally and/or diagonally adjacent; Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides with a chain of black stones that are orthogonally adjacent.<br/><br/>&quot;Freestyle&quot; Variant: For variety you can play Zipline with free placement for Pip's two black stones, that is, with no ban on orthogonally adjacent placements in the same turn.<br/><br/>Three-Person Pippinzip: The Zipline version of Pippinzip can also be played as a 3 player game.  In 3 player Zipline, the taker plays as Zip and the two non-takers play as a single Pip team.  Each non-taker plays a single black stone on his/her turn, for a total of two black stones for Pip for every one white stone for Zip.  Roles are determined in the auction phase using the same process described for 3 player Unlur in this thread: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1706872/unlur-three-people\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1706872/unlur-three-people</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES<br/><br/><br/>     Before the game, players should agree whether to place stones on the intersections of the game board grid (as in Go) or alternatively, place stones within the cells of the game board grid.  Either mode of play is fine; it is a matter of personal choice.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>     The board starts out empty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Placement must always be to an EMPTY intersection or cell (depending on which mode was agreed before the start of the game).  There is no capture or displacement of enemy stones in Pippinzip.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Once placed, stones never move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     If during the auction phase, a player creates the win condition for the color being used in the auction phase, then that player wins the game.  (However, this won't happen if both players play competently!)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The game ends with a final jackpot round where players can chain multiple jackpots together! Can you hit the jackpot and win the payout?&rdquo;<br/><br/>In Jackpot Payout, each player receives the same starting hands of cards and a play mat. A display area of cards that can be obtained is placed within reach of all players. On a player's turn, the player will draw the top 3 cards from their hand of shuffled cards and place them on the 3 areas of their player mat. The mat represents 3 reels of a slot machine.<br/><br/>If a player gets 3 matching cards, they hit the jackpot! Those cards are placed in the player's score pile. Cards will have coins on them in addition to symbols and special text.

        "description": "The agents are sent to a village in 1799 to find and defuse Basilisk, a monster that got there through a space-time rift from an alternative dimension.<br/><br/>Basilisk's Lair is a Czech fan extension for T.I.M.E Stories. To play it is necessary to own a basic game. It is issued in the form of &ldquo;print and play&rdquo;, so you have to print and cut it first.<br/><br/>The script is original, not an adaptation of a book, film, or comic. This is an amateur act, which is reflected primarily in the graphic aspect of the game, but it is comparable with similar acts published here on the site.<br/><br/>The scenario is rather relaxed, you will not have to solve challenging and lengthy puzzles, which does not mean that it is a linear adventure without thinking. At almost any point in time, you will have to make decisions, some of which can be fatal and have a major impact on your group's fate. In addition, there is not only one path leading to the goal, and not all paths lead to the goal.<br/><br/>The scenario will guide you through the preparation and subsequent participation in an expedition to find and kill Basilisk. It contains some non-standard elements (&ldquo;minilocations&rdquo;, special status tokens directly printed on the cards) that enrich the basic game principle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With UQ Hockey, we aim to provide you with an extremely quick and accurate method of resolving the final score between two hockey teams. With UQ Hockey you can play out an entire season for a team or a league in rapid fashion. UQ Hockey makes a perfect stand-alone game for season replays. It also functions very well as a complimentary game by resolving the games that don&rsquo;t particularly interest you in a detailed shot-by-shot game, while you use the detailed game to play out the games that do interest you.<br/><br/>Unlike most quick play games, which only provide a team score, UQ Hockey does offer an optional individual scoring module to allow you to track league leaders in goals and assists. UQ Hockey also features an individual goalie modification for even more realism.<br/><br/>With UQ Hockey, you'll be able to track not only Team wins and losses, but league leaders for Goals scored, assists and GAA.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Children love to play with these but unfortunately, a group of trolls has settled into a glade there. They love the glimstones too and have been snatching the children for lunch. A wizard recruits Esmeralda, from the Hoard game, as he knows of her reputation stealing treasure from a dragon and hopes to put her skills to use to benefit the community.<br/>The wizard and Esmeralda set off in opposite directions, collecting glimstones which can be used to ransom snatched children and buy time. When they meet again, if they have the right combination of glimstones, they can perform a spell to zap a troll. They must zap all the trolls to win, but if a player ends their turn and all children have been taken, the players lose.<br/>Players use movement cards to move the characters between the gems; it is possible to plan sequences of movements to get the characters to align again. Before each player's turn, an event card reveals if a child has been snatched or other forest inhabitants, some friend and some foe to the players, have been active that turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A handful of victims were abducted at various points throughout the month, killed in gruesome ways, decorated to resemble popular children&rsquo;s toys, and gift-wrapped for the police to find. Among those &ldquo;toys&rdquo; that were created and left for the authorities: a life-sized Jack in the Box that caused a spring-loaded victim to pop out of the top when the handle was cranked, a Nutcracker doll decorated with greasepaint and blood, a robot that was created from both human and mechanical parts, and a marionette whose movements could be controlled via a series of cables that were attached the victim&rsquo;s limbs. The gift cards attached to each one were all signed by someone calling themselves &ldquo;The Toymaker.&rdquo; Police were closing in on the culprit when The Toymaker stopped killing, causing the trail to grow cold. They have continued to pursue leads throughout the year, but they haven&rsquo;t had any real breakthroughs in a while. Earlier this week, a new &ldquo;gift&rdquo; arrived from the killer, and it is reasonable to assume that the murders will start anew. If the pattern holds, there is only a very finite amount of time to investigate before The Toymaker goes underground again. No doubt The Toymaker has more &ldquo;toys&rdquo; in mind to create so lives are at risk.<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 7/10<br/><br/>",

Those who book a spot aboard The Dagger will spend their time in full pirate regalia, enjoying the high seas as buccaneers of old did: imbibing on copious amounts of rum, feasting in the banquet hall, gambling, and lounging on the deck. As part of a new promotion, guests aboard the ship will also have the duration of the cruise to search for clues aboard The Black Dagger that will lead to Captain Armstead&rsquo;s treasure. Whoever finds the treasure first wins $25,000. Given your recent case load with The Will Street Detective Agency, you are eager for a break and book passage aboard the ship, thinking it sounds like fun...and a way to possibly win a nice stack of cash. A group of history and English professors from Valley Falls University has the same idea and books spots on the cruise as a last hurrah before the fall term begins. The voyage is everything the brochures describe and more. Everyone is having the time of their lives when the unthinkable happens and one of the professors, Dr. Alexander Gorman, is found stabbed in the back in his cabin. Because the ship is hours from the nearest port and you have had some success with this type of case you offer to help with the investigation. The captain readily agrees. There is a killer aboard The Black Dagger, and it is up to you to uncover the motive behind Dr. Gorman&rsquo;s murder and bring the killer to justice.<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 7.5/10<br/><br/>",

The goal is simple: Move your three pieces to the three spaces on the opposite side of the board before your opponents can do so. Players may jump over opposing pieces, which they then relocate. You will find it's not easy to progress at times because of your opponent's movement and re-location of your pieces.<br/><br/>Each player has three colored pieces with reversible faces to show their goal sign. Each player sets their three pieces, plain color up, on their three starting spaces. A turn is made by moving one of your pieces. Passing your turn isn't allowed.<br/><br/>You can move any one of your pieces to an unoccupied space in any of eight directions (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). You may move a piece by jumping over any number of adjacent pieces, whether your own or an opponent's, onto a vacant space. When jumped, your pieces stay where they are, but opposing pieces must be relocated to a vacant space.<br/><br/>Once a piece reaches the goal, you flip it over, and that piece is now immobile. You can't move it, and opposing players can't jump over it because it can't be relocated.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, if you haven't won and all of your starting spaces are occupied with pieces &mdash; whether yours or others &mdash; you are out of the game. If more than one player remains in the game, remove all of your pieces from the board. Continue the game to determine the winner.<br/><br/>The first player to move their three pieces to the opposite side of the board or the last active player still in the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Samurai are the almost mythical warrior caste of Japanese history. <br/>Their most famous exploits occurred during the Sengoku period between 1467 and 1603. <br/>With the Emperor and the Shogun unable to control the many daimyos, there was near constant fighting between the various factions. In these times the Samurai code (Bushido) became more defined and standards of fighting improved. <br/>Even the introduction of the musket in 1543 was seen as an opportunity rather than a threat.<br/><br/>Ashigaru (literally &ldquo;light foot&rdquo;) were so named as they had lighter armour than the Samurai. They also formed the bulk of the armies of the day. Each Samurai was expected to provide two armed Ashigaru. Many of these would be armed with the yari (spear). These are not the pike blocks of contemporary Europe as the Ashigaru were trained to fight in a looser formation, travel quicker and their spear was for slicing and thrusting. Many a battle was won by the Ashigaru, especially if cavalry were foolish enough to attack them from the front.<br/><br/>The biggest change in the Sengoku period (1467-1603) would affect the role of missile troops in battle. At the start of the period, these were all armed with the yumi (bow) and fought in coordinated units to pepper the enemy with their arrows. This bow, like the equivalent English Longbow, took many years training to perfect but was deadly when used correctly. Due to the training needed there were never as many yumi armed troops as a daimyo may have wanted!<br/><br/>By the 16th and 17th centuries, warfare was changing and the Samurai were changing with it. They did not forget their horse-riding roots while this change happened. Even though the introduction of the long spear made cavalry charges more difficult to pull off they were still performed. A well-timed strike by a unit of Samurai horsemen could turn the tide of a battle. These cavalry attacks continued throughout the Sengoku period and many a daimyo lost his head to one.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the year 1511 and the Portuguese Empire rules the seas.  Far in the east, the port city of Malacca makes the mistake of backstabbing them, sparking a war at their doorstep. As Admiral of the Portuguese Empire, you arrive at Malacca to punish the Sultan's foolish betrayal by laying waste to his city. Meanwhile, as Laksamana of the Sultanate, you must repel the invaders and save your home from certain doom.<br/><br/>Malacca 1511 is a 1-2 player game of the Portuguese conquest of Malacca in 54 cards - with 2 Solo Modes: a Solo game as the Portuguese Empire, and a Solo Campaign as the Sultanate.<br/><br/>In a two-player game, each player leads one side, fighting over the city and against each other's armies in this unique Deck Builder vs Engine Builder card game. The cards are double-sided, with one side being the Empire Attackers besieging Malacca, while the flip side is the Sultanate's Defenders trying to hold them at bay. The game also uses a creative area control mechanic that simulates the Frontline of battle. This makes vying for the right cards and spaces on the battlefield key to winning the war.<br/><br/>The Portuguese Empire plays as a Deck Builder, building up their strength to unleash increasingly deadly attacks against the city. The Sultanate plays as a Set Collection, Tableau + Engine Builder, adding Fighters to their city to bolster up defenses and making it easier to defeat enemies on future turns.<br/><br/>Awards:<br/><br/>From the 2020 54-Card Game Design Contest.<br/>-Best War Themed Game: 1st Place!<br/>-Best Solo Game: 2nd Place!<br/>-Best Euro Game: 2nd Place!<br/>-Best Overall Game: 3rd Place!<br/>-Jury Prize: 3rd Place!<br/>-Best 2 Player Game: 3rd place!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the jungle, all the animals are gathering. They demand that all resources be divided rightfully among them. The stronger ones are taking more than the weak. That&rsquo;s wrong! But, who will ensure that peace prevails? The winner of this battle of wits will be the King of the Jungle!<br/><br/>Fracto is a 3-in-1 card game to learn operations with fractions. It has a set of 80 playing cards. There are 3 kinds of fraction cards - number cards, image cards and word cards.When the sum of two fraction cards is equal to 1, it is called a whole pair. For example:  ⅓ + ⅔ = 1 : so, the fractions ⅓ , ⅔  together forms a whole pair. where as ⅚ + 2/6 = 7/6, so the fraction ⅚ + 2/6 does not form a whole pair. Remember, here you can make whole pairs using only two fraction cards. The three different gameplay of fracto are: Whole-in-1, Deck of Fortune and Memory Hero. <br/>Let&rsquo;s look at the first gameplay: To play Whole-in-1, shuffle the cards and distribute 8 cards to each player. These are the hand cards. The main deck is placed face down in the centre of the table. Check your hand cards if you can make any whole pairs. if you can, then place the pairs face down on the table in front of you.At any given point in the game, you must have even number of hand cards. Pick the top card from the main deck. place it face up on the table. This is the discard pile. The player on the left of the dealer starts the game and it continues clockwise. On your turn, you can either pick up the top card from the discard pile or the top card from the main deck. Check if you can make a whole pair using the new card. if yes, then place the whole pair, face down, in front of you and discard any card from your hand cards into the discard pile. if you cannot make a pair, then put any of your hand cards into the discard pile. The turn moves to the next player. You must call out &ldquo;fracto&rdquo; whenever you have only 2 hand cards. This is applicable even at the start of the game. if you do not call out &ldquo;fracto&rdquo; and you are caught by another player, you must draw four cards from the main deck. You finish when you have made whole pairs with all your hand cards. There will be one card remaining, which will be discarded into the discard pile. When you have made all the whole pairs, you must show the whole pairs to the other players. If you have  made a wrong whole pair, you need to draw four cards from the main deck. you must also pick up the incorrect pairs and the game continues.<br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s look at the second gameplay: To play Deck of Fortune, shuffle the cards and distribute equally until all cards are over, amongst all players. All the cards are dealt face down. you are not allowed to see your cards. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game. The game continues clockwise. On your turn, you pick up the top card from your player deck and place it face up on the table. This is the discard pile. You check whether the card placed forms a whole pair with the card below it. if it does, you pick up the entire discard pile and place it below your player deck. if it does not, the game continues and the next player places their card. This continues until a player completely finishes their player deck.<br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s look at the third gameplay: To play Memory Hero, remove the red cards from the deck. Make a deck of blue and green cards. shuffle the two decks separately. Distribute 7 blue cards to each player. These are the hand cards. you can see your hand cards. Take 16 green cards and arrange them, face down, in a grid of 4 by 4.These are the table cards. The remaining green cards are kept separately as the main deck. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game and the game continues clockwise. On your turn, you will open any one table card, so that everyone can see it. If the table card forms a whole pair with any one of your hand cards then pick up that card, show the pair to everyone and set the pair aside. If you cannot form a whole pair, you keep the card back facing down. the game continues. Once a table card is used you must replace it with another card from the main deck, facing down. You can only combine one hand card with one table card. You can open a table card only on your turn. The game ends when a player completes all their hand cards.<br/><br/>The perfect educational family entertainer with three engaging games packed in a single set!

        "description": "18WE: Western Europe is an 18xx game based on Mike Hutton&rsquo;s popular 1862: Railway Mania in the Eastern Counties system, with a larger board, more offboard areas, and a strong operational spin.  It features a random setup of twenty one companies that have four different kinds of licenses, and appear in different orders through the game. Additionally, it has both major company and minor company scenarios, as well as differing starting cash values that create major differences in play styles.<br/><br/>Major and minor companies get pooled board actions to determine tile and station placements and upgrades.  All track tiles are unlimited.  Major companies may place up to twelve stations which can also be acquired from bankrupt companies via auction.<br/><br/>In the historical game, French major companies receive extra track actions, Germanic major companies (based in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium) receive industry markers that increase the value of one Germanic city, and Southeastern major companies (based in Italy, Austria Hungary, and Switzerland) receive extra warranties that allow their trains extra staying power. These simple differences in setup present the players with major strategic decisions in what railroads to found, as well as how their companies will best be developed and operated.<br/><br/>Mergers, refinancing, bankruptcy, chartered and non-chartered corporations all function in exactly the same ways as 18EA/62.  Finally, 18WE will support solo play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1905: Days of Decision is the third game in The Scandinavian Wars Trilogy* from Pantero Games.  The game is a strategic level analysis of potential war that could have happened when the union between Norway and Sweden was dissolved in 1905. Units are battalions and regiments, with a few squadrons of cavalry and dragoons thrown in. The game will use the same basic set of rules as the other games* in the series  and also has a few separate rules to account for the time period and way of war in the early 1900's. The map depicts the border area in southern Norway and Sweden, from Trondheim to Gothenburg. The game also includes a set of naval rules and units, to account for the fact that both navies were mobilised and had been modernised heavily before 1905.<br/><br/>As the Swedish player your goal is to keep Norway in the unions by capturing Christiania, take control of the border fortresses and force the Norwegian parliament to resign or accept a continued and renewed union. As the Norwegian player, your goal is hold the Swedes back long enough, and cause enough casualties to make King Oscar II order the Swedish forces to stand down and enter negotiations.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

With each change, players get to redo the pitch and make it even more exciting.

        "description": "Throughout the game Rangers will build two areas: an Ecosystem consisting only of species in their BiOME, and a Sanctuary made up of any species in their hand. At the end of the game, points are awarded for different aspects of the Ecosystem and Sanctuary, and the winner is the Ranger with the most points.<br/><br/>If using 1 Starter Pack between Rangers, each Ranger takes their 9 BiOME cards and the rest of the cards are shuffled. Deal the remaining cards evenly between the Rangers, up to a maximum of 9 each. Leave the rest aside. If each Ranger has their own pack of cards, they may select 9 BiOME and 9 non-BiOME cards for their hand (rather than randomly dealing). Each Ranger now places down an Eden card (the first card in your ecosystem) and 3 Sanctuary cards.<br/><br/>DURING THE GAME<br/><br/>The Ranger whose turn it is is called the Active Ranger and has 3 choices: Endangerment, Sanctuary or Clash.<br/><br/>In Endangerment, ALL Rangers place a species into their Ecosystem (called an Eco card). The Active Ranger then rolls the die to see which danger (e.g. Persecution) must be overcome. Rangers use their remaining Holding cards (i.e. those not already in Ecosystem/Sanctuary/Life Cycle) to overcome the danger. If a Ranger can&rsquo;t overcome the danger, they lose the Eco card they just played, plus 1 of their Sanctuary cards.<br/><br/>In Sanctuary, the Active Ranger only places a card into their Sanctuary. No more than 4 species are allowed in the Sanctuary at any one time.<br/><br/>In Clash, the Active Ranger nominates another Ranger, and both choose a species from their Holding cards. Both cards are placed face-down on the table, and revealed at the same time. Follow the Clash matrix to find the winner of the meeting between the two species. Both cards are placed into each Ranger&rsquo;s respective Life cycle (the discard pile) and rewards/punishments enacted (see full Gameplay guide for Clash matrix and outcomes).<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/><br/>When a Ranger runs out of Holding cards or Sanctuary cards, the game enters Brumation. Each Ranger still in play then has 2 turns as Active Ranger each, before the game is finished. At this point, each Ranger counts their score from their Ecosystem and Sanctuary (see Gameplay guide for scoring system), and the winner is announced.<br/><br/>The starter pack features 54 amazing species, including 9 cards from the Forest, Desert, River and Scrub BiOMEs, 7 cards from Sky, 6 cards from Coast, and 5 cards from Mountain!<br/><br/>",

But a bug in the patch caused a frantic side effect: in the pursuit of being harder, better, faster, and stronger, robots are now smashing smaller ones and even creating new problems.<br/><br/>With a length of approximately 30 minutes, the game is played in alternate turns. Players control 4 different robots to execute actions and collect resources, fixing problems, or robots that were smashed by the opponent. The first crew to clear their workshop, fixing all problems, and lining up all its robots in the Production Line of the factory wins the game.<br/><br/>Turns are simple and divided into three phases: In the first, robots in the workshop charge up; in the second, a single robot is called up to activate its quadrant in the Production Line, generating resources to fix problems and other robots. In the last phase, the available robots can be lined up in quadrants of the Production Line for later activation.<br/><br/>Although robots can block quadrants from the Production Line by their presence there, bigger robots can smash them out, sending their pieces to their workshops to be fixed.<br/><br/>As problems are fixed and players get closer to winning, combos are forged, and in a blink of an eye, your opponent can take you from certain victory to an &ldquo;hasta la vista&rdquo; defeat.<br/><br/>How to end the game? The first player to finish his turn with his office empty, solving all problems and allocating all robots on the production line, wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You are the first player.<br/>     Return all building cards to the box with the exception of a building costing 1, one that costs 2, one that costs 3 and one that costs 4. They must all be of a different color and randomly selected (e.g.: play with the blue &ldquo;1&rdquo; building, the &ldquo;2&rdquo; red building, the &ldquo;3&rdquo; yellow building and the &ldquo;4&rdquo; green building).<br/><br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/>Play multiple turns in a row until the game ends.<br/>During each of your turns you must perform one of the three actions of the game, with the following additions to the normal rules:<br/><br/>      Collect Contributions: you get coins as usual, and the AI gets a military power token.<br/>      Recruit a Catalyst: You recruit a Catalyst as usual, then take the first card to the left of the one you recruited and place it, without looking at it, in the deck of AI's scoring pile. If you recruit the first Catalyst to the right of the deck (the one on the space marked with &ldquo;+1&rdquo;), then place the top card of the draw pile, without looking at it, in the scoring pile of the AI. <br/>      Activate a Catalyst: activate a Catalyst as usual, then place the card on top of the drawing deck, without looking at it, in the AI&rsquo;s scoring pile.<br/><br/><br/>Note: When you get coins or actions to recruit a Catalyst through a Catalyst or a building&rsquo;s effects, and when you spend Chain activation tokens to activate Catalysts, the additions to the normal rules (see above) do not apply: This means that while you perform the effect of an activated Catalyst or building, the AI does not get any military power tokens nor you must put cards in its scoring pile.<br/><br/>THE END OF YOUR TURN<br/>As in the standard rules, after you have chosen and performed one action (and possibly the AI has gained a card in its scoring pile or a military power token), your turn is over. If one or more spaces of the board are empty, slide the other cards to the right until there are no gaps, then draw new cards from the deck to fill the board back up to 5 cards.<br/><br/>THE END OF THE GAME<br/>When the last card of the reserve deck is discarded or put on the board, the game ends immediately.<br/>Count your VPs as usual, including the goal card&rsquo;s points. The AI instead obtains the VPs written on the cards in its scoring pile, the VPs provided by each pair of its military power tokens (and for the majority), and additional VPs depending on the difficulty level chosen (see Preparation). If you scored at least 1 VP more than the AI, you won &ndash; otherwise, try harder!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your excavations have unearthed ancient mechanisms that redirect treasure falling from great heights, how much can you now collect in your treasure buckets?<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Take your sushi roll case and lay it out on a flat surface. This will be the floor of your treasure chamber. Long press 2 Blinks until they flash white, then set them standing up on the sushi roll case. These are your treasure buckets. Take another Blink and set it between the two buckets. This trio of Blinks is the foundation of your treasure chamber.<br/><br/>Finally, take at least 1 Blink and triple click it. It should now be green with a swirling face. This Blink is your treasure spawner. It will drop one treasure piece whenever it is placed on top of the treasure chamber tower.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>The goal of this game is to collect as much treasure in your bucket as possible by using the mechanisms built into the treasure chamber walls.<br/><br/>The game is played in two stages. First, both players work together to assemble the treasure chamber. Take turns adding one Blink at a time to the tower and watching the mechanisms self-assign.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION<br/>When the bucket is full it will turn purple - the first player to fill their bucket with treasure is the winner!<br/><br/>However, if one of the players causes the tower to collapse, they must empty all the treasure from their bucket. Double-click a bucket to empty it. Then the first stage of the game is repeated and the tower is reassembled before treasure is allowed to tumble again.<br/><br/>",

Sets can either be cards of the same number of cards of the same suit. If a set is ambiguous (e.g. any single card) it does not have to be declared.

        "description": "This is a VERY playable (free to print off and play) aerial transportation solitaire game about the U.S. Army Air Force's effort to fly supplies to China to keep it in World War 2 and tie up so many Imperial Japanese Army soldiers on the Asian mainland which it did.  <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.CoatneyHistory.com/CBIATC.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.CoatneyHistory.com/CBIATC.htm</a><br/><br/>(In the &quot;Advanced&quot; game, one player can be the Equipment transporter and the other the Fuel Transporter and separate record/chits could be kept to see if they achieve their respective delivery requirements.  Of course, if either fails too often, they both lose overall, so .... :-) )<br/><br/>The player chooses either the H (High Himalayas) route with its hazards or the M (Japanese fighter-interceptor aerodrome at Myitkina) route.  He takes the maximum number of transport aircraft pieces possible and then adds to that upside-down piece mix a number of hazard pieces equal to half the number of transports rounded up.<br/><br/>(In 1942-43, trying to fly the lower route over Myitkina is very much pushing your luck, depending on Japanese fighter strength and who wins the air battle.)<br/><br/>From that inverted total he pulls a number of pieces equal to the number of original transports and finds out if sufficient loads - DC3s/C-47s carry 1, C-46s and (B-24 Liberator transport) C-87s carry 2 (although the C-87s can only carry 1 over the High route), and the late war DC-4s/C-54s carry *4*! - make it over the Hump.<br/><br/>Of course, the number of loads required each season increases with the Allied supreme commanders' demands.<br/><br/>The USAAF Air Transport Command actually delivered far more supplies in the air than could be delivered by gas-guzzling trucks on the Burma and then Ledo/Stilwell Roads.<br/><br/>Hazards include Engine Failure, Unexpected Mountain, Mule Stampede! (wrecking the center of gravity ... 3,000 mules were delivered, 4 to a plane), Spontaneous Explosion (C-46s only), Bad Compass-Thick Clouds-Out of Gas, Oxygen Loss-Disorientation, and Rock Throwing Yetis! (Some planes just disappeared along the costly &quot;Aluminum Highway.&quot; Wrecks and remains are still being found.)<br/><br/>The no-dice Basic Game plays in about 40 minutes max. and really gives you the overall sense of the air transport campaign.  (Ernest K. Gann was an ATC pilot and later wrote the book Fate is the Hunter.  The movie is free to watch on YouTube.)<br/><br/>The Advanced Game, differentiating Fuel and Equipment loads,  including sea and rail transport cargo capacities to the East India airfields, and having abstracted ground combat rules takes longer.<br/><br/>All aircraft icons are by me, pixel by pixel (hence, the small datafile size of the counter sheet).<br/><br/>The Dedication includes mention of one Bob Coatney, who was a master sergeant based at ATC headquarters in Dacca, East India.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Five complete words must be created to secure your entry. The longer the word, the more you&rsquo;ll score and topical words are even better. But beware, gobbledygook will get you nowhere!<br/><br/>Before you play, as a group choose a category (e.g., the ocean, food &amp; drink or board games) and write it down.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous. Each player chooses how to use the two dice on their own scoresheet. One die shows the box a letter must be chosen from and the other die shows the line that letter must be written on.<br/><br/>Each player writes their chosen letter anywhere on the selected line. Players may choose any letter from the box. Each letter can be used an unlimited number of times. Sixes are wild and can be used instead of any other number. Cross off a 'Pass' box if you choose not to place a letter.<br/><br/>Each player is allowed a maximum of three passes. After your third pass, you must withdraw from the game. Other players may continue until they have used all their passes. When the last player has finished, the game ends.<br/><br/>Your aim is to make a complete word on each line. You score points according to the length of the word, as shown on the scoresheet. If your word is relevant to the chosen category score two extra points.<br/><br/>To play, you&rsquo;ll need to print a scoresheet for each player. You&rsquo;ll receive the file in black and white, for easy printing. You may like to laminate your scoresheets and use dry erase pens to play. This will reduce your need to print new sheets out.<br/><br/>You'll also need 2 dice and a pen for each player. To play, you write directly onto the scoresheet.<br/><br/>Any number of players can play the game. Lingo Land is also ideal for playing online via videoconferencing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This involves running a gauntlet with enemy cannons to the left of you, to the right of you, and in front of you.<br/><br/>Your task seems like folly... but yours is not to reason, yours is but to do and die.  <br/>The charge seems doomed from the start, but you do have the French Chasseurs d'Afrique on your left to possibly assist, and the Heavy Brigade behind you, so perhaps there is more chance to carry the opposition than at first appears?<br/><br/>Play the game, experience the situation, and find out.<br/><br/>The original orders: Lord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front, follow the enemy, and try and prevent the enemy carrying away the guns. Troop horse artillery may accompany. French cavalry is on your left. Immediate.  <br/>Optional rules and scenarios allow you to explore various &quot;what if?&quot; interpretations of these orders, providing more strategy.<br/><br/>All you need to play the game (specifically designed for solo play) is:<br/><br/>     a standard deck of 52 playing cards,<br/>     a six-sided die, and<br/>     pencil.<br/><br/><br/>Available separately or in Panzerschreck #18<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The answerer should keep answering one question after another as long as they answer correctly (that is, incorrectly). Answers must come quickly, without hesitation. It's up to the reader to decide whether the answers are fast enough, but a few seconds is a good rule of thumb. Answers that take too long are considered a wrong answer and play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>The reader continues by asking the new answered questions from the same card, picking up with the next question. When all questions from a card have been asked, draw a new card from the pile. A new reader can take over at any time.<br/><br/>The player with the highest number of correct questions in a row is considered the leader. If another player beats their record, they are now the person to beat. Play for a set number of rounds, and the person with the highest score at the end wins.<br/><br/>",

Rival factions have built monstrous towers that spire past the clouds. Each tower is as unique as its inhabitants. Some with slim and smooth outer faces and others with protruding arms that simultaneously protect and threaten. These magical and mechanical structures roam across The Wilds seeking resources, and new conquests. City of Giants refers to an annual Gathering of the the Spires under a tenuous truce.<br/><br/>In Turris, players become Lords of their faction. By adding new cards to your tower you&rsquo;ll add new abilities and followers to your structure. You can choose from mystic cards that call upon the gods both kind and cruel, science cards that explore power of machines and potions, or warfare cards that focus on combat. Will you specialize in one area or create powerful combos across each? The faction with the most Influence wins, but all players must defend against the Darkness, or you all lose!

These could be anything from telling a story to acting as props for a play.<br/><br/>Audience Suggestions<br/>There is a deck of audience suggestions to switch things up every time a challenge is drawn. Different challenges require different types of suggestions. For example, the judge may draw a Place Card so the scene could take place anywhere from a baseball field to Mars.<br/><br/>Hilarious Punishments<br/>The judge then decides which player did the worst and deserves to be punished, Japanese game show style! It could be something humiliating like calling a friend to tell an embarrassing story about you, or painful like getting an arm hair plucked out! In the end, players are either funny or get punished!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Follow in the footsteps of the ancient Hawaiians in Wanna Hocka Lugie, the trading game inspired by the legend of Ka'ao. Players head to the Hawaiian marketplace in a race to fill their baskets. Each player controls two pawns - one that can trade goods and one that can steal goods from the baskets of other players. There's a delicate balance as players map out their acquisition strategy - trade or steal - and all the while avoiding thievery themselves! Players begin with a basket containing three items. By landing one's trading pawn (Tally Trader) on various items, a player can trade up for more valuable goods, stepping up the value of the items in his basket. Maneuvering one's stealing pawn (Shifty Shorty) onto the same space as an opponent's trader gives him the opportunity to shortcut the whole system and pick up valuable goods the &quot;easy&quot; way. Trade and steal. Steal and trade. Twists, turns, and a little bit of luck keep it close until the end. Who will return triumphantly from the market as the Big Kahuna?<br/><br/>Contents include: Game Board, 4 Trading Pawns, 4 Stealing Pawns, 2 Dice, 4 Trading Basket Placards, 54 Item Cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rival diner owners are under pressure to cook breakfast for their customers as quickly as possible. As some foods take longer to cook, you will need to plan ahead so the entire order is ready to serve at the same time. Players receive points for each successfully completed order and lose points for wasted food and incomplete or incorrect orders. The player with the most points when the flow of customers runs out is the winner.<br/><br/>Setup   <br/>Each player chooses one diner board and places it in front of them.<br/><br/>Sort and place the food tiles and penalty tokens into each slot of the kitchen caddy.<br/><br/>Shuffle the customer order cards. Based on the amount of players, remove the number of cards needed and place the remaining cards back in the box (see chart at right).<br/><br/>The first person to shout out what they ate for breakfast will deal first. Give them the chef&rsquo;s spoon and cards.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>This game is played in rounds. Each round consists  of the following actions:<br/>1. Dealer assigns customer order cards.<br/>2. All players select food tiles.<br/>3. All players cook food items.<br/>4. All players serve their customers, if they are able.<br/><br/>After all four actions are completed, the chef&rsquo;s spoon and the customer order deck are passed clockwise to the next player, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>1. Assigning Customers<br/>The player with the chef&rsquo;s spoon is the dealer for each round. The dealer draws customer order cards equal to the number of players. The dealer then assigns one customer order to each player, including themselves. You can keep a more difficult card with the higher risk and point value for yourself or assign it to an opponent in hopes of giving them more than they can handle. All players then place their customer order cards on an empty table space within the Orders section of their diner board. In later rounds, if all the table spaces on a player&rsquo;s diner board are full, they must immediately serve one of their current customers, even if that order will be incomplete, before receiving a new customer order card for that round.<br/><br/>2. Selecting Food Tiles <br/>Starting with the dealer, players take turns in clockwise order selecting food tiles from the kitchen caddy based on their orders and cooking times. Each player may take up to a total of seven food tiles, from up to three different food types. This is the maximum; you are not required to select more food tiles than you want or need. Take your selected food tiles, and place them in a stack on their corresponding spaces in the Prep column of your diner board.<br/><br/>3. Cooking Food<br/>All players cook their food at the same time. When everyone is ready, the dealer for the round announces, &ldquo;Cook time!&rdquo; Now, starting with the top row and working your way down, move all food tiles on your diner boards one space to the right. Keep each round&rsquo;s stack of tiles together as they move across the board. Some food types do not need to stop in each column. When a tile reaches a space with an arrow, slide it across the arrow until it reaches the column indicated. Once food items are in the Ready to Serve spaces, they can be used to serve any combination of orders (see Serving Customers section).Any unserved food in the final column of the Ready to Serve section will be moved into the Trash column during cook time.<br/><br/>4. Serving Customers<br/>Players may serve their customers during actions 1 or 4 using any food tiles that are in the Ready to Serve area. When you are ready to serve a customer&rsquo;s order, move the food tiles from your Ready to Serve area and place them on the corresponding spaces of the customer order card to check that you have the correct food items.<br/><br/>End of Game <br/>Complete the round in which the last customer order cards have been assigned. Then the game enters the final phase. Still taking turns going clockwise, each player has the chance to select one last set of food tiles to place on their diner board. Cooking then occurs as normal. The final phase then continues with all players cooking their food and serving their remaining customer orders (repeating  actions 3 and 4). The game ends once all customer order cards are removed and all food tiles have been served or moved into the Trash column.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Players total the scores from their served customer order cards and subtract any penalty tokens received to determine their final scores. The player with the most points wins. In the case of a tie, the player with the fewest penalty tokens wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the five highest-point customer order cards wins.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Unlike that version however, this is not completely bilingual; only 300 of the 900 questions have been translated to Swedish and there's a separate deck for those cards, furthermore the cards are not categorized but simply have the &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;difficult&quot; option on them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The concept is simple: Help the animals break out of the zoo. Zoo Break is compact and easy to grasp for kids as young as five, who are still learning their numbers, but it involves strategy and level variations that make it intriguing for the sharpest of gamers. (We challenge advanced gamers to try getting through Levels 1-10 in one play session!) Zoo Break can be played alone, or collaboratively by multiple people. It's a great family game.<br/><br/>To play, simply shuffle the cards and lay them out in an 8x8 grid. Place the four colorful wooden animals in the center. Roll the green dice to guide the animals to freedom, using strategy to choose the best path for each animal. But watch out for the zookeeper! For every roll of the animal dice, you'll also roll the zookeeper dice. The zookeeper locks down cards and closes off escape routes with every roll.<br/><br/>Win the game by breaking out all four animals before their escape routes close. Strategy abounds around which paths to take, and this makes for great interaction with kid co-players. Four free spaces help you on your way. But if the zookeeper locks down a card that is currently occupied by an animal, it's back to the central cage!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Backyard Baseball captures the spirit of an impromptu game played by two teams of two kids each.  The game lasts three innings.  Each half-inning consists of a series of plays, each of which has four steps:<br/><br/>1. The fielding player positions the fielder pawn, then secretly chooses a pitch card.  <br/>2. The batter chooses a batting card, both players reveal their cards, and roll the die. <br/>3. Compare the roll to the # on the pitcher's card; if it's less, check the pitcher's card to see where the ball goes, otherwise use the batter's card.  If the fielder pawn is there, it's an out, otherwise it's a hit!<br/>4. The batter may try to extend the play and advance the runner(s), but the pitcher gets to play a card to try to throw the lead runner out.<br/><br/>The batting team only has two pawn, so when a pawn that's on base has to bat, it's replaced with a ghost runner.<br/><br/>If a runner reaches home, the batting team scores a point (run).<br/><br/>After three outs, the teams switch roles and repeat the process.<br/><br/>The team with the higher score after three innings wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The games live in the same universe, but they&rsquo;re totally different. For starters, one is a video game and one is a card game. Also, one is an 8-player party game about making funny characters and the other is a 2-player combat strategy card game.<br/><br/>Champ&rsquo;d Up: Slam Down is a unique two-player card game where each player takes the role of a trainer battling champs against their opponent until only one player is left standing/sitting! Each turn you will recruit champs from your hand into the ring to fight your opponent&rsquo;s champs. Deplete your opponent&rsquo;s reserves and call them out to declare victory and win the game!<br/><br/>To get a pack (you only need one), play an online game of Champ&rsquo;d Up in The Jackbox Party Pack 7. Create ridiculous champs and battle them for supremacy. But draw with care because these champs are going to make their way into the physical world! After your game, you can purchase a pack of Champ&rsquo;d Up: Slam Down cards with the characters you created in Champ&rsquo;d Up. It will be custom printed and delivered right to your door. When you receive your cards, grab a friend and play this simple but exciting take on a 1-on-1 collectable card game. Combine decks and trade cards with others for even more ridiculous mayhem.<br/><br/>Players will take turns until a player wins the game. The player who is taking a turn is referred to as the &ldquo;active player.&rdquo; At the very start of their turn, the active player gets 3 energy. On the active player's turn, they can use energy to execute a variety of actions: Recruit, Hype, Fight, use Special abilities, and Call out their Opponent. Slam Down's custom cards means a diverse variety of cards can be printed from playing Champ'd Up (in the Jackbox Party Pack 7) repeat times. Fighting is how players remove opposing champs from the ring. If the active player has a champ in the ready position and their opponent has no players in the ring, the active player can call them out. If the active player calls out an opponent with no champs in their reserve, the game ends and they win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The central nine spaces hold small cones at the beginning. The active player rolls the five big cones and places them on the second board. Upright cones go in the center, the other cones are go around it, depending on where their tip pointed after rolling. The player then turns the board into the desired alignment and makes their move. All pieces have to remain connected at least diagonally. A piece moves into the direction of the cone tip, jumping over all other connected pieces in front of it (like in Reinhold Wittig's old game Wabanti, which inspired the name). An upright cone means placing a new cone in the central area, a second upright cone means removing a piece anywhere. <br/>The winner is the first player who has a piece leave the game board on their side.<br/><br/>",

A trick is captured by the person who played the highest card of trump, unless a trump is not played, then the highest card of the suit that was lead wins.  When you win a trick you may keep a single card with a 1 value in your score pile, if there was one played.<br/><br/>A poker chip on a card at the saloon determine trump and ending points.  The cards in the saloon may be moved by players in some circumstances.  Suits in this game are the Outlaw, Gambler, Kid, Cowboy or Deputy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As the battle goes on, your commander in chief will rally wavering units, redeploy and push in reserves, or even change your subordinate's orders entirely.<br/><br/>He Did What Heroes Do has its focus on command, but the usual aspects of Napoleonic warfare will make an appearance. Skirmishers, heavy cavalry, square formations and grand batteries are all viable tactical options. <br/>All combat needs is just a few D6 to work out if your charging unit has broken through, your musket volleys are wearing the enemy down or if your artillery are hammering away effectively.<br/><br/>This game doesn't use cards, rolling on tables, distributing points or even command radii to decide which units you can use each turn. Every unit gets to activate once every turn, but they will only follow the orders you gave to their general. <br/>Want those cavalry to charge? <br/>Change their corps' orders, or move your commander to the unit and order them forward yourself! <br/>Or do you hang on for another turn, waiting until the enemy are even weaker? <br/>Your impact can be crucial, but you can't be everywhere at once. <br/>As the army commander, your focus will be on taking the initiative, supporting your subordinates and hopefully winning the day. <br/>Good luck general.<br/><br/>Designed to be played with 2 to 6mm, but can be adapted to other scales.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THE GAME オバケやしきのすうじのアクマ is a new incarnation of The Game where players struggle to seal away ghosts and other creatures lurking about a haunted mansion.  <br/><br/>The premise of the game is that players are naughty children who enter a haunted house and accidentally open a book that releases a host of demons. They must work to seal these escapees back into the book. However, the demons are actually Demons of Numbers and therefore the players cannot speak in numbers (or else be cursed and die).<br/><br/>The basic gameplay is the same as The Game, where players work together to discard all cards into four piles depending on the UP/DOWN conditions of each pile. During their turn, players discard either a larger or smaller value card(s) as appropriate. Afterwards, players refill their hand.  <br/><br/>Players cannot share the numbers of the cards in their hand with other players but must find ways to collaborate in order to effectively place cards in the four piles so that all players can have zero cards in their hand at the end of the game.<br/><br/>If there is an exact difference of 10 between the card a player discards and the last card in a pile, the player is free to play the card regardless of the UP/DOWN direction of the pile.  <br/><br/>In Demons of Numbers, there are also six types of effect cards (which are number cards with an effect written at the bottom): Reverse, Skip, Short, Draw 2, Silence, and Declaration of Death.<br/><br/>There are three types of ending results for the game: Total victory, victory, and loss.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Additional Information:<br/><br/>This all new game builds upon the original The Game with additional rules for a spookishly fresh gameplay experience.<br/><br/>Unlike The Game Extreme which added rules to make gameplay even more challenging for players, Demons of Numbers offers a more interactive, conversational experience. The new design also allows for up to 6 players.<br/><br/>Familiar &ldquo;effects&rdquo; are added to the game to give it a more UNO-esque familiarity. In fact, these changes have earned this version of the game the nickname &ldquo;The Game Junior&rdquo; by the original publisher.<br/><br/>The increased player number, new rules, and random events make it more difficult for players to find a repeatable pattern to beat the game and result in a making Demons of Numbers more of a &ldquo;party game&rdquo; for all ages and for gamers and non-gamers alike.<br/><br/>The designer, 326, felt that the original The Game had a title that was really not ideally optimized for easy internet searches, as well as artwork that would make it for children to convince their parents to purchase the game for them. He wanted to take a new approach and was able to find a willing partner in Arclight Games.<br/><br/>Illustrations are also by 326.<br/><br/>",

Then, the winners are decided depending on the type and level of the influence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dans ce jeu &eacute;pique de cartes pixelis&eacute;es, les joueurs utiliseront des cartes pour augmenter ou diminuer le niveau d'influence du village, en essayant de s'emparer d'une puissante pierre mythique, l'Atris Lucidum.

Each poker-sized card has one of Greenland's coastal villages - visit a new village each time you turn over a card. Starting with just a couple of basic resources, your aim is to gain as much money as you can in order to pay for your sea passage home, before you run out of time.<br/><br/>Trade resources and learn new local skills as you travel between villages. Skills will gain you benefits later in the game, or help you avoid penalties, but learning a new skill means spending more precious time in that village. You'll need to decide when to invest in skills and when to push on to the next village.<br/><br/>With multiple solo and two player modes, this pocket sized game will keep you thinking for hours.<br/><br/>",

Several times in the following decades the Capellan Confederation tried and failed to reclaim those worlds, including the ancestral homeworld of Liao.<br/>But Sun-Tzu's son, Daoshen, is crafty and patient.<br/><br/>In the wake of the devastating collapse of the hyperpulse generator network, The Republic is beset on all sides and Daoshen sees his chance. Taking advantage of a student uprising and unrest against The Republic, Daoshen's secret agitators and devoted troops will try one more time to avenge the dishonor of losing Liao. And this time, they will know victory!<br/><br/>This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a &ldquo;Liao flavor.&rdquo; The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of Liao, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players' imaginations are the limits.<br/><br/>",

Of course if you want to make a good thing better, then it is hard to beat a Vertical Stabilizer to give your tank an advantage on the move, whilst the Wright Continental R-975C4 engine that enhances your tanks initiative can benefit both M4 Sherman variants, as well as the &ldquo;yet-to-be-released&rdquo; M18 Hellcat (can someone say &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo;?).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Steal is a fast and furious new letter game of cunning, treachery and outright theft!  A hugely exciting game from New Zealand, with all letter tiles contained in a handy mask-shaped fabric bag, allowing it to be played almost anywhere. Steal is suitable for 2-8 players of all ages, easy to learn but more difficult to master.<br/><br/>Play proceeds by flipping tiles (every 2-3 seconds), with players calling out and forming three+ letter words from the exposed letters. As the game proceeds, the aim then is to steal words from your opponents by adding one or more letters. So pin might be stolen as pain, and stolen again as inapt, then pliant, implant, platinum, manipulate, planetarium, perambulating etc....! All the while other words are of course being formed and stolen.<br/><br/>The set contains ten coloured STEAL letters which double the score of the word, so the highest scores are always obtained by assembling/stealing long words containing a coloured letter.  Play is further enhanced by the mask (joker) tile which can be any letter you want (&amp; can change as the word is stolen).<br/><br/>Flipping stops while words are being assembled (with the last assembler being next to flip) but stealing does not. So often a word is stolen whilst it is being formed with the addition of an already-exposed new letter! Frustrating and hilarious at the same time, bringing out the competitive streak of everyone who plays. Once all letters are flipped and no more words can be made or stolen...the scores are counted up to find the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player has his own character with which he explores the map by opening new hexagon tiles and finding different items. These serve as inspiration and opportunity to tell a story and progress thorugh the game towards it narrative finale.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls a die which tells him how many action points he gets to use. As an action, he can open a new tile, move to an adjacent tile, or pick up an item from the tile he is on. There's also a possibility he gets to use his special power. All this should be narrated as well. The game ends when all the story cards are completed, that is, a set amount of items in requested colours are collected. The players win together, I noted the game is cooperative. But I guess, there is no winning as such, as the game is about telling a story, there is no mechanical challenge.<br/><br/>",

Yet even as the Inner Sphere adjusts to a new sense of normalcy, questions remain about whether the Blakist threat is gone for good or merely hibernating.<br/><br/>Once a disorganized collective of hobbyists and academics backed by the idle wealthy, Interstellar Expeditions has emerged from the fires of war to take up the mission once claimed by ComStar's Explorer Corps: to search for the elusive hiding places where humanity's enemies might have gone. From the dead worlds within the borders of the Inner Sphere itself, to the distant, uncharted reaches of the Deep Periphery, IE relentlessly searches for the answers to mysteries dating back to mankind's first ventures into deep space, while simultaneously watching for any sign of the zealots who so recently waged the most horrendous interstellar war in modern history.<br/><br/>Interstellar Expeditions: Interstellar Players 3 describes the organization and efforts of Interstellar Expeditions as it continues to search within (and beyond) human-occupied space in the BattleTech universe. First introduced in Interstellar Players, IE's operations have now gone truly universal, seeking answers and treasures not only from the lost and forgotten worlds of humanity's distant past, but also the distant colonies and civilizations that have risen--and even fallen--beyond the boundaries of the Inner Sphere. Gamemasters and players can decide which of these groups and discoveries may actually bear fruit, and which are the misdirections left behind by the surviving leaders of the Blakist war machine. Whether from this sourcebook or the gamemaster's own imagination, these discoveries can become the ultimate villain, ally, or unique new setting for any type of BattleTech campaign!<br/><br/>",

The mecha has a hollow body and the player loads a cylinder into the mecha and then fires it across the board by flicking the back of the mecha.<br/><br/>The game board in You Be Aim is double-sided, so players can play two different games. In one game, Watari Usagi (わたりうさぎ), they aim to fire cylinders at the rabbit robots of their opponent. In the other game, Jitsuriki Sugoroku (実力すごろく), the players must move around the factory and fire at targets on the walls without hitting the rabbit robots.<br/><br/>Customers who reserved early for the game at the Tokyo Game Market got a free metal miniature rabbit robot.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "肛門で語る人生 (Komonde Kataru Jinsei) is a trick-taking game from Japan. The game title is a vulgar expression, as the theme of the game is about human&rsquo;s filthy life. The publisher's blurb says &quot;Throughout life, people accumulate their filth to reach their climax, then fall suddenly.&quot;. So the game title translates as 'Life told through the anus'. The box cover shows a purse with a star-like decoration, which is recognisable in Japan as an anus.<br/><br/>The publisher says &quot;In this game, the cards are played out two at a time from a hand of five. At the end of each round, the hand is replenished from the deck, so you always have five cards in your hand. This makes trick-taking a relatively light game.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards in the game: simple numbers 1 to 5 and special cards with the number 0. The special cards are Monko-sama (a monk) and Servant. The person who makes a bigger number with two cards wins the trick (an offering at the temple), but the special cards affect the trick.<br/><br/>If there is a servant played, the player who played the servant wins.<br/>If there is both a servant and a monk played, the player who played the monk wins.<br/>If there is no servant but a monk is played, the player who played the monk loses.<br/>In a battle between monks and servants, the player with the higher number wins.<br/><br/>As you play, the number you play in a round is your 'life experience' and you record this value of the experiences you have talked about. At the end of the game, the total number of experiences is calculated, and the player with the highest total is eliminated from the game as having &quot;experienced too much&quot;. Of the remaining players, the player with the highest total of offerings wins the game.<br/><br/>肛門で語る人生は、トリックテイキングと呼ばれるタイプのゲームです。<br/><br/>ありふれたトリックテイキングはカードを配り切って手札から1枚ずつ出していくのですが、肛門で語る人生は、手札5枚の中から2枚ずつ出していきます。ラウンドの最後に山札から手札補充がありますので、手札のカードは常に5枚です。<br/><br/>手札補充があることにより、トリックテイキングとしては比較的ライトなプレイ感に仕上がっています。<br/><br/>1から5までの単純な数字のカードと、0の特殊なカードが2種類あります。<br/><br/>特殊なカードは「もんこう様」と「下僕」です。<br/><br/>基本的にはカード2枚でより大きな数字をつくった人が得点（＝お供え）を獲得するのですが、<br/><br/>・場に、下僕がいる場合、下僕を出したプレイヤーの勝ち、<br/><br/>・場に、下僕ももんこう様もいる場合、もんこう様を出したプレイヤーの勝ち、<br/><br/>・場に、下僕がおらず、もんこう様がいる場合、もんこう様を出したプレイヤーの負け<br/><br/>となります。<br/><br/>もんこう様同士、下僕同士の戦いは数字の大きな方が勝ち、数字が同じ場合は後出しの方が勝ちます。<br/><br/>そのラウンドで出した数字は、このゲームで語ったあなたの「経験値」です。<br/><br/>人生での&quot;経験&quot;を示しているわけですね。<br/><br/>毎ラウンド、語った経験の経験値を、ホワイトボードマーカーでメモっていきます。<br/><br/>ゲーム終了時にこれまでの経験値の合計を計算するのですが、最も合計値が高いプレイヤーは「経験しすぎている」ということでゲームから脱落します。<br/><br/>残ったプレイヤーの中で、最もお供えの合計点の高いプレイヤーの勝ちとなります。<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.<br/><br/>",

If he picks the wrong card, he places it face up with his other cards. The player to his left then takes a turn. If the pile you pick from gets used up, play continues.

        "description": "Even weeks before Trafalgar, by August 1805 the newly crowned Emperor Napoleon Ier, had come to understand his plans required action on land. More specifically, he had to defeat his continental enemies in order to secure his continued power. Britain, Russia and Austria were allied against him and, since he couldn&rsquo;t get at the British on their island fortress, and Russia was too far away to allow for the required quick victory, he was left with invading Austria.<br/><br/>Rapidly surrounding and capturing the main Austrian Army at Ulm, December found Napoleon at Austerlitz (modern day Skavkov u Brna) in southern Moravia at the end of a very stretched supply line. He also appeared to be slightly outnumbered by an Coalition army made up of the remnants of Austrian forces, plus a sizable Russian contingent. Feigning weakness, Napoleon lured the Coalition force into attacking his right flank (where he wanted them to), then counterpunched through the Coalition center to encircle most of them. The Coalition were crushed, and through the victory, Napoleon cemented his hold on the throne. It was a crowning glory.<br/><br/>This two-player grand-tactical simulation by Ty Bomba presents the battle generally considered to have been Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory. Both players have the opportunity to attack and defend, but the main burden of the offensive resides with the French player. His opponent, the Allied player, commands the Austrian and Russian units. Each hexagon on the map represents 600 yards (549 meters) from side to opposite side. The units are brigades and divisions. Each full turn represents one hour of &lsquo;real time.&rsquo;<br/><br/>Published in Against The Odds #57<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All players present their version of that recipe, and the Manager then chooses which they think is the worst combination, promoting the winner to the next kitchen-based rank. Each rank brings with it perks and limitations (e.g. a player with the Prep Cook rank may not use meat or fish in their recipes). If a player catches another player using items their current rank doesn't allow, the offending player loses rank!<br/><br/>Gameplay also includes Method cards, for adding to the &quot;grossness&quot; of a combination, and Kitchen Items, which can be played to ban certain foods in a round, challenge other players, change a player's rank, or even enforce new rules for the round.<br/><br/>Play continues, rotating the Manager role each round, with players leveling up through 5 ranks (Dishwasher, Prep Cook, Line Cook, Sous Chef, Head Chef), until a player wins a round while Head Chef and wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This featured two full games in one box!<br/><br/>The Ventriloquist: The police are shocked when a man walks into the police station with a bomb strapped to his chest. The mystery deepens, however, when they discover that he is simply a puppet that has been manipulated and sent there by someone calling themselves The Ventriloquist. What is The Ventriloquist's message to the Valley Falls police, and why has he taken the entire police force hostage? Don't be a dummy. Investigate this case and find out!<br/><br/>Howl at the Moon: Three recent deaths in Valley Falls have all thesigns of animal attacks. However, the evidence about the sort of animal that could be responsible is inconclusive. Rumors abound that the murders might have been committed by a werewolf, given that they all occurred under the  light of a full moon. The local authorities, however, aren't taking that seriously. The only connection that the three  victims share is their love and patronage of a local watering hole called Ernie's Bar. Can you determine who (or what) is responsible for the deaths of these three victims? Beware: this case may get a little hairy!<br/><br/>As with all Deadbolt Mystery Society games, you step into the role of the detective. Examining the evidence provided,visiting different locations and using the password protected QR mechanic to uncover the truth.<br/><br/>Players win once they catch the killer, find whats missing or whatever else is needed to solve the case at hand.<br/><br/>",
