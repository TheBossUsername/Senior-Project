        "description": "From the Amigo rules:<br/><br/>The players collect cards by winning tricks, and these cards are sorted in a special way. The players divide cards into piles by color during the course of the game, and only the point value of the topmost card in each pile counts at the end of the round. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible.<br/><br/>A note about game play: The deck includes five suits, but players don't need to follow suit during play. Instead suits are important because you have five scoring opportunities each round. The game lasts as many rounds as there are players.<br/><br/>(The English name of this game would be &quot;Null &amp; Void.&quot;)<br/><br/>",

(If a stick slides onto other colors later as the tower tilts and wobbles, that's okay, but you need to match when placing!)<br/><br/>If any sticks fall off the tower on your turn, collect them and place them in front of you. When all the sticks have been placed onto the tower or when the tower falls over, the game ends immediately. If you caused the tower to fall, you don't collect any of the sticks, but you do score five points (which isn't good). Every player scores one point for each stick in front of them.<br/><br/>If anyone has eleven or more points, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.

The publisher was obliged to replace the phrase &quot;scrabbling with numbers&quot; for &quot;dominoes for the 21st century&quot; on the box, but really it is just Scrabble with numbers. And very good for it, it is too. There are 121 tiles with 1-6 dots like a standard die or domino (20 of each number plus an extra 1). Players alternately draw and place 2 tiles on the board extending the pattern already laid. When you make a vertical or horizontal line that totals 10, 11 or 12 (12 is the limit), you score 1, 2 or 4 points accordingly on your game pad. Completing scoring lines on the pad gives a rising bonus and covering marked squares on the board gives you a doubling bonuses on your pad.<br/><br/>Simple and quick, but surprisingly challenging when you get the idea. The idea being that you must keep an even, balanced score pad, scoring 10s and 11s, not just successive 12s. Easy to pick up, but it requires some effort to score well; spotting those opportunities to place one tile which scores each way, making sure you keep clocking up 10s, to turn into 11s or 12s. Luck does play a role, but good players consistently score highly game after game, so there must be something deeper at work.<br/>The publisher Perner maintains a website with play &amp; chat over the internet and there are several very active Zatre clubs in Germany, Austria &amp; Switzerland. Players results are scored on the ranking table on the website.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by: Zatre: Das Kartenspiel<br/><br/>",

The only condition on these actions is that, at the conclusion of the turn no two stones of the same color can be diagonally adjacent unless they are orthogonally connected by a common like-colored stone.<br/><br/>Forced Passing: In the very unlikely event that a player will not have a legal move on his turn, he must pass his turn. passing is otherwise strictly prohibited.<br/><br/>pie rule: The pie rule has questionable efficacy in classic Slither, as any stone can be translated to the middle of the board without even a loss of tempo. This rule states that<br/><br/>No draws are possible in Slither.<br/><br/>Advanced Slither: Seasoned Slither players may want to upgrade to Advanced Slither, which is a variant from late 2018 which aims to resolve issues generated by the perhaps excessive mobility of stones, chiefly making the pie rule less superfluous. The only additional rule in advanced Slither is that a stone may only move if its part of a contiguous orthogonal group consisting of stones of both colors. In addition to making pie more effective and foiling opening templates, this rule makes the game both more static, and therefore strategic and more tactically rich. speaking as its designer, I would have released this version of Slither if I had discovered its relative merits in 2010, despite how this may have effected Slither's reputation.<br/><br/>",

Unbeknownst to the group, Kali's rhinoceros friend Mambo is eager to bump the group along to keep it moving, possibly pushing an explorer or two into the dung heaps that dot the land. Can you avoid getting a faceful of feces and being bumped by Mambo?<br/><br/>To set up the game, one player places Mambo on a space on the track that circles the game board, then all of the explorer tokens placed in random order in front of it, then Kali placed at the head of the line. Place the dung heaps along the movement track with some space between them. Each player takes a set of movement cards that match the color of her explorer.<br/><br/>Each player secretly chooses a movement card, then they reveal these cards simultaneously; someone also reveals the top movement card from Kali's deck. Whichever player has played the highest card moves her explorer token to the first unoccupied space in front of the group, then the player with the next highest card moves her token, and so on. If two or more players reveal the same number, only the one farthest back in the group moves; all other such explorers remain where they started the round. (Kali moves like an explorer. If you play a zero or are at the front of the group when you are supposed to move, you don't move.)<br/><br/>If a player's token lands on a dung heap, she scores three penalty points. If Kali lands in the dung, the player(s) who played the lowest number that round take the penalty instead of Kali.<br/><br/>Whenever Kali or an explorer token leave the space immediately in front of Mambo, the rhino charges, moving until it rams into the token in back of the line and giving that player as many penalty points as the number of spaces Mambo ran. If Mambo rams Kali, then as with the Kali/dung interaction, the player(s) who played the lowest number take the penalty points instead of Kali.<br/><br/>Remove those played movement cards from the game. After twelve rounds &ndash; that is, after the final cards have been played and resolved, the game ends and the player with the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

The players control the destiny of intrepid explorers setting out on expeditions to far off regions of the world. Fantastic animals, beautiful orchids, glittering treasures, lost explorers, maps and more all await discovery. However, fame and fortune will only come to those brave enough to trek into the untamed wilds.<br/><br/>Exploriana is played over several rounds, each split into a number of phases. Each round, players recruit explorers, ranging from photographers and detectives to scholars, medics and more. They then decide which of three far flung regions of the world they wish to send their explorers; South America, Africa or The Far East. Those explorers then lead expeditions into the deep jungles, endless savannah and mist swathed mountains of these strange new lands.<br/><br/>Exploration is a dangerous pursuit, perils lurk around every corner waiting to doom an expedition to failure! Explorers rely on their skills and wit to get them through, but if their expedition runs into too much trouble they could become lost, perhaps never to be seen again! The players must decide just how far to push their luck and see if fortune really does favour the bold!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be careful where you place your bet because the odds might be against you!<br/><br/>Each game is played in 3 Rounds that each consist of three phases:<br/>1.) drafting cards for your hand<br/>2.) betting on which horse you think will win<br/>3.) playing movement cards to adjust the order of the horses in the race.<br/><br/>Final scoring is based on where horses start in the race (horses starting in lower positions are worth more points), where horses end in the race (more points earned for higher place finishers), and when a bet was played (with later bets being worth less than earlier bets).<br/><br/>Score the highest points with your bet and you win!<br/><br/>",

Pub crawl!<br/><br/>The Red Dragon Inn 8 introduces five new characters&mdash;the proprietors of five brand new taverns, plus a new play variant where players can travel around to multiple taverns rather than staying at the Red Dragon Inn.<br/><br/>-- description from the Kickstarter<br/><br/>The Red Dragon Inn characters bar hop to other taverns and inns of the town (The Black Dragon Depths, The Harmonious Cup, Lucky's Rolling Barrel, The Scurvy Dog, Startusk's), discovering new drinks and characters (the tavern owners: Father Farai, Lucky the Scofflaw, Nerodia the Petrifier, Phyll Startusk, Samantha the Bookie). Each pub adds its own twist to the rules. Whenever a player reveals a Drink that includes one or more Chasers, the party pawn moves to a different open tavern after the Drink and any other pending effects are finished. Each tavern has an event that is triggered as the party arrives there. It also has its own Drink deck, and once that is exhausted, the tavern closes. The party crawls back to the Red Dragon Inn only once all other taverns have closed.<br/><br/>",

In each hand, one player bids to be Chimera and the other two players team up as the Chimera Hunters to defeat this player. Players compete for points in several hands of play, and the winner is the player who scores the most points once the designated point score is reached by one or more players. Chimera is normally played to 400 points, although longer or shorter games may be played. Chimera for three players was previously published as Chimera by ZMAN Games.<br/><br/>Chimera for five players plays similarly to Chimera for three players, but with additional cards and rules. One player bids to be Chimera, then chooses one other player to be their partner (the Pi Ya) through a bid system; the other three players then team up as the Chimera Hunters to defeat them. Chimera for five players is normally played to 400 points.<br/><br/>",

The game can also be played on a sheet of graph paper using X's and O's. It is similar in idea to tic-tac-toe, but far greater in scale and complexity.  The name means &quot;five points.&quot;<br/><br/>It is debated whether this game originated in China or Japan, with more evidence pointing to the former.<br/><br/>The object is to get five stones in a row.  The game is played on a 19x19 board (such as the board used in Go), creating a large and open field to complete this objective. The game can also be played on a smaller board, such as the popular 15x15 option.<br/><br/>If played perfectly, Black (who goes first) can always win the game.

Beginning with a single company valued at 10 million dollars, you can build a cartel whose final value may approach or surpass one billion dollars within ten years (ten rounds of play). You can acquire one or more new companies each year, increasing your profits and the value of your unsold stock, making it possible to buy bigger and bigger companies as the game proceeds. Special bonus profits are gained whenever you buy companies situated adjacent to one another on the board, further increasing your rate of growth.

Arm your robot directly while fighting and conquer your enemies!<br/><br/>In Steel Arena: Friday Night Robot Fight, you can make a cruel duel and gather up to four robots in a team battle or in a crazy war against everyone. Each player takes control of a robot and tries to eliminate the other players in the modular arena; the arena consists of hexes that are &quot;spaces&quot; to move and also modules that can be picked up during the fight and used to upgrade your robot to make it more deadly.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player activates their robot's modules in different combos that allow it to turn, move, fight and defend. There are a lot of weapons working in various ways: melee, direct fire, plunging fire, explosives, acoustic, etc. Causing damage to an opponent's robot destroys its modules and lets you take it as a trophy (victory points). The game ends when any of the robots are completely eliminated or when the stack of the modules runs out, then the player with the most trophies wins.<br/><br/>They were created for the show, so even after the apocalypse, the show must go on!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "September 1st, 1939: Germany invades Poland, setting off the Second World War. Except for minor attacks, France and Great Britain, the victors of World War One, do nothing. The Allies view the short Polish campaign of 1939 as a case of a newer, larger army winning out over an older, smaller army. Certainly the massed panzers are impressive, and need to be emulated, but the winter months see little positive activity on the Allied side. Missing the more vital lessons of the Polish campaign, the Allies are content to wait. Not only do their armies outnumber the Germans in terms of manpower, tanks and artillery, they have the advantage of operating on the defensive. Meanwhile the Germans feverishly apply the lessons they learned in Poland, and hone their operational techniques. The surprise German conquest of Norway jolts the Allies out of their lethargy. They do not have long to wait for the next blow.<br/><br/>May 10th, 1940: Germany unleashes its Blitzkrieg upon the western Allies. Six weeks later, the war ends in a smashing German victory. Four Allied national armies have vanished. The tiny Dutch and Belgian armies, pulverized in battle, have surrendered. Great Britain rescues most of the soldiers in the BEF, but their heavy weapons and vehicles remain on the beaches of Dunkirk. The island nation begins to re-arm, but for now is out of the fight. The proud French Army, with many regiments tracing an unbroken lineage back to the 1600s, suffers the most catastrophic defeat of modern times before France surrenders.<br/><br/>How did this happen? The Germans, realizing they could not win a repeat of World War One, set about reinventing the offense. Their formula included massed tank formations, an air force dedicated to close tactical support, and most importantly, a command and control system based on the use of radios. Allied tanks and soldiers were often equal or superior to their German counterparts &ndash; when given the opportunity to properly deploy and prepare. Unfortunately, such opportunities were few and far between. The Germans had securely positioned themselves inside an Allied decision making process that often took days to execute, rapidly concentrating, overwhelming defenders and then exploiting success. Certainly there were answers to every German innovation, but in six short weeks the Allies did not have the time to find them.<br/><br/>Case Yellow is a simple, but accurate, simulation recreating this monumental campaign. Each game turn is divided into eight action segments. Each player has four action chits. The initiative player selects the first action chit to play. The remaining seven chits are placed in an opaque cup and drawn randomly. In most cases the Germans have the initiative and go first by playing one of their four action chits. Each German chit is marked for movement or combat, and the German player chooses what his army will do (though the German player during the course of a turn must use two chits for movement and two chits for combat). At the end of movement, any panzer or motorized formation adjacent to Allied units has the option to attack. If combat is chosen, all German units adjacent to Allied units may attack if allowed by terrain.<br/><br/>Two Allied chits are marked two for movement and two for combat &ndash; not both.  The creaky Allied command structure will bedevil the Allied player throughout the game. Need to move? Sorry &ndash; you just drew a combat chit. Set up to attack? You drew a move chit, and only the number of motorized formations equaling the roll of a six-sided die can attack.<br/><br/>Zones of control reflect that the infantry of both sides still fight by the rules of World War One. Infantry units must stop when entering an enemy zone of control. Mount a one hex infantry attack against a defender hex, and you attack only the units in the defender hex. Mount a two hex (or greater) infantry attack against a defender hex, and all adjacent enemy hexes must also be attacked (large-scale infantry attacks take time to set up, and the defender has the time to integrate adjacent units into the defense plan).<br/><br/>Motorized units play by different rules, though the Germans with their better-trained, veteran formations do it much better than the Allies. Simply stated, any motorized unit with a Troop Quality (TQ) higher than any adjacent unit may disregard those adjacent units&rsquo; zones of control for purposes of movement, combat and retreat. Only a solid line is proof against motorized unit exploitation and envelopment, and only so long as combat does not create gaps. Additionally, motorized units only may attack a defender hex from two hexes without engaging any other adjacent defender units &ndash; the speed of motorized concentration allows the attack to go in before a traditional defensive response can be established.<br/><br/>The Luftwaffe is present in overwhelming strength, allowing the German player to negate the toughest defensive positions if necessary. Each Luftwaffe asset marker provides a one column shift on the combat table. Each Allied air asset marker provides the same shift, but there are far fewer Allied markers &ndash; not that the Allies had far fewer planes (they had almost as many), but the Allied air-ground coordination was so cumbersome that planes usually did not arrive in time to influence the battles being fought.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Red Typhoon is a redesign by Revolution Games of the fourth game of the popular PANZER KORPS series; originally published by Command Magazine Japan. Red Typhoon simulates the early 1942 Russian counter-offensive in front of Moscow that almost destroyed Army Group Center. Can you as the Soviet player complete the destruction or can you as the German player survive the Soviet onslaught.<br/><br/>Red Typhoon is a two player game following an IGO-UGO turn sequence with activation points controlling the movement and attack of each of your formations. This means that some units will not move or attack, some will just move or just attack and some will both move and attack. The players choices of how to use his activations is the most important decision in the game. Combat is fairly traditional with the additions that units are retreated by the attacking player and that retreated units are disrupted. Players able to take advantage of these two factors will be successful.<br/><br/>The game starts with several large Soviet breakthroughs that the German player must skillfully plug and in certain situations counterattack. There are special rules for German panzers, Soviet Airborne and Partisans.<br/><br/>First published as Panzer Korps 04: Red Typhoon in Command Magazine (Japan) #85 (Mar-Apr 2009)<br/><br/>",

The code-breaker then has to make guesses as to what the code is by filling in rows of 5 pegs using the feedback from the code-maker (correct color/correct position, correct color/incorrect position, or nothing). There are twelve chances to break the code. If the code-breaker cracks the code in 6 tries, that is how many points are given to the code-maker. Players alternate as code-maker and code-breaker for as many rounds as they would like to play.

        "description": "Here is the tale of &quot;The Sheep Race&quot;, of that glorious day when her Majesty the Queen of England's sheep were challenged by those of the former colonies in order to decide which of them were the best in the world. New Zealand and Australia were the first to issue the challenge, but soon after Scotland, South Africa, and the United States joined in. Then Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, and even Brazil intervened. England proudly refused to be forced into this dispute and proposed a worldwide racing championship be held in the Suffolk countryside in order to establish who were the world's supreme sheep farmers. Thus, the sheep race became an incredible and fascinating reality...<br/><br/>In The Sheep Race, players must place bets on three races, with six sheep participating in each race. Each sheep starts with a number of &quot;breath&quot; cubes (in three colors) on it, along with numbers for three speeds of movement: trot, walk, and gallop.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he rolls the two dice &ndash; one a normal d6 and the other having values 0-0-0-1-2-3 &ndash; then moves the sheep in the appropriate lane, with a 7 or 8 moving the sheep in the outer two lanes and a 9 moving the lazy sheep at the back of the pack. When you move a sheep, you choose one of the three types of movement, advance the sheep the indicated number of spaces, and remove the appropriate breath cubes required &ndash; or you make the sheep rest so that it recovers two blue breath cubes.<br/><br/>If a sheep hits the &quot;end zone&quot; &ndash; the final five spaces of a lane &ndash; with no cubes on it, then the sheep is exhausted and can't move or rest again. The race ends when three sheep reach the finish line or when all the sheep are exhausted. The first three positions pay off for those who bet on them, even if one or more of those positions contains an exhausted sheep.<br/><br/>Players place three bets in the first two races (two secret and one visible) and two bets in the final race (both secret).

The game has been designed to ensure that, just as in reality, the commanders (you) are fully occupied with decision making from the outset. Your key objective is to outmanoeuvre the enemy army and concentrate your forces at critical points in the battle. This will then destroy the enemy's will to fight, deal a devastating blow to the morale of their commanders (your opponent) and allow you to win.<br/><br/>Our companion army list books will contain historical overviews and the organisation of hundreds of accurately researched armies, ensuring that your battles will be able to have a realistic and historical feel.<br/><br/>Also, in reality, some armies would be relatively small, consisting of as few as 5,000 men, whilst others would be enormous. Field of Glory will allow you to see what might have been had these forces been equally matched, using a points system, as each army can then be scaled up or down whilst retaining an individual mix and balance of troops to create &ldquo;what if&rdquo; encounters.<br/><br/>We started with a blank sheet of paper and looked at a wide range of possible mechanisms. Some concepts are entirely new. Others may look familiar at first glance, but interact with the rest of the rules in a completely new way, giving Field of Glory a style all its own.<br/><br/>In Field of Glory our most important objective is to make the game fun to play whilst retaining a strong historical feel. So whether you fancy being Alexander the Great or Ghengis Khan, it's up to you, happy gaming and may your dice roll high!<br/><br/>",

Vivid colors mark the way to intricate tiles zigging and zagging through the green. Within the flowers lies the key to greater meaning. An explanation for all things unknown...<br/><br/>In Umbra Via, players compete to control and complete the most cunning paths. Reach into your bag to select wooden flowers, then place them on your secret board in the order of the paths you want most. But when players reveal their choices, things get delightfully tricky. Experience the magic of Umbra Via and find out why this award-winning design belongs on any table.<br/><br/>In more detail, at the start of each round four tiles are revealed from the deck, with each tile showing part of a path, e.g., a straight line, a curve, or a T. Players secretly draw three cubes from their bag and place them on spaces on their personal board corresponding to these tiles. They all reveal their choices, move their cubes to the chosen tiles, then secretly place three more cubes, then move those cubes to the tiles. Whichever tile ends up with the fewest cubes on it is placed in the 4x4 grid first, maintaining the same orientation, by the player who bid the most cubes on that tile. (Some cubes in your bag are worth two cubes during the bidding phase, but are then removed from the tile and returned to your bag prior to placement.) Then the next tile is placed on the grid, and so on.<br/><br/>When you place a tile, if all the &quot;open&quot; ends of that path are cut off &mdash; whether by the edge of the board or other tiles &mdash; you count how many cubes each player has on the path. The player with the most placed cubes retrieves &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes from the reserve equal to the number of tiles in the path, adding these cubes and all other cubes to their bag. The player with the secondmost cubes on the path retrieves half this many &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes, and so on. After removing and returning all the cubes on this path, remove the tiles from the grid, placing them in a discard pile.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has retrieved all of their &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes from the reserve, they win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(See VGG entry: The Eye Of Judgment)<br/><br/>The Eye of Judgment is a hybrid paper and electronic collectible card game which can be played using the PlayStation 3 game console, supported by the PlayStation Eye camera peripheral. It is one of the first games to use the peripheral, which is bundled with the game, along with a fixed Starter Deck and 1 booster pack. The trading cards are encrypted along their edges with a CyberCode matrix code. The game can also be played without the use of the Playstation 3 system, as a stand-alone card game. However this will cut out many unique graphics and require a person to keep track of numerous scores normally tracked by a computer - mana gain/loss, health bars, element advantages, field terrain changes, etc.<br/><br/>Players take turns playing creatures or spell cards from a 30-card deck in order to control a majority (5 fields) of the 9 total fields on the playing mat which is laid out in a 3x3 grid.  Other than  controlling a majority of fields, players can also win if their opponent runs out of cards to play.  Creatures' overall effectiveness is determined by their Hit Points and Attack Score as well as any special abilities they may possess.  Five elements divide the game's units: Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Biolith.  The playing grid fields have a top and bottom side and each side is affiliated with one of the five elements.  Creatures placed on friendly elements receive HP bonuses while creatures placed on an opposite element (a Fire creature placed on a Water field) suffer a loss of Hit Points, so unit placement is important.<br/><br/>In order to play any card (creature or spell), players must first pay a card's required summoning cost in mana (auto-generated for players every turn).  Each creature has a specific attack and defense pattern and these, along with the unit's placement on the 3x3 grid, determine where combat occurs and to some extent, how it resolves.  The extremely unique aspect of the Eye of Judgment game, however, is that when you play a card, the PlayStation Eye peripheral automatically generates that creature or spell into a 3D graphical version on your TV or monitor and it places it on a computerized version of the playing grid.  It also generates battle animations and resolutions digitally based on the cards involved or recently played.  This adds a level of visceral excitement to the collectible card game experience since you can actually see your minions battling it out in colorful digital fashion.  There isn't a single-player campaign but players can play matches vs. an AI opponent, another human, or online vs. other human opponents.  A rudimentary creature combat mode entitled Judgment allows players to determine which units would defeat other specific units in a head-to-head match-up.<br/><br/>The Eye of Judgment provides 5 themed pre-constructed decks (Fire Crusader, Earth Emperor, Water Barrage, Wood Swarm, and Biolith Scourge) and the Starter deck that's provided with the base game (containing a variety of card types).  Set 2 is due for release sometime in mid-April 2008 and will add another 100+ cards to the game, with more advanced powers.<br/><br/>",

Code-named Typhoon, Germany expected this final offensive to destroy all Soviet armies in front of Moscow in a classic double-envelopment by the Panzer divisions. In short, the Germans expected Typhoon to end the war in the east. Spearheading the German attack was Army Group Center, General Guderian's PanzerArmee, with some 900,000 men in 70 divisions. Facing them, blocking the way to the Soviet seat of power, were over 800,000 Soviet troops in 95 divisions.<br/><br/>The German assault was ferocious and incessant and came within sight of the Moscow Kremlin. Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected. After suffering huge losses in the opening battles, the Soviets reinforced the front line with Siberian and other reserves numbering perhaps 1.2 million men.<br/><br/>The battle for Moscow proved to be one of the decisive battles of the Second World War.<br/>Now, you can replay this epic struggle for supremacy in the east. The game's easy-to-play system allows the players to focus on the critical matters of operational maneuver and force coordination, while adding just enough chrome to faithfully recreate the key elements of the campaign.

        "description": "Rostov &lsquo;41: Race to the Don is the 21st game in the Standard Combat Series (SCS). It covers the bold&mdash;some would say &ldquo;foolhardy&rdquo;&mdash;dash by Army Group South to take Rostov in the late fall of 1941. Amazingly, the attack succeeded, resulting, however, in the Germans being isolated at the end of a logistical shoestring. The regrouping Red Army, stung from a long series of defeats, saw this as the perfect opportunity to launch its first coordinated attack of the war, thus paving the way for the Moscow Counteroffensive just a few weeks later.<br/><br/>Rostov &lsquo;41 covers all this swirling mobile action in turns representing 3 to 6 days and at a map scale of 2.5 miles per hex. Units are battalions to divisions. Low counter density and a wide-open map bring all the action and possibilities to light in some wild gameplay.<br/><br/>Both players will find themselves under the gun.<br/><br/>The German player must use his limited and overstretched forces to pull off a brilliant coup. Playing it safe won&rsquo;t cut it; speed is all-important. With a lot of skill and a bit of luck, Rostov will be yours. Then you&rsquo;ll have to pay the piper.<br/><br/>The Russian player must conserve his forces as the German rapier expends its energy. While the capture of Rostov requires a lot of skill and some luck on the German part, don&rsquo;t begin to think your job is easy. Derailing that German drive can easily consume precious forces needed for your main effort: turning the tables on the Germans and taking back great swaths of the Motherland.<br/><br/>Rostov &rsquo;41 components:<br/>&bull; Standard Combat Series (SCS) rulebook (version 1.8) <br/>&bull; Rostov &lsquo;41 game-specific rulebook<br/>&bull; one full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; map<br/>&bull; 280 counters<br/>&bull; 4 scenarios:<br/>  Fritz on the Don (Campaign), 14 Turns<br/>  Fritz on the Mius, 4 turns<br/>  Fritz Grabs Rostov, 7 turns<br/>  Soviet Counterpunch, 4 turns<br/>&bull; box and dice<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Like the first edition of the Dungeons and Dragons Miniatures Game, players pit their warbands against each other on a battle map. Warbands consist of models, each with their own respective characteristics and points values.  A typical warband consists of 200 points worth of models, with a maximum model count of 10.<br/><br/>The mechanics has been revised and streamlined, though the overall structure remains. The game has been updated to correspond with the change from 3rd to 4th Ed. Dungeons and Dragons Roleplaying Game.<br/><br/>The three sets released for this game were Dungeons of Dread, Against the Giants and Demonweb. Each is a set of 60 figures, with 8 random figures in each pack, Giants included huge figures. A fourth set, Feywild, was announced but not released. The Starter Set released with Dungeons of Dread, contains a rulebook, five fixed models, their stat cards, counters for tracking damage, a twenty-sided die and two double sided battle maps.<br/><br/>Notable changes in the 2nd Edition:<br/><br/>     Alignment has been simplified. The &quot;Chaotic&quot; and &quot;Lawful&quot; tags have been removed. Only models considered to be absolutely &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil&quot; are given an alignment.<br/>     Warband building is no longer based on alignment, but on &quot;Factions&quot;. Each model belongs to one or more of four factions. Every model in a warband must share at least one faction.<br/>     Commanders are gone, replaced by champions. Models no longer make morale checks or rout. Models reduced to half damage are &quot;bloodied.&quot; Certain game effects may trigger from this state.<br/><br/><br/>Wizards of the Coast is revising all the stat cards from 11 sets of the first edition of the game to make them compatable with the new version of the game. These stats will be available online in PDFs.<br/><br/>Wizards of the Coast will continue to release miniatures for use with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Roleplaying game. They have authorized a group of fans to create official stat cards to use these future figures with this minatures game.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Dungeons and Dragons Miniatures Game<br/><br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/minis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/minis</a><br/><br/>",

From prickling hot sensation came the grand idea for this sweet game.<br/><br/>Sweet &amp; Spicy is a bluffing card game for 2-6 players and the kid-friendly variant of Spicy. Instead of Wasabi you can now play with Lemon and there is a new card in the game: The SUPER-JOKER. But the game principle remains the same.<br/><br/>Just like in Spicy, the cards are played face down, so you can cheat when you announce your card. But it's not just about bluffing convincingly. You can almost always play a card that is at least half right if you play it skillfully from your hand. It's a matter of tactically considering which card you can get away with: Do I play a &quot;pepper 9&quot; better than a &quot;chili 10&quot; or a suit joker than a &quot;pepper 10&quot;? Or do I pass better, because I'm sure it will be noticeable that I've been thinking about it for so long?<br/><br/>In Sweet &amp; Spicy, the super joker is added, which can be any spice and any number. It is therefore always correct and cannot be doubted.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1840 and America&rsquo;s first mining boom is about to strike in the remote wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Take on the role of a mining company and compete for copper by casting miners and machines into what was known as the underground lottery. As the industry grows, so do the communities surrounding your mines. But every attempt to wrest copper from the ground hangs the fortunes of your company, and the lives of your miners, in the balance.<br/><br/>In Copper Country, each player takes on the role of a unique mining company and competes to produce the most copper before it's all gone! To produce copper, players hire miners to work mine sites. Your miner's productivity is measured in shifts. Each shift, you reveal one card from the top of the production deck, then choose an outcome by playing capital card resources from your hand, placing your miner at risk, or both!<br/><br/>Stake your claim by building company houses to increase your miners' loyalty and safety. Expand your mining empire by building shaft houses and hoist houses to increase your copper production.<br/><br/>When a player produces copper, the byproduct &mdash; poor rock &mdash; is removed from the industry track and dumped onto the mine site, reducing shifts nearby for all players. As players remove more poor rock from the industry track, local businesses open their doors, historical events occur, and Copper Country enters new eras of production. The game ends when the last poor rock is dumped onto a mine site, depleting Copper Country's mineral wealth. The winner is the player who has produced the most copper!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The basic game (Attack!) is a very simple game of expansion and conflict set in the World War 2 era. It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).<br/><br/>There are three major sub-games in Attack!:<br/>1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.<br/><br/>2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.<br/><br/>3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire &quot;set&quot; (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of &quot;1&quot; that represents a region without any special economic value (just &quot;population&quot;).<br/><br/>The units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.<br/>The map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa). The expansion contains the map of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Attack!: Expansion<br/>    Attack! Deluxe Expansion (Replaces Attack!

But beware! The danger of the city could turn your pack feral before you get a chance to build your forever home.<br/><br/>GDBZ aims to provide players with an immersive dog's-eye-view of the zombie apocalypse. Track down the hoomans from their smells, lick one another for boosts of energy, and bark at anything and everything!<br/><br/>On their turns, each player may take two actions, which can consist of running to different locations, playing energy cards from their hands, sniffing scent tokens, and giving each other licks in order to draw more energy. Each energy card has an ability, such as: Run, Herd, Bark, Chew, and Good Doggo, the last of which allows each dog to perform a unique and powerful ability. Some cards can be chained together for elaborate, tactical turns. At the end of each player's turn they will have to roll the dice in order to add another zombie to the board, which may eat unsuspecting hoomans or get into Central Bark.<br/><br/>If too many hoomans are eaten or too many zombies get into Central Bark, the Feral Tracker will reach 10 - and we become wild dogs, forgetting our love of hoomanity. However, if the players rescue enough hoomans (6 on easier difficulties, and 8 on expert modes), we all win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bagh Chal is a traditional abstract game that is popular in Nepal. The name roughly translates to &quot;Tigers Moving&quot;. It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.<br/><br/>The board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.<br/><br/>It is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.<br/>See also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.<br/><br/>Games played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar. See the according image galleries of these games.<br/><br/>",

Tasty portions of fried worms are waiting to be fetched from the grill. In turn, the chickens play out their card stakes. Whoever quits earlier gets less, but still has cards up his sleeve for later rounds. Clever play is made by those who judge their hand of cards well at the right moment and can thus get hold of the most valuable portions.<br/><br/>A must for all Heckmeck lovers.<br/><br/>In each round, cards from the hand are played to gain worm portions of different values. Each player lays out cards. Cards of the same value may not be placed by the same player in subsequent rounds. Gained portions are stacked in front of each player, and the last portion won (on top) can be stolen. The thief can be any player who, whose total of played cards, at the time of his or her own exit, matches the value of the stolen portion.<br/><br/>The game ends after all worm portions have been taken. The winner is the player who has the most worms on his gained portions.<br/><br/>",

Will your pack live in legend as the ones who saved the world, or those who betrayed it?<br/><br/>Is today a good day to die?<br/><br/>Take control of a pack of Garou, savage werewolves, as they battle the forces of the Wyrm in defense of Mother Earth, Gaia.<br/><br/>Call upon ancient spirit pacts, mystical abilities, and the tools of the modern world to destroy the forces of corruption that threaton to plunge the world into eternal darkness and decay.<br/><br/>But not every Garou agrees how best to save Gaia. Is it best done through force? Through renewing the traditions and spirit pacts of old? Through mystical means? Or should the Garou just adapt to the new age and help Gaia change to fit into the new world?<br/><br/>Or sell out and play a pack of Wyrm creatures hell bent on seeing that the Wyrm is the final victor in the coming Apocalypse.<br/><br/>But not even the forces of the Wyrm can agree on their methods. Should they concentrate on corrupting humans and Garou to do the Wyrm's bidding? Should they fight the Garou claw to claw? Or should they win the war by destroying every last thing the Garou love and cherish?<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player has two decks. One deck is his &quot;Sept&quot; hand.  This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.<br/><br/>Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:<br/>Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards<br/>Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt<br/>Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.<br/>Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions<br/>Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.<br/>Combat - resolve any fights.<br/><br/>Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:<br/>1) Attack another Alpha<br/>2) Attack a victim<br/>3) Attack an enemy<br/>4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character<br/>5) Attack a territory<br/>6) Do nothing.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.<br/><br/>Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.<br/><br/>",

In a battle scenario, two players will command either the Jacobite forces or the units of the Government army. There are 13 battle scenarios in the game. A scenario&rsquo;s battle notes state which player takes the first turn and players will alternate taking turns thereafter until one player reaches the number of Victory Banners indicated in the scenario&rsquo;s victory conditions.<br/><br/>The Jacobite Rising battlefield game board has a hex grid of 13 hexes wide by 11 hexes deep. The battlefield is divided into three sections by two dotted lines, giving each player a Left Flank Section, a Center Section and a Right Flank Section. Where the dotted line cuts through a hex, the hex is considered to be part of both the flank section and the center section. Terrain Tiles represent a range of terrain features and are placed on the battlefield to recreate the historical scenario setting.<br/><br/>A Command card is played each turn by the active player to order troops on a player&rsquo;s side to move, battle, or do something special. The mix of units both players may have under their commands include; regular infantry, highland infantry, lowland infantry, militia infantry, battle cavalry, light cavalry, trained artillery, light artillery and leaders. Units are represented by a group of 4 blocks in a hex and a single block represents a leader. Units and leaders may only move and battle when given an order. During a turn when units are battling, the battle dice will resolve combat quickly and efficiently and when the last block of an opposition unit or leader block is eliminated, a player will gain one Victory Banner. Again the number of banners needed to win is detailed in a scenario&rsquo;s victory conditions.<br/><br/>In a Jacobite Rising Tricorne battle, unit morale is one of the main thematic concepts, as it was historically. It is possible that units which have taken few-- or even no-- losses will run off the battefield at the first combat, which will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.<br/><br/>To further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the Highland Clans and Government forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards. These cards represent a mix of unit training, abilities, and surprising actions that take place during the course of a battle.<br/><br/>As with other Commands &amp; Colors games, the scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger historical Jacobite Rising battles, like Culloden and Falkirk, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. The 13 battle scenarios in the game present a stylized battlefield map that emphasize the important terrain features and highlights the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. Still the tactics of the period, that players will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various armies of the day and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought.<br/><br/>Here is the list of 13 battles and smaller skirmish actions included with Jacobite Rising:<br/><br/><br/>     Killicrankie - 27 July 1689<br/>     Dunkeld - 21 August 1689<br/>     Cromdale - 1 May 1690<br/>     Alness - 10 July 1715<br/>     Sheriffmuir - 13 November 1715<br/>     Glen Shiel - 10 June 1719<br/>     Prestonpans - September 1745<br/>     Clifton - 18 December 1745<br/>     Inverurie - 23 December 1745<br/>     Falkirk (Stage 1) - 17 January 1746<br/>     Falkirk (Stage 2) - 17 January 1746<br/>     Culloden - 16 April 1746<br/>     Culloden (Flanking Move) - 16 April 1746<br/><br/><br/>Again, owners of Compass Games The American Revolution Commands &amp; Colors: Tricorne will find many familiar game mechanics in this stand-alone game product, but there are also plenty of new and interesting play concepts, which  add historical depth and will provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors players new experiences and challenges as they are introduced into the world of the Highland Clans in the time of the Jacobite Risings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In order to confuse the wolf, the hunter and animals in the farmhouse also start to disguise themselves. As a result, nobody can tell each other apart anymore. Meanwhile, the shepherd boy has repeatedly fooled others by crying out &quot;Wooolf! Wooolf!!&quot;. So the hunter and the hunting dog have to be careful with the shepherd boy. Everyone has to find out the real identity of others. Will the wolf finally catch the real sheep, or can the sheep find the hunter and the hunting dog who can protect them?<br/><br/>Wooolf!! Is a fast playing deduction game suitable for four to eight players. Each player has two character cards, one of which represents his true identity and the other is only there to cause confusion. Character cards include wolf, sheep, shepherd boy, hunter, and hunting dog. By asking clever questions and drawing the right conclusions, each player tries to make correct suspicions before the other players do. In order to catch the wolf, the shepherd boy will sometimes dress up as hunter, the hunter will disguise as a sheep, the sheep will act like hunting dogs and the hunting dog will put on wolf skin. Use your wits to tell truth from lies in order to be the first to catch the wolf.<br/><br/>",

You've walked its stalwart streets, tasted of its determined harvests, and have in turn sworn your life to its defense. Death does not frighten you near so much as the thought of Farrenroc falling to Darkness.<br/><br/>And now, here you stand&mdash;at the gates of the last city, facing the uncertain lands beyond. As the distant drumming heralds the encroaching Darkness, you steel your weapons and ready your courage for a final defense of your ancestral home. The dark frontier awaits...<br/><br/>Fight back the oppressive forces of Darkness in Myth: Dark Frontier, a fully cooperative board game for 2-4 players. Take on the role of an iconic Myth hero in a desperate fight to protect the city of Farrenroc from the legions of Darkness that seek to despoil its holy walls.<br/><br/>Heroes will have to travel, fight, and quest in defense of their city, while also establishing strongholds throughout the surrounding lands to provide crucial resources to Farrenroc. Each hero is equipped with a unique deck of action cards, providing unique ways to perform the standard actions...as long as Fate is on their side.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the forces of Darkness spread across the land, methodically crippling Farrenroc's influence in hopes of eventually laying siege to this last standing beacon of Light. Each game of Dark Frontier pits the heroes against a sinle army, contributing its own unique minions, captains, boss, and treacheries. Heroes must contend with these threats while also mustering the support of the land to unite against a mutual foe.<br/><br/>Dark Frontier combines high adventure with resource management, programmed action selection, and epic conquest to create a unique gaming experience to further enrich the world of Myth.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of iconic heroes from the world of Myth, aiding the besieged city of Farrenroc in its never-ending quest to push back the Darkness. Each hero has a small deck of five actions: Travel, Battle, Encounter, Fortify, and Quest. Three of the five are selected and placed in one of three time slots (morning, day, and night). These selections are made for all heroes and the enemy at the same time, then shuffled. Each time phase is played out by drawing and executing the action, be it a hero or an enemy. Oftentimes the timing of these actions is important to accomplish a quest or encounter, or to push back invading forces. Players will need to discuss their planned actions with each other and play them in the appropriate time slots. All the while, the enemy is moving to destroy Farrenroc by any means necessary.<br/><br/>",

Combat is resolved with the unique &quot;power card&quot; system, which is designed to have all the excitement of dice-based combat but with far less randomness. Whoever has the last hero standing wins control of Power City!<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the hero cards. They represent one hero in the game and are modelled after vintage trading cards. On the front side is a picture of the hero, and all the gameplay info about their powers; on the back are fun stats and an origin story!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player assembles his team. You can either pick one of the set starting teams or draft your team. Drafting allows you to put almost countless sets of heroes together to try out all sorts of crazy combos and synergies. Drafting works almost like a mini-game before the main event, as the players try to put their best possible team together. Once you have picked your team, it's time to fight. The players take it in turn either bringing a hero into play, or using their hand of power cards to trigger one of their heroes' amazing special abilities!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Daedalus Sentence is a cooperative escape game that challenges players to use limited actions and effective communication in order to flee from their captors and escape a dangerous and ever-changing prison. Use your actions to explore your surroundings, overcome guards, or change the layout of the prison itself - just be careful that the moves you make to save yourself don't doom a teammate!<br/><br/>In the year 2083, an alien race known as the Loctae descended on planet Earth, killing billions and capturing and containing the few million that remained. The survivors were sent to locations throughout the galaxy, to work as slaves or as subjects for genetic experiments. The most infamous of these locations, known as the Hive, is a Loctae space station orbiting Ganymede. Here, prisoners are harvested for their genetic material, which is used by the Loctae to make genetic hybrids engineered for aptitude in any skill the Loctae require. A few have tried to escape, but none have succeeded. Those who are not lost in the station's labyrinthine halls are recaptured by the station's guards and then moved to the front of the list of those who are to be processed. The failed escapees blabber about the twisted and spliced creatures that roam the corridors of the maze, as if they were in the Labyrinth of King Minos. The remaining survivors now call their plight &quot;The Daedalus Sentence&quot;, a grim tribute to the facility's designer.<br/><br/>As the months in The Hive wear on, fewer and fewer prisoners remain. Fearing their subjects would run out before their experiments were completed, the Loctae have confined the remaining prisoners in regenerative pods, so that the organs and marrow taken from the prisoners will regenerate with time. Though expensive, this set up was proving successful for the Loctae until a rogue meteor struck the station, damaging the ship's AI and releasing the bonds that kept the prisoners contained. Now the prisoners have a chance, likely the last one they'll ever have, to brave the halls of The Hive and escape to freedom.<br/><br/>The main feature of the game is its rotating board. The board has four rotating rings, with players starting in the center prison cells and making their way to the outer ring, where they must find the final exit to make their escape. When players start the game, the entire board will be hidden. As they move from the start location, they need to spend actions to flip over tiles in order to discover the layout of each ring. Their main objective is to find the gate to the next ring, but as they explore they will discover tiles both beneficial and perilous. The tiles may allow them to influence the movement of enemies or the maze itself, but they may also spawn additional enemies that will hunt for the players until subdued. If the players can make their way through all four rings, find the final exit, and escape together, they win!<br/><br/>Enemies will spawn throughout the course of the game, both as the result of exploring tiles and from drawn cards. Unlike many card-driven games however, the players have a glimpse into their future by way of the Theseus Device, which holds eight cards that determine how the rings and enemies will move in coming rounds. All eight cards start hidden, but through die rolls (and cards played from the hands of players in case of emergency), players see some of the cards to come. This allows for careful planning, as players try to anticipate how rings will line up in future rounds, as well as making sure they are not caught in the patrol of any passing enemies. When the game starts, only two cards will be activated per round, but as the players breach additional rings, the number of cards that will activate increases. When playing the recommended timed game difficulty enhancer, this leads to a frantic rush as players try to evade enemies and find the exit while planning ahead for the next activation sequence.<br/><br/>The Daedalus Sentence is designed to be played at a variety of difficulty levels, and players can mix-and-match the optional difficulty enhancers to achieve the perfect intensity level for their group. In addition to a four player co-op game, The Daedalus Sentence can also be played one-versus-all, with a player taking the role of the labyrinth and its minions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>Karelia &rsquo;44 is an operational level game that focuses on the last major campaign of the Russo-Finnish Continuation War (25 June 42&mdash;4 Sept 44). STAVKA planned an offensive during the summer of 1944 to coincide with the Normandy landings. The objective was to force Finland out of the war. Towards this end, the Soviets amassed two ground armies, one air army, and an impressive amount of artillery. Confident after a series of victories against the Germans, the Red Army attacked in Karelia on 9 June 44. The attack began with an overwhelming artillery barrage (second only to the Oder crossings in intensity). Finnish lines were pushed back and then breached&mdash;the race for Viipuri/Vyborg was on. The capture of this city would open the road to Helsinki.<br/><br/>The game features a unique &ldquo;Boss Point&rdquo; System which precludes either player from knowing how long the game will last. For the Russian player, this represents the gun to his head of an unhappy dictator who will gladly send you to a Gulag forever if you fail in your goals. For the Finns, you know that you are understrength and that the Russians will destroy you if given enough time, but you need to hang on for dear life in order to be in the best possible position when the Boss&rsquo; patience runs out.<br/><br/>Players will find two very different armies to command. The Russians are the proverbial 500 lb gorilla, but one that takes time to prepare big operations and isn&rsquo;t fleet of foot enough to do small scale attacks.<br/><br/>The Finns have splendid artillery and are designed for a mobile defense which, if done right, will leave the Russians flailing in the air. You have three defensive lines to use and an innovative &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; unit feature that allows your thin ranks to try to hang on to them.<br/><br/>Please note, this is not the Winter War of 1939! This is a well developed late war Russian army, not the hapless troops of the opening years of the war. The Finns need to be on their toes to stand a chance.<br/><br/>Karelia '44 is the 14th game in the award winning Standard Combat Series.

The relevant hardware must be purchased, including a rocket powerful enough to lift the weight of the other items involved. The mission is carried out by following a series of steps, and rolling percentiles against the safety rating of specific items each turn - e.g. liftoff roll against rocket, orbital burn roll against space capsule, space walk roll against space suit etc.<br/>If a player fails a safety roll, the advanced game contains several possible failure outcomes (requiring one or more further rolls) ranging from a bulb failure to a catastrophic explosion, which will reset the safety factor of your equipment!<br/><br/>Once missions are completed, players&rsquo; incomes are adjusted depending on successes / failures, and the next year begins.<br/><br/>Multiple development options are available, with 1, 2, 3 and 4 man capsules, a shuttle, several rockets, a couple of lunar landers and many other items. Do you follow the US methodical strategy or do you develop a space shuttle in 1961 and glide to the moon? Challenge is to determine when to take risks to get the extra income boost, do you use an untested new rocket now, or do you hope your opponents haven&rsquo;t planned the same mission as you giving you time for one more year of research?<br/><br/>There is a new version of the game in the works, by designer Fritz Bronner.

        "description": "Pacific Tide: The United States versus Japan, 1941-45 is a compact, Strategic-level board wargame covering the struggle between the United States (including some Commonwealth forces) and Japan in World War II by game designer Gregory M. Smith. This game utilizes a unique and fast-paced, card-driven combat/build system revolving around carrier operations which will provide players with a multitude of decisions. While extremely competitive as a two-player game, Pacific Tide can be enjoyed again and again in Solitaire play format with its unique, &ldquo;personality&rdquo; driven bot system.<br/><br/>Despite the Strategic level of the game, there are operational and even tactical nuances, as players must decide when and how to commit their carrier forces, land-based air, and even their intelligence assets. To a degree, the Japanese player is racing against the clock. The quality of his pilots degrades over time, and starting in 1943, he also loses the strategic initiative as he becomes the second player. The US Player is also fighting the clock, as he cannot sit back and take a relaxed approach to defeating Japan. If he doesn't win by 1945, he doesn't win at all. Tension build as both sides race toward decisive carrier battles and seizure of key geographical objectives.<br/><br/>The card-based combat/build system is a different take on the &quot;normal&quot; event/operations points driven systems. Separate card decks are provided for the U.S. and Japanese player. Each year, the players receive that year's cards for free&hellip;but must use build points to repurchase older cards. This will cause the player a few agonizing moments, as he typically cannot afford to re-buy every card he needs (or thinks he needs). Players must also decide which aspect of cards to use &ndash; many have multiple but exclusive uses (such as, &quot;Do A or do B&quot;) and these uses sometimes give very different results based on operational or strategic needs at the time. To help ensure a tense and dynamic game, the system forces players to make many choices and decisions throughout play.<br/><br/>Units comprise five different types:<br/><br/>&bull; CV units represent individual carriers or small groups of escort carriers<br/>&bull; INF units represent all types of ground combat troops, including Marine and Army units<br/>&bull; Naval Air units represent carrier borne aircraft<br/>&bull; Land Air units represent bombers and fighters based on land<br/>&bull; Partisan units represent the Filipino resistance, which grew to considerable size by the end of the war<br/>&bull; Campaign set up and reinforcement codes are printed on the counter<br/>&bull; Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts<br/>Control and Entrench markers are also provided for play.<br/><br/>Special rules are provided for amphibious attacks, repair of fleets, supply effects, and guerillas. Bidding rules determine which side one will play in a tournament-style play format.<br/><br/>As a bonus for solo players, Pacific Tide features a solitaire assistant &ndash; commonly known as a &quot;Bot&quot; &ndash; which gives guidance to the player for either side during solitaire play. The assistant acts differently based on the &quot;personality&quot; it's been given...aggressive, defensive, or balanced. All game cards have a rating which the assistants will prioritize differently for play. While extremely competitive as a two-player game, Pacific Tide can be enjoyed again and again in solitaire play format with its unique, &ldquo;personality&rdquo; driven Bot-system.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: 3 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: Single Year Turns with alternating, multiple cards plays per player<br/>Map Scale: Area map<br/>Unit Scale: from individual carriers or carrier groups, fleets, army-level infantry, air groups<br/>Players: one to two, best with two<br/>Playing Time: two to four hours<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>One map (17&quot; x 22&quot; map size)<br/>One Countersheet of 9/16&rdquo; unit-counters<br/>52 Game Cards<br/>Rules booklet<br/>16 Six-sided Dice<br/>Box and Lid<br/>Game Credits:<br/><br/>Designer: Gregory M.

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Koi Pond: A Coy Card Game is a lovely, clever game for 2-4 players. Collect colorful koi fish and choose whether to place them in your pond or in your house. You'll score points only for the *lower* number, though, so keep your pond and house as balanced as you can. Your pond is public, but your house is secret. To win, you have to be...coy!<br/><br/>Each turn, players take turns drawing a card from the face-down deck or from the face-up &quot;lake&quot; until everyone has three new cards in hand. Then all players simultaneously choose from amongst their entire hand one card to add to their personal pond and one to discard to their personal &quot;river&quot;. Cards in your river will eventually go to the lake, so choose carefully.<br/><br/>After six turns, the round ends. Score points by comparing the total number of koi of a suit in your pond and your house. Score points equal to the *lower* number. Score each suit of koi in this manner. If a crane, housecat or turtle is in your pond, you score bonus points for koi of that noted suit in your opponent's pond (crane), house (housecat) or river (turtle). Which opponent depends on the number of players and the current round.<br/><br/>After each round, ribbons are awarded to the player with the most koi of each suit in her river. Ribbons grant bonus points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>To maximize your koi score, you have to carefully balance the populations in your pond and house. A turtle, housecat, or crane earns points from an opponent's hard work, but they also take valuable space in your hand. Sending high value koi cards to your river earns more ribbons, but also makes them available to all players in the next round. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

It is more of a game than a simulation and intended to bring a high player interactivity and replayability to the player's table.<br/><br/>The Situation<br/><br/>From December 12 to December 23 in 1942, &quot;Unternehmen Wintergewitter&quot; was in progress. This was the code name for a relief attack by Heeresgruppe Don to free the trapped 6th Army in Stalingrad.<br/><br/>The Axis formations entered with 50,000 men and 250 tanks, while the strength of the Soviet formations was reported to be about three times that. For the enterprise to have any chance of success, the troops in the encirclement had to break out and meet the advancing Axis troops. The breakout had to be precisely coordinated with the advance of the relief troops and was to commence on the cue &ldquo;Donnerschlag&rdquo;. The breakout was never ordered and the troops in Stalingrad were never able to be relieved. This sealed their fate.<br/><br/>Players will be recreating this episode, with the Axis side attempting to secretly establish and reach a meeting point, thus effectively freeing the 6th Army, while the Soviet will try to impede such outcome.<br/><br/>The Scale<br/><br/>A hex represents 4 kms (2.5 miles) of terrain from side to side.<br/>Each turn represents a period of 1-2 days.<br/>Combat units are mostly Brigades &amp; Regiments for the Soviets and Romanians, Battalions &amp; Abteilungen for the Germans.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It includes a campaign mode composed of individual adventures for 1 to 4 players, linked together by an overarching storyline. Each adventure can also be played separately, as standalone episodes. This enables the players to experience each story in different ways and allows to lead their Heroes on a different path during each playthrough.<br/><br/>Each Hero has their own Saga, a tale waiting to be uncovered and told. Progressing through it grants powerful, new relicts, rituals or allies. As they roam the lands, the Heroes will be able to acquire new Sagas, which shall give them more power and unlock new, hitherto hidden parts of the story. This is why our Heroes are a work in progress, so to speak, and it falls upon the players to shape them and lead them to noble (or not quite so) deeds.<br/><br/>Here are the four tribe champions who seek their destinies;<br/><br/>Svara &ndash; the Vengeful Grace<br/>A mercenary, roaming the land together with packs from Wolf Gate.

When the druids found him at the stone, half-dead, he told them of his taint in the hope that his Saga would not end with the next full moon&hellip;<br/><br/>Dalbor &ndash; the Murkbathed<br/>A child found by a witch. It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to survive, had no chance to resist the cursed fog in which it had been abandoned. And yet the hungry Murk did not monstrify the boy, granting him strength instead. He would soon find his heritage and embark on a journey to meet his past&hellip;<br/><br/>Veda &ndash; the Sister of Hollows<br/>Veda, like her mother before her, carried the Gift. She was born into it and even when she was a little girl, her mind wandered between worlds. After losing her beloved brothers she did not want to accept the cruelty which fate had bestowed upon her.

American and German troops scramble from their bases to try and delay the Soviets, for if they get through, they will drive all the way to the Rhine.  Over two thousand tanks will meet in the decisive engagement of the war.<br/><br/>The Corps Command system returns with a modern twist!  Asset chits allow players to bring in reinforcements and influence the battle space with gunships, chemical attacks and electronic warfare.

All of this with the same lean, mean and simple system as the first game in the series, Corps Command: Totensonntag.<br/><br/>The Soviets hit hard but fold fast - as their units wear down they lose initiative, making them less and less capable, and the clock is against them.  The NATO (American and German) forces defending the Gap are highly capable but are outnumbered and playing for time.  Both players are being asked to do the impossible - to win the greatest tank battle of all time.<br/><br/>The game ships with:<br/><br/>A 17&quot; x 22&quot; map that beautifully depicts the lush, West German landscape of the Eisenbach Gap.<br/><br/>136 colorful, 5/8&quot; counters, representing the battalions and brigades that fought the first battle of World War III.<br/><br/>Easy to learn, quick to read, rules. Be up and playing in less time than it takes to set up other games. Better yet, if you know how to play Corps Command: Totensonntag you know the basics of Corps Command: Dawn's Early Light.<br/><br/>Players' Aid card and Terrain Effects Chart.<br/><br/>Everything lovingly packaged in a good-looking box.<br/><br/>Look for the new edition Dawn's Early Light Red Hammer coming soon.<br/><br/>Other Games in Series:<br/><br/>    Totensonntag<br/>    Corps Command: Dawn's Early Light – Red Hammer<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The IT company is staring Chapter 11 in the face. Its cost of operations is too high, its revenue too low. In a last ditch attempt, it is looking to hire a top tier business consultant to turn this around. Alas, there are many such persons claiming to be the best. To filter mere noise from the elite, the company has called upon the consultants with the most potential to share their business proposals - You are one such.<br/><br/>Shake Up sits in a very rare tabletop genre: reverse deck-building or also known as a deck destruction game. Players each have their own deck of cards, which are completely identical decks since they represent the same employees of the same IT company. How each player handles the company will be different though, and that is where the better consultant will stand out. The first consultant to put the company into the green wins!<br/><br/>Every turn players draw 4 cards from their own deck, and determine how to utilize those cards' abilities. Players are also allowed to perform a 'Lay Off' action, permanently removing an employee from the deck. While this may seem bad, it makes their deck more efficient in the style they want to build towards. They also save on that employee's salary, especially if it is a highly paid executive! Note however, that the higher ups usually have greater experience and better abilities. Starting off the game with some debt, players will slowly clear them away as well as make some profit through new business projects. How then do consultants interact in the game? Their sales folks can try to hustle the other team, messing up their rivals' business proposals! Of course, those same rivals will likely also have their own purchasing and accounting departments to protect themselves from red herring purchases.<br/><br/>When does the game end? Each time a player's draw deck is emptied and recycled from its discard pile, she has a chance to call an Audit. When an Audit is called, that player counts her total revenue earned, then reduce it by the salary of all existing employees in her deck, as well as any unpaid loans. If it is still positive, she wins the game right away! Dare you call an Audit before your rival? Doing so is risky, since you either win the game right away or you gain more debt because you have to pay for wasting the auditors' time, putting you further from victory.<br/><br/><br/>    Deck-builders are a common genre and folks try to add more powerful and advanced cards into their deck, which is typically comprised of basic cards. In reverse deck-building however, players begin with fully powered-up decks. The problem is one where veteran deck-builders will be familiar with - having too thick a deck will make it inefficient. Throughout the game, players will try to cull cards that are not part of their chosen strategy.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Try to maneuver the ping-pong ball into your opponents goal by deftly applying just enough backspin and English to reflect off the sidewalls and around the barrier that separates you.  You have 5 attempts to get a goal, as long as the ball keeps returning to you.  But if you put too much speed on it, it'll fly off the other side as there's no backstop in this game, only side rails.  If you can manage to curl it all the way into your opponents 'end zone' and make it come back into the goal, you get two points.  But instead of taking a point, you can set up a blocker instead, to try to protect your goal.  Comes with each players yoke like ball holder and rubber shooting implement with a small wooden handle.

You and your fellow students train vigorously every day to improve your mind and body, but your master is ailing, and only one senshi will become the next master. To prove your worth, you must develop four attributes: strength, agility, wisdom, and honor. A true master must be strong in all of these, and weak in none.<br/><br/>Senshi is a strategy game for 2-4 players that takes only 15 minutes to play! Carefully manipulate stacks of tiles that represent your four attributes: strength, agility, wisdom, and honor. Competing in a battle of wits, players will choose one of three actions each turn: study to take stacks of tiles, train to take a single tile off any stack, and test to score tiles when the time is optimal.<br/><br/>Whoever has the tallest scoring pile of any of the four attributes at the end of the game wins; however, first the player with the shortest scoring pile is eliminated. Watch your opponent's moves closely and exploit their weaknesses to achieve the great honor of becoming the temple's next master!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Age of Sigmar began with the thunderous arrival of the Stormcast Eternals, borne upon the heavenly storm of the God-King Sigmar Heldenhammer. They are great heroes, snatched up at the moment of death and magically reforged &ndash; these golden warriors are thrown into battle against all who would corrupt, decay, and destroy the Mortal Realms.<br/><br/>While Sigmar and his pantheon of Order strive for prosperity in these dark times, the Great Necromancer Nagash marshals the forces of Death in a bid to claim every last soul for his own. Meanwhile, Kragnos leads the wild forces of Destruction in a savage rampage across the civilised world, all while the Chaos Gods prepare to conquer the last uncorrupted bastions in a world of conflict and upheaval. This is a new epoch, a time of mighty battles and unending war. This is the Age of Sigmar!<br/><br/>The Age of Sigmar is an epic setting populated by myriad armies, powerful heroes, and magnificent monsters. It plays host to vast, realm-spanning wars between the forces of Order, Chaos, Death, and Destruction. In the Warhammer Age of Sigmar Core Book, you&rsquo;ll not only learn the rich history of this war-torn age, but you&rsquo;ll also find all the rules you need to evoke these epic stories on the tabletop.<br/><br/>Realms of War<br/><br/>The Core Book starts with Realms of War, an overview of the Warhammer hobby with concise how-to guides on collecting, building, and painting your miniatures, as well as the various ways you can use them to play games of Warhammer Age of Sigmar.<br/><br/>War Unending<br/><br/>Discover the history of the Mortal Realms in the first lore section of the book, containing a detailed, illustrated story-so-far, from the arrival of mankind's God-King to the savage Era of the Beast. This covers three major ages:<br/><br/><br/>     The Age of Myth, Sigmar&rsquo;s journey through the cosmos, his meeting with the Great Drake Dracothion and his exploration of the eight Mortal Realms. It tells of his awakening of other gods, the building of civilisations, and the fractious alliances that were forged.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Age of Chaos, brought about by the machinations of the Chaos Gods and their command of the Realm of Chaos, spitting daemon legions forth and destroying the peace that once reigned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Age of Sigmar, in which the God-King's champions fight back against his enemies in all their forms. From the vengeful Realmgate Wars that cast Chaos back from many Order strongholds, to the cataclysmic Necroquake brought about by Nagash, God of the Dead, to the dawn of the Era of Beasts as the ancient Earthquake God unleashes hordes of rampaging greenskins into the heartlands of civilisation.<br/><br/><br/>Delve into background information on each of the eight Mortal Realms &ndash; Azyr, Shyish, Ashqy, Chamon, Ghur, Ghyran, Hysh, and Ulgu &ndash; which details their links, descriptions of the native civilisations that have risen and fallen, key events that have taken place and notable geographical features; along with details of the Realm of Chaos, a nightmarish dimension home to the Chaos Gods and legions of terrifying hellspawn.<br/><br/>Clashing Empires<br/><br/>Learn about the armies and alliances that fight across the Mortal Realms, each featuring a showcase of beautifully painted Citadel miniatures, split into four sections according to their Grand Alliances. Beginning with the forces of Order, you'll glean insight into each of the factions that comprise the last bastion of civilisation in the eight realms (even if they don't always get along), before moving on to parley with their nemeses in the forces of Chaos. Meanwhile, Nagash's alliance of Death plots to claim every last soul in the land, while Grand Alliance Destruction indulges their baser instincts on a roaring rampage of carnage alongside their newfound deity, Kragnos.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/><br/>The first rules section of this book contains the core concepts you need to start fighting battles in the Age of Sigmar, taking you through deployment, the battle rounds, combat, magic, and more. The rules are laid out in a clear and concise format with additional commentary from the designers, making this the easiest rulebook to reference in Warhammer history.<br/><br/>Once you've got the basics squared away, find out all about the three core ways to play the game and the battleplans you can undertake in each.<br/><br/>Open Play<br/>Let your imagination run wild as open play caters for re-enacting every kind of narrative storyline or tactical challenge you can think of, without restrictions.<br/><br/>     Includes the Open War Battleplan Generator, which provides pre-set Maps, Victory Conditions, Twists, and Ruses.<br/>     Combining different options allows over 1,200 different types of Open War scenarios to be played.<br/><br/><br/>Matched Play<br/>Designed to put both players on an equal footing, matched play offers players an even chance of victory based around points-based army construction rules and a competitive set of battleplans.<br/><br/>     Includes additional special rules, including Stealing the Initiative, as well as rules for additional objectives scored on either a turn-by-turn or end-of-battle basis.<br/>     Features much broader and more detailed requirements and restrictions than other game types, including restrictions on endless spells, reinforced units, and understrength units.<br/><br/><br/>Narrative Play<br/>Send your army on a Path to Glory and watch them develop across games with an overhauled section on narrative gameplay rules. Earn renown, gain new abilities, and even expand your army's territory while free of limitations on how, when, and where you can play.<br/>&ndash; Includes rules and guidance on a 5-step process to starting a Path to Glory campaign, including: Choosing Factions and Realms, Starting Sizes and Territories, Orders of Battle, Core Enhancements, and picking Quests to embark upon.<br/>&ndash; Provides guidance on how to fight battles against opponents both participating and not participating in a Path to Glory Campaign.<br/><br/>Conquest Unbound<br/><br/>The final section helps represent the vast array of battlefields and endless war that the overlords of the Mortal Realms fight across, including bespoke rules for the various, more niche type of battlefields you may come to fight, on, across, over, or indeed, under.<br/><br/>It includes three variant types of games for players to enjoy, including:<br/><br/><br/>     Siege Warfare &ndash; all too often across the Mortal Realms, warlords and conquerors look to displace inhabitants of a territory or city that they have decided should fall under their control, and often the culmination of such a campaign is a brutal, no-holds-barred siege.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Triumph and Treachery &ndash; sometimes duty calls for an all-out brawl between all of your enemies at once, and, when that happens, these rules can be used to represent battles that take place between three or more factions at the same time &ndash; all are frantically fighting to win the day against all other opponents, but will you be the one to come out on top?<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Tunnel Fighting &ndash; deadly, close-quarters combat is commonplace across the Mortal Realms as armies cluster into labyrinthine cave networks, perfidious skaven skitter through the city sewers, and mind-bending tunnels open up in the unpredictable domains of Chaos.<br/><br/><br/>The Core Book closes out with a handy, alphabetised rules index and a photocopiable Path to Glory roster, Order of Battle, and Army roster.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are 4 different types of items in this version, which are the different kinds of street performers in the marketplaces of Muscat.  The tiles representing the performers are placed in these marketplaces in such a way as to establish local dominance hierarchies, which are resolved by kicking the loser out on the street and promoting the winners to higher-class sections of Muscat.  Eventually, once can reach the Sultan's palace, and when enough performers have everyone scores points according to how high their performers have advanced up the board.<br/><br/>There is more to it than that, of course.  The performers kicked out on the street want to get their revenge, and they can be placed back on the board or used to take 3 special actions which add a great deal of complexity to the game.

Anomia X pokes a stick at the underbelly of society, and the results are decidedly NSFW!<br/><br/>Think about it - our minds are just brimming with all sorts of questionable information. While it's easy enough to think of a rum cocktail, a lubricant, or a celebrity train wreck, you'll find that your brain works a little...*differently* under pressure.<br/><br/>Anomia X is simple. Players flip category cards until the symbols on two players' cards match. Matching players race to give an example of the category on their opponent's card. Sounds easy, right? Think again. Wild Cards create unexpected matches, and even losing a card can set off a chain of cascading face-offs. Pay attention, it could be your turn at any time - and with Anomia X you never know what the cards have in store!<br/><br/>Fast-paced, brain-bending and irreverent, Anomia X promises hours of laugh-till-you-cry hilarity for you and your twisted friends.<br/><br/>",

Activating shields may sound boring but doing so could boost the mood of your crew &mdash; and thus earn you those last few victory points!<br/><br/>Space Dragons is a trick-taking-ish game that plays over seven rounds. Each round, everyone plays a single card, and the highest card played wins the current space dragon (trick).

The battles that resulted from this escalating violence left quite a mark on the imagination and history of a modern-day nation unused to armed conflict.<br/><br/>But most Quebecers today know little about what led to these events.  In the years before the rebellion, the demands for greater power for elected officials and for recognition of the Canadians' rights were at the heart of an ideological struggle between the Patriotes and a coalition loyal to the system in place under the British crown.<br/><br/>&quot;Prelude to Rebellion&quot; depicts this conflict as a card-driven game using key events from 1834 to 1837.  Each player strives to mobilize the people of the various counties of Lower Canada and rally them to his point of view.<br/><br/>Relive the history of the famous characters who shaped the province of Quebec in a strategic duel where each turn will bring plenty of unique tension and excitement!<br/><br/>",

Each turn is divided in a varying number of impulses, during which both players always have the opportunity to react to their opponent&rsquo;s moves, alternating within an extremely flexible game structure.<br/><br/>When a turn starts, each player gets a certain amount of activation points he can use to put under command his forces during impulses. These formations, single divisions or whole army corps, once activated, can move and fight, move strategically in a different sector, can be put in reserve and so on.<br/><br/>​Activation points can also be used for other operations: air cover, landings, strengthening defensive lines, recon, ULTRA, etc.<br/><br/>Artillery has a very important role in the game; it can perform various missions: bombardment, interdiction, tactical support. Aircraft perform the same kind of missions too, but with a much longer range.<br/><br/>The activation point system creates great uncertainty in the game, so every game plays out differently: players must carefully plan their strategy and constantly make fundamental decisions. It is a game of great tension and depth, where desperate counter-attacks alternate with strategic surprises; the attention of players must always be constant.<br/><br/>Other detailed rules cover: combat, breakthroughs, artillery, reserves, reinforcements, replacements, naval support, supply in mountainous terrain and flat land and, of course, victory conditions.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/><br/>The German player has obviously a chance to win the game right away if he manages to repel the US 5th Army in Salerno.<br/><br/>If the German player does not win, the game goes on, and the Allies must conquer Rome, trying to eliminate the armies of the Axis powers, in order to win. The Axis wins if the Allies do not reach their victory conditions or if, in any moment, the losses for the Allies go over a certain level. 'The Kesserling&rsquo;s Option' variant changes the game completely, giving back the initiative to the Axis player and changing the victory conditions again.<br/><br/>(description from the publisher and BGG user)<br/><br/>",

It will be an evening of stimulating conversation, quiet music, and desperate murder attempts. But this time, it's a card game.<br/><br/>Get Lucky is the card game adaptation of the classic board game Kill Doctor Lucky. Players control multiple house guests, each with some very good reason to take the old man out &mdash; but he's not called &quot;Doctor Lucky&quot; for nothing. He's more resilient than a bad habit and twice as irritating. Take heart; his famous luck won't last forever! Gather around the card table and see who can Get Lucky!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SOCCER BLAST is designed to bridge the gap between highly detailed soccer games that play in the 90-120 minute range and quick-play games which are primarily designed to generate realistic scores. PLAAY Games has taken the basic game engine from its hockey and lacrosse games, and modified it to capture the more refined nuances of classic football. The result: a sports board game that gives fans everything they love about watching soccer, captured in a 30-45 minute game window.<br/><br/>Despite the quick playing time, SOCCER BLAST provides surprising detail and the genuine sense of witnessing a full, realistic football match from start to finish. Individual players' true-to-life abilities are captured simply but realistically, using a series of easy-to-understand symbols and descriptive qualities. These individual performances synch together to create realistic team results that will make you feel like you're in the stands watching the game for real!<br/><br/>SOCCER BLAST was created in such a way as to place an emphasis on story and context. Yes, the statistics are important, and we think you'll be pleased with the numerical results. However, this game is more than just numbers. The usual assortment of drama-inducing elements and game mechanics that PLAAY Games have become known for have been built into this game as well. For example, referees can affect play--and BE affected by play. If somebody says the wrong thing to a ref, his team might have to pay for it. In SOCCER BLAST, you'll occasionally see a subjective referee call that should have gone the other way, and you'll experience that palpable sense of joy, or disgust, depending on your leaning!<br/><br/>The game offers many other features. The advantage of playing on one's home pitch is very real, but not over-stated. Injuries will play a factor, and you may be chagrined to see your star player carted off the field with the match hanging in the balance. Fatigue is a factor, too--you'll face the same challenge with late-game substitutions that a real soccer coach faces, and you'll need to plan accordingly. And, the game comes with a full complement of unusual and rare results waiting to add memorable twists to your tabletop sports archives.<br/><br/>Finally, SOCCER BLAST Pro Soccer Game allows you to rate your own teams with its &quot;How-To&quot; guide, made available at a nominal extra charge. The world is filled with soccer teams and every country has its own league or leagues. Ordinarily, this poses a problem for game companies because while many of these leagues have devoted fan followings, they're not large enough to warrant the time and energy of creating cards for them. If you have your OWN favorite team or league, you won't have to depend on PLAAY Games to make cards for you&mdash;you'll be able to make them yourself!<br/><br/>",

Successful challenges result in points for the winner and penalties for the loser.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Deal each player 5 cards (show one of 5 colors), then reveal the top Limit Card. Limit Cards specify limits (0 - unlimited) for the number of allowable cards in each of the 5 colors. Players place one of their cards face down in front of them -- these will modify the limits, adding one per card played this round. In turn order, players either challenge a previous player's play, or play card(s).<br/><br/>Challenging: may &quot;call&quot; any player's last played card. Figure out which card they played last, and count how many of those cards have been discarded. Reveal all face-down cards and add those matching that color to the limit on the Limit Card. If the total exceeds the Limit, you get +1 VP and the challenged gets -2 VP; otherwise, vice versa.<br/><br/>After resolving a Challenge, flip discard pile face down and place under draw deck WITHOUT shuffling. Players return their Limit-modifying card to hand; reveal a new Limit card and play again (player who got the -2 VP plays first).<br/><br/>Playing Card(s): place a card to the discard pile, then draw a card. OR, if you have a set of 4 matching cards, you may draw 2, then discard 2 of the matches and place the other 2 matches on top of the draw deck; take a +1 VP card bonus.<br/><br/>Game ends after all Limit cards have been played; most VP wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Casino is a fishing standard deck playing card game based on the traditional Italian game Scopa.  It is one of the few card games played with all cards in a standard 52 card deck that can be dealt out evenly to 2, 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>Play starts with four cards to each player and four cards to the table.  Each numeral card is counted as its numerical value.  The aim is to capture cards laying on the table by playing a card from hand which matches in number a table card or the sum of several table cards (for example, a 2 and an 8 can be captured by a ten).  Cards can also be stacked, called a &quot;build&quot;, to be taken next turn only if you have that card in your hand to take it later, risking their capture by another opponent (for example, a 2 and an 8 can have a 10 stacked upon it, next turn you can take the pile with another 10 and so can an opponent, capturing four cards).  Face cards are captured by the same face card.<br/><br/>Cards must be played onto the table, called &quot;trailing&quot;, if there is nothing to capture.  Picked up cards are accumulated in a pile to be counted at the end of the round.  Once all players four card hands are depleted four cards are again dealt to each player (only deal the table on the first hand of a deck).  This happens until the deck is spent.  Cards remaining on the table after the deck is spent are won by the last player to capture a card.   Scoring depends on the variant.<br/><br/>Most commonly the points total 11.  Per the rules published at pagat.com the scoring is as follows.<br/><br/>Most cards = 3 points<br/>Most spades = 1 point<br/>10 of Diamonds (&quot;Big Casino&quot;) = 2 points<br/>Deuce of Spades (&quot;Little Casino&quot;) = 1 points (also counted as a spade in Most Spades count)<br/>Each Ace = 1 point (4 points with the Ace of spades counting towards most spades).<br/><br/>A total of 11 points per deck, shuffling the deck again and starting over playing to 21.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Anathema<br/><br/><br/>",

Players invest in railway companies, which build routes and run trains, with the aim of ending the richest player.<br/><br/>18GB combines elements of 1825 and 1860 on the one hand with features of 1830 and its descendants on the other hand.  When setting up the game, the railway companies are randomly grouped into two tiers, so each play will see the map develop differently.  Players may buy up to 100% of ten-share companies and may sell any number of shares into the open market, even including the directors' certificate.  Each share sold depresses the stock price of that company, but the stock price will recover several places if the company's income is double, triple, or four times its stock price.<br/><br/>The number of railway companies scales with the number of players.  The two 2-player scenarios play quickly, while the game becomes longer and more complex with more players.<br/><br/>18GB has an unusual mix of city tiles and associated rules for upgrading them, which makes the engineering side of the game more challenging than many in the 18xx family.<br/><br/>",

The monks may move from tile to tile and in addition to building work they can also study, toil or pray. In the &lsquo;icon&rsquo; game monks can also make use of the special properties of some of the tiles.<br/><br/>The tiles vary in value ranging from 1 point field and path tiles to 5 point Chapter House and Library. The higher the value of tile the more monks are needed to build it. Players can build independently, but often they are required to work collaboratively.<br/><br/>The game spreads over two days of monastic life, with turns being allocated as time for study and toil or for services in the abbey. At each service a new abbot is elected and apart from going first in the turn the abbot also has some significant powers.<br/><br/>In order to win the game players must collect the letters of the abbey&rsquo;s motto &lsquo;Libera Nos Quaesumus Ab Omnibus Malis Amen&rsquo;. The letters become progressively more expensive and players must decide whether to buy letters or recruit extra monks.<br/><br/>Points at game end are also awarded for the &lsquo;blessings&rsquo; which players can collect throughout the game.<br/><br/>",

To become bigger, fish must eat plankton. When you move to a space where there is a fish of the same size or smaller than you, you capture it. Small fish are fast but vulnerable; they can capture small fish but can be captured by any fish, and they are the only ones that can go through shipwrecks. Medium fish can capture small and medium fish, and they can't go through shipwrecks. Big fish can capture fish of any size, and they can't go through shipwrecks.<br/><br/>On a turn, you move one of your fish two spaces or two of your fish one space each. Fish can move orthogonally, and you must resolve the action of a space before taking your second move. Move into a space with plankton, and your fish grows in size; land on a birth space, and you add a little fish from your reserve to the board. The shipwreck serves as a tunnel for small fish, and the &quot;?&quot; space makes you draw a tile, take its action, then discard it. You might rotate part of the board, put a fisherman to work, or have an unexpected birth. Race to eat five fish first!<br/><br/>",

A card display is filled with the remaining chili pepper cards, with up to three cards of the same value being placed on top of one another.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases: In the first phase, players collect chilies, taking cards from the display and placing them on their personal ingredient stack. Whoever plays the highest combination of the same cards is the first to use the display. After all the ingredients have been taken, the card display is refilled and the chili collecting continues. This phase ends when no one has cards in hand.<br/><br/>For the second phase, the previously accumulated chilies are taken into hand. In addition, a new display with sauce tasks that can be fulfilled is made available. Now the players can decide each round whether they want to collect more ingredients or use their chili-card combinations to complete a sauce task to receive chili points. The hotter the sauce, the more points you score. Depending on the number of players, the game ends as soon as someone has prepared 3-6 sauces and has no more chili cards. Whoever collects the most chili points wins.<br/><br/>",

In this game players will take turns choosing the Cactus card with the prettiest flowers they want to bring over to their collection. Before taking the card they&rsquo;ll need to indicate which side of the card they will touch, and then flip it handling only that side of the card. If the reverse is clear on that side, they can take the card and score that number of flowers. If the reverse shows a cactus full of thorns, they will lose the card.<br/><br/>As soon as someone manages to keep eight cards (or the deck runs out), players will count the number of flowers they&rsquo;ve managed to collect.

One player moves squads of Space Marine Scouts inside the guts of a Tyranid Hiveship, and the other defends the bioship by placing &quot;blips&quot; which can be Tyranid warriors and other monstrosities.<br/>The game is designed to be played as a campaign, although suggestions for playing one-off games are included. The game comes with three Space Marine Scout squads and six Tyranid Warriors.  It has rules for including several miniatures from the old WH40K Space Marine and Tyranid range. (Rules were also published in White Dwarf for using an Imperial Guard or Ork force instead of Space Marines).<br/>The game mechanics are very simple: Space Marines move and fire and then the Tyranids move and fire. The map is built gradually by the Tyranid player from a complete layout he keeps secret as the Space Marines explore the ship. The space marines explore the bioship in search of its vital organs, hoping to survive the waves of aliens as they head deeper inside.<br/><br/>",

The rest of the game the rooms are collapsing around you, and you must quickly make your way to the exit before the robot locks down, trapping you forever inside its bowels.

It was an endless source of admiration and improvement of people&rsquo;s lives.<br/>That is, until it started to go out of control. At this point no human had a detailed plan on how to fix it, or even shut it off. Due to the organic growth it had had, the original blueprints were useless, and nobody had thought of keeping logs outside of the machine&rsquo;s system. There was no guide whatsoever on how it was structured now.<br/>Your team, as designers of the core system, must dive into the bowels of the beast, find its control room, activate the off switch, and then escape before it collapses entirely around you while self-disassembling.<br/>To aid in your quest you can send your reliable android to tinker with the gears and rooms, should you get stuck, or you can activate the gears yourself to create a path amongst the chaos.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

The two teams are:<br/><br/>&bull; Sultan and Guards (Loyalists) &ndash; to win, they must eliminate all the Assassins and have no more than two Slaves still in play, or the Sultan must survive for a round after being revealed.<br/>&bull; Assassins and Slaves (Rebels) &ndash; to win, they must kill the Sultan or have three Slaves seated adjacently with their identities revealed, in which case a slave revolution brings down the Sultan.<br/><br/>The number of role cards in play equals one more than the number of players, with exactly one Sultan, as many Guards as Assassins (with at least one in play), and at least three Slaves in the mix. Zero to four neutral characters will also be in play, each unique and each with the ability to win with one team or the other. The Slave Driver, for example, wins with the Rebels if face-down when the round ends and wins with the Loyalists if face-up, while the Fortune Teller must correctly predict the winning team.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player secretly receives one role card, with one card placed face-down in the middle of the table. On a turn, a player can peek at another player's role card, switch/hide (if your role is face-down, switch cards with another player or the spare role card; if face-up, make other players hide their eyes, then secretly switch with any other face-down role card), or use a character action: Guards can detain other players, forcing them to lose their turn; Slaves try to bring about a revolution; Assassins can eliminate any player at the risk of a Guard intervening and killing them instead.<br/><br/>The neutral characters have more complex actions. The Belly Dancer, for example, neutralizes adjacent Guards, preventing them from detaining others or warding off assassination &ndash; but only if she's revealed. (If she's revealed and using her powers, she's working for a Rebel win; otherwise she can stay hidden and score if the Loyalists win.) The Vizier can force another player to reveal himself and use his special action.<br/><br/>Players on the winning team score one or two points depending on whether they were face-up &ndash; that is, working publicly for the cause &ndash; or face-down. At the end of a round, redeal all the role cards. The player with the most points after five rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

But competition is fierce, and other Strike Teams will be out to thwart you on your mission.

Models can be moved anywhere in a cube, which ensures you can make the best use of cover and obstacles to avoid the enemy, and movement takes seconds, rather than minutes. Shooting is just the same &ndash; measure the distance in cubes and, if you can see it, you can shoot it! Wargaming has never been this fast or cinematic.<br/><br/>MORE THAN 5 YEARS OF RULES DEVELOPMENT<br/><br/>Since the release of Deadzone: Second Edition in 2016, we&rsquo;ve been refining the rules to make them faster and more streamlined.

        "description": "James Ernest once again stakes out some uncharted game design territory with Diceland: Deep White Sea.  The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2&quot; per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from &quot;mere paper,&quot; the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.<br/><br/>The basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by &quot;killing&quot; your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.<br/><br/>Attacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been &quot;wounded&quot; so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.<br/><br/>A basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>List of Diceland sets and armies<br/><br/>",

Now you must find your way home across the empty vastness of space so that your MomDad can ground you for the rest of your mortal existence. Maybe you could fix the saucer, or flag down a passing spacecraft, but in the meantime you'd better make sure you don't meet any pesky Earthlings...<br/><br/>Blorg in the Midwest is a solitaire deck-builder story game in just 9 cards. Your hand contains a single location card that determines where you are, plus a card for each item you are carrying (such as your trusty memory eraser zappo gun). Each turn you may move to another location by swapping your location card for another, or obtain a new item card from those available by combining the required icons from cards in your hand. In the second part of your turn a scrolling time line determines a range of events that you must avoid or mitigate, such as meeting the farmer or his wife.<br/><br/>If you can obtain the right items you can repair your saucer, or signal a passing spacecraft. But if you are seen and reported then this sets in train a series of events leading eventually to your capture and vivisection by the FBI. So tread softly, choose your actions wisely, and above all don't get caught.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the May 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.<br/><br/>",

Three monster card piles are at the center of the table, each with a revealed card in front of it. Each monster requires a different combination of weapons or spells or both to be captured. The players, one by one, reveal cards from their piles. As soon as the cards revealed by all the players meet the requirements of one of the monsters, they must quickly place their hand on it. The first player to do so captures it and gets to score its points. If a player tries to capture a monster without all the requirements met, they get a negative point instead.<br/><br/>After each attempt to capture a monster, a new card is revealed in its place. When a pile runs out of monster cards, the game is over and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The core mechanics are based on those of Unstable Unicorns, but there are a ton of new card effects that you've never seen before.  Also, Llamas. How can you resist?<br/><br/>In the game, you'll find 4 types of characters: Llamas, Alpacas, Goats, and Rams. The goal is to get 7 animals into your field before your opponents. A task that sounds much simpler than it is.<br/><br/>There are also magic cards, instant cards and upgrade/downgrade cards.<br/><br/>Playing certain cards only affect certain types, such as if you play a &quot;Goatmeal Raisin Cookie&quot; or a &quot;Download More RAM.&quot;<br/><br/>In addition, there is a new mechanic called &quot;Herd Bonus.&quot;  If you get 3 of the same type of character in your Stable (now called a Field) at the same time, you get a Field Advantage!  Think of it like an Upgrade card, except with no Upgrade in your Stable.  Bonus effects range from extra card draw to protection to stealing from your friends.  Be sure to strategize early though- if you don&rsquo;t remember the Herd Bonus when choosing your Baby Animal, you might end up having a baaaad time!<br/><br/>Plus, each of the instant cards in the deck (equivalent to the Neighs you know) have an added bonus of allowing you to snatch up the card if it belongs to a specific type (ex. if you use the right &quot;Neigh&quot; on a Goat-type card, you can add it to your hand instead of sending it to the discard pile!)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Avant Carde, you want to build a collection of stunning cubist artwork. Each player starts with a deck of ten so-so cards: 1s and 2s in six colors that don't match and four high-value cards, each in a different color. Each player draws a hand of seven cards, then puts on the best exhibition possible by matching colors and numbers, e.g. red 11, red 1, purple 1, purple 13.<br/><br/>Each card you play earns you $1, and in turn players can buy cards from the gallery stacks: a 2 costs $2, a 3 $3, etc. Once per turn, you can bury a top card in a gallery stack on the bottom of that stack. If you don't spend all of your money and don't already have a change token, take a change token from the bank; it's worth $1 when you decide to spend it. End your turn by discarding all played cards and cards still in hand, then draw a hand of seven cards, shuffling your discard pile when necessary.<br/><br/>Six patrons numbered 2-7 are in play, and they give cards additional powers. If you played the most 2s, for example, you have an extra $1 to spend; if you played a 3, you can trash a card from your hand or played area; when you play a 4, you can change either its color or number. Avant Carde includes multiple sets of patrons, and you can use the cards from a single set or mix them.<br/><br/>Why are you building this collection? To gain awards! If you earn at least $6, you gain an award, and higher amounts net you more awards. Earning $11 is worth four awards, and while you might wonder how you can earn $11, a 7 patron lets you draw additional cards on a turn and a 5 patron lets you earn an extra $1 for each 5.<br/><br/>When the deck of awards runs out, whoever has collected the most awards wins.<br/><br/>",

The Full campaign links the individual battles.<br/><br/>This game contains five battles from the opening phase of the 1814 Campaign in France following the Battle of Nations, which was fought just half a year before at Leipzig.<br/><br/>Napoleon has just arrived at the front. At their first encounter the French surprised Bl&uuml;cher's Prussians and Russians during a snowstorm. The Battle of Brienne was a short-lived success, however, for just two days later the Prussians triumphed at La Rothi&egrave;re and wrote-off the enemy as a spent force, advancing hell-for-leather across the Marne and onto the highway to Paris. Ten days later Napoleon seized his opportunity when &quot;Marschal Vorw&auml;rts&quot; allowed his advancing columns to get dispersed and defeated in detail, in rapid succession in three short sharp combats.<br/><br/>BATTLES SIMULATED <br/>Brienne Unskilled Fury, 29-30 January. <br/>The raw conscripts under Napoleon and Ney chased the Russians and Prussians from the town.

Players may also collect and play Drebin cards to grant further offensive or defensive powers.<br/><br/>As in traditional Risk, players are attacking other players' territories with their massed troops, attempting to gain control of all of the territories on the map.

Ten cards are placed beside the first four rows in stacks of 4, 3, 2 and 1 card. On their turn, the player picks up an open card from one of the stacks next to the game board and places it in another row &mdash; always in a clockwise direction. All players whose colors are on that card (one or two) are then allowed to build a new tower or build on top of an existing tower in this particular row. Building on an open space is free, while building on top of somebody else's tower costs as many ducats as the number of &quot;floors&quot; already built. A player can decide to trigger a general round of scoring simply by moving the last card of any stack. High towers are a good way to claim a large, connected territory and collect a lot of ducats.<br/><br/>",

The game is said to have taught the emperor and his court to temper their influence and power with caution.<br/><br/>The goal is to be the first player to push seven points worth of your opponent&rsquo;s game pieces off the board. Each player begins the game with eight game pieces shaped to look like one-, two- and three-story Japanese buildings. The number of stories a piece has equals the number of spaces it can move, the maximum number of other pieces it can push and the number of points it is worth if pushed off the board.

        "description": "GD '40 - The Battle for Stonne, France 1940, is game 5 in the Tactical Combat Series by The Gamers and covers the battle for Stonne, France in 1940. It is the first in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II.<br/><br/>The German breakthrough at Sedan opened the way for Guderian&rsquo;s dash to the English Channel. What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash. It is not an understatement to say that had the French significantly threatened the Sedan bridgehead, the 1940 campaign could have developed quite differently. The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD&rsquo;40, players have the chance to change history. A successful French player may cause OKW to put the brakes on Guderian&rsquo;s advance, which could give the French army time to react to the surprise German blow at Sedan. Failure will allow history to take its course&mdash;one of the most decisive victories of modern time. GD&rsquo;40 is the first in a series of TCS games which will portray the Grossdeutschland throughout the war&mdash;from an infantry regiment in 1940 to a Panzer Corps in 1945. (Note: Just so that no one continues any misconceptions...the Grossdeutschland was a German Army unit; it was not in the Waffen SS.)<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 20 minutes<br/>Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters<br/>Units: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color maps<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 28-page TCS version 3.0 system rulebook<br/>One 8-page Grossdeutschland, 1940 specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-page TCS version 3.0 Charts &amp; Tables folders<br/>Four Player Aid cards<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 6-20 hours<br/><br/>",

A Japanese force composed of the 228th Regiment of the 38th Division of the IJA and the 1st Kure Special Naval Landing Force occupied the island against a force composed of the Dutch Molukken Brigade and the Australian &quot;Gull Force&quot;.<br/><br/>One player controls Japanese forces and the other one Allied (Dutch and Australian) forces. Victory is achieved by means of control of certain hexes and elimination of enemy units. The aim of the Japanese player is to conquer as soon as possible the three main key locations in Ambon (the city of Ambon, Paso, and the Laha airfield) as well as some secondary key locations. The sooner the Japanese conquers these locations, the more victory points he will receive. So, for the Japanese it's a race against the clock, while the Allied player must slow down the Japanese advance without suffering too many losses.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A description by Phalanx's Uli Blennemann from &quot;Gone Cardboard&quot;<br/><br/>It is a completely new game, much lighter in complexity. The game uses a large gameboard, comes in our big box and is for 2-5 players. Playing time is 75+ minutes. It is not a simulation game but provides more Alex flavor than Alexandros. Each turn, players move with their armies (wooden) and build cities and temples (both wooden, too).<br/><br/>In this game, players follow the path of Alexander's army, occupying provinces in regions, building temples, founding cities. You score points each round and also at the end of the game for majorities. There are 5 regions, but for the short game you just use #2 to #4.<br/><br/>Players have 15 tiny wood cubes which they distribute each round on a hidden plan in 4 ways. Then they reveal their choices and carry out the actions. This way they decide 1. turn order 2. army size 3. temple building 4. city building. By putting more cubes than others in the sections controls how the round works for you.<br/><br/>So the player with the most cubes in 1. gets to choose their turn order (since going later may be better). Then the cubes in 2. become your army on the board (and having majorities in provinces scores 2 pts). Moving the armies around costs cubes as well, which are taken from 3. and 4. Then, where your soldiers are, you can build temples (3.) or found cities (4.). But if another player is also doing the same, whoever has the most cubes on their plan gets it, but pays 1 more than the second highest.<br/><br/>In this way, players spend their 15 cubes each round, moving from province to province in the region, trying to score points for controlling armies, building temples and cities. Where players directly compete, the costs are high. Where you are unopposed, your unspent cubes carry on to the next round, allowing you to try to get more points.<br/><br/>When the last region is conquered, there is a final scoring, for the majorities of temples and cities in each region and then in the whole game. The scoring switches here, since in the rounds temples earn you 3pts &amp; cities earn 5pts. But at game end, cities earn 10pts and temples earn 15pts.<br/><br/>The game is a mix of planning, bluff, tactics and group think. It works as a contest of majorities and the use of the cubes, in both deciding who goes and what things cost, is clever.<br/><br/>",

Each subsequent comic book acts as an expansion pack, continuing the game's epic story, whilst introducing new miniatures, game mechanics &amp; environments along the way.<br/><br/>Players take control of one of 4 main protaganists, completing chapters &amp; gaining vital experience points, with which they must upgrade their character if they are to have any hope of surviving the increasingly nightmarish scenarios.<br/><br/>In addition to the game's co-operative comic book campaign, the quick-play &quot;Director Mode&quot; allows one player to connect with their devious side, using director cards to stack the odds in favour of the infected hordes!<br/><br/>Although there are multiple ways in which Z War One can be played, the real heart of the game lies in it's 1-4 player co-operative comic book campaign. The Season One 6 issue campaign is made up of 26 exciting chapters, with the climax of each chapter taking place on the game board. The cinematic mood created by the comic carries through directly into the game play, as time limits &amp; set pieces drive the story forward at a breakneck pace. The missions themselves, whilst working from the same core set of game mechanics, vary widely in tone, from exploration &amp; tense survival horror to all-out pitched battles and daring escapes.<br/><br/>Whilst the co-operative campaign is by no means easy, for more experienced players, there is the &quot;Directors Cut&quot; which adds game play elements from the quick play &quot;Director Mode&quot; to the campaign, essentially allowing a 5th player to participate and make life hell for the heroes.<br/><br/>",

Outwit your opponents during a presidential primary election by traveling the country, hosting rallies and fundraisers, advertising, and gaining the favor of powerful Super PACs. Regions across the country will vote during the eleven rounds of the game and you will have to predict your opponents&rsquo; strategies in order to earn the most delegates and win the game! Good luck, candidates!<br/><br/>How To Play<br/><br/>The Primary is played over 11 rounds, each with 4 phases: News, Action, Vote, and Organize.<br/><br/>In the News phase, 1 News card is drawn and its effect is applied to the current round. You may be forced to move, get an extra action, or gain influence, etc - be prepared to adjust your strategy!<br/><br/>In the Action phase, players select 4 Action cards from their hand and commit them face down in a queue. Will your opponents try to swoop in and steal an election? Will they go all-out in an attempt to win over the Super PAC? Choose wisely!<br/><br/>Once all players have committed their 4 Action cards, they take turns executing their actions one card at a time. Bus and Plane cards provide some flexibility and the Positive Ad / Negative Ad cards can be used anywhere!<br/><br/>During the Vote phase, 1 or more regions may vote (or none at all - a nice break from the stress of campaigning.) The player with the most influence in the regions voting wins delegates, getting one step closer to victory!<br/><br/>The player with the most delegates at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It was a place just outside the realm of man, off to the west, where there was no illness or death or time, but only happiness and beauty.<br/><br/>The golden path to T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g is open once more, and the greatest Celtic storytellers have gathered for a once-in-a-lifetime journey.

Over time those stories will become a saga &mdash; and the most epic saga will live on forever.<br/><br/>Journey to the Otherworld in T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g by placing storytellers between story cards in the shared grid. When all storytellers have been placed, in reverse player order draft cards and add them to your hand. From your hand, you'll then add cards to your personal tableau: one card to hand, one card played. At the end of five rounds, score each row according to the rules on its corresponding goal card, and earn points for having the most connected story cards of each color.

        "description": "When you signed on as storyboard editors, you never expected a mess like this. Panels all out of order, some missing entirely, and you're not even allowed to talk on the job? You're pretty sure that's not what &quot;silent film&quot; means. Somehow, you'll need to rework all this into a movie that makes sense. But with the animation budget quickly running out, there's little room for error...<br/><br/>The cameras are rolling on our newest blockbuster: Moving Pictures! This cooperative game for 2 players was designed by Chris Klimowski and is sure to be a big hit.<br/><br/>In Moving Pictures players take turns placing numbered scene cards from their hand into the shared Timeline row in hopes of getting all 6 cards in order. The catch? They can't speak or signal to each other, so they'll have to watch each other's play closely for clues. Each card also has an effect listed which can impact placement, swap cards around, or even allow players a rare opportunity to share information.<br/><br/>Getting it right once is a feat in itself but a full game of Moving Pictures is played over 3 Acts. The Timeline grows with each Act, making each round harder than the one before. Thankfully you also have access to 2 Deleted Scenes: if the round would end with scenes out of order, you can spend a Deleted Scene to hide one card. These Deleted Scenes don&rsquo;t refresh, meaning that you only get 2 mistakes before the credits roll.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Drive on Paris, is a game simulating the first 100 days of fighting on the Western Front during World War I.<br/><br/>The mobile campaign of 1914 in the west was the result of more than a generation of staff planning on both sides. The German General Staff had prepared the Schlieffen Master Plan of a giant right hook into France which its namesake had hoped would result in a Cannae-like battle of annihilation of France. The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.<br/><br/>Both plans failed.<br/><br/>Drive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds. Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.<br/><br/>Both side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.<br/><br/>This system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual &quot;one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it&quot;. Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to &quot;win&quot; ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).<br/><br/>Drive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series. These games are designed to be easy enough for novice players, yet meaty enough to retain the interest of veterans. It violates two principals of game design at the same time: Easy games are dumb, and the converse that interesting games are hard. The SCS challenges these bogus assertions...and has successfully done so for eight years now.<br/><br/>Part of the Standard Combat Series by The Gamers.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1/2 week<br/>Hex: 6.2 miles / 10 Km<br/>Units: Brigades to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheet (420 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook<br/>One 24-page Drive on Paris specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-12 hours<br/><br/>",

A Sun token is placed next to a Roof and will score the Roof's owner points for each Shadow placed on the other side.  The Shadows score points for the Roof's owner, and can be scored multiple times if surrounded by multiple Roof/Sun combinations.  Each turn, a player places three pieces in any combination, but must score at least one point per turn.

        "description": "Description <br/>In the new game Eaten By Zombies! players strive to survive as the horde of the living dead make it their goal in Death to force you to join the crowd. You must work with or against the other survivors to be the last one standing.  No not standing, cowering in the corner crying for their mommy.<br/><br/>In the spirit of AMC's &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, Eaten By Zombies takes you into a dark world of eventual death. Every turn you must venture out from your safehouse and scavenge for Swag. But not so fast, the Undead have other plans for your brains. Every day a Horde of fresh zombies will be waiting for you, and over time the threat gets greater. Now it's time for your &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; instincts to help you to survive just one more day. Using the swag you've got on you (ie cards in you hand) you must survive any way you can.<br/><br/>If you can get away or kill the Horde, you may scavenge the remains of the desolate suburbs for any Swag the neighbors may have left behind.   With the right stuff and a few good friends to out run, you may just make it through this alive... well, no probably not.  But being the last one to die a slow, painful death means you can claim sole victory!<br/><br/>With a set of over thirty different cards to start with, no two games will ever be alike. This game is a combination of Card Drafting, Hand Management and Survival Horror with a few dirty tricks thrown in.<br/><br/>Game Play/Mechanics <br/>You start with five heavy sticks (each worth +1 fight) and five hide cards (each +1 flee) as well as two sandwiches (+1 Flee &amp; Draw one card).  You shuffle these 12 cards and draw 6 into your hand.  You then face one of the 25 zombies from the Zombie Deck with a fight value ranging from 1-8 and a flee value of 1-4.  You must announce Fight or Flee and then proceed to play some/all of your 6 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>If you successfully fight/flee you then take the total fight/flee value to the scavenging portion of your turn (think of it as a &quot;buy&quot;) where you acquire items such as Shotguns, fists full of ammo, crowbar, binoculars, fire on a stick, grandma pantry, deadeye or other cards which you then put INTO YOUR HAND for use in the very next turn and draw back up to 6 cards from your draw deck.  Played cards go to your discard pile, including any zombies you have succeeded in killing.<br/><br/>If you flee then the zombie card goes to the zombie discard pile.  As you draw zombies into your hand (from shuffling your discard pile) you are stuck with them in your hand forever unless you play them into the zombie horde attacking on another player's turn, so the zombie horde gets tougher over time.<br/><br/>If you are unsuccessful in killing/fleeing then you must lose a number of cards equal to the flee value of the horde.  These lost cards come from either your hand or as a blind draw off the top of your draw pile and go back to the scavenging area, weakening you.  If you run out of cards you succumb to your wounds and become a zombie, now trying to kill the other players on each turn.<br/><br/>If a player ever ends up with six zombie cards in his/her hand the zombie players win as the remaining players have gone insane.  Each time the zombie deck is gone through and reshuffled you add one more zombie to the horde for the rest of the game, making perpetual survival impossible.<br/><br/>It isn't a matter of if you're going to die but when.  Be the last player standing and win.  If at any time the entire zombie deck is depleted (because the players have killed all of them rather than using flee), all remaining players alive win together.<br/><br/>This is a unique cooperative/competitive game where you really feel the tension and inevitability of doom.  You spend the first few turns building up your deck only to see the zombies increase in power and slowly drain your will to live as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Eaten By Zombies!: In Cahoots<br/><br/><br/>",

The game board is a 4x4 grid, with a stack of three mosquito tokens placed at the nine internal intersections of this grid.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player moves either their toucan or chameleon. To move the chameleon, you first eat one of the mosquitoes sitting on a corner of its current space, then move it one square orthogonally. To move the toucan, you move it diagonally from one square to another, eating the top mosquito that you pass over; the toucan can move more than one space in a single movement, but you must be able to eat from each corner space that you cross. If you cannot feed one of your animals, then you can't move it. If you can't feed either of them, then you lose the game.<br/><br/>If you eat nine yellow mosquitoes, you win the game instantly. The game also has mosquitoes of other colors that have special powers: move one mosquito, move one of your animals, force the opponent to play with a particular animal, etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WestFront details the conflict between the Allies and  Germany during WWII between 1943-45. Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to try and break the other sides lines. Additional rules are included for amphibious invasions. Several scenarios cover every major point of the war. The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Western Europe and Italy printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is one section of the complete EuroFront series that covers the entire European conflict of WWII.<br/><br/>This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    WestFront II: The War in Europe 1943-45 – Second Edition<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "RONE: Races of New Era is a strategic post-apocalyptic card game for 2 or 4 players. Players are immersed in a dark world full of destruction and suffering, a world where people are fighting to take back their place after a global nuclear war annihilated all achievements of the human race and all that was left was only a handful of usable resources. The remaining scattered groups of survivors are fighting amongst themselves for dominance over the remnants of the past. Now it is your turn to join the global war and recruit soldiers, battle machines, powerful hybrids, or tremendous mutants into your army. Equip your troops with the best available technologies and show all your enemies who is the ruler of the new order.<br/><br/>Players are represented in the game by their hero and play units or one-time effects (tactics) in an attempt to destroy all cards from the opponent&rsquo;s deck. The number of cards in the deck and the player&rsquo;s hand is connected to the number of health points of the player's hero. For each point of damage that the hero receives, the player has to destroy one of their cards &ndash; from the top of their deck or from their hand. Once a player loses all cards from their deck and hand they lose the game. Because each card used by a player during the game costs them a life point, players are forced to play cards as efficiently as possible so that each played card does more damage to the enemy than to themselves.<br/><br/>These combined mechanics create a well-balanced system where every erroneous move or unplanned action can lead to a player&rsquo;s defeat. Each and every decision is tightly coupled, and even a small decision can completely change the course of the game.<br/><br/>Players have to find a balance between investing in game control, which allows them to play cards more effectively, or investing in killing the enemy hero, which is the primary goal. This means that players should control their damage output wisely. One can easily feed the enemy graveyard with destroyed cards, which may turn the game completely against them - because of the recycling system which allows players to put cards from the graveyard back on the battlefield. So, instead of dealing massive amounts of damage directly to the enemy hero, waiting sometimes has its benefits.<br/><br/>Timing of attacks, card activation, graveyard management and tactical decisions are the real keys to victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Grasshopper &amp; the Ant is the fourth title in Purple Brain Games' &quot;Tales &amp; Games&quot; series, each of which comes packaged in a book-shaped box. In this game, players take turns playing the part of the industrious ants and the grasshopper content to sponge off the labor of the ants.<br/><br/>The Grasshopper &amp; the Ant includes two ways to play, but the heart of both is the same. At the start of the game, lay out 16 (of the 48) path cards in a 4x4 grid; each path card shows one of four types of landscapes. The ant player places six ants on these cards, one ant per card, with the ants forming a chain (as in real life), then secretly chooses one type of terrain on which at least one ant stands. The grasshopper player then stands with one of the ants, and if the grasshopper chose the same landscape as the ant player, the grasshopper takes all the path cards of this type on which an ant stands; if the grasshopper chose incorrectly, then the ant player takes these path cards. Either way, you then refill the 4x4 grid. The ant player keeps playing until she finally wins path cards, then the next player in clockwise order controls the ants. (In winter mode, the third and fourth players control red ants and receive a random path card if they match the choice of the ant player.)<br/><br/>In autumn mode, players score path cards immediately, with each type being tracked independently; path cards that feature insects are saved for a endgame bonus. As soon as a player maxes out two scoring tracks, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>In winter mode, players keep the path cards they collect in order to buy provision cards (worth one victory point), which cost particular combinations of path types. In this mode, when you win a path card that features an insect, you can claim another card in the grid that features the same insect. Collect both provision cards of the same type, and you score a bonus VP. The first player to collect 4 VPs wins.<br/><br/>",

This time you will be the inventor, who creates, patents and introduces these inventions to the markets and the world!  In the late 19th and early 20th century, these inventions were all made in a certain order. In Era of Inventions, however, you&rsquo;re the one who determines the order of the inventions. Race your competitors to invent as much as possible, or to speed through the production process.  But don&rsquo;t forget to register your patents.  Otherwise you may lose influence in the industry.<br/><br/>GAME OVERVIEW<br/>Era of inventions is played over 8, 9 or 10 rounds &ndash;depending on the number of players&ndash;. In each round players attempt, by using action tokens, to use the following actions at the wisest, such as: building factories, buying or producing goods, and making and producing new inventions. The number of action tokens is limited however(the time is short), and thus you must choose the best of many actions, given your situation. The player who uses his actions, money, goods and development points at the best will earn the most influence in the Era of Inventions and win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Moon Base is a two-player abstract game set on the moon, proceeding over six rounds. The player replenishes the 'Ring Module' at each round, and builds the moon base while placing and stacking on the crater. The player uses their three-color ring well to advance their color. At the end of each round, it will be a point to construct a 'residential zone' and 'resource facility', but while aiming to move the 'mobile research building' effectively, players will also aim for bonus points that can be earned at the end of the sixth round . Finally, the player with many total points wins.<br/><br/>Game Abstract <br/>Moon Base is a 2 player abstract game about Moon Development. There Are 6 Rounds. Each round, players choose a set number of ring modules to place on the craters, or place on top of each other to develop the Moon Base. Using the three different colors of the rings, players try to build in a way that their colors will gain the upper hand. At the end of each round whoever has the highest total points wins the game with the highest points by gaining bonus points at the end.<br/><br/>5 Features of Moon Base<br/><br/>＜Feature 1＞ Unique Game Board<br/><br/>The impressive craters on the lunar board are the squares of this game. Craters overlap, so if you put a ring in one crater, the other one overlapping it also gets eliminated, and vice versa if you put a ring on the other. Depending on which crater you are placing a ring on, the situation on the board changes and affects your game plan. First come, first served, so if you really care about placing your ring on a specific crater, make sure you do it earlier than your opponent!<br/><br/>＜Feature 2＞ A 3D Stacking Game<br/><br/>The ring modules that make up Moon Base can be stacked to 2 or 3 layers, and the position where they are placed impacts the subsequent turns. It&rsquo;s a strategic game, and there are aspects of analog games mixed into it. Regret joyously. &ldquo;I should have put this ring a little more inside!&rdquo;<br/><br/>＜Feature 3＞ Random Setup<br/><br/>Although it is an abstract game, the ring modules are prepared randomly. But once the game starts, you must rely solely on your choices and decisions. All ring modules are disclosed, so make your best judgment on which ring to choose. Have future rounds in mind, read your opponent&rsquo;s prospective moves in the next round, and change randomness into certainty.<br/><br/>＜Feature 4＞ A game that gets more exciting towards the end<br/><br/>Players alternate with each player having 4 turns across 6 rounds = 24 hands (placing 1 ring each turn). Bonus points can be earned depending on the situation at the final round, so the battle will get more competitive towards the end. Each player aims to find an unexpected move to turn the game around.<br/><br/>＜Feature 5＞ Think about the future on the completed lunar base<br/><br/>The game ends when the moon base is complete. The spectacular sight on the board that was created at the end of the competition is a collaborative work you&rsquo;ve created together with your opponent. After the game, take a moment to look up at the moon in the night sky and think about what we might expect in the future.<br/><br/>",

The multiple stages of the wonder must be built from the ground up, while the buildings may be built in any order. Players have four worker meeples and a personal supply of resources, and a general supply of resources also exists. The resource supply bag moves from player to player to indicate who is the active player.<br/><br/>On a turn, you take one of four actions. You may draw three cubes from the cloth supply bag, then add two to your personal supply, placing the other one in the general supply. You may take all resources of one type from the general supply. (You may hold only eight resources at a time in your supply, so if after drawing or taking you have more than eight resources, you must return some to the general supply.) You may build a level of the wonder or a building by paying its resource cost from your supply; your workers mark individual buildings as you build them, unlocking abilities. Finally, you may sell pairs of matching goods to the supply in exchange for coins. Coins can be used as a wild resource, but they also appear in the cost of some wonders. Resources sold or used to build are returned to the supply bag.<br/><br/>In games of four or more players, players may also trade. Trading occurs off-turn, that is, it can involve anyone except the active player. You may negotiate and trade freely with other players, but you must stop negotiating once you receive the supply bag and become the active player. The longer you spend on your turn, the more opportunity your opponents have to make deals.<br/><br/>The first player to complete their wonder wins!<br/><br/>",

To succeed, сity leaders awakened the forces of nature and called the golems to help them in the construction. Each player controls his city and tries to construct lots of beautiful soaring towers and get the prestige points.<br/><br/>In this game time matters: you can perform the construction of the building quickly, but then pay more resources for it. There is an original gear-clock, which will determine the cost of adding new building to your city in the sky.<br/><br/>The player's turn consists of two phases: building completion phase, when you will place the building on your pad, and worker-placement phase when you send a golem on the construction site.<br/><br/>Every building on your island is very important! Every time you build something, you may activate some cards, which have been built earlier. So, step by step, you build your own engine of the game.<br/><br/>The player needs to plan the city development very strategically: the value of your buildings, the influence of the guilds and the time of every your action are important to come to victory. <br/>It&rsquo;s time to build!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Somme 1918 is the second game in a series that covers all of the offensives on the Western Front in 1918 and the Sequel to Marne 1918: Friedensturm.<br/><br/>Somme 18 is different from Marne 1918 because it covers only one battle, Operation Michael, while Marne 1918 simulated a series of offensives, from Blucher to Friedensturm. The result is a more intense and nerve-wracking game that takes place over eight turns (from the end of March to mid-April), at least half of which are composed of three operational phases. Both players will face difficult challenges. The German player needs to re-create the historic breakthrough and has to put in every effort to reach Amiens. The Allied player has to resist succumbing to panic in the first turns in order to organize an effective defense, and then a counter-attack near the end of the game.<br/><br/>While the basic rules in Somme 18 are identical to those in Marne 1918 (with the exception of the air rules, which have been completely revised), the advanced rules will be very different. The principal reason is the length of Operation Michael, about fifteen days, which does not give an opportunity for the campaign management rules of Marne 1918 to be used.<br/><br/>So, all of the unit management tracks have disappeared and have been replaced by one table that manages the replacement and re-construction of units. Strategic movement has also been greatly simplified and adapted to the tempo of the game.<br/><br/>Somme 1918 will of course be enriched by numerous specific rules, simulating the particularities of this battle.<br/><br/><br/>     Petain&rsquo;s Reticence: Simulates the French command&rsquo;s lack of urgency in supporting their British allies.<br/>     The arrival of French reinforcements without their artillery support, allowing a quicker deployment of troops coupled with a reduction in their value.<br/>     Inter-Allied Cooperation: This will be extremely reduced at the beginning of the campaign.<br/>     Evolution of the use of Stoss: The doctrine of using assault troops had been principally introduced by General von Hutier, in Russia and Italy. At the beginning of Operation Michael, the generals commanding the Second and Seventeenth armies used their Stosstruppen in frontal assaults, wasting these elite forces and provoking fury from Ludendorff. A rule thus simulates the evolution of this doctrine.<br/>     The Doullens Conference: At the height of the German offensive, while the French Army under Petain prepared to cut its ties with the British, Haig accepted that he be placed under the command of Foch, finally creating an inter-Allied command. This rule simulates this conference, tied to German conquests. It also plays a part in obtaining victory points. In fact, this rule is really the heart of the game and we think that players will be pleased with the proposed system that will bring together the different parameters of this game.<br/><br/><br/>&bull; Boxed game<br/>&bull; 1 A1 single-sided maps<br/>&bull; About 560 counters<br/>&bull; 24 pages rules booklet in english<br/>&bull; 2 player aids in english<br/>&bull; Introductory historical booklet with design notes<br/>&bull; 4 dice<br/><br/>(from Nuts Publishing website)<br/><br/>",

At the start of each round, players receive a secret card informing them of the group's location &mdash; one of twenty unique DC locations, including Arkham Asylum, the Daily Planet, the Hall of Justice, and S.T.A.R. Labs &mdash; except for one player who receives the Joker card instead. The Joker doesn't know where he is, but if he can figure out his location before his cover is blown, he wins the round!<br/><br/>DC Spyfall includes a few twists on the Spyfall formula. Since Harley Quinn usually follows wherever the Joker goes, each round, one player may receive a location card with a Harley image; if they do, they try to feed the Joker player information about the location, even if they don't know that player&rsquo;s identity! If the Joker player guesses the location, the two collaborators each score points &mdash; unless the superheroes can turn the tables on them and determine who Harley is.<br/><br/>The game includes two multiverse decks that contain eight different locations instead of only one, so players will be confused with some of the questions and answers. Keep in mind that no one at the table knows whether or not they are playing with a multiverse deck. An all-Joker deck gives each player a Joker card, which means that all questions and answers will be based on nothing more than whatever players collectively believe. As with the multiverse decks, you won't know you're playing with this deck until someone figures it out.<br/><br/>Super power cards can give a player an ability for a round, such as being able to dodge a question, or require a player to modify their behavior; for example, Super Speed forces a player to answer a question in three words or less.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FIEF: France is a game of dynastic ambition in which players assume the roles of nobles in the 15th century kingdom of France. Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fiefs and Bishoprics. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery, and deception!<br/><br/>FIEF is a classic game and this edition includes a new board (FIEF France: Gameboard)!<br/><br/>The game board represents the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre. Bishoprics include several different Fiefs' villages.<br/><br/>Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.<br/><br/>In FIEF France edition, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl, or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, they gain 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!<br/><br/>You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to attain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies by some other foul means!<br/><br/>In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot;, and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly affect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprising&quot;!<br/><br/>Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.<br/><br/>Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men-at-Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Archers and Bombards. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men-at-Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Going down the Great River, explore the banks to rescue contaminated Humans, to hire Ymune Doctors to treat them, or Ymune Protectors to protect the boat from the banes to come. Try also to collect Batteries to activate the Machine rooms of your boat, or Food to feed the new healthy Humans&hellip;<br/><br/>In Precognition, you must truly see the future to win the game. That comes from understanding a new card mechanism: the Dual Select System. In addition to being innovative, the Dual Select System fits perfectly with the theme because, among the two cards that you will let pass, one of them will come back to you on the next turn. You have 12 turns to make the right choices.<br/><br/>Your goal is to have the most Healthy Humans at the end of the game. To keep the Humans you take in while working your way downstream, you will need Food, Doctors to treat them and Protectors to fight the Banes you&rsquo;ll encounter. Good luck!<br/><br/>The game is played over 12 rounds. A round consists of 3 distinct phases. Each phase must be done by all the players at the same time.<br/>I &ndash; Decision phase (secret): draw and choose cards according to the Dual Select System.<br/>II &ndash; Action phase: Activate your cards to earn resources. If any of your powered machines can be used, benefit from its effects.<br/>III &ndash; Maintenance phase : manage your Banes if you have suffer any, heal all possible contaminated Humans and move forward on the Great River from which you reveal and apply the event of the River tile.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, move forward by flipping over the River tile in front of the Progress pawn to discover the end-of-turn event. Each player applies that event&rsquo;s effect. Every three rounds, it is the end of a season and it is when you feed the new healed Humans. Make sure you have enough food for everyone.<br/><br/>At the end of the third season, after feeding the Healthy Humans you have saved, count them. The player with the most Healthy Humans wins the game. If tied, the player with the most Healthy Humans and Contaminated Humans wins the game. If players are still tied, they share the victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Bot battling is all the rage, and Gekido: Bot Battles gives 2-4 players the chance to enter the arena and face off in 30-minute fights. Each round, the bots lock onto a target, then roll dice to execute attacks. Through cunning moves and swift strikes, players can activate secret powers in the arena and eliminate the competition. The last bot standing takes home the electric glory!<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Description of the first edition:<br/><br/>For a long time the Lord of Gems &mdash; Jikan, the mightiest dragon of all &mdash; feared that another dragon could take his place as the most powerful dragon. Soon he realized that only his sons could compete with him, so Jikan swallowed them. For many years Jikan lived happily as the king, eating whole worlds for breakfast. But one day, during a heartburn crisis, he saw that his sons were battling in his stomach. The first one to win and escape the belly of Jikan will be the next Lord of Gems!<br/><br/>Gekido is a dice game in which each player controls a dragon, trying to beat other players by knocking their life dices from 6 points to zero. At each round, players rolls six 6 sided dice and try to score one of many combinations showed in his character sheet (pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, etc), but watch out! If you fail on your gamble attempt you can hurt yourself instead of the enemy! As the battle gets more fierce, however, players would unlock new powers: when one of your life dices is reduced to zero, you gain new special abilities! The player who remains in play, knocking all opponent's life dices, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Stardrill has acquired the mining rights to Saturn&rsquo;s largest moon &ndash; Titan - and is sending in a team to strip it of its resources.<br/><br/>Your task is to fill the hold of your ship with as many units of valuable resources from Titan as possible, in order to earn the most Credits by the end of the game.<br/><br/>To help its teams with their task, Stardrill has supplied a number of Extraction Plants - buildings which can be placed anywhere on the map. These extraction plants will allow you to obtain different types of resources. As you&rsquo;re all employees of Stardrill, once placed these buildings can be accessed and used by any player!<br/><br/>Place pipes branching out from your main base to create the extraction network that will bring resources into the hold of your cargo ship. Each time you integrate an extraction plant into your network by joining a section of pipe to it, it activates, gaining you a unit of the resource of the building&rsquo;s type.<br/><br/>Once obtained, these resources will have to be managed carefully, as you only have a limited amount of space in your hold! When full, no more resources can be added without spending or jettisoning others first. <br/>Some resources have value during the game and can be spent to free up space in your hold, while others can only score points at the end of the game - so you&rsquo;ll need to keep an eye on the space you have, and time your activations carefully.<br/><br/>There are 6 resources available on Titan: Deuterium, Hydrocarbons, Silicium, Titanium, Water, and Tholin.<br/><br/>However, not all of these resources are desirable. Titan hosts large quantities of Tholin, an organic substance which could potentially cause you to lose Credits at the end of your mission. Picking some of it up is impossible to avoid as you dig deeper into the centre of Titan, but don&rsquo;t let it get out of control &ndash; as well as losing you Credits, if you take Tholins into your hold when it is already full, some of your precious cargo will be contaminated!<br/><br/>Stardrill has also supplied you with a team of trusty drones that will lend you on claw on your mission. As well as transporting valuable resources and moving Tholins away from your network, Drones can dock to an Extraction Plant to increase its yield or make it less costly to upgrade. These handy machines can also use Titanium to destroy pipe sections, either in another players network, or even your own!<br/><br/>Earn Credits during the game by placing and upgrading Extraction plants, completing Stardrill&rsquo;s special Objectives, and fulfilling Planetary Orders.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll score Credits depending on the contents of your hold! The more Deuterium you have, the better, as long as it hasn&rsquo;t been contaminated&hellip;<br/><br/>The Employee with the most Credits at the end of the game becomes Stardrill Employee of the Month!<br/><br/>",

Take on smaller missions to earn creds. Then, put those right back into more experienced runners, and better gear. Once you think you've got what it takes, send your runners out to attempt to collect one final score. If you fail, don't worry, your doc-wagon contracts will keep your runners in the game.

The strengths and weaknesses of the German and Russian units involved are accurately and playably duplicated by forty-nine data cards that display all information needed to move and fight. The system easily incorporates myriad details such as armor thicknesses at various points, shots from various angles, heights, and altitudes, and the effects of terrain. The rules cover the important aspects of small unit tactics - armor piercing shots, small arms fire, artillery barrages, air support, communications, gun depression, mines, roadblocks, barbed wire, smoke, and much more. The scenarios cover a variety of combat situations that are resolved on the three piece geomorphic mapboard, which also features movable terrain pieces. The types of units include counters for infantry, anti-tanks guns, Panthers, Tigers, STG IIIs, Hetzers, T-34s, Stalins, SU-100s, SU-152, and much, much more.<br/><br/>",

It was reprinted by Mike in 1978 as &quot;Warlord&quot; and came in a blue box.  It was released by Games Workshop in 1980 in a smaller version (only western half of the Warlord board) as &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.<br/><br/>As of October 2012, the game is now available again as Classic Warlord, a limited edition in a gold box, with two sets of rules and an FAQ booklet, counters in pouches for up to seven players and a single large D6, along with the full eight-section mapboard. This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.<br/><br/>Objective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.<br/><br/>Mechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.<br/><br/>Gaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.<br/><br/>Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).<br/><br/>A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.  These can be placed to act as deterrents against other players, and can be launched to clear enemy territory prior to an advance.  Nuclear damage however will render map spaces impassable for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>",

With that much power, it is inevitable that he will destroy the mighty Kingdom and undoubtedly everyone in it. The King is looking for brave leaders to recruit heroes, gain power within the guilds, and race through the dungeon to destroy Blasphemy. Will you adventure through the realms?<br/><br/>Adventure Realms is a worker placement and deck building game in which you will recruit new heroes, gain power within the guilds, and race through the dungeon. Gain powerful elemental stones to enhance certain items and heroes and gain extra end game victory points. You can also complete quests by meeting certain requirements. Stuck in lower levels of the dungeon? No worries, just play some devastating magic cards to gain the lead in the dungeon.<br/><br/>Adventure Realms is completely done in beautiful 16-bit graphics by FinalBossBlues and graphically designed by Pete Jank. It is reminiscent to the old school Super Nintendo games such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they will play 1 of their hero cards and place an agent into an Agent Space. These spaces will gain you specific rewards. On top of that, the hero card you played will also give you specific resources or abilities for that turn.<br/><br/>The objective of Adventure Realms is to gain Journey Flags to race through the dungeon. Once everyone has passed on their turns, players will enter the dungeon phase in which magic cards can be played to boost your levels in the dungeon. The player who had traveled through the dungeon the furthest will gain the first player rewards. The game will continue like this until a player has gained 10 victory points or until the dungeon deck has run out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "December 1757: Not since losing Silesia in 1742 had Austria come so close to regaining the province. With the recent Imperial victory at Breslau (November 22) Austrian forces under Prince Charles of Lorraine and Field-marshal Daun, the victor at Kolin, were only a battle away from that goal. They expected to fight this battle in the new campaign year which would begin in the coming spring.<br/><br/>For King Frederick II the loss of Silesia would not only be a devastating blow to his prestige but deprived of its resources, revenue and manpower Prussia's ability to continue the war would be desperately compromised. Rather than to allow the enemy to go unchallenged Frederick marched his remaining army of 40,000 men composed of Rossbach veterans and Breslau survivors against Charles' nearly 60,000-strong force of Austrians, Hungarians, Imperials, Bavarians and Wurttembergers.<br/><br/>On a frigid December 5th, in a season when armies usually sought the comfort of winter quarters, the opposing forces met on the snow covered fields surrounding the Silesian village of Leuthen. After deftly maneuvering around Prince Charles' flank Frederick's Prussians attacked with unprecedented fury collapsing the enemy line. However, despite this initial crushing blow the Austrians were able to reorganize their front and fight the Prussians to a standstill leaving the battle's final outcome still in doubt. Only after a climactic cavalry charge did the Habsburg army finally break and retreat to Breslau. Two weeks later the city capitulated and the Austrians evacuated Silesia. Although the war would continue for another six years Frederick would never again attain the level of success he did at Leuthen, his greatest victory.<br/><br/>Leuthen (Battles from the Age of Reason, Vol. 3) presents both gamers and students of the period with a colorful and meticulously detailed simulation with which to explore the actual events and possibilities of this definitive battle. Included is an historical commentary written especially for the game by the period's leading authority, Prof. Christopher Duffy. This narrative contains many previously unpublished aspects of the battle and includes maps, diagrams, statistics and his analysis of the 1757 campaign in Silesia.<br/><br/>",

The game includes an accurate order of battle and detailed game map. The map encompasses the primary theater of war from Peterwardein in the north, Sarajevo in the west, to Ni&scaron; in the south-east.<br/><br/>The game system used is the same as found in 1914: Offensive à outrance (GMT). The game has a playtested, concise, well written and organized 24-page rules booklet. <br/>1914, Serbien mu&szlig; sterbien includes three sceanrios. Two short scenarios and a Grand Campaign scenario that covers the period from the initial Austro-Hungarian invasion in August to exhaustion a stalemate in December.<br/><br/>The game-design goal for 1914, Serbien mu&szlig; sterbien is to produce an enjoyable game from which players can learn a great deal about the campaign and the geography of the theater of war. The result is a game that the &quot;WW1 enthusiast&quot; must have and that a gaming connoisseur will enjoy.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>The combat units are primarily Divisions and Brigades. The map&rsquo;s scale is 1:500,000. Each hex is approximately 8 kilometers across, with the corresponding area being roughly 6475 hectares (or 16000 acres). Each game turn represents from two to four days of time depending on the season.<br/><br/>",

This year&rsquo;s mark has been carefully selected, and Constable Cramphorn is hot on our trail. And did I mention that you should watch your back? After all, stealing from a Society member is just as entertaining as fleecing a mark. So, do you have the lightest fingers, the snappiest patter, and the most disarming smile...or is this the year when you get nicked?<br/><br/>Scoundrel Society is the first Small Box/Big Fun game from Action Phase Games where players take on the role of a member of The Society, a gathering of notable con artists who come together once a year to show off their craft by proving who can steal the most loot from the mark without getting caught. Loot is lifted from the mark by playing one of five action cards, most of which work best when played alone. But tread carefully: while many pieces of loot have unique abilities that can affect the game, each carries a suspicion value. So when Constable Cramphorn is revealed from the last ten cards of the loot deck, the player with the highest suspicion score is apprehended, leaving the rest to compare the value of their ill-gotten gains to determine who is the most dirty and rotten of the Scoundrel Society.<br/><br/>",

In a new regeneration, you are standing at the console of your TARDIS as it flies through the Time Vortex.&quot;<br/><br/>This web-published game is played using four booklets: Rules, Adventures, Enemies, and Events. Two six-sided dice are also required. all the Booklets, plus expansions and support materials are in the Files section below.<br/><br/>An Adventure begins when the TARDIS lands at a location, be it modern-day London, the wilds of Sherwood Forest, or the distant planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius. Through actions such as Explore and Investigate, references in the Adventure book will lead you to paragraphs in the Events book, allowing you to gather Allies and discover the plots that are in progress. Eventually you will reveal the Enemy, each of which has its own 1-page section in the Enemy book explaining how you might discover their dastardly Goal. New Actions then open up, allowing you to Plan, Research, and (hopefully) defeat the Enemy. If you fail to reveal and Defeat the Enemy within 12 Turns, the Doctor is killed - maybe your next regeneration will do better (or at least be better dressed)!<br/><br/>The 2nd Edition is currently being developed, incorporating material from the 1st Edition and selected expansions, as well as 12th Doctor material and all-new content.<br/><br/>SC Games is a fan-based group which makes unofficial games purely as a labour of love.

        "description": "The object of HeartSwitch &ndash; a card game inspired by Hearts &ndash; is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. The sixty-card deck consists of the standard 52-card deck, plus four Magicians and four Witches, two good and two bad, with Witches ranking between Jacks and Tens.<br/><br/>As in Hearts, HeartSwitch is a trick-taking game with fairly standard rules. The lead player plays a single card, then each other player must follow suit, if possible &ndash; except that a player can always choose to play a Magician. A Magician is a null card that can never win a trick (unless a trick consists only of Magicians). Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led collects the cards, then leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>After everyone's hand is empty, players score points for the cards they've collected. As in Hearts, each heart collected is one point, while the Queen of Spades is 13 points. What's new in &quot;HeartSwitch&quot; is that the Witch of Spades is worth 5 points, while the Witch of Clubs cancels points earned for either of the Spades cards. The Witch of Hearts doubles points earned from hearts up to a maximum of 15 points, while the Witch of Diamonds knocks up to 5 points off your score. If a player &quot;shoots the moon&quot; by collecting all the hearts and either the Witch or Queen of Spades (or both), that player scores no points while everyone else scores 20, 25 or 30 points.<br/><br/>Players continue playing rounds until one player reaches 70 points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins. Alternatively, players can agree to play a set number of rounds, with the lowest-scoring player winning the game.<br/><br/>",

The Allies possess more tanks, including the &ldquo;Queen of the Desert,&rdquo; the Matilda, and have mastery of the air.  Crossing the Egyptian border into Libya their mission is simple:  destroy the Afrika Korps, and lift the siege of Tobruk!  The Axis forces in the path of the Allied advance occupy well-prepared strongpoints, and lurking somewhere behind them are the German panzers &ndash; and Rommel, &ldquo;The Desert Fox.&rdquo;  The next three days of battle will decide the course of the war in the desert for months to come.<br/><br/>Utilizing a new and streamlined version of the &ldquo;area-impulse&rdquo; system players will experience the uncertainty of the desert battlefield.  Each turn will contain a variable number of impulses, and both players will be challenged to determine whether it is better to attack first, or defend and then counter-attack.  Having committed one&rsquo;s infantry and armor to battle, artillery support may or may not be available.  To win the Allied player must exploit his numerical edge in armor and artillery, plus airpower, to capture Axis positions and destroy German units.  The Axis player must exploit his greater speed, operational flexibility and superior battlefield recovery, to recapture lost ground and destroy Allied units.  Fast, furious, and chess-like, this is a game for players who love concentrated action!<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day (divided by 12 impulse phases)<br/>Area: 1&quot; = 2 miles / 3.5 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 17 x 22&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (88 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 12-page Operation Battleaxe rulebook<br/>One dual-side printed Players Aid Card<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-3 hours<br/><br/>",

You join them around the fire and share in the strange potion that the great Shaman passes around. The stories told by those around the campfire seem odd and disjointed, but with cleverness and insight you may make sense of the many legends of Luma...<br/><br/>In the dreamlike board game Nomads, players each collect disjointed pieces of stories. As you gather the story tiles, you can exchange them for a song or legend that makes sense of the seemingly random fragments. In the end, the player with the most points gleaned from song and legend cards and opal moon tiles &mdash; and with the fewest leftover story or joker tiles &mdash; wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the Cyclades archipelago, off the shores of a divided Greece, players develop their cities and compete for supremacy under the watchful gaze of the gods.<br/><br/>In Cyclades: Legendary Edition, designers Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc have reworked the Cyclades base game and its many expansions to make gameplay more dynamic and fluid.<br/><br/>The game features a strategic bidding system that defines the actions available to each player on their turn. You must balance your finances to optimize the various actions provided by the different gods, with each player gaining the support of only one god each turn. The game features a shorter and more dynamic bidding phase than the original Cyclades thanks to a new exponential bidding scale. Six gods are available instead of the five, increasing the variety of actions available:<br/><br/><br/>     Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of fortresses.<br/>     Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build ports.<br/>     Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples.<br/>     Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities.<br/>     Apollo increases the income of his worshipers.<br/>     Hera provides mercenaries to enforce your troops during battle.<br/><br/><br/>Players now use landscape tiles to assemble the modular game board during set-up, allowing for ever-changing maps and game strategies. New creatures and heroes are available in the base game, offering new strategic opportunities to build metropolises and gain decisive advantages on the battlefield. Your goal is to be the first to control three metropolises, which can be obtained as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     Economic development, by constructing four different buildings.<br/>     Intellectual development, by owning four philosophers.<br/>     Heroic deeds, when sacrificing a hero.<br/>     Military conquest, when seizing an enemy city by strength.<br/><br/><br/>Cyclades: Legendary Edition features three game configurations:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;Classic&quot; mode for 3-5 players in which each player defends their own interests.<br/>     &quot;Team&quot; mode for 4 or 6 players in which you play in teams of two, co-operating with one another and competing against others.<br/>     An enhanced and refined two-player mode.<br/><br/><br/>",

The players must put their social deduction skills to the test by collectively identifying the Saboteur to regain control of the train.<br/><br/>The train speed is controlled by a speedometer which is impacted by the cards that are laid by each players called Effect Cards. The gameplay is accented by dramatic interventions, votes on route taken and emergency meetings where players can be thrown off the train. If the players can exhaust the deck of Effect Cards, the train runs out of steam. Otherwise a collision is caused and the game is lost and the Saboteur has prevailed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Damage Report is a modular, 2-6 player, simultaneous, real-time, co-operative game where the players take on the role of a starship crew faced with making split-second decisions to survive while in the midst of various catastrophes. Unlike many co-operative games, the simultaneous, real-time nature of the game helps prevent groupthink. This forces players to make decisions with minimal feedback and prevents one player from simply running the show. Your turn never ends, and is only limited to what you can accomplish in 15, 30, 45 or 60 second intervals.<br/><br/>Each player uses a timer to keep track of their time, moving the timer down a track based upon how long their turn interval is. In most scenarios, the turn interval is based upon the Life Support system status: the more damaged the system is, the less air the player has to &quot;breathe&quot;, thus each turn is extended, as it takes more time to complete their actions.<br/><br/>The modular board pieces in Damage Report ensure a brand new experience with each game scenario. Each scenario has their own 'success' and 'failure' conditions. The Standard Edition of the game includes three scenarios, however a number of additional scenarios will available as expansions. This will include a 7-10 player expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Phantom Fury - The 2nd Battle for Fallujah<br/>This solitaire game simulates, at tactical scale, the combat waged by US forces during the month of November 2004 to secure the city of Fallujah and crush insurgent resistance. The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.<br/><br/>The player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.<br/><br/>The map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.<br/><br/>The troops of each side are represented by &lsquo;unit&rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.<br/><br/>Insurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.<br/><br/>The game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.<br/><br/>At the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>&bull; 17x22 map<br/><br/>&bull; 88 &frac12;&rsquo;&rsquo; die-cut counters and 140 5/8&rsquo;&rsquo; counters<br/><br/>&bull;  1 player aid<br/><br/>&bull; 1 die<br/><br/>&bull; Rule booklet<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warhammer Ancient Battles is a historically-orientated version of the popular Warhammer rules. Originally created as an independent spin-off from the Warhammer Fantasy Battle rules, it was subsequently brought back in-house at Games Workshop and now functions as a separate division of the company. Some of the rules inconsistencies that the parent game is so famous for have been ironed out, as have some of the more outrageously unrealistic rules. Don't expect massive historical accuracy though: the emphasis is still on a fun, playable system over real historical or military realism. The rulebook tells you everything you need to play the game and comes with two generic army lists for &quot;Romans&quot; and &quot;Barbarians&quot;. The authors actively encourage players to get their miniatures from a range of different manufacturers. Further army list supplements are available and you'll need to supply your own scenery too!<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Warhammer: Armies of Antiquity – A Supplement for Ancient Battles (1999) (no longer in print, replaced by the all the following...)<br/>    Warhammer: Fall of the West – A Supplement for Ancient Battles (2000)<br/>    Shieldwall (2002)<br/>    Warhammer: Chariot Wars – A Supplement for Ancient Battles (2002)<br/>    Alexander the Great (2003)<br/>    Armies of Chivalry (2004)<br/>    Spartacus (2004)<br/>    Byzantium: Beyond the Golden Gate (2005)<br/>    Hannibal and the Punic Wars (2005)<br/>    El Cid (2006)<br/>    Vlad the Impaler (2006)<br/>    The Age of Arthur (2007)<br/>    The Art of War (2007)<br/>    Siege & Conquest (2007)<br/><br/><br/>Reprinted once, with the errata (version 1.5).<br/><br/>Warhammer Ancient Battles, 2nd edition was published April 2010.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pick-a-Seal features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Polar Bear, but without the two variants of that game. An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined the two games support up to eight players.<br/><br/>To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.<br/><br/>Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.<br/><br/>To set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins!<br/><br/>Components<br/>96 cards (3 sets of 32 different cards)<br/>1 rules sheet<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bitter End: Attack to Budapest, 1945, is an operational-level simulation of the German attempts to relieve the encircled Hungarian capital of Budapest, besieged by Soviet forces, in January 1945.<br/><br/>Budapest, Hungary, January 1945<br/><br/>79,000 Axis troops belonging to the IX SS Mountain and 1st Hungarian Corps are surrounded and being pounded by two Soviet armies, the 46th and 7th Guards. The situation is grim. The Soviets are well- supported by heavy artillery and the German line has been steadily retreating, leaving Budapest in grave danger.<br/><br/>On January 1st, the German IV SS and III Panzer Corps launch a surprise attack to rescue the defenders and recapture the city. By January 12th the attack is stalled in the rough terrain to the west of the city. Hitler shifts the focus of the attack from the west to the south-west and continues the attack on January 18th. Although progress is made, Soviet reinforcements pour into the area and the offensive grinds to a halt.<br/><br/>Hitler calls off the attack at the end of January, and by February 14th, after seven weeks of grueling combat, Budapest falls.<br/><br/><br/>By January of 1945 Nazi Germany_s military fate was sealed. There was nothing the German forces in Hungary could have achieved that could have substantially delayed or even mitigated this defeat. That did not deter the German attempt to relieve Budapest. Hitler_s goal in ordering the attack toward Budapest was not the rescue of its garrison, but rather the recapture and retention of the city. The garrison was in fact ordered not to break out but instead to hold and await relief. Few commanders on the German side took the idea of the retention of Budapest seriously, however. Had the relieving German forces gotten to within a few miles of the city, a breakout attempt would probably have been made. Bitter End lets the players explore the tantalizing possibilities. In addition, players may test their skills with several viable historical alternatives, such as the inclusion of forces that could have been available to the respective commanders.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (456 9/16&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Bitter End rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed Unit Organizational Charts<br/>Two dual-side printed Historical Set-up Charts<br/>Three dual-side printed Player Aid Cards<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-25 hours<br/><br/>",

When a group of apprentices show sufficient promise, a Trial is called. Over a period of three days the apprentices racing through the realms attempting to earn renown in the minds of their teachers, but most importantly in the eyes of the fantastic creatures. Each student is given an Amulet, allowed the same three spells, and start their travels with an identical group of creatures who aid them with magical energy and fantastic abilities.<br/><br/>The objective of Legendary Creatures is to win the trial and advance to the rank of Druid. Players do this with the aid of fantastic creatures who assist them in their quest for renown, whatever form it may take. An apprentice&rsquo;s final rank in each elemental realm, renown earned through great feats, and expeditions to distant landmarks determines who becomes the next Druid!<br/><br/>Legendary Creatures is played over three days, each of which consists of AM, Afternoon, and PM turns. Players draw 4 creatures from their individual decks, then play 3 into their stable and send one on a solo expedition. Order and types of creatures determine initiative and resource generation for the round. Players then take turns selecting the realm they'd like to travel in, the resources they generate, and the spells they cast. This is repeated each portion of the day with a final expedition at the end of the PM portion. Ultimate leadership in each realm and via their expeditions reward victory points to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

Here you'll see dolphins jumping, lovers holding hands, and children playing in the sand...always in pairs.<br/><br/>Twin Palms is a beach-themed escape from your traditional trick-taking card game. At the start of each of the game's 5-8 rounds, you bid the number of tricks (0-5) you think you'll claim with the ten cards in your hand. Wait, ten cards = five tricks? Yes, because each time you play to a trick, you play two cards at once!<br/><br/>You play the game with 1-3 suits of cards depending on your desired level of difficulty and the number of players at the table; each suit has cards numbered 0-10 and a wild, with each card appearing twice. The strongest play is a pair of cards that are the same number, with high numbers beating low ones, and with palm trees beating dolphins, which beat sunglasses, which beat pairs that are of different suits. If no one plays a pair, then whoever played the highest single card wins the trick. After five tricks, you score points if you've met your bid exactly. (If you bid a non-zero number of tricks but missed, you still score 1 point per trick taken.)<br/><br/>What's more, if you want to play risky, you can place bets on your bids, giving you an additional way to win (or lose) points. Whoever has the most points after the designated number of rounds wins!<br/><br/>",

The player that rolls the highest can choose to be either.<br/><br/>The next phase is the attacker&rsquo;s Action phase. In this phase, each of the attacker&rsquo;s warriors can take one action. A warrior can move, shoot or do nothing as its action. Once the attacker is finished with all of his or her actions, the defender now gets their action phase.<br/><br/>The final phase is the Combat phase. This is when your warriors fight. Warriors killed in this phase aren&rsquo;t removed until the very end, so they will at least get to fight back if they are struck down.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sir Stamford Raffles has established a post at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is inviting merchants to take ownership of certain plots of land as long as they develop those locations.<br/><br/>In Singapore players are rich merchants who are trading to develop that small outpost into a metropolis. Players own one building at the start of the game, and each round they take ownership of a new lot &ndash; with the player who has the fewest points determining who gets which land &ndash; and erect a new building. Each building has one or more streets connecting it to adjacent locations, and after building you can move 1-2 workers along the streets to take actions in up to three buildings; these buildings provide a small amount of resources or allow trades of resources/VPs/money for some better combination of resources/VPs/money.<br/><br/>A number of the buildings are black market locations that tend to be more powerful than legit businesses, but carry the possibility of stinging you in the end. Each time you build or use a black market building, you draw a chip from a bag. If the chip is black, keep it; if white, the player who has the most black chips and opium is fined and loses half his opium stash. Opium can be quite profitable, but will the cops catch you with dirty hands before you unload the goods?<br/><br/>In the end, the player with the most victory points wins so find the right balance of aboveboard business and criminal doings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Columba, you'll build dovecotes, breed pigeons, expand your territory, and &ndash; above all else &ndash; avoid your opponents' falcons. Players start with 2-4 dovecotes depending on the number of players, and they use them during the game to claim flocks as their own. (The larger dovecote doubles the score of the flock claimed.)<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players need to catch one pigeon of each of the four breeds, after which that goal will be replaced by a new one. The starting player reveals the first tile, places it on the table, then draws another tile and tries to capture pigeons to fulfill his goal. To catch a pigeon, you must place a tile so that it covers the square or squares with the pigeon(s) you need. You may capture pigeons only if you need them; you cannot catch pigeons which belong to a flock already claimed by an opponent, but you can (re)catch pigeons from your or your team's flocks. You receive a tile for each pigeon captured and place those tiles on your goal card.<br/><br/>When you fill a goal tile, you place the tiles on it on your mat, optionally take a new goal card, play the now-freed goal card, then place the tiles on your mat wherever you wish to make one of your (or your partner's) flocks bigger, provided either of you have already built a dovecote to claim a particular flock as your own.<br/><br/>You can also use the tiles to breed falcons. You need to discard two of them to get a baby falcon and two more on a subsequent turn to have it grow into an adult falcon that you can then send to prey on your opponents' flock and make it smaller.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more goal cards can be drawn; any player with an unfulfilled goal card loses four points. Each player counts the tiles or squares forming the flocks claimed by their dovecotes, and the player or team with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hungarian Rhapsody depicts the Soviet drive into Hungary which led the Red Army into the Vienna  basin. Rumania's defection in August 1944 allowed the Soviets to outflank well defended Axis positions in the Carpathian Mountains through the South. In the process, the German 6th Army was almost destroyed, losing most of its heavy equipment (which explains the relative weakness of the German artillery at the start  of  the campaign). The game begins on 5 October 1944 with the 2nd Ukrainian Front and the 4th Ukrainian Front launching an offensive to isolate the German 8th Army which is still defending an area off-map to the East in the Carpathian Mountains.<br/><br/>Hungarian Rhapsody allows players to play the two  major Soviet offensives and several smaller scenarios covering the German counter offensives.<br/><br/>Hungarian Rhapsody is the next game in the award winning Operational Combat System (OCS #18). Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions, making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.<br/><br/>Game Turn: Half Week.<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 km.<br/>Units: Battalion to Division.<br/>Two 22&quot;x34&quot; maps. <br/>One 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; Budapest inset map.<br/>Five (5) one-map scenarios.

There is no need for additional supplements or game cards.<br/><br/>By utilizing half-a-dozen or so six-sided dice (d6), about a dozen 10-sided dice (d10), a tape-measure and a standard set of playing cards, this was the first published set of rules to incorporate:<br/><br/>- Variable move distance<br/>    - Specific casualty determination<br/>    - Random movement and firing sequence<br/><br/>Figures are individually mounted, but movement, morale and combat is by the unit, with the basic unit being the 20 figures infantry platoon (or Pathan clan, Zulu Iviyo, Dervish warband), 12 figures for a cavalry troop and 4 figures for an artillery battery. Units are then added to make larger forces (company, battalion, Pathan/Dervish tribe, Zulu Ibutho, Boer Commando, and cavalry squadron). Each unit has an identifiable command figure.<br/><br/>TSATF has been described as a semi-skirmish game. Unit movement is determined by die roll, different types of units under different circumstances rolling differing numbers of six-sided dice.

        "description": "Dragon Master is designed by Reiner Knizia and originally published and released in Korea. Your aim is to create vertical lines that score lots of points. As you sit on neighboring (rather than opposite) sides of the playing area, your horizontal lines appear as vertical lines for your opponent, and vice versa. The game ends when both of you have played all your 8 cards into the playing area. The 4x4 grid is now complete. Count each of your 4 vertical lines individually and compare the weakest column from both players to determine the winner. Whoever has the higher score in this line wins. In case of a tie, compare all vertical lines. If all lines awarded the same number of points, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>Based on the early Reiner Knizia games Sono and Prisma, and then reworked as Robot Master<br/><br/>Note: the rules in the Victory Point Games promo edition are slightly different:<br/><br/>1) There are only 20 dragon cards in the deck. Players are each dealt 8 cards; the remaining 4 are discarded without the players knowing their values.<br/>2) The grid size is 4x4.<br/>3) Each column is worth the sum of its values. A pair of cards in the same column counts as 10x the value (e.g., 2 &quot;2&quot; cards in a row would be worth 20 points). Three or more cards of the same value in a column scores 100 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is by veteran designer Ted Raicer and contains: 1 hard mounted game board, 96 army counters (about an inch per side; incl. 24 dummies), 46 City Victory markers, 30 Combat chits, 1 Game Turn marker, 1 Game Round marker, 4 Victory Point markers, 8 Game Order Determination markers, 4 Surrender markers, 1 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk marker, 2 Dice, 1 Rules Booklet (8 pages, full-color).<br/><br/>The game board divides the map of Europe into three Theaters of War - the Western Theater, Italian Theater, and Eastern Theater. Each theater is sub-divided into two or more numbered Fronts (11 fronts total). Each front contains the location of one or more victory cities (46 in total). Ordinary victory city locations are shown with a box, color-coded to show the original owning faction. Replacement centers are shown by a circle in place of a box. Each front also contains one or more faction bases (hexagon shaped) which act as a special sort of city. Bases and cities within each Front are connected by Attack Lines which indicate which cities may be attacked. Finally each Front lists which armies may be deployed or moved there.<br/><br/>The First World War can be played by 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>There are two Alliances: the Allies and the Central Powers. Each Alliance is divided into two factions. The Allies are divided into the Western Allied faction and the Eastern Allied faction. The Central Powers are divided into the German faction and the German Allied faction. Each faction consists of one or more nationalities.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer:<br/><br/>&quot;Nemesis: The spirit of divine retribution against those who succumb to hubris&quot;<br/><br/>While Burma was the backwater of WW2, it contained several of the most colorful characters of the war. The background was such that...<br/><br/>General Stilwell, who despised both British and Chinese (and the current American, except Marshall) leadership, wanted to fight the Japanese with Chinese troops, in Burma or in China. Roosevelt, while having no interest in rebuilding the British Empire, was at the same time incapable of seeing the Chinese Kuomintang regime as fascist as it really was. He often wanted to sack Stilwell for repeatedly reporting on Chinese incompetence and corruption.<br/><br/>Chiang Kai-Shek was more interested in getting his hands on the valuable lend-lease supply the US was sending him through Stilwell, who he hated, than fighting the Japanese. He was not keen on putting Chinese troops under Stilwell's command in Burma since they might become well trained and then possibly turn on Chiang. But he accepted doing so if Stilwell used them for opening up a supply route to China once again.<br/><br/>Churchill was not interested in Burma at all and wanted to focus on Singapore. Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander in India and Burma, wanted to attack into Burma, but through an amphibious assault further south instead. Wingate (some thought him to be certifiably insane) wanted to land special trained brigades in the middle of Burma and from there reconquer Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>General Slim, who had to put up with his rude and querulous colleagues, Stilwell and Wingate; his flamboyant chief Mountbatten; the hopeless and incompetent Chiang Kai-Shek, just wanted to defeat the Japanese there in the north and from there retake the rest of Burma.<br/><br/>In the meantime, in 1944, the Japanese, being outnumbered and with hardly any supply, said &quot;enough is enough&quot; and attacked. Why not? It worked in 1942. But this time Japanese hubris met Slim, the best British General of WW2, in the west; Stilwell's well trained and hard fighting Chinese troops in the North; Wingate's Chindit brigades in the middle amongst them; Chinese Yunnan soldiers who, after Chiang finally let them loose, took heavy casualties when investing the Japanese in the east. This time, after many ferocious battles, the Japanese met their Nemesis and were, in the end, utterly defeated.<br/><br/>Nemesis features my &quot;Open Game Turn&quot; system. The Game Turn consists of only four phases: Assault (where a unit may move and &quot;overrun&quot;); Attack; Supply Check; Reinforcement. The phases are drawn as chits, so you will not know in what order they will appear, with the exception of the first chit in a Game Turn which is chosen from the first three drawn chits in the previous Game Turn. Both players have a set of four Phase Chits each and they take turns drawing them. The game mechanics are easy to master. The game play may not.<br/><br/>The quality of the unit is the most important feature. Basically it affects four aspects: Not only will a high quality give an edge in combat, it also decides what kind of ZoC the unit is able to exert. The quality will decide how long a unit can be out of supply before attrition strikes, and how capable the unit is to make an operational move (a &quot;double move&quot;). Since ZoC is non-existent except when preventing enemy units conducting operational moves, it is very important which units you position and where you do so. Especially so, if you are uncertain of which phases there remain to be played.<br/><br/>The game will also feature my &quot;Active Combat&quot; system. A combat result will have step losses and probably a retreat result. Step losses are straightforward. The retreat result though has to be enforced by the attacker. That is usually not a problem if it is done by a high quality unit. A unit with lesser quality may have to pay with step losses in order to do so. The defender then decides to retreat or resist. If it stays, then it takes step losses, depending on its quality. Before any attack, the Japanese player has the option to get an DRM in its favor (in attack or defense). But it comes with a price.<br/><br/>Finally, there will be a two layer Victory Point system. There is a Satisfaction point track for each player. Some points can be actively acquired by you but are given once, usually those that will please your local commander. Some points can be actively acquired by the opponent and will be deducted every Game Turn from your track as long as the enemy controls them, usually those that displease your superiors. Then again, it is the same thing for your opponent. Those that you have received once are also the ones that are deducted each Game Turn from your opponent's track etc. In the end, as the commander, you will have to prioritize, depending on the current situation.<br/><br/>Nemesis has a high replay value and if you love tense games when in action as well as games that allow you to ponder on possible &quot;perfect opening moves&quot;, then this is the game for you.<br/><br/>",

The player who collects 10 Power tokens, wins.  In a world without gods, only you may claim your destiny.<br/><br/>During the game, a general and a dragon entering to the same region peacefully, have a chance of becoming Dragonbonded to unlock a unique ability that interacts with each other, and playing as a team for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>In the planning phase players secretly play action cards in a face-down pile to program their actions across the board until one player passes; in the resolution phase, actions are resolved in order. Through these actions, players move to different regions, attack, collect power or cast spells by spending the Power collected.<br/><br/>Combat has a wargame feel into it due to the dice-based resolution with critical hits, counterattacks and retreats. If Power is scarce on the board, you can steal a Power token from another player entering into combat and dealing more hits than they can take.<br/><br/>Dragons and generals play entirely different in strategy and actions. Generals raise armies and customize them in different regions around the board to control them and harvest Power. Dragons can gain Power by devouring units, they also have a health track and must rest and recover if they get wounded too much. All characters in the game have a unique Vaala deck of spells.<br/><br/>-description from developer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On March 23, 1862 and then again on July 24, 1864 the area around Kernstown, Virginia witnessed clashes between Union and Confederate forces. The Pritchard House and Pritchard's Hill were central to both battles as they abutted the Valley Turnpike.<br/><br/>At First Kernstown, Stonewall Jackson erred in taking scouting reports at face value and so he unknowingly attacked a superior Union force. With Union Commander James Shields laying wounded back in Winchester, Colonel Nathan Kimball ignored Shields' orders and managed, and mismanaged, the battle his way. Though Jackson's men ran out of ammunition and fled the field, Stonewall's only tactical loss became a strategic victory as Union Commanders overestimated the size of Jackson's force. The Union forces could have crushed Jackson, stopped his Valley Campaign before it really got started and perhaps allowed McClellan to end the war in 1862.<br/><br/>On July 24, 1864, Union Commander George Crook ignored his scouting reports and ordered his forces to attack what he thought was a small body of Confederate cavalry and skirmishers. Generals Jubal Early and especially General John Breckinridge led their forces well and routed Crook's men. Only the failure of the Confederate cavalry to cut the Union retreat routes prevented the annihilation of Crook's army. Better Union leadership and troop placement could have made this battle much harder for the Confederates to win.<br/><br/>​Kernstown is a game simulating the fighting on March 23, 1862 and July 24, 1864 around Kernstown. The game is specifically designated to be a playable regimental-scale simulation of these two conflicts and some scenarios can be completed in a long evening. This is the fourth ACW game published by Revolution Games which features the &quot;Blind Swords&quot; chit-pull system. This mechanic emphasizes the three &quot;FOW's&quot; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war, and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment.<br/><br/>Components:  One 22x34&quot; map; 2 x  5/8&quot; counter-sheets (352 counters); Rulebooklet; 5 charts/playeraids; Box or ziploc bag; 2 dice (Boxed version only).<br/><br/>​Game Information:  Complexity: 6 out of 10.

If you are Inspector Nose, shuffle the number cards (1-5) and look at one of them to determine which target card players must not remove from play. You then roll five image/symbol dice, choose one of them, and place it on the clue card. The other players then debate and remove one image card from play. If they didn't remove the target card, you add one more image/symbol die to the remaining four, roll them, choose another die, and so on.<br/><br/>If the players remove four cards and leave only the target card behind, great! If they remove the target card earlier, well, better luck next round. The team scores 1 point for each correctly removed card, with the highest possible score being 20. How well will you do?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A member of the Checkers Family.<br/><br/>International Checkers is played just like American Checkers or British draughts, with the exception that it is played on a 10x10-square checker board with twenty pieces per player. This game is played mostly in European countries like France, The Netherlands, Russia, Poland and Belgium and in African nations like Congo, Senegal and Ivory Coast. However, there are countries outside these two continents that boast of good players like in the United States, Italy, Israel and Brazil.<br/><br/>Rules of the Game: This game is played on a 10 x 10, or 100 squares checker board where the double corner is on the right of each player.<br/><br/>The Moves of the Men: Checkers pieces can move forward on each empty square to the left or to the right. When these pieces reach the last line on the opponent's side they become kings.<br/><br/>The Moves of the King: Kinged pieces can move across multiple squares on the two diagonals that cross their position for so long as these squares are open, in a rule known as the &quot;flying kings.&quot;<br/><br/>Captures: In International checkers, maximum captures are obligatory, which means that if a player has more than one path to jump to capture his opponent's pieces, he must take that path that will effect the most capture of his opponent's pieces. If a piece lands on the king row during a jump, it must continue jumping backward for as long as there is a jump opportunity. That particular piece cannot be kinged unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.<br/><br/>Captures by the Men: Men can effect capture by moving forward or backward and jumping over a single piece of the opponent provided that the said piece is adjacent to it and the following square is empty. If the man can jump again from the arrival square to effect another capture, then it must do so.<br/><br/>Captures by a King: A kinged piece can capture an opponent's piece if it is on the same diagonal where it is positioned provided that the squares between them are empty and that the square beyond the piece to be captured is also empty. The king can stop on any square within the same diagonal line and if another capture can be effected from any of these squares, then it must continue to do so.<br/><br/>The Winning Player: The player who cannot move any of his pieces loses the game.<br/><br/>Conditions for a Draw:<br/><br/>     By mutual agreement of the players.<br/>     Both players have played five moves, after a position arises of one king against two pieces, which includes a king.<br/>     Both players have played sixteen moves, after a position arises of one king against three pieces, which includes a king.<br/>     Both players have moved twenty five moves solely with kings and not a single piece was captured.<br/>     For the third time the same position arises with the same player at move.<br/><br/><br/>Information from checkershistory.com<br/><br/>Online Play <br/><br/>    Boardspace.net (real time play against humans, or play against the computer)<br/>    SkillGamesBoard (cross-platform, real-time, human opponents or bots, turn-based for registered users)<br/><br/><br/>Mobile Apps<br/><br/>     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS<br/>     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android<br/><br/><br/>",

In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play. Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story. Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!<br/><br/>Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.<br/><br/>In The Volcanic Island, you slip into the roles of four students on a volcanic island who face mysterious events. Like a thriller, you need to solve puzzles, make decisions, track traces, and analyze and use objects. You will experience a story together. Gameplay is variable and different in each group.<br/><br/>Admin note: The first edition of the German edition of The Volcanic Island contains an error for which KOSMOS has released a PDF correction that you'll find in the files.<br/><br/>",

The individual goal is to stay alive by securing a parachute.<br/><br/>It was always going to be a daring heist. Everything was going to plan until the pilot seized a gun from the lockbox, opened the emergency door and fired three rounds into the engine before bailing with his parachute and a spare!<br/><br/>You need to secure the loot but now you&rsquo;re a parachute down on a plane that&rsquo;s losing altitude. Fast. Who can you trust? Who&rsquo;s got the cash? Where are the &lsquo;chutes? Can you hold your nerve before you Hit the Silk!?<br/><br/>The gameplay is suspenseful and mischievous &ndash; each turn, players can search the plane frantically for useful equipment, trade from their inventory and play a variety of speculative actions; anything to secure a parachute or a briefcase of cash.<br/><br/>But with each action the altimeter needle drops another 500ft. With the ground approaching fast, you may need to forge an alliance. You&rsquo;ll get a few chances to jump, but only with a majority vote. If trading nicely doesn&rsquo;t work, you may need to resort to drastic action with the handcuffs, poison or revolver. What follows are tense standoffs, fragile deals and double crosses. And if all else fails, can you land the plane?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>About:<br/><br/>In The Football Game, each player takes charge of a football club and manages it through an entire football season. The winner is the Club who most exceeds the expectations of their fans.<br/><br/>The Football Game is a much about the football narrative as it is about winning. It captures the rivalries, the excitement, the back-page headlines, the stars, the emotion, humour and the occasional insanity and scandal of football both on and off the pitch.<br/><br/>The Football Game combines our love of the sport with our love of tabletop gaming. It reflects not only how football works, but also how it feels!<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>The game is played over six rounds, with one turn per Player per Round. Each Round represents about 6 weeks of a football season.<br/><br/>During setup, each Player chooses a Club and is dealt a random squad of Footballers and a Manager. The strength of your squad determines your Club&rsquo;s Class (and win conditions).<br/><br/>The transfer market is where you'll buy and sell Footballers in order to add strength and depth in your squad. You&rsquo;ll need cover too: Players may become unavailable in the course of each Match Day.<br/><br/>Every turn ends with a Match Day Roll, where coloured dice are used to reflect scoring. Even the very best Footballers won't perform every week! When selecting their match day team, Players should consider a Footballer&rsquo;s Ability, Colour, Position, and how these might affect other Footballers in the team. Each Match Day influences the league position of all clubs, so you're never left waiting for your turn.<br/><br/>You can boost your score through the use of Tactics cards played both before and after each Match Day Roll. Careful management of Tactics cards might be the difference between stealing the title for some, or avoiding relegation for others. These cards allow your players (such as the Wing Wizard, Ancient Attacker, and Incredible Sulk) to pull off elegant interceptions, lucky deflections, and wonder goals.<br/><br/>The two twelve-sided bring about the fortunes and misfortunes that can affect any club or Footballer. You&rsquo;ll experience Injuries, Knocks and over 50 events including Social Media Mishaps, Night Club Nightmares, Academy Stars, Billionaire Buyouts, Sell-On Fees and many more!<br/><br/>Victory points are scored at several stages of the season, and are awarded according to your league position and club class. Different club's have different expectations, so the winner at the end will be the club who most exceeded their fans expectations!<br/><br/>Will your Players perform? Will your risk-taking be rewarded? Will lady luck hand you a lifeline?<br/><br/>",

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.<br/><br/>The game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as &quot;Improved Bridge Building Techniques&quot; that allow players to build across estuaries or &quot;Sheep Boom Goes Bust&quot; which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.<br/><br/>During the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.<br/><br/>If all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.<br/><br/>",

Taking on roles of powerful mystical characters like the Druid, the Shaman or the Wizard, players will brew potions to grow their magical power, while casting spells to stop others from getting ahead. Cauldron is a resource management game that plays with 2-5 players aged 10+ in 1 hour.<br/><br/>Play revolves around a central set of fields, producing potion ingredients each season (frog legs, spider webs, dragon eggs etc). Each player has potions - way to combine ingredients to score Magik (game's victory points and currency). Players take turns harvesting ingredients, brewing potions and attempting to steal ingredients from competitors. Each player also has a hand of spells - one-time effects that help the player or hinder opponents. Each character has variable powers that modifies the way basic actions are resolved.<br/><br/>After all ingredients have been harvested, players have a chance to invest some of their Magik to buy additional potions, spells or add fields to the game board. Balancing investment with advancement is a crucial part of the game.<br/><br/>The game proceeds until one of the player reaches 35 Magik - that player is the winner. The game has an element of luck and conflict present but the majority of it revolves around resource management, planning and balancing short and long term investment.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Espa&ntilde;a 20 features four complete games covering key battles fought over control of the Iberian Peninsula: Bail&eacute;n, Talavera, Arapiles, and Bussaco.<br/><br/>Hans von Stockhausen's Bail&eacute;n 20 (July, 1808) showcases the stunning triumph of General Francisco Casta&ntilde;os&rsquo; Spanish army over French General Pierre Dupont&rsquo;s Corps d&rsquo;Observation operating in the mountains of Andalusia. This game challenges both players: The Spanish must struggle to coordinate the actions of their large and enthusiastic but mostly untrained army, while the French must decide whether to try and hold against superior numbers or conduct a fighting withdrawal back to Madrid. With Spanish guerrillas, a baggage train full of looted treasure, and treacherous Swiss mercenaries who might change sides in the middle of the battle, Bail&eacute;n 20 offers players plenty of military adventure.<br/><br/>Considered one of Wellington&rsquo;s finest battles, Arapiles 20 (July, 1812) from Lance McMillan focuses on the hard-fought meeting engagement between his veteran British forces and Mareschal Marmont&rsquo;s French army in the hills south of Salamanca. With two armies of equal strength, victory requires careful planning, precise maneuvers, and exact timing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by unexpected events. Will the British player be able to pounce on a fleeting French blunder to win the day (as happened historically), or will the French be able to simply bludgeon his opponent into submission? In Arapiles 20, the outcome of this famous battle is in your hands.<br/><br/>Rudi Garcia's Talavera 20 recreates the major battle which occurred near the city of Talavera de la Reina on 27 to 28 July 1809. One player commands the French army under Napoleon's brother, Joseph, the self-proclaimed King of Spain, and the other commands the combined allied armies of Great Britain (under Sir Arthur Wellesley) and Spain (under Captain-General Gregorio de la Cuesta). After his attempt to liberate Madrid from the French was repulsed, Cuesta's army fell back to Talavera, which was covered by the British. Starting with a daring night attack, Joseph repeatedly attempted to push the allies out of their superb defensive positions, to no avail. As the French, can you find and exploit a weak spot in the allied lines? As the allies, can you hold your shaky alliance together and fend off the French (all the while keeping a nervous eye out for a second French army that might unexpectedly show up behind your armies)?<br/><br/>Bussaco 20: Second Edition, from designer Lance McMillan, features the battle occurring on 26 September 1810, during the early stages of the French invasion of Portugal. One player commands the French army of Marshal Andr&eacute; Mass&eacute;na, while the other controls Sir Arthur Wellesley, Viscount of Wellington's combined British and reconstituted Portuguese army. Historically, a distracted Mass&eacute;na launched a series of uncoordinated frontal assaults straight up a steep ridge into the teeth of the British defenses, suffering heavy losses before Wellington elected to disengage and fall back to Lisbon. Can you as Mass&eacute;na avoid the same mistakes, or as Wellington can you use your superior position to achieve a decisive victory?<br/><br/>",

Have the second most damage, gain 1 VP.<br/><br/>Don't get too attached to your dudes. They will die. Quickly. No worries though, you'll get new ones to carry on the fight. Players can earn tokens to nerph other dude's abilities and shields to protect abilities. Each player also receives just 3 re-roll cubes at the start of the game, and when they are gone, they are gone. So make them count!  In the arena it is usually best to have dudes with abilities that trigger on low numbers and high numbers to ensure you have your bases covered for maximum pointage. <br/>Remember, you can do a single damage and score the most points for a dude if it's the killing blow! So it's not all about brute strength, although that helps too.<br/><br/>Fight until a player reaches 30+ VP, and that player wins.<br/><br/>Unhappy Cthulhu vs. Helpless Bunny? Expansionist Alien vs. Righteous Paladin? Coal-fired Robot of Doom vs. a Little Girl? Rabid War Bear vs. Animated Chicken Bone? Mentally-Challenged Goat vs. Pirate Taco? These are all possible match-ups, plus thousands more.<br/><br/>When you play O.P. Arena get ready to see some of the craziest, chaining combos you've ever seen in a game!

You can build majestic pagodas and Shinto shrines, learn ancient eastern wisdom, explore the world, or fight ancient monsters &mdash; or all of the above. This is a sandbox-style game, and how you play is up to you!<br/><br/>In Floating World, you play as one of six unique characters from Edo Japan, each with a unique power and a mysterious secret. The game plays simultaneously over three phases that repeat until one player has gained a victory condition. All phases occur simultaneously, and they are:<br/><br/><br/>    The Draw Phase: Draw six cards from your deck, then pass them to another player. They take these cards, discard one of their choice, then separate the remaining five cards into two piles, one containing two cards and one containing three. You do the same for another player, then take your two piles, discarding one of them and playing the other.<br/>    The Collect Phase: Collect items and bonuses indicated on the cards in your hand. You may also pay time tokens to perform extra actions in the next phase.<br/>    The Action Phase: Simultaneously take actions based on your cards in hand and those that you chose in the collect phase. Disputes caused by the simultaneous nature of these actions are resolved using the influence track, where the player at the top of the track chooses the outcome; choosing in your own interest, however, drops you to the bottom of the track.<br/><br/><br/>Rounds continue in this way until a player gains any of the seven victory conditions available, such as collecting all four ganbaru tokens or discovering another player's secret location and achieving any two of the ganbaru tokens.<br/><br/>Philosophia: Floating World contains over 200 tarot-sized cards and 12 intricate miniatures and is filled with beautiful Ukiyo-e style Japanese art, all digitally remastered to regain the original vibrance of the era.

Well, now it's not anymore, because you have reached the most mysterious and wackiest place in the whole Universe! Odyssey is a journey through oneiric galaxies where only the players' imagination is the limit. It is a game of a thousand possibilities and approaches. It is four games in one box.<br/><br/>Odyssey is a game of exploring hidden galaxies and outwitting the opponents to be the fastest cadet to gather all the mind crystals. To do so players need to discover, learn and memorise the hidden map of a galaxy and use this knowledge wisely. The trick is to travel as quickly as possible, but also not to reveal too much to others.<br/><br/>Odyssey is also a demanding solo experience, where a cadet tries to collect the shards of mind crystals and not being devoured by the Black Hole Monster at the same time. This mode can also be played as a cooperative game.<br/><br/>",

Among 10 historical and hypothetical scenarios, players can simulate the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Kurdish Rebellion, the Sunni versus Shia confrontation as well as Russian, Turkish, Israeli and Western intervention in the region. ISIS troops are activated through Event cards.<br/><br/>This wargame allows you to have a clearer view of the local protagonists' goals and a real understanding of what is going on in this chaotic area. This is why it is used by experts and analysts of the French Ministry of Defence to test prospective scenarios, as the iconic &ldquo;Gulf Strike&rdquo; used to be by US experts to plan the Gulf War.<br/><br/>Each turn represents two months of real time and is divided into several phases allowing players to play events, to take reinforcements, to check supply, to spend operational points, to move units (mostly brigades and divisions) and to launch offensives. Each player gets 4 cards in hand allowing him or her to use them carefully either for creating events, spending operational points or supporting battles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On the table, there are sets of cards for each room, with each card showing one piece of furniture. Players take turns flipping over one of the cards and choosing one of the shapes shown on the backside of the card. Then all players have to draw that piece of furniture into their plan, making sure there is enough space for walls, doors and a corridor that connects the rooms. Also, each piece of furniture must be reachable from the door. To ensure this, the furniture shapes also show empty fields that must be adjacent to the furniture. To be able to fit all the furniture into the rooms, players must overlap the empty fields efficiently.<br/>When all cards are flipped, players score depending on how much of the furniture they were able to place.<br/>The scenario booklet contains several small campaigns with 25 scenarios all in all, with various difficulty levels.<br/><br/>",

Events include German intervention, Swedish occupation of &Aring;land islands, grain trains from Soviet Russia as well as drunk Red commander&hellip;<br/><br/>Units represent mainly company/battalion level and include both Civil Guards and Red Guards, as well as special units; armoured trains for Reds and Jaeger units and German intervention forces for Whites.

Who will be the one to find the murderer&rsquo;s room?<br/><br/>Crime Hotel is a trick-taking game in which the players become the inspectors who are trying to find the room in which the criminal is hiding. Each round, the players who played the highest card and the lowest card can guess in which room the criminal is hiding. The more rounds you play, the closer you get to the truth. The players score points based on their guesses and the closer they are to the correct room, the more points they receive.<br/><br/>Each round, the hotel rooms will light up one by one, leading you closer to the answer &mdash; and the closer you get to the answer, the higher the tension becomes. Even if you know the answer, you have to think strategically since you have to play highest or lowest card to be able to make your guess before the others. Like solving a real crime, you have to collect all the clues and use your powers of deduction. Who will be the one to find the criminal?<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game remains the same: Be the first player (or team) to push six opposing marbles off the playing area.<br/><br/>On a turn, you push 1-3 marbles in a straight line one space in any direction provided that either (1) the space you move into is unoccupied or (2) you're pushing an opposing group of marbles that consists of fewer marbles than the group you're moving. For example, a line of three marbles can push one or two adjacent opposing marbles one space along the line or off the playing area. (In team play, the first marble in the pushing line must belong to the player who makes the push. You can push marbles belong to both opponents.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's web page (Medieval):<br/><br/>Medieval is a card-based board game that takes players back to the turbulent 13th century in Europe, Middle East and North Africa. The cards not only represent the Powers, various capabilities, and events that the players use to gain victory, but they also provide the playing board, a map that is divided into 19 Cards, only 8 of which start the game in play. The rest of the Map Cards - and the map - come into play randomly, but at the players' pace.<br/><br/>The remaining cards are for the 27 Powers - countries from the strong but troubled Holy Roman Empire, England and France, through the various Islamic powers, down to such minor, but important, countries such as The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Livonia and Trebizond. Even such mysterious and far away areas as Polovtsy and The Cumans come into play. - and the various &quot;events&quot; the players use to forward their schemes.<br/><br/>Each Player represents an ever-changing conglomerate of these Powers, using his wiles, and the cards, to further his control over areas of Europe to win the game. There are Spies, Assassins, accusations of Heresy, Jihads, even the use of the various Knights of Christ.<br/><br/>And then there are the Popes. Each player, randomly, can become Pope (they're named and historical). As Pope he can arrange alliances, excommunicate players, and call for Crusades (a great way to make money).<br/><br/>But hovering like a very, very black cloud over all of this are The Mongols. No player knows exactly when they start to arrive, although the card play does give them hints &hellip; and some time to prepare, if they choose to heed the warnings. But when they do arrive, all Tartar Hell breaks loose, as The Mongols, also represented by cards, literally eat the map, east to west, conquering Powers, chewing them up and making them disappear from European view.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who survives the onslaughts of religion and the Mongols to control the largest part of 13th century Europe.<br/><br/>Medieval is for 3 to 5 players and takes around 2 hours to play, once you've learned the system. It comes with 110 cards, lots of little pieces, and coin-shaped florin markers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the golden green woodlands of the Alpine Slopes, stands Bethel Woods; an orphanage once explored by young, creative minds pushing the limits of space and time, gravity and light. But when an ominous force invades the world, Bethel Woods becomes a distant memory, lost inside the thickets of the forest.<br/><br/>Now a group of young people, wearing the crest of the orphanage, return to finish the work that was started long ago. They must work diligently, however, to repair and restore the machines scattered throughout the forest, before the ominous force finds the technology and destroys the only chance the world has in surviving.<br/><br/>The cooperative game Bethel Woods is set in the universe of &quot;Hours&quot;, created by author, Jessy Ribordy (Falling Up/The River Empires) and uses a mancala-like mechanism. Players first pick up all the Workers from any one of the 6 Machines surrounding the Orphanage, then move either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the board, dropping one worker on each Machine and fixing Malfunctions as they go. There are 4 Malfunction types, each with a matching Worker type to fix it. All Malfunctions that players fix are added to their personal supply as &quot;Knowledge&quot;.<br/><br/>To win, players need to send 6 of the 12 Workers into Bethel Woods Orphanage with increasing amounts of Knowledge to construct the &quot;Daydreamer&quot; (a machine that will rescue the orphanage's inhabitants from the impending downfall). The first Worker needs just 1 Knowledge of their type, the second 2, the third 3, and so on.<br/><br/>Players also need to use their acquired Knowledge to uncover spies, hidden within each of the Machines. Players may uncover 1 Spy only on the last Machine they place a Worker on each turn.<br/><br/>After each turn, three random Malfunctions are drawn and added to the various Machines. If a Machine has more than 3 Malfunctions and/or Spies, it goes into the critical state. These all make the task of maintaining the Machines and constructing the Daydreamer that much harder. Also, any round where at least one Machine goes critical, results in a Spy being placed.<br/><br/>Players lose the game if at the end of a player's turn, there are 4 critical Machines. They can also lose immediately if there are ever 6 Spies on the board or not enough Malfunctions when placing them.<br/><br/>",

The pride of the Royal Navy went to the bottom of the Denmark Strait southwest of Iceland and Bismarck disappeared into the fog. But HMS Prince of Wales had managed to hit Bismarck below the water line, and she left behind her a slick of fuel oil. The British Home Fleet relentlessly tracked the German warship, and she finally sank beneath a hail of gunfire.<br/><br/>This Second World War at Sea game has one of the larger operational maps in the series; the North Atlantic is a big and empty place. There are two 34x22-inch maps, covering the area from north of Iceland south to the latitude of Spain. The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.<br/><br/>The game includes 24 pages of rules and 12 scenarios which feature not just the Bismarck chase, but also the North Atlantic raids made by the German warships Admiral Hipper, Admiral Scheer, Gneisenau and Scharnhorst.<br/><br/>",

In Blockade Runner, players take on the roles of entrepreneurs attempting to make the most money  by shipping cargo in and out of the South during the American Civil War. Positioning is achieved by competing with each other for access to commodities, top market prices, and newly built ships.  Hard decisions include whether to play safely to keep ships afloat or take potentially profitable risks.  The crux of the play is hinged upon whether to bring in vital war goods, which reduce the intensity of the growing blockade, or more profitable black market goods. This enables a potential for cooperation, but competition is the heart of the game. <br/>publisher blurb.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Invasion: America is a &quot;mini-monster&quot; wargame designed by Jim Dunnigan and published by SPI in 1976. It depicts a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist Coalition (ESC) staging their invasion from Cuba, the South American Union (SAU) invading from Columbia, and the Pan Asiatic League (PAL) invading along the Pacific coast. Defending North America is a coalition of the United States and Canada, with Central America and Mexico having been annexed earlier in the alternate history timeline. It can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map of North America in which each 'hex' is approximately 130 kilometers (81 mi) from side to side. Distinctive color and symbology is used to represent which of the nine different terrain types dominates the hex. There is additional symbology for ports, supply sources, resource centers and amphibious landing zones. There are also map features along the hexsides including rivers, borders, and and other boundaries. Both movement and combat are affected by terrain.<br/><br/>There are 400 (7 are blank) 1/2-inch cardboard pieces (unit counters) representing the land, air, and naval military and logistics units of each combatant. The unit counters have numerical combat and movement ratings. Land and Air units are double-sided with their actual combat values on one side, and a question mark on the other side to indicate the unit's &quot;untried&quot; status, making it the first game to have this feature. Units are initially deployed as untried, and only when they are committed to combat is their true strength revealed.<br/><br/>On each turn players may move all, some or none of their units through a number of hexes equal to or less than its movement rating allows. After movement is completed units that are adjacent to enemy units may engage in combat. Combat strengths are totaled for all participating units on each side and the relative strengths are expressed as a simplified odds ratio. A 6-sided die is rolled and the appropriate odds column is consulted to determine the combat result. Combat may result in retreats and/or losses to attacker, defender or both.<br/><br/>Invasion: America includes six different scenarios lasting 8 turns and a campaign game of 60 turns. Each turn of the game represents one month. Scenario instructions define each side's order of battle and initial deployment, their unit replacement rates and victory conditions. Victory is determined by control of urban, supply and resource hexes that yield victory points.<br/><br/>Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a larger, more complicated sequel in 1978, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shards of the Jaguar is a competitive &ldquo;dungeon-deduction&rdquo; game, which requires both strategic and tactical thinking. It is about an initiation trial where you and your fellow initiates have to prove that you are worthy of your tribe's legendary animal's, the Jaguar's power.<br/><br/>The Jaguar was the defender of the tribe in the ancient times, but on a fateful day it got struck by a terrible curse and was broken into crystal shards.<br/><br/>The Shards of the Jaguar are still to be found in the Sacred Temple among the mountains, and the initiation trial is about to seek them and incorporate their power. But your journey will not be that easy. The temple is filled with perilous traps, and you have to learn how to use them, if you want to acquire the Jaguar&rsquo;s hunting instinct.<br/><br/>Try to foresee what the others will do and set clever traps against them. Collect precious crystal shards, mystical amulets and map pieces leading to the Heart of the Jaguar. Outsmart the others and be the best in this trial to become the heir of the Jaguar, the defender of the tribe!<br/><br/>Shards of the Jaguar has eight rounds, and in each round, each player sets a trap secretly (Poisonous Gas/Darts/Guards/Earthquake), and then each player moves their character in the temple spending action points. You can move, take crystal shards, perform rituals and heal yourself in your turn for the action points. But move carefully! Each space on the game board could contain a secret trap - activated by another player - so you have to pay attention to each other's movements to be able to find out which traps will be activated and so which spaces are safe for that round.<br/><br/>After each player spent their action points, you activate the traps and check who got hit by them (gathering different negative effects). If you were able to hit another player with your trap, you get glory points, as you are worthy of the Jaguar's hunting instinct. At the end of the game you count the points you get for the crystal shards, the glory points for the successful traps, and the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The Halls of Montezuma is a Card Driven Game, allowing players the opportunity to recreate the various events and actions in Mexico from 1846 to 1848. The historical cast of characters is here, from Doniphan to Arista, Scott to Santa Anna. Even Lee, Jackson, Beauregard and Grant make appearances.<br/><br/>Strategy card play allows you to move your forces, make events happen, activate the fleet, secure control of your lines of communication, and even invade Mexico with General Scott.<br/><br/>The outcome is never a foregone conclusion. Victory comes from driving Mexico's political will down to zero; but each battle's outcome is in doubt - a few troops performing superbly can defeat many troops performing poorly.

Scenarios examine the forces available over the entire 44-year period with snapshots in 1945, 1962, 1975, 1983, and 1989. The resulting force ratios not only change with weapon and OOB evolution but as a product of the tumultuous effects of the culture.<br/><br/>In addition to the typical Warsaw Pact-invades-NATO situations, the game provides for three NATO offensive scenarios. The 1945 Churchill plan to continue WW2 before the Soviets could consolidate their gains (Operation UNTHINKABLE), the mishaps of 1983 that could have launched an offensive in error, and allowing the West to capitalize on the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact nations in 1989.<br/><br/>Every game is different because while the units set up in their peace-time housing areas, each side gets an unpredictable amount of time to &quot;run up&quot; before the war actually begins while tension rises. The result will allow each side to move to deployment areas (or not) as the fates decree with all combinations of total surprise to total preparedness possible between them.<br/><br/>Iron Curtain is a fast-paced game of what is assumed to be a month of intensive combat where both sides race to fulfill their objectives before a cease-fire ends hostilities.<br/><br/>All the developments of modern warfare over this epoch are included: nuclear and chemical warfare, modern near-nuclear aviation effects, airmobile forces, attack helicopters, airborne mech forces, amphibious operations, and even the ill-fated Pentomic Division structure.<br/><br/>It is your turn to decide the fate of Europe.<br/><br/>Scenarios (all are a maximum of 10 turns):<br/>&bull; Hot Time in the Town of Berlin&mdash;1945 Western  Allies Offensive<br/>&bull; Don&rsquo;t Fence Me In&mdash;1945 Soviet Offensive<br/>&bull; If I Had a Hammer&mdash;1962 Soviet Offensive<br/>&bull; Bohemian Rhapsody&mdash;1975 Soviet Offensive<br/>&bull; Eye of the Tiger&mdash;1983 Soviet Offensive<br/>&bull; It&rsquo;s a Mistake&mdash;1983 NATO Offensive<br/>&bull; Everybody Wants to Rule the World&mdash;1989 Soviet Offensive<br/>&bull; We Didn&rsquo;t Start the Fire&mdash;1989 NATO Offensive<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>&bull; One 8-page Standard Combat Series rulebook (Version 1.8)<br/>&bull; One 52-page Iron Curtain game-specific rulebook<br/>&bull; one 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>&bull; Four dual-side printed countersheets (1120 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>&bull; two full-color Player Displays<br/>&bull; two full-color 2-sided Game Charts &amp; Tables<br/>&bull; box and 6-sided dice<br/><br/>",

It allows the player to experience some of the decisions that face a Ranger patrol leader.<br/><br/>From the Designer's Notes: &quot;In designing Ranger, I have attempted to do two things. First, I wanted to give the wargamer a realistic simulation of Ranger operations. Second, I felt the need to keep the game playable. Most tactical games have hundreds of complicated rules to memorize, but bear no relation to actual field maneuvers . . . Patrolling suits solitaire gaming fairly well. While conventional operations are the result of the efforts of numerous commanders and staff officers, patrols generally depend entirely on the patrol leader's actions . . . I made every attempt to present the tactical situations as the patrol leader would experience them. I wanted the game system to avoid excessive administrative bookkeeping and rules memorization . . . I tried to simulate patrolling from my own experiences and not be tied to more standard wargame conventions . . . The element of chance throughout Ranger is by design. No patrol leader can control his environment. He can only plan for as many possibilities as he has time and be alert and prepared to implement these contingency plans if necessary. Even the most experienced player making all the correct decisions will occasionally be destroyed. Combat is always dangerous, but even more so when forward of friendly lines.&quot;<br/><br/>Components: Rules of Play booklet, Patrolling Tactics booklet, Tactical Events booklet, laminated game map, laminated Patrol Record Log, plastic Tactical Template, Glossary folder, Combat Results Card, Tactical Reference Card, Extended Patrolling Card, 18 Mission Cards, 2 six-sided dice, China marker pencil.<br/><br/>",

She&rsquo;s the very best.<br/><br/>In each chapter of Suspects, you will read Clue cards to progress through the plot like a book, discuss and reason amongst yourselves, and form hypotheses. Your goal is to score the most points when you answer the questions about the case. The &quot;faster&quot; you answer (i.e. having drawn and read as few Clue cards as possible), the more points you will score.<br/><br/>",

Life as we know it struggles to endure on the Abaddon. Once the home of a mysterious, non-human civilization, the planet is now a desolate wasteland bearing one immensely precious resource: Feronium power crystals. The unimaginable energy contained within the crystals is coveted by two groups of humans: the Satellite City-States and the Commonwealth Alliance. Using Links &ndash; giant bio-mech suits made from modified military vehicles and alien technology &ndash; the warring factions fight a weary battle for territorial control of the Abaddon.<br/><br/>At your disposal in Abaddon is a 28&quot; x 19&quot; battlefield game board with 32 highly-detailed mech figurines, 18 free-standing landscape terrain features, over 100 game-changing Wild Fire and Weapon System cards, dozens of tokens, battle dice and a Battle Manual containing over 15 mission scenarios. Choose your allegiance and lead your army in non-stop excitement as you forge through unforgiving terrain, fight to overcome random and bizarre technological glitches, and battle your enemies in never-ending war.<br/><br/>Abaddon is a furious, two-to-four-player game of futuristic combat. Each scenario is laid out on the customizable battlefield game board with each side using a varying number of units. The game is played in turns during which a player rolls his Activation Dice, allowing him to &quot;activate&quot; certain units and move them. These mechanical units &ndash; Links &ndash; are powered by Feronium power crystals, and as they take damage these crystals are depleted. A unit that runs out of crystals is unable to continue functioning and is considered destroyed.<br/><br/>Combat is card- and dice-based. The attacker lays out his Weapon System cards, targeting defending enemy units. Once the attacker has laid out all of his planned attacks, the defender may defend with his own Weapon System cards. These cards can modify the dice rolls that are used to determine the results of the combat. Additionally, due to the experimental nature of the Links and the mysterious happenings in the Abaddon region, things can, and often will, go wrong. These malfunctions and odd happenings are represented by Wild Fire cards, the drawing of which can result in anything from possible shutdowns to anti-gravity surges.<br/><br/>Victory is determined based on stipulations presented by the chosen mission scenarios. Typically, victory is achieved by damaging and destroying your opponent's units by way of their power crystals. Each destroyed enemy crystal is worth one victory point, which players must collect in order to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Towards the end of the XIV Century, King D. Jo&atilde;o I ordered the construction of one of the most elegant Portuguese monasteries, the Monastery of Santa Maria da Vit&oacute;ria. During the construction period numerous prestigious architects, master craftsmen, and apprentices came from all over Europe motivated by financial rewards, prestige, and, importantly, the pursuit of knowledge.<br/><br/>In Moesteiro, players are architects in charge of teams of workers and master artisans and they compete for the glory of becoming the most prolific and important architect of their time.<br/><br/>The game is played over five rounds. Once all dice have been placed players will perform actions in the order of the action areas, from I to V. After that each player will have an opportunity to help build the monastery. During the game Victory Points (VPs) can be earned from the King tiles, from the village and in helping to construct the monastery. At the end of the game VPs are earned for sets of different unused stonework and stained glass tiles, as well as for their position on the labour track. The winner is the player with most VPs.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The dynasties of Ancient Egypt rise and fall. Will your rule be strong enough to survive? Feed your citizens, protect them from invaders, and secure their places in the afterlife!<br/><br/>IUNU is a card game for 2 to 4 players lasting about 30 minutes, with the game lasting eight rounds (with 2 or 4 players) and nine rounds (with 3 players). To set up, divide the cards into two decks &mdash; citizens cards and afterlife cards &mdash; shuffling each and placing them face down as draw decks. One player, selected to be the starting player, takes the starting player card with the (1) icon oriented up, rolls the three four-sided dice, and sets them in front of all the players along with the Bread and Deben counters. The starting player then deals an initial hand of cards &mdash; 2 players: 6 cards, 3 or 4 players: 5 cards &mdash; to each player, as well as 9 Debens worth of tokens.<br/><br/>Each round of game play has two phases:<br/><br/>&bull; Dynasty Phase: In turn, beginning with the starting player, each player plays one, or a set of, citizen cards of the same type in front of them to their &quot;Dynasty&quot;. For each additional card played beyond the first, the player must pay 1 Deben per card [Exception: The Scribe]. The player may then use the special ability of that card type as applicable. Note: You only use the Special Ability once when laying down sets of cards within a turn, i.e., even if you play a set of three Priest cards together in one turn, you only look at the afterlife deck once. Citizen cards have three numbered icons on their lefthand side:<br/><br/>1. Victory points (VP) that this card will score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>2. If a player has a clear majority of a type of citizen card (ties do not count) at game end, they gain this additional number of VP. This number may be further multiplied by an afterlife card. This number is also the total number of cards of that type in the deck.<br/>    <br/>3. Bread: A player gains additional VP if the Baker feeds that citizen with bread (see: The Baker).<br/><br/>&bull; Discard Phase: After each player has played one or a set of cards, all players must discard down to one card in their hand. The citizen discard and draw decks are then shuffled together and players draw back to their initial hand size. The starting player passes the starting player card to the next player to the left and it is rotated clockwise to the next round number. Lastly, the new starting player again rolls the three four-sided dice and the next round begins.<br/><br/>After the required number of rounds &mdash; or if a player cannot draw the required number of cards back from the draw deck at the end of any round &mdash; the game ends. Count victory points to determine the winner.<br/><br/>&bull; Total the number of victory points listed on each citizen card<br/>&bull; Add victory points for a majority of each citizen card type (no points awarded for ties). This value may be multiplied by an Afterlife Card. Multiple Afterlife Cards may be used but only one afterlife card per one majority may be used<br/>&bull; Add victory points for all Bread-fed citizens<br/>&bull; Every 3 Deben coins are worth one additional VP each<br/><br/>In the case of a tie the player with the most Deben coins wins.<br/><br/>",

The Republic of Venice had its eye on Methoni since the 12th century, due to its location on the route from Venice to the Eastern markets. Rich Venetian traders started to expand their territories with power and money to be a lord of Methoni which must be the promised most powerful throne.<br/><br/>In Castello Methoni, players attempt to take over castles, but with money, not military power. On a turn, a player plays a card of a certain terrain, builds a wall on the corresponding place, then places one of their houses and one other house on each side of the wall. When an area is closed by walls, it becomes a domain.  When a player builds a domain, then they pay money to the players who have a house in the area. When a player builds a domain adjacent to another domain, they can merge the domains by paying money.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more walls remain in the supply. The player who has collected the most points from coins and domains wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Normans, and their successors, had a large impact on history. Normans, from Nortmann (northman), were originally Viking raiders that settled in what would now be northern France. Normans gained territory as far away as southern Italy and Sicily, and modern day Syria. They were Crusaders, they were Kings, they were princes, and they were scoundrels. They began as raiders from the north that fought on foot and transformed themselves into Dukes, Kings, and princes that fought from horseback.<br/><br/>How many games include a battle with a Papal army? Very few, so Norman Conquests visits Italy and the Norman Count of Apulia fighting with, and capturing, the Pope. Stretching the definition to include the Norwegian King Harald (III) Hardrada (undoubtedly a northman) and his invasion of England allows us to include all three battles for the throne of England in 1066, including the most famous Norman William the Conqueror and his invasion of England. Next we catch up with two sons of William I, the Duke of Normandy and the King of England, feuding over his lands years after his death. We end with the Baron&rsquo;s War between William I&rsquo;s great-great-great-grandson Henry III and his barons who were led by Simon de Montfort.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After a brief period of collaboration, the relationship with the Natives was ruined by the Conquistadores' arrogance. A war started, and an alliance between different Natives groups factions successfully drove the invaders from their land and destroyed the city.<br/><br/>Almost fifty years later, Juan de Garay led a new expedition and founded a new city in the same area with the name of Ciudad de Trinidad. This city flourished to become modern Buenos Aires. Just like the first attempt, resources are low and the Natives, aware of the danger represented by the Spaniards, are ready to combat the intruders. To add to this tension, the English Crown has paid various Corsairs to threaten the new Spanish settlement!<br/><br/>In Trinidad players represent the heads of the Spanish families in Buenos Aires. The game is set in 1580 and covers the following 120 years, allowing the players to develop the city how they think is better. They can promote commerce with Spain, constructing a Harbor, and creating many productive buildings, or in another way, they can promote the construction of the biggest city buildings like the Cathedral, the Fort or the Cabildo. They can chase the richness, try to build an army or try to collaborate with the Church. They can link their policy to some famous city character, which will push a specific skill. But also this decision will not be easy! Some city representatives want to exploit all available resources and do a new war with Natives. Others push to collaborate with them, try to join forces and combat with the Corsairs. And you, what will you do?<br/><br/>Trinidad is a strategy game based on player actions and worker placement 2.0 mechanic, where workers have multiple functions and can be used in several different ways. The game also includes several other mechanics like action card combinations, character management, trading, and diplomacy. The game comes full of great miniatures for the historical buildings, workers, conquistadores, and warriors. Trinidad is inspired by the 2010 board game Rio de la Plata.<br/><br/>",

The brief but brutal war in 1982 began after the Argentines unexpectedly seized Stanley, the capital of the Falklands, and the island of South Georgia from small garrisons of British Royal Marines. The British government responded by sending a large naval task force to the South Atlantic to reclaim the disputed islands. Here, the fierce ground combat that occurred during the war is depicted as only the immersive squad-level Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series can.<br/><br/>The 13 scenarios Heroes of the Falklands feature the Argentine seizures of Stanley and South Georgia and all of the major land battles, from the British Paras&rsquo; costly but morale-boosting assaults on Darwin Hill and Goose Green, to the daring commando raid on Top Malo House, across East Falkland to the climatic battles for the ring of hills around Stanley. Two what-if scenarios depict Argentine opposition to the British landing at San Carlos and a last-ditch fight for control of Stanley.

These cards have symbols on them that represent their abilities and these are use to bypass threats without actually having to face them.<br/>    Objectives - These are what you are making runs on.  They are worth reputation points and usually have a task that you must best or a number of symbols that you have to match with the symbols on your runners.<br/>    Challenge - You assign these to the objectives as additional hurdles that you have to get by before you can tackle the objective.  Usually you can overcome them with the right symbols but if not they can represent nasty things you will have to fight or things that will just hurt you.<br/>    Gear - This is stuff that you assign to runners to help them make runs.  Some gear requires you to have a runner with a matching symbol.<br/>    Locations - These represent places that you control and can help you in various ways.<br/>    Contacts - These represent people that will help you. <br/>    Specials - These are instants that you play to affect the current situation.<br/><br/><br/>Everything is driven by money which is hard to come by.

Simple rules of movement and firing include all the most important features of the aircraft of the time: speed, agility and firepower. Battles are fought at five different altitudes, so there are differences between the planes in terms of climbing and descending speeds. Some specific characteristics were also taken into account, such as gyroscopic effect, which gives some aircraft exceptional maneuverability. Wind influences movement and the position of the sun affects firing accuracy, so these factors are also taken into account. A plane under attack can escape into the clouds and thus hide from the enemy. Most of the pilots are average, but there are also rookies and aces.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Many ages have past since the use of magic broke the world. Since then, the races of Oshos have lived in an unstable peace. Yet as memory slips to myth, and myth slips to legend, the &quot;Great Races&quot; once more begin meddling with magic, and the tainted power corrupts the land yet again. Lava swallows up whole villages and a terrible famine spreads. &quot;Lower&quot; nomadic races begin rising up, pillaging and raiding nearby towns for food. Peace is no longer an option. War is here, and only one race can reign supreme.<br/><br/>Ignite is a dueling deckbuilder where players battle miniatures across a variably built board. Each player has 3 units of their chosen race, each with its own asymmetrical race ability.<br/><br/>Each unit has 3 hit points. When your unit takes a point of damage you insert a dagger into the back of the miniature. The player who inflicts the last point of damage keeps the unit as a trophy. Whoever has the most trophies at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Each card in your hand can be played for its honor value (allowing you to buy more cards) or for its battle effect (affecting your units and cards). Knowing when to battle and when to invest is incredibly important.<br/><br/>In the middle of the board is the bazaar. While one of your units is here it may sell a card. Selling a card allows you to trash it (removing it permanently from your deck) and gain honor equal to its original cost, allowing you to buy more powerful cards. The bazaar is powerful, but also dangerous as your opponents are often right there next to you.<br/><br/>There are 4 special types of terrain in Ignite and you'll have to choose how best to use them.<br/><br/>     Village: Allows you to purchase a card, but a successful attack against you will do additional damage.<br/>     Forest: Protects you from ranged attacks, but fire attacks will spread through the entire forest.<br/>     Water: Necessary for certain powerful spells, but freeze and lightning attacks will spread through the entire body of water.<br/>     Lava: If you are pushed into lava, your unit immediately dies.<br/><br/><br/>In Ignite there is a strength and weakness to everything. Invest too early in powerful magic attacks, and you won't have any honor to purchase more valuable equipment when you need it. Invest in bows and arrows to gain a range advantage over the enemy, but remember, you can only shoot arrows if you also have a bow in your hand. Prefer getting up close and personal with melee weapons? Just be sure you have mounts available to bring your unit within striking distance.<br/><br/>Ignite comes from our love of deckbuilders. The main complaints against deckbuilders are that they (1) have minimal player interaction, playing a lot like solitaire (2) have an anti-climactic end-game (3) often feel the same after a few games. We built a deckbuilder where negotiation, alliance-making, and begging were legitimate strategies. Where the end of the game is the most exciting part. And where you will never play the same game twice (between the asymmetric race abilities, variably built board, and incredibly varied weapons, items, and spells).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On the Edge is a card game based on the Over the Edge RPG setting. It was one of the earliest to jump on the Magic/collectible bandwagon.  To their credit they did create a game that was very unlike Magic in play and flavor. The card types are:<br/><br/>Characters - These are your soldiers and they are laid out in a grid that is a maximum of three deep.  You can only attack or defend with the first untapped character in each row (with exceptions of course).  Some characters also generate Pull points.  These are used like money to bring cards in play or to generate influence which is needed to win so they of course must be protected.<br/><br/>Resources - These generate Pull for bringing cards into play.  Pull generated from resources can not be used to generate influence.<br/><br/>Whammy - These are instants that you can play anytime.<br/><br/>Gear - These are items you can assign to characters.<br/><br/>Condition - These are assigned to characters and can have positive or negative affects.<br/><br/>Environmental - These cards affect the game as a whole.<br/><br/>Secrets - These usually affect cards from specific conspiracies.<br/><br/>The game is generally played by putting your big hitters in your front row, your big defenders in your second row and your pull generators in your last row.  First player to generate a predetermined amount of influence wins.<br/><br/>The art on the cards is very strange and different people either love or despise.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Continental Express, players add train cars to their station in the hope of fulfilling objectives and maximizing the value of their secret contract. To start the game, each player chooses one of two contract cards dealt to them; these contracts require players to collect icons of a particular color or groups of like-colored icons or icons and company tokens of differing colors.<br/><br/>Players then take turns drafting cards from three face-up rows; the card on the end of each row costs nothing, the card in the middle costs $1, and the card closest to each of the three decks costs $2. Players start with no money, however, and the only way to get some is to draft it &ndash; but naturally that means you'll be forgoing other cards. If a player has train cars matching one of the three face-up objective cards, he can choose to discard those train cars and claim the objective &ndash; and since the objectives have the icons that satisfy contracts, you'll probably want to do that.<br/><br/>In addition to train cars and money, players can draft characters, taking the special action of a character when he drafts one. Actions include things like taking a train car of your choice from the card array, stealing all money from one player, and taking a company token of the color of your choice. The card decks also include two events, and those cards flush either the objective cards on display or the smaller cards that players draft.<br/><br/>When a player claims his fourth objective, each other player takes one more turn, then the game ends. Players tally the points scored for their contract (if any), their claimed objective cards, and any money still in hand. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

Travel to exotic locations and brave difficult terrain to take that perfect shot; win prestigious awards, and complete secret assignments for Snapshot Magazine to become Wildlife Photographer of the Year.<br/><br/>Crammed with beautiful wildlife photography, Snapshot is easy to learn but filled with exciting tactical decisions and difficult choices.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Snapshot combines dice-management with set collection and a touch of push-your-luck. Each turn, players attempt to find and then photograph the most prestigious animals by following these 3 stages:<br/><br/>Stage 1: Research<br/><br/>So, you thought you could just rock up with your camera and take a photo, eh? Well, first you need to do your homework!<br/>Turn over new animal cards to increase your options and gain tracking tokens to boost your rolls... but be careful - if you draw too many cards, the animals will get spooked, ending your turn.<br/><br/>To avoid spooking animals, you can reserve animal cards and roll for them later. However, you have a hand limit of two reserved cards at a time so be careful not to clog up your hand with animals you don't want.<br/><br/>Other players can also reserve animals on your turn so they will be keeping their eyes peeled for the animals they need!<br/><br/>Stage 2: Prepare<br/><br/>Now that you know which animals are available this turn, you must choose your destinations and subjects, represented by placing dice on the animals you plan to photograph and their habitats. The rarer the animals, and the more difficult its habitat, the higher the prestige for photographing it.<br/><br/>You can photograph as many animals in as many habitats as you have dice for... Be careful, though &ndash; go for too many difficult animals and you could end up with none, so allocate your dice wisely. You only have six dice to roll so you&rsquo;ll need to decide how best to allocate them; do you go cautious and allocate them all to one animal or spread them out and roll for more? You&rsquo;re in control of the odds so, do you feel lucky?<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t forget that you also need to use dice to explore the habitat. You only need to roll for each habitat once, so going for more than one animal in the same location can be a great tactic.<br/><br/>You can also spend tracking tokens to increase your chances: do you use them now or save them for that crucial roll later on?<br/><br/>Stage 3: Photograph<br/><br/>At last! It's time to get out into nature, click the shutter and hope for the best...<br/>First, roll the dice on each habitat to explore it. (Tokens can be used to re-roll habitat dice.) If you fail, your chosen animals are spooked and run away!<br/><br/>Then, if you explored the habitat successfully, you may roll to photograph your chosen animals!<br/><br/>If you manage to photograph 3 animals from the same habitat, or one from each habitat, you can collect the corresponding photography award. The earlier you get them, the more they are worth!<br/><br/>If you failed to get any photographs, don't worry - you learn from the experience and gain 3 tracking tokens to improve your chances next turn&hellip;<br/><br/>Game End<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has taken a set amount of photographs and everyone then gets to tally up their score.<br/><br/>Each player also has a secret Assignment card which bestows bonus prestige for photographing specific animals and characteristics.<br/><br/>Simply total the prestige on all your animal photographs, Photography Awards and Assignment card to see who becomes Photographer of the Year!<br/><br/>Snapshot is fun, fast and simple to learn and is well-suited for families while also offering enough depth and tactical opportunities to keep advanced players engaged.<br/><br/>",

Powerful warlords orchestrate grand strategies and daring battlefield tactics, their actions bringing glorious victory &mdash; or the despair of final defeat. Do you have the courage and cunning to guide your forces to ultimate triumph? Take command of the mightiest warriors and beasts to conquer the wilds of Immoren!<br/><br/>In Hordes: High Command, each player takes control of one faction of the Hordes world &ndash; Skorn, Circle of Orboros, Trollblods or Legion of Eveblight &ndash; leading whole armies of soldiers, Warlocks and mighty Warbeasts to great battles which will shake all of Immoren and change it forever. Each faction has individual decks with faction-specific warbeasts, units, and resources which assure different strategy and gameplay from the other factions. Additionally, before each game, players choose three of the five warlocks specific to their faction. This decision makes every game different and allows for multiple strategies. During the game, players play a whole season of War, trying to build up their strength, then capture strategic locations to earn victory points.<br/><br/>Hordes: High Command can be combined with the following other core sets:<br/><br/>Warmachine: High Command.<br/>Warmachine: High Command – Faith & Fortune<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The island of Luzon &mdash; the largest and most populous in the Philippines &mdash; poses a series of challenges to those seeking to build a railroad network and profit from it. The island's topography is difficult to work with as large mountain ranges collide with wetlands, and an already established shipping industry means that coastal cities will be profitable only to rail networks that have already established effective routes.<br/><br/>In Luzon Rails, players are rail investors. They buy stock in companies, seek to improve those companies, and amass wealth when company dividends pay out.<br/><br/>This game differs from cube rail games you may have played before. Variable company start locations mean that companies can feel quite different from game to game. Actions are selected by playing action cards either from hand or from a central pool, which leads players to make tough decisions and risky moves. How would you proceed in a round where it looks like there will be few auctions? How would that affect your own bids?<br/><br/>Some features on the board try to encourage varied rail types. Landlocked cities grant a long term bonus to companies that then connect to coastal cities. Manila provides a one-off dividend payment for investors who can make a company rail reach that far. And the Southern peninsula creates tight conditions if more than one company has ambitions on the cities down there.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter edition comes with an official solo-mode and the Private Companies expansion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Quite a few Gopher Ranchers have set up shop around town, and each of them will try to show you exactly what you&rsquo;ve come to see. Thanks for visiting Gopher Gulch, please remember to tell your friends!<br/><br/>~The Gopher Gulch Tourism Board<br/><br/>Players are gopher ranchers in the town of Gopher Gulch, each placing tiles to build their own warren of burrows, hoping to attract all three types of gophers. It&rsquo;s a delicate balancing act where every tile counts. Build your warren, forming burrows of three different colors. Complete a burrow of a particular color that is longer than the current shortest burrow in that color, and the gopher living there moves into the new one; it stays there until it gets lured away again by an even bigger burrow! There is one less gopher of each color than there are players, so not everyone will be able to host all three gopher types at once.<br/><br/>Every once in a while the tour bus will arrive, and the tourists will be most excited to see the types of gophers promised to them by their tour schedule. If your ranch is missing those particular gophers, you&rsquo;ll get complaints from the tourists. At the end of the tourist season, the rancher with the fewest complaints wins!<br/><br/>",

Each player must check the Projects drawn on that specific row and consider them for scoring.<br/>Check for any group of Projects in your Village: a group is defined by adjacent Projects of the same type.<br/>A group of Projects will score points at the end of the turn only if it does have at least one Project in the active row. That group will score all the points depicted on the spaces where you have drawn a Project of that type.<br/><br/>After the 9th turn, each player sum all the points scored during the game, determining their final score. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Celebrated by many as &ldquo;Afrika Korps done right,&rdquo; this two-player game allows players to explore the key elements of the Desert War, beginning in December 1940 with Wavell&rsquo;s first offensive, Operation Compass, against the Italian forces of Marshal Graziani, and culminating in December 1942 when the American&rsquo;s landed in Rommel&rsquo;s rear, thus sealing the ultimate fate of the Afrika Korps.<br/><br/>The African Campaign re-creates the ebb and flow of battle and wide-swinging action in the desert as the pendulum swings with both sides launching major offensives during the North African Campaign. Game play is swift thanks to the low counter density while capturing the key facets of the campaign including supply, ports, replacements, Axis fuel, strategic movement, air power, Flak units, minefields and more.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature Edition provides an updated treatment to the Jedko, 2nd Edition release and includes known errata along with new optional rules and variants as published in Panzerfaust/Campaign #74 (July-Aug 1976). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in playing homage to the original classic design by John Edwards. While the standard game remains true to the original, we&rsquo;ve added bonus material to explore other facets of the War in the Desert without sacrificing game playability. All components are upgraded to include a larger playing surface (1.5 maps) and 5/8&rdquo; counters to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting, to be enjoyed by both grognards and newcomers alike.<br/><br/>",

Some might dare open the door that lead to the Dragon's room.<br/><br/>The Dragon's room is an amazing place, full of golden nuggets. Once you get there, the frenezy starts around the table. You can now throw the precious golden dice, roll them as much as you can to collect as many golden nuggets as possible. But beware, other players are rolling the dragon dice, trying to wake the legendary beast up to make you lose all treasures. Will you stop in time, who is the best and more discret thief around the table?<br/><br/>On your turn, roll the dice as many times as you want, as long as you have something to score. If you roll a key and a door, you can go to the Dragon's room. Once there, roll dice as much as you want but if your opponents roll 2 dragon faces on their dice, you will lose everything you gathered.<br/><br/>Troll and dragon is a frenetic and very fun game for the whole family to play!<br/><br/>",

Each season has three rounds and you can either build, move or feed depending on the cards in your hand and the strategy you want to adopt.<br/><br/>When you build you claim benefits for your kiwi flock both immediately and at the beginning of each season.<br/><br/>Kiwi birds are hungry and love to be fed. When you feed them, they grow and can push other smaller kiwi out of the way, or even off the island. Be careful though &ndash; too much food and they explode!<br/><br/>Move your kiwi flock to strategic areas to outnumber your opponents. Use your leader or larger kiwi birds to push other players kiwis out of the way or off the board.<br/><br/>At the end of each season place domain markers to claim your territory. Domain markers = victory points. When the game ends, the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Warriors from lands both known and unknown perform upon the sands for the chance at freedom, riches, and eternal glory. Many choose this life, some are condemned to it -- they will face men, beasts, and creatures of myth, all for the favor of the crowd.<br/><br/>Arena Rex is a table-top miniatures game of gladiatorial combat.  Battles of 3 to 8 combatants per side are recommended, and take approximately 30 to 40 minutes to play. Simple, intuitive rules offer myriad tactical possibilities.  Maneuver and arena terrain play key roles in the game along with a fatigue-based activation system that twists a traditional round structure in new and exciting ways.<br/><br/>Arena Rex is a world inspired by the most exciting eras of antiquity.  The myth, hearsay, and superstition that riddles accounts of these periods is pervasive, and key historical changes lead to a setting that is both familiar and incredible.  The Roman Republic endures, as does the Gallo-Roman Empire.  The kingdom of Aegyptus is a tributary of the Roman Republic and ruled directly by an Antonian king and Ptolemaic queen. The Atlantic is not the barrier it once was, and men from the twilight lands of the north and natives of the far west join in commerce and warfare.  The year is 1253 AUC and this is not the world you know.<br/><br/>",

If a card's color matches others in a street, the player scores points equal to the highest-valued card of that color. If a card's building matches others in a street, the player receives the total sum value of all the matching buildings. Players receive a 7-point bonus for placing the 7th building in a road.

This stand-alone game adds 63 more types of aircraft, new campaigns, and action cards featuring the new aircraft!<br/><br/>Down In Flames places each player in the cockpit of a Leader and Wingman as they enter combat against other aircraft. By playing cards, you gain advantageous positions on your targets, fire your guns, and send them down in flames!<br/><br/>The game is based on a unique action-reaction card mechanic. Each card can be countered by specific other cards. At the bottom of every card is the list of cards it is allowed to cancel. This makes for exciting card play back and forth between players...<br/><br/>Player #1: &quot;I Play an In My Sights for 3 Hits.

An aircraft&rsquo;s position determines if it can attack, and how many bonus Bursts it receives if it is Advantaged or Tailing.<br/><br/>The game uses a simple Altitude system to add this vital aspect of air combat. Aircraft get to draw cards when diving, and must discard cards when climbing.<br/><br/>The game also includes Light, Medium, and Heavy Bombers that are used in the historical campaign games.<br/><br/>Components<br/>110 Full color Action Cards<br/>126 Full Color Aircraft Cards<br/>Full Color 24 Page Rulebook<br/>Full Color Counter Sheet (176 - 5/8&rdquo; counters)<br/>6 Full Color Campaigns<br/>Full Color Player Log Sheet<br/><br/>Scheduled Aircraft Cards: <br/>GERMANY<br/>Bf-110G2, Fw-190A6, He-177, Ju-87D, Me-163, Do-335, He-162, Henchel, Bf-109G10, Bf-109F2<br/><br/>JAPAN<br/>G8N Rita, N1K2 George, J7W1, Ki84 Frank, Sally, A6M8 Zeke, A6M6 Zeke<br/><br/>UK<br/>Buffalo, Spitfire IX, Lancaster, Meteor, Tempest, Halifax, Typhoon, Beaufighter<br/><br/>USA<br/>P-38F, P-47B, B-25, B-17G, Avenger, B-29, B-24J, F4U-4<br/><br/>SOVIET<br/>I-15, I-153, I-16-29, LaGG-3, La-5, Yak-3<br/><br/>FRENCH<br/>M.S. 406, D.520, Potez 630, MB-152, Amiot 143, LeO.451, Farman F.222<br/><br/>ITALIAN<br/>C.R. 42 Falco, M.C. 200 Saetta, M.C. 202 Folgore, M.C. 205 Veltro, G.50 Freccia, Re-2001, Re-2005, Breda Ba.88, Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, Savoia-Marchetti SM.81, Breda Ba.65, Piaggio P.108<br/><br/>Scheduled Campaigns<br/>Italian<br/>French<br/>Daylight 1945<br/>Pacific 1944<br/>Soviet<br/>North Africa<br/><br/>The aircraft and campaign list is still a work in progress.

King Kyros clings on to power by any means necessary; his estranged Queen Eleftheria has joined a rebellion of conquered people; and their daughter, Princess Beatus, has rejected both of her parents to fight alongside the church.<br/><br/>The players, as members of a secret society, wield great influence over the destiny of Aclysmia, but their job is not to set things right. They just want be on the winning side when the fighting ends. By weaving Machiavellian alliances and determining the outcome of crucial battles, they accrue influence for when the war finally resolves.<br/><br/>Shadow Throne is played over the course of several battles. To start each battle, players gain control over characters from the warring factions by drafting a hand of cards. Next, players simultaneously play cards from their hands to determine which faction wins the battle. Players can freely switch alliances, playing cards from any faction. After the battle is fought, the faction with the most power wins, and players who played cards from that faction collect influence points. Once one player has collected enough influence, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wargame based around the WW2 Western Allied campaign from just after the Normandy invasion to the crossing of the Rhine.<br/><br/>First significant mechanic is the unpredictable turn order - players dice for each turn, with the highest taking the turn. However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).<br/><br/>Second significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.<br/><br/>These mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.<br/><br/>The Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.<br/><br/>Victory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game. The big mounted map with large hexes and counters remove the 'fiddle factor' which can blight wargames with lower production values.<br/><br/>Republished in Command Magazine Japan #64 in 2005.<br/><br/>",

Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.<br/><br/>Players take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.<br/><br/>The currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).<br/><br/>Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.<br/><br/>Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.<br/><br/><br/>As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.<br/><br/>There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.<br/><br/>Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).<br/><br/>",

It's a pure abstract 2 player game, white versus black, the board is somewhat similar to the one in Brain Trainer or Othello.<br/><br/>Epaminondas is named after the Theban general who invented the phalanx formation he used to defeat the Spartans in 371 B.C. The term &quot;phalanx&quot; is used in the game to describe a connected group of two or more pieces in a straight line, either orthogonally or diagonally.<br/><br/>Epaminondas is played on a 14 x 12 checkered board with 28 black pieces and 28 white pieces. The objective is to move your pieces across the board onto your opponent's back rank, the row closest to him, by moving your phalanxes and capturing enemy pieces.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/>Crossings that is on a 8x8 board.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets three Movie Cards and has 30 seconds to get their team to guess all the movies using one of three methods&mdash; using just one word, quoting a line from the film, or acting it out. When a team gets one right, they add the card to their collection.

Alongside these towering monsters, lesser minions such as powerful tanks, fighter jets, flying saucers, fearsome dinosaurs, and demonic fiends fight to capture important locations and help power their monster to victory.<br/><br/>Monsterpocalypse Miniatures Game represents an updated and streamlined second edition of the original Monsterpocalypse collectible game from 2008. Players can choose two different agendas when building their armies: the noble Protectors, who want to save the world and the creatures that inhabit it from destruction, or the evil Destroyers, who seek to enslave and destroy the Earth for their own diabolical purposes. Both agendas feature three different factions, each with its own unique monsters and units. Players can mix and match any models from the factions within their agenda when building their army.<br/><br/>The game debuts with two different one-player starter sets, one for each of the two agendas. These starter sets will be expanded by monster, unit, and building packs that contain new models for players to use in their games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A party game for horrible German people&quot;<br/><br/>Play begins with a judge, known as the &quot;Round Boss&quot;, choosing a red fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players. Each player holds a hand of eight white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes more) to the round boss, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The round boss determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent a point, and then the player to the left of the Round Boss becomes the new Boss for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, or until they are thrown out of the pub, at which point the player with the most Points is the winner.<br/><br/>Kampf gegen das Spie&szlig;ertum is the German adaption of Kampf gegen das B&uuml;nzlitum, a Swiss party game by Angela V&ouml;gtli and is a hommage to the popular Cards against Humanity.<br/><br/>It features all new cards with German celebrities, places and topics of interest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It seems that Andromeda is the abandoned wreck of a spaceship from an ancient, vanished race. Every modern race knows that these Ancients had fantastic technologies far beyond those now known, and many wish to seize the ship's secrets for themselves.

        "description": "18DO-Dortmund is a strategic economy game, which reflects the development of the most important industries in Dortmund during the 19th century.<br/><br/>Dortmund has been a town of beer brewers since the medieval age. About 1840 the first underground mining started and the first steel mill has been built. The connection with the German railway net pushed the industrial development of Dortmund furthermore. The expansion of coal mines and steel mills led to a population increase. From the latter the Dortmund breweries benefited as the demand for beer boosted. At the end of the 19th century the Dortmund breweries used conditioned cars to transport the Dortmund Export beer by railway to distant regions.<br/><br/>In 18DO-Dortmund the players are investors who invest in both, breweries and railway corporations. Each player starts with a private brewery. In addition every player may found a railway corporation. Coal mines and steel mills have a passive role only, but their locations have an impact on the game&rsquo;s development. All breweries are located in the hex &ldquo;Dortmund City&rdquo;. They produce and supply beer and during the course of the game they improve their brewery equipment in order to scope with the increasing requirements of the beer market which a separate element of the game. The railway corporations are more dynamic. From their starting field at the border of the map they lay tracks to the coal mines and steel mills. On this tracks they run their trains virtually and achieve income according to the value of the hexes which are part of their trains&rsquo; routes. When connecting the locations of coal mines and steel mills with the railway network the demand for beer will be increased. This reflects that the coal mines/steels mills with a railway link are able to increase their capacities and the consequently needed higher workforce will trigger an increase of beer consumption. Later in the game the breweries start shipping beer by using the transport capacity of the railway corporations. In order to do so the train of a railway corporation must run a route that leads from the &ldquo;Dortmund City&rdquo; hex to one of the red off-board destination hexes.<br/><br/>While the railway companies start the game as corporations the brewery corporations will be founded later during the game. For this purpose private breweries may be converted into brewery corporations.  In order to give an owner/director of a brewery more room for decisions there are special function tokens which will give each brewery specific advantages.<br/><br/>When a corporation pays dividends the owner of its shares receive the due payment by the bank. In addition the stock value of these shares will be increased. At the end of games all players accumulated their possessions&rsquo; which consists of their private cash plus the value of their share portfolio.  This richest player will win!<br/><br/>Description by the author<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ruins: Death Binder is a 1 to 2 player board game that incorporates unique reverse deck building and dungeon crawling mechanics. This is a game where you stand against great odds with very limited resources, you do your best to survive and push forward and test different strategies. You will learn to master and manage your cards and possibilities, as the game becomes only harder with time.<br/><br/>Each player chooses his path and delves into the dungeon filled with different events and encounters.<br/><br/>During the game your character gains taint, more taint it gathers the stronger and more difficult enemies are sent your way. Use action cards in combinations to defeat enemies and use their weaknesses. But be aware of their strengths and different abilities.  Thin your starting deck and store cards that fit your play style to form a new, more fitting deck. Gain experience points to use rest actions and make the character your own by upgrading various traits, to make him tougher, deadlier and more capable fighter. Partake on side quests that will give you even more resources and aid.<br/><br/>Doomsday clocks that are built into the core of the game will make you think on each step of the journey. Watch for an exhausting and limited number of action cards, ever-increasing numbers, and strength of enemies and finally, encountering a boss. In this game, even the simplest decisions may end up having a great impact on your journey.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By February 1814, Wellington had invested the French city of Bayonne and was pressing into the French interior with two goals in mind: driving the French army away from the important port city of Bordeaux, and bringing Soult's army to bay. Soult's Army of the Pyrenees, outnumbered and outclassed by Wellington's veteran forces, fell back towards the east, defending a series of river lines. Wellington's troops, showing excellent coordination between their maneuvering wings, were able to turn Soult out of these strong defensive positions one by one, all the while driving toward the inland city of Toulouse.<br/><br/>On February 26, Wellington's lead elements were able to exploit a gap in the French cavalry screen and began crossing the Gave de Pau River unopposed, moving in the direction of Orthez. Soult chose not to fall back, and arrayed his six divisions in excellent defensive positions on the high ground north and west of the town. On February 27, he would be attacked by Wellington's eight divisions.<br/><br/>Orthez focuses on the infantry game, and as such serves as an excellent introduction to the system. Artillery plays a supporting role, and there are only a half dozen or so cavalry regiments per side. For the first time we see Wellington and the British on the attack. Command control plays a critical role, and highlights the differences between Wellington's veteran and well-established command hierarchy and Soult's more makeshift organization. British advantages include numerical superiority, command flexibility and their excellent infantry. The main French advantage is the terrific defensive terrain and the defense of interior lines. Make no mistake though, this is a very tough battle for the French.<br/><br/>In addition to the main battle scenario, there are several smaller scenarios that can be played to conclusion in a long evening. A variety of optional rules are included to provide replayability and variability for face to face or solitaire play.<br/><br/>La Bataille D'Orthez will feature two hand drawn maps of the battlefield by Rick Barber, as well as 420 state of the art counters and the usual assortment of charts and tables. The rules will be contained in a single book, and will be based on those included in La Bataille de Lutzen.<br/><br/>scale = 100 m/hex; <br/>time = 20 min/GT; <br/>strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)<br/><br/>",

Players have three goals which will help them earn points: capturing targets, completing contracts, and purchasing droids and crates at the Jawa market.<br/><br/>There is no down-time in this drafting game: everyone plays at the same time. Players start with 4 cards in hand. Each turn, players pick a card from one of the available piles (targets, hunters, contracts, and Jawa market). Then, they can choose to either play or sell a card. Finally, they pass their remaining hand to their left-hand neighbor.<br/><br/>Target cards have defense values, while hunter and droid cards have attack values. To capture a target, players must equal or exceed the target&rsquo;s defense values by placing hunter and droid cards in front of their targets. Once a target is defeated, it is placed horizontally.<br/><br/>Players may also fill contracts by choosing contract cards. These grant bonus points for capturing specific targets and purchasing crates.<br/><br/>The first player to capture 4 targets earns bonuses, and this triggers the final 2 turns. Using the scorepad, players count the points they earned from capturing targets, filling contracts, and purchasing crates, and they deduce points they spent to hire hunters. The player with the most points is declared the best bounty hunter in the galaxy!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.<br/><br/>The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!<br/><br/>UNDO: Cherry Blossom Festival is one of three initial cases of the innovative new game series UNDO. As players travel through the dead man&rsquo;s past and try to give him a future, they gradually explore a touching story about love, loss and family.<br/><br/>Okayama, Japan, March 2000: A man in his sixties lies lifelessly on the floor of his living room, a broken wine glass and the photo of a young woman in a wheelchair next to him. The deceased wears an old-fashioned blue suit and has no visible injuries aside from a barely perceptible scar above the eye. In his jacket a telephone rings with the melody of &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; and on the table lie cherry blossom branches...<br/><br/>This title isn't about solving a crime or catching a murderer. Instead, players must embrace their role as disembodied destiny weavers to go through the past of this man's travel to prevent his death. Everyone who leaps through time carries a momentous decision that in the end will determine whether he lives or dies?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Volume 9 of the &quot;Great Battles of History&quot; series.<br/><br/>Caesar in Alexandria challenges the best GBoH players out there by allowing them to conduct both land and naval operations at the same time, in this simulation of Julius Caesar's rather rash pas de deux with the Egyptians in 47 BC. Caesar and the Romans - the VI, XXVII, and XXXVII legions, lots of archers and auxiliaries, and a dangerous contingent of field artillery - control the center of the city, including the Palace and the Inner Harbor. The Egyptians - a mixture of heavy, medium, and light infantry, and a numerically superior galley fleet - control the Outer Harbor, the rest of the city, and all land approaches to it.<br/> The Romans must defend their city position and also take control of the Heptastadium, the bridge that connects the city to the island of Pharos and its lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.<br/> Caesar in Alexandria combines GBoH with War Galley, with rules for both systems included. On land, the game is closer to Simple GBoH (which is not needed to play this), mostly because the form of warfare involved here: street-fighting. Caesar in Alexandria also uses the SGBoH command and activation system, which is what produces the large dose of tension. Do you move legions to protect your inner defense, or do you continue to attack the town of Pharos to gain access to the Heptastadium? Do you transport land troops to the island, or do you move your battle galleys out to sea, around Pharos, and into the Outer Harbor to attack the Egyptian fleet? Each turn you can do only one, all the while your opponent is considering his several, difficult options.<br/><br/>Included are some small scenarios for quicker play.<br/><br/>",

These two types of birds must reach their breeding ground in good shape by eating berries and bugs to gain energy on route &ndash; but flying costs them energy.<br/><br/>In Tweeeet, each player is a bird and belongs to the robins or the bluethroats. The landscape tiles build a migration route from south to north. In this landscape are empty spaces (grassland), impassable spaces (lakes), and tree spaces, which hold the birds' food. Each turn you move to a new tree space, and the number of spaces moved equals the amount of energy lost. But you eat the food in the tree where you land &ndash; eating a strawberry brings 2 energy points, purple berries 3, a caterpillar 4, and a beetle 5 &ndash; so each turn your energy level goes down (because you fly) and up (because you eat).<br/><br/>Birds of the same type (robins or bluethroats) can speak about tactics together if they are within a &quot;crow flies&quot; distance of six spaces from one another. When they're seperated by 7-9 spaces, they may only twitter, and when ten or more spaces apart, they may only flap their wings.<br/><br/>When the surviving birds reach their breeding ground in the north, birds of the same type flock together. Once all birds are in their nests, you calculate the average energy level of your team to see which team is the strongest in the end.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Jijbent.nl (turn-based, Dutch)<br/><br/><br/>",

One player plays the &ldquo;Hako Onna&rdquo; (the Woman in the Box), and the rest are &ldquo;Visitors&rdquo;, who are trying to escape from the mansion. As Visitors, you&rsquo;ll try not to make noise as you search the shadowy rooms of the mansion for items to protect yourself, for information, and for a way to escape what you do not see, but know is there. But if you stumble upon the Hako Onna, you&rsquo;re dead. Players who discover the Hako Onna become a Hakobito, one of her servants, and wake up with her to move throughout the house.<br/><br/>During most of Hako Onna's turn, the human players must keep their eyes closed so they cannot see where she moves to or what action she has done. The game also features a unique optional dexterity element that adds to the game's overall tension and dread. Before a visitor can take their turn, they need to avoid making noise by stacking a small disc on top the previous ones; if the tower collapses, they've made noise and it instantly becomes Hako Onna's turn.<br/><br/>Hako Onna can win the game in two ways:<br/><br/>    If all visitors are turned into Hakobito, or<br/>    If she has made it impossible for the visitors to win.<br/><br/><br/>The human players can win in one of three ways:<br/><br/>    If they manage to kill Hako Onna after finding her only weakness,<br/>    If they find the secret exit, while in posession of the key ring hidden inside the safe, or<br/>    If they can bring peace to Hako Onna by bringing the remains of her body to her precious doll, Mary.<br/><br/><br/>Since its original publication in Japanese, Hako Onna has reached its fourth edition, and has been republished in English by WizKids.

Having the role of a stellar creator, your task is to decorate the night sky using colorful dice as stars and win the competition among other creators who share the same goal. Choose your star dice carefully, foresee your opponents' moves. and take risks at the right moment in order to claim victory.<br/><br/>Over the seven rounds of the game, you form your constellation one die at a time, building off either or both of the &quot;starting stars&quot; on the player board. To set up, roll the six colors of d8 dice, then place them on the central game board. Place the d4, d6, d10, and d12 dice in each of the six colors to the side. On a turn, choose either:<br/><br/><br/>    One of the d8 dice without changing the value on it<br/>    Any three dice not previously claimed (with d8 dice being an option), then roll those three dice and choose one of them, returning the other dice to the central game board or the side as appropriate.<br/><br/><br/>Place your chosen die in your constellation, either as a star branching off one of your starting stars or as a star branching off a previously placed star. Each starting star and each placed star may have at most two branches off of it, and each placed star must have a lower value than the star from which it's branching off.<br/><br/>If a newly placed star has more sides than the star it's branching off of, you immediately score 2 points. Otherwise, you score points only at game's end, with your dice scoing points based on their color. For example, with yellow you score 1, 3 or 6 points for having one, two, or at least three yellow dice. Blue dice are worth only 1 point each, unless two blue dice branch off one star, in which case the pair is worth 4 points. Black dice score based on their sum off each starting star, and red dice based on how many even or odd non-red dice are on the same line. Whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>You can also play Twinkle with mission cards that reward the player with the lowest total sum, the fewest types of dice, the fewest colors, and so on, with 1-3 of these mission cards in play as desired.<br/><br/>",

In the battles of Sidi Barani, Bardia, Tobruk, and Mechili, the Italian 10th Army had been soundly defeated but remained intact to defend the gates of Tripoli.<br/><br/>On this, the 58th day of the offensive, the remaining operational tanks of 7th British Armoured Division and a small advanced detachment of men, guns, and armored cars are attempting to block the last escape route for the Italians.<br/><br/>The Italians, yet unaware of the fast approaching Western Desert blocking force, will soon find themselves desperately racing against time to break through near the small village of Beda Fomm and escape into Tripolitania before it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/>The time is 1200 hrs, 5 February 1941<br/><br/>The complete destruction of the remnants of the Italian 10th Army hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe GameBeda Fomm marks the triumphant return of one of the truly classic gaming gems originally released in 1979 by Game Designers Workshop during what many consider the heyday of traditional conflict simulation gaming. This fast-playing, operational-level game of the Battle of Beda Fomm represents a classic blend of simple gaming mechanics with nail-biting action suitable for solitaire or competition play.<br/> Relive the drama as the British player, maneuvering your outnumbered but superior armored vehicles and supporting personnel and weapon units to cut-off and summarily destroy the retreating Italian forces. As the Italian player, you have strength in overall numbers, but your formations are brittle and are hampered by a lack of maneuverability in attempting to break through and escape complete destruction. Simple mechanics capture the flavor of desert warfare along with the unique qualities and characteristics of the opposing forces.<br/><br/>This Consim Press edition represents a re-mastering of the original release by introducing many enhancements while remaining true to the original game design.

        "description": "THE CHARGE OF THE 3 KINGS 1212: BATTLE OF LAS NAVAS DE TOLOSA<br/><br/>An epic clash between Christian and Muslim armies with a dynamic impulse-based game system that will delight even the most demanding strategists.<br/><br/>In 1212, Alfonso VIII decided that it was time to take revenge for his defeat at Alarcos a few years earlier at the hands of the Almohads. They had come to the Peninsula from the Maghreb imposing their rule and strict religious norms on the Andalusians with plans to expand Islam into the Christian-held territories. At that time, the Peninsula was divided into fie Christian kingdoms: Castile, Leon, Aragon, Portugal, and Navarre. However, being bound by the same religion did not stop them from fighting amongst themselves, and by no means where they unified nor did they have the same interests. Alfonso VIII of Castile requested the bull of the crusade for his fight against the Almohads, which meant that if he could not get the other Christian kingdoms to participate, he could at least make sure he would not be attacked from behind as he advanced south. The Pope grants this endeavor the status of a crusade, which results in knights and kings from other kingdoms and places in Europe joining Alfonso&rsquo;s campaign, in addition to his neighbors on the Peninsula.<br/><br/>Each player has 5 formations and a deck of tactical cards and a deck of strategic cards. During his turn, the player will receive tactical and strategic cards and will activate 3 of his formations, each in a different impulse and alternating with his opponent. In each impulse you can play a tactical card, even in the opponent's impulse if the card is a reaction card. Additionally, during any moment of the turn, the player can play a strategic card.<br/><br/>&bull;    Recreate this epic battle in less than 3 hours.<br/>&bull;    The game cards allow players to alter the game rules in order to surprise their opponent and foil their plans.<br/>&bull;    Each side has at their disposal a wide variety of units with special abilities that affect the course of the battle, along with a unique deck of cards that will en-sure no two games are alike.<br/>&bull;    Thanks to the game&rsquo;s impulse-based system and the possibility to interrupt your opponent&rsquo;s turn, both players will have a great time as the battle unfolds. <br/>&bull;    The game&rsquo;s design and illustration has been meticulously crafted with the idea of immersing players in a medieval-themed experience. <br/>&bull;    Historical accuracy. Includes a scenario book that pro-vides a detailed summary of the battle, how it unfold-ed, the aftermath, as well as an example of play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sky Galleons of Mars is a board game set in the fantasy Victorian era of space exploration.  It is essentially the tactical ship combat game for the &quot;Space: 1889&quot; role-playing system.<br/><br/>The game has a lot of mechanics that are similar to Star Fleet Battles and Interceptor.  It has a distinct 'naval' feel about it though... think of a game like Wooden Ships & Iron Men, with altitude thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns of three phases.  In the Initiative Phase, players form or disband boarding parties and change crew assignments.  They also roll dice to see who becomes the First Player that turn.<br/><br/>Two Movement/Fire Phases follow.  The moving player moves all of his vessels, both players fire (depending on range, weapon, etc.), damage is taken, then the second player repeats the full move/fire action.<br/><br/>Two large hex, beautifully rendered maps are included in the game to accomodate detailed plastic ships.  The rules are broken into two parts: Basic (the game at its simplest level with basic rules for moving, firing, taking damage, etc.) and Advanced (adds more detailed rules such as: ramming and grappling, towing, small arms, crew quality, etc.).  Also included are seven Scenarios and rules for a Campaign game.<br/><br/>Replaced by Ironclads And Ether Flyers<br/><br/>",

Other than the three great blocs, there are but a handful of countries left hanging on to relative neutrality.<br/><br/>As the conflict grew longer, old alliances were broken while new ones were formed. Nowadays, the leading powers of the past are assembled into three huge states:<br/><br/>&bull; The Allies have gathered around the U.S.A. This great coalition of nations includes, among others, the British Commonwealth and the French colonial empire.<br/>&bull; To secure their survival against their powerful enemies, Germany, Japan, and Italy have merged as the Axis. The rise of this totalitarian state was helped by the successful assassination of the F&uuml;hrer in 1943 following operation Walkyrie.<br/>&bull; The USSR and communist China have united their fates to build the SSU, or Sino-Soviet Union. Becoming a planetary power, the communist bloc intends to impose its way of life on all other continents.<br/><br/>Throughout the world, the three blocs are fighting to gain exclusive control over a revolutionary ore: Vk. This ore has revealed extraordinary properties and brought forth the design of gigantic combat robots, capable of challenging the world's most advanced tanks.<br/><br/>The discovery and first military applications of Vk came from Germany. Everything concerning this ore is shrouded in mystery. Rumors have been going around saying its secrets were revealed by aliens from another planet &mdash; but who could take such rumors seriously after years of war propaganda?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By the year 70 of the Common Era (CE), the province of Judea had been in revolt against Rome for nearly 4 years. The protests and riots that began in 66 CE had quickly turned into open rebellion. The standard Roman punitive force under Syrian legate Cestius Gallus, having failed to capture Jerusalem, was wiped out at Beth Horon. General Vespasian was given command of the Roman army in the region and ordered to crush the rebellion and restore order. Turmoil in Rome, however, saw Vespasian recalled to become Emperor. In early 70 CE, Emperor Vespasian dispatched his son Titus (a future Emperor) along with four legions to end the rebellion in this important province. Titus arrived in Jerusalem in April to find the city still at war with itself. Throughout the rebellion, differing Judean factions had fought a bitter internecine war among themselves. The primary factions fighting each other in Jerusalem at this time were controlled by Simon bar Giora and John of Gischala. With the arrival of Titus and his legions, however, they were now faced with a common threat to their immediate survival.<br/><br/>The brutal siege of Jerusalem lasted nearly five months. During the siege, city walls were breached one-by-one, much of the city devastated, and the Temple&mdash;central to both the Jewish religion and the defense of the city&mdash;destroyed and burned. With the capture of Jerusalem, Titus had effectively ended the Judean revolt, with the last of the rebels finally cornered and eliminated in the legendary siege of Masada in 73 CE.<br/><br/>Storm Over Jerusalem: The Roman Siege is a 2-player wargame simulating the Siege of Jerusalem in 70AD.&nbsp; One player controls the Roman forces, and the other player controls the Judean forces.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Using the Area Move system redefined in Storm Over Stalingrad and Storm Over Dien Bien Phu, the game features the use of tactical cards to augment game play, adding to the tension experienced by both sides. The rules are similar in length to those seen in previous Storm Over games, and are of the same level of complexity, with additions made for the situations encountered in this battle.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Additional rules added to the game include Siege Towers, the Walls of Jerusalem, and Judean leaders.&nbsp; In addition to these new rules, new cards have been created in order to represent events encountered during the battle. These include &ldquo;Battering Rams&rdquo;, &ldquo;Famine&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rigging the Colonnades&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Escape the Siege&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: approximately 10 - 14 days<br/>Area: approximately 1&quot; = 300ft / 91 meters<br/>Units: Legions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (108 3/4&quot; counters w/ 1 blank)<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (54 3/4&quot; &amp; 88 5/8&quot; counters w/ 17 blanks)<br/>One 12-page full color rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed player aid cards<br/>One deck of 55 tactical playing cards<br/>Four 6 sided dice (2 red &amp; 2 blue)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Low<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 (or more)<br/>Playing Time: 2-3 hours<br/><br/>",

Units are upright and specific information about them is hidden from the other player.  Army groups are made up of 5-6 different units; each unit is roughly division sized.  Map areas are irregular, and the board covers basically from the Soviet Union to France.  Time scale is unspecified, but appears to be in the days per turn range.  Advanced rules add air combat, airborne units, and chemical weapons.<br/><br/>",

(from the Foundry webpage).<br/><br/>This beautiful 136-page book lays out rules for gunfights (and bar fights and knife fights) using miniatures to represent the famous gunslingers of the old American West.  Beyond the rules for combat, the book is really an invitation to start a light RPG compaign, evaluating each member of your potential gang and assigning a dollar value to keep him on retainer.  So use your old railroad buildings to stage a gunfight or created an entire economic campaign pitting the ranchers against the sod-busters.  All the tools are in this book.<br/><br/>Like all Games Workshop books, there is plenty of eye candy and tips on painting and scenery.<br/><br/>LotOW is proportedly based on Warhammer and Lord of the Rings tabletop battle game with Necromunda and Mordheim mixed in.<br/><br/>",

Players then see what the opponent chose before assembling a deck of ten out of 22 cards, with the players choosing cards both to take advantage of their own megami powers and to exploit their opponent's weaknesses. Players then duel to see who will be victorious.<br/><br/>The game uses a single kind of token to represent life, distance, aura (defense), and flare (special/gauge). The tokens represent this based on the zone they occupy, by moving tokens between zones you attempt to gain the ideal position and set up to use as many attacks as possible, or be prepared to avoid attacks.<br/><br/>The gameplay at its core is simple, and due to its limited environment, it is relatively easy to learn the cards for a deck-construction game. Building a deck and playing normally takes less then 20 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

A new cemetery must be built to handle the needs of London for the indefinite future, outside of the city limits - far enough away that growth won't be an issue. The only way to transport the deceased and their loved ones to the cemetery is by train. This new system needs to be designed and you and your fellow planners have been tasked with submitting proposals. The most successful design will be awarded the contract by the city and your name will be listed among the great planners of history.<br/><br/>Each turn in London Necropolis Railway, you choose a card and take the two associated action discs. You then activate 1-3 of the actions on the card, spending the discs of the matching colors, to improve your London Terminus, the Brookwood Necropolis, and/or the Railway that connects the two. You need to manage your money, your staff, and make sure you can keep pace with your improvements in each section. In addition, you can spend action discs to improve the prestige of your system, in order to gain more points for your London improvements.<br/><br/>Points come primarily from two areas: how prestigious you&rsquo;ve made the London Terminus and how well you've filled the Necropolis. After twelve rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the XVI century Italy was the scene of wars and dynastic quarrels. In the Papal States, Pope Paul III knew he could rely on the strength of the powerful Orsini family to oppose the power of his enemies. In 1542 Pierfrancesco II Orsini, called Vicino, inherited the fief of Bomarzo, which elected to his residence, along with the fiefs of Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero and Mompeo. In 1547 Vicino Orsini wanted to celebrate the grandeur of his family, by commissioning one of the greatest architectural wonders of Italy. Within a natural amphitheater were masterfully carved huge mythological figures, whose sublime beauty enchants and terrifies those who are in their presence. Even today the park is shrouded in mystery: is it a Sacred Grove in which to bring votive offerings to the gods or a Park of Monsters made to scare poor people? It's rumored that Vicino Orsini owed his own fortune to the devotion shown to the gods and to the offers that he brought to them.<br/><br/>In Bomarzo, you will have to delve into the mystery of the park, to propitiate the gods and obtain their favor. You&rsquo;ll play the role of one of the feudal lords of the Orsini and you&rsquo;ll manage one of four minor feuds, Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero or Mompeo, trying to earn the esteem of your lord. If you&rsquo;ll develop your feud in the best way you will manage to prevail over your rivals. Do not forget the supernatural forces that dwell in Bomarzo: your existence and your achievement will be influenced by how you manage to turn in your advantage the will of the monsters of the park.<br/><br/>Bomarzo is a game of deep strategy for 2-4 players, the short duration of which gives to the players' choices even more decisive importance. The careful management of resources will allow you to easily take advantage of the power of the monstrous deity of the park. Each turn you will be able to perform various operations in your fief and also you will have to choose which god ingratiate, through workers placement bound by auction. But beware: each divinity of the park requires a very specific offer to concede his favor otherwise unleash his monstrous fury on unwary visitors! To triumph in Bomarzo you not only need the best development but mostly to have tied your for-tunes to the most powerful and prestigious deity.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It was far too easy to progress into this dark dungeon, far too easy...but you progressed anyway, and when you reached its very last level, you had the bad idea to wake up the sorcerer &mdash; the big boss &mdash; and now the only way you can survive is to rush out the exit.<br/><br/>Rush Out! is an asymmetric and hectic game for 3-5 players, with 2-4 heroes trying to escape while the sorcerer casts spells against them. Everybody plays simultaneously, with each &quot;team&quot; rolling and re-rolling dice (three per hero, and five for the sorcerer) in order to complete cards. Each player can place dice on only one card at a time, and each ordeal card on the heroes' side can be completed by at most two people. As soon as a card has all of its symbols covered, you carry out its effect (in the case of the sorcerer), then draw a new card. The first &quot;team&quot; to draw the final card of their deck wins.<br/><br/>The game is divided into trainings first, followed by scenarios. Each time you progress in the rules, you are invited to play game before going further, so step by step, you learn the following rules (which often add new cards to decks):<br/><br/><br/>     When the sorcerer completes specific cards, they can remove one or all of the heroes' dice from a card they are trying to complete.<br/>     By completing dracology spells, the sorcerer can move a dragon pawn onto a card on the heroes' side of the board. Heroes cannot remove this card from play, but can play on and remove other cards; by using wilds on their dice, the heroes can push the dragon back. If the dragon moves all the way onto the heroes' deck, the sorcerer wins the game.<br/>     By completing specific spell cards, the sorcerer can forbid a hero from using a specific symbol, although this restriction can be cancelled by the hero under certain circumstances.<br/>     By completing cards, heroes can experience, and they can use this experience to make their wild symbols more effective. (For each hero, normally a rolled joker on a die is equal to a specific symbol, but this experience gives you options).<br/>     The sorcerer can damage heroes, requiring them to heal themselves &mdash; possibly with the help of their friends &mdash; before they can attempt to complete ordeal cards.<br/><br/><br/>Rush Out! includes a half-dozen scenarios beyond the training games, and each scenario is played as a best-of-three series of games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You start with four cards in hand; after seeing them, shuffle them and place them so that all other players can see them, but not you.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player requests a card from an opponent. If the opponent refuses to hand it over, they keep in their area for scoring at game's end; if they do hand it over, they can try to claim a card from the active player's hand &mdash; and the active player can then agree to this trade (with players swapping cards and scoring them) or refuse (with each scoring their own card). Whatever happens, players refill their hands to four cards.<br/><br/>Each player arranges cards in columns according to their color, with colors corresponding to the four zones in which the city is divided: the playground, the boardwalk, the central station, and downtown. At the end of the game, depending on the majorities, players earn points based on their card combinations.

The continent has been bought and broken in two by experiments of a powerful corporation Cerbero. Now it kneels divided waiting for the fall. The government is non-existent and so are any laws of men. Desolated wastelands are roamed by mutated beasts, decades-old machines running on corrupted software and degenerate humans who are  even more dangerous. In those few pockets of civilization left people are more interested in survival than in progress. Values like compassion and responsibility are scarce &ndash; even scarcer are fuel and ammo needed to face new reality. But things are about to change as there are still those who care. Will you muster enough hope to fight for better future? Will you stand tall and shine the beacon of your courage in this darkest of times? The Waste is calling &ndash; better be ready to answer&hellip;<br/><br/>Waste Knights is a post-apocalyptic adventure game for 2-4 players set in dystopian Australia now called the Waste.  Each player becomes a hero who travels around the continent fighting monstrous enemies, accomplishing Tasks to acquire new Gear Cards and hoping to gain enough Reputation in order to fulfill the Mission being played. All players share a common goal set by the Mission, but only the quickest and the most cunning will manage to win!<br/><br/>Waste Knights features unique rules&rsquo; systems. Players need to manage 4 different resources: Fuel, Ammo, Health and Radiation as reaching a certain level in any means almost certain death in the Waste. They move using different Vehicles, face threats shown on Wasteland Cards and explore various locations on a modular, hexagonal map that is formed of 37 hexes. Combat is both deadly and rewarding as players set the range, utilize Combat Cards with different maneuvers and have various melee and ranged weapons at their disposal. Additionally the Waster, the person opposite the active player, controls the game to some extent choosing threats and making combat decisions for enemies.<br/><br/>But Waste Knights is not only about fighting and moving. Players progress by accomplishing Tasks &ndash; short quests given by inhabitants of the Waste. Some of them require tactical acumen, others are based on Skill tests or getting certain goods. Finally, a unique barter system allows players to trade Gear Cards of different colors as in the post-apocalyptic future there is no currency system whatsoever. Thanks to this some players will win by strength while others by brains &ndash; and all will have a good time playing!<br/><br/>",

Ideally, you will be able to play this with 3+ players.<br/><br/>The story:<br/><br/>Long ago, when the realm was fledgling, the five Great Houses of the Valeria were constantly bickering, stealing, conspiring, and even assassinating each other &mdash; all for the chance to become the wealthiest and most powerful House in the Kingdom! Thrones of Valeria evolved from those power struggles and has thrived among the common people looking to taste the tug-of-war of the nobles. Today, it is the sort of game travelers play in taverns for fun and money.<br/><br/>The game itself:<br/><br/>Thrones of Valeria is a trick-taking game where winning is based on the coins gained and not on the amount of tricks won. Each card has a special power that affects how game rounds unfold; causing the Great Houses (suits) to swing from the prestigious to the reviled &mdash; from winning a small treasure to losing a small fortune. Thrones of Valeria features a standings board that tracks Great House prestige, chunky &quot;&quot;mahjong-style&quot;&quot; tiles to reflect the relative power of each House, a custom draw bag, coin tokens, and cards designed by The Mico.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They awaited the expected German offensive with great confidence, ready to repel their ancient foes and overwhelm them in 1941 with a massive wave of new armored divisions. Instead it was the German panzers that did the overwhelming. Despite heroic efforts in which over 90,000 French soldiers lost their lives, within six weeks France had fallen.<br/><br/>1940 - The Fall of France is a stand-alone game in the Panzer Grenadier series.  You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the 50 scenarios. Design is by wargame veteran Philippe Leonard of Belgium, who has crafted scenarios involving the French Army on the attack and on the defense, with units ranging from the elite Foreign Legion and Coloniale to the pitiful second-line reserves.<br/><br/>Pieces include the huge array of French armor: S35 cavalry tanks, B1-bis heavy tanks, FT17, R35, R40, H39. H35 and FCM 36 light tanks. Panhard, AMR33, P16 and AMR35 armored cars and reconnaissance tanks. Plus the bizarre C2 multi-turreted heavy tank. Plus many types of troops and support weapons, from motorcycle troops and horsed cavalry through the awesome 155mm GPF rifle.<br/><br/>The Germans receive their full set of panzers, from the puny PzKw I through the PzKw IIIE and 38t. There are vehicles not seen before in the Panzer Grenadier series like the SiG33 assault gun, and a set of pieces for Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in their own colors.<br/><br/>There are eight semi-rigid mapboards, the same type as those found in Eastern Front, created by Guy Riessen, who crafted the widely-praised maps for Elsenborn Ridge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Birds of Prey - Air Combat in the Jet Age is a revolutionary jet dogfighting game, simulating flight with unprecedented precision and engrossing play. <br/>The Birds of Prey flight mechanics allow freedom in three dimensions without requiring special maneuver rules. Physics-based systems model aircraft performance differences correctly and simply through the use of only two elegant playaids; graphical computers known as nomograms. Missiles fly out towards their targets without player intervention, using proper kinematics from launch and flowing seamlessly into the underlying flight engine. The core of Birds of Prey is the PHAD - the Pitch, Heading, and Attitude Display, a simple tool allowing players to track their the orientation of an aircraft in three dimensions. The PHAD makes it trivial to find the relative position (bearings) and relative motion between maneuvering aircraft. It also makes figuring blind spots where you can't sight other aircraft a trivial exercise, regardless of whether the aircraft is flying straight and level, has its nose pointing straight up, or is in the middle of a wingover.<br/><br/>The lavishly illustrated Birds of Prey tutorial guides you through learning the game solo, while the rulebook is a reference for rules questions only. The play aids are built to keep the rulebook in the box during play. Laminated play-aids use a system of hints that lead players through flight and eases return to play. Full-color box-miniatures are placed on tilt-blocks and stacking tiles showing altitude, pitch, roll and heading and bringing the three-dimensional fight to life.<br/><br/>",

TCS 4.0 rules.<br/><br/>The battle depicted here begins on D-Day +2, June 8th, and continues for the next 3 days and was known by the Germans as the First Battle for Caen. The situation unfolds with the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division dug-in on its D-Day objectives. Aware of the resounding defeat that the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered the previous day at the hands of the Hitler Youth, the 7th prepares a Fortress around Bretteville, Norrey and Putot. The soldiers of The Regina Rifles and The Royal Winnipeg Rifles, still under-strength from their D-Day losses, wait their turn for the inevitable encounter with the Grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division. The Canadian must hold their thin red line at all cost as failure to do so could result in a serious set back affecting the invasion time table and loss of the initiative to the Germans.<br/><br/>This game is a balanced, one-map knife fight between the highly motivated 12th SS Hitlerjugend and the equally matched Canadians determined to preserve and expand their D-Day bridgehead.

        "description": "Mountaineers is a strategic board game in which 1-6 players compete against each other and AI climbers to earn climbing points (victory points) as they maneuver around a 18 in./45 cm tall rotating 3D modular game board. The theme of Mountaineers is lighthearted and fun, primarily focused on competitive route finding, resource management, character building and upgrades, while challenging players to react to various exciting (and sometimes comical) events that occur on the mountain.<br/><br/>Strategy during both set-up and game play is important. At the beginning of a game, players need to choose four climbing routes, one character, and a starting position that work well together, in order to earn the maximum amount of points possible. However, as the game progresses, the mountain terrains fill up, making it more difficult to complete certain climbing routes. Additionally, various mountain conditions change (once per player), and event cards (drawn on each turn) require players to adapt their strategy, change their climbing routes, and purchase various combinations of gear upgrades to continue climbing.<br/><br/>Resource management is important as players start with a limited number of thirty route markers and will on average draw only sixty supply tokens during a game. Depending on the game and the various difficulty of event cards used, players have to balance how often they spend supplies and route markers in order to climb efficiently and complete routes. Climbing strategy is also important. Players must be careful in what order they complete routes, how they maneuver on the mountain, and whether or not they pay extra to &quot;lock in&quot; certain route markers to avoid sabotage by other players.<br/><br/>A typical turn involves drawing an event card, resolving the conditions of the event card (which may apply to other players), saving the event card for later use with your character, performing 0 to 2 regular actions, 0 to 1 special actions (if available), and special character actions (as allowed). Games with 1 to 4 players last ten rounds, each player drawing a total of ten event cards, and 5 to 6 player games last for eight rounds (with eight event cards/player). For 1 to 2 player games (and more challenging 3 to 5 player games), an &quot;AI&quot; mechanism can cause &quot;automated climbers&quot; to move around the mountain, placing route markers and blocking/sabotaging players. Players can also substitute more difficult event cards into the game, creating more flavor and challenge. The goal of a 2-6 player game is to have the most victory points at game end, and the goal of a one-player game is to have 55 victory points and four climbing routes complete at game's end.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>While Mountaineers has a similar 3D appearance to its predecessor The Mountaineer, it is a vastly different game. For example, The Mountaineer was a roll-and-move game that required resource trading between players and had a large luck element. On the other hand, Mountaineers offers freedom and interesting choices to players every turn as players can choose when and how much to climb, and are not restricted by a luck element. Additionally, Mountaineers allows players to &quot;lock&quot; their routes, and provides mechanisms for advanced climbing techniques. (more below)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A game of plane to plane combat in World War I&quot;<br/><br/>There is plenty of goodies in the box, including three geomorphic map boards, plenty of thick counters, and as much rules as you can stomach. Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.<br/><br/>(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)<br/><br/>Wings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.<br/><br/>The basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.<br/><br/>Simultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.<br/><br/>Gunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1<br/>power to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.<br/><br/>Solitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those &quot;missing&quot; planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "High Heavens sets the players in the clouds, fighting for ultimate power above the earth.<br/><br/>High Heavens is a two player, tactical strategy game played on a hex grid, pitting Norse gods against Greek gods. The game is won when either all 12 gods in an entire pantheon is wiped out, or when Asgard or Mt. Olympus is destroyed. Players draw five cards every turn and then are allowed 3 actions. These actions can include Invoking a god, Moving, Attacking, playing a Divine Power card, using a god's Special Ability or Acquiring a dropped bonus chip. Red chips are stacked under each character to represent that characters health. Modifiers such as Attack Bonus, Armor, or Disabled are also represented by different colored chips. No two gods are alike, and their actions and abilities closely correlate to the mythology they were derived from. The luck of the cards you draw forces you to change your strategy from game to game. There is no reshuffling when you are out of cards, so once a god is dead, they're dead. Game play takes about a half an hour to an hour, depending on the players' skill, luck of the draw and the strategies used.<br/><br/>Created by award-winning video game industry veteran Ryan Lesser (Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Beatles:Rock Band, Dance Central...), High Heavens is a 2-player, expandable board game that utilizes lessons learned from 15 years of video game creation and a lifetime of playing board games.<br/><br/>",

Each Character Deck has special power and Wild Cards designed just for that character.  There's also a Danger Deck with &quot;Event&quot; cards and &quot;Enemy&quot; cards that can really change the game! Like any great superhero battle, there's gonna be a lot of powers and stuff lying around, so buckle-up and pay attention!<br/><br/>There are also two ways to win!  Get rid of all your cards in your hand or be the last player standing with cards in their character deck.<br/><br/>Collectible foil cards in each box.<br/><br/>Don't forget to call Uno when down to 1 card!<br/><br/>Characters:<br/>Black Panther<br/><br/>        Black Panther is in it for the long haul by trying to stay in the game as long as possible. As Black Panther's ability comes from defeating Enemies, you will want to hold onto your Danger Icon Cards and play them when you have cards in your Burn Pile. You might not always get an Enemy when you play them but you don't want to waste the chance at recovering cards early on by defeating Enemies.<br/><br/><br/>Captain Marvel<br/><br/>        Captain Marvel is always looking for the right strategy to do the most damage. With her character power letting her always have the right color to play, use it to never miss your plays. Change the color when you can to prevent other players from being able to defeat their attacking Enemies. Sometimes you may want to use her power to change the color to play a powerful Action Card such as Skip or Draw Two.<br/><br/><br/>Iron Man<br/><br/>        Iron Man always likes to be on the attack. Iron Man wants to burn as many cards as possible from the other players decks, and try to eliminate multiple players at a time to win. So, you want to play as many Danger Icon Cards as you can to keep the pressure on. Keep in mind that every time you play a Danger Icon Card you will have to flip a Danger Card.<br/><br/><br/>Thor<br/><br/>        Thor is great at attacking other players and trying to eliminate them one at a time. When playing as Thor you want to decide either to focus on one player at a time or spread out your Wild Cards to affect all players. That means when you play your Wild Cards you want to make sure you are using them to change the active color o get the most effectiveness out of your character power.<br/><br/><br/>",

While solving the tasks presented in the book, players assume the role of discoverers of secret knowledge. Each subsequent task will reveal the secrets of the elements and alchemical ingredients, to finally allow them to perform various magical rituals. In total, 45 tasks of various formulas and types await players &mdash; from less complex puzzles to complex, multi-stage riddles.<br/><br/>The topics covered in the book refer directly to the events of the Escape Tales series. Although knowledge of games is not necessary to solve riddles, experienced players will find flavors and references to the series' stories here. Important characters from the games, such as Samuel from The Awakening or heroes from Children of Wyrmwoods. These characters become secondary heroes in The Book of Rituals, who, just like the players, have delved into the book's secrets. For better or for worse...<br/><br/>Solving riddles is done with the help of a free application that does not require installation on devices and works on both mobile devices and computers. It is primarily used to check answers but also provides hints for riddles. What is characteristic of the Escape Tales products is that players are not judged or punished for using the hints. The overall goal is player satisfaction, so the application is designed to help them, not judge them.<br/><br/>The Book of Rituals is a breath of fresh air in the mystery book market. It stands out from the competition with a formula that encourages and sometimes forces the book's exploration in the order that is convenient for players &mdash; it does not have a single path from puzzle to puzzle. The mechanics have been prepared in such a way that players who get stuck on one of the tasks can freely solve others and return to it with fresh ideas or use the hints without the feeling of losing. Thanks to the creative use of the application, the book can also surprise players.<br/><br/>",

It is about villagers of a lonely island who are trying in panic to reach their boats at the beach to still escape the rapidly approaching mysterious and life-threatening FOG.<br/>The game combines tactical depth with high variability through the islanders many different movement options and a very variable setup.<br/>You are playing a mystical Island Guardian coordinating the difficult path of several self-drafted islanders towards their boats &ndash; trying to save as many of them as you can. Each turn you use the available movement points for the various movement options like running, swapping, pushing, squeeze through, jumping, crossing to move your islanders forward.<br/>So choose your islanders wisely and move them more effective and anticipatory then your fellow players. While the beach is packed and everyone is in panic, will you stay calm and assure that your islanders reach the rescuing boats before the FOG swallows them?<br/>When the FOG reaches the shore, the boats will depart and each player will receive or loose rescuing points in several categories. Then it will be known who collected the most rescuing points and wins against The FOG and the fellow players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, many players elect to use later rules editions and make the money count as the measure of the game. Starting with &pound;700, each player can buy horses and/or businesses in two steps, first by lot and then by auction. Then the players make one lap around the Training Track of the gameboard with each of their horses. Here the players collect advantage and disadvantage cards to be used in the race. Also on the Training Track, the players gain or lose money that can be bet on the race. Once the players have circumnavigated the Training Track, the gameboard is flipped to reveal the Race Track.<br/><br/>The players may enter only 3 horses into the race. The players may bet on any horse to win. After the betting is over the race begins. The players roll one die and move their horses in turn, utilizing the cards earned during the first half of the game whenever it is felt to be advantageous. The players who bet on the winning horse divide the money bet on the race minus ten percent (that goes to the Bookmaker).<br/><br/>",

Brettspiel retains the central element of the 6 nimmt! card game: Each player reveals a card from their hand at the same time, then the cards are added to a central display with players possibly being penalized should their card end up in the wrong location.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game includes tiles numbered 1-100, and each player receives a hand of twelve tiles. Four tiles are revealed at random and placed in the first position of the first four rows on the game board. On a turn, each player chooses a tile, then reveals them all at the same time, with the tiles being added to the game board from lowest number to highest. A tile is placed in a row to the right of a tile with a lower value, with the smallest difference between tiles mattering should multiple options be available. (For example, a 16 would be placed to the right of 14 and not 7 should both of those numbers be present in different rows.) If a tile is lower than all rightmost tiles, then you place it to the right of the tile with the highest value.<br/><br/>If the tile is placed on a space with a positive or negative bullhead symbol, the player gains or loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their played tile. If the tile fills the final spot in a row, then the player loses points equal to the sum of bullheads on all other cards in this row, then this card is moved down the game board to the first position in the highest empty row.<br/><br/>Once everyone has played all of their tiles &mdash; or in a two- or three-player game, refilled their hand, then played through a second set of twelve tiles &mdash; the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>If you like, you can play 6 nimmt! Brettspiel with &quot;good luck cards&quot;. Whenever you score negative points, you draw such a card from the deck. These cards either convert a non-final row space on the game board to +5 points (instead of whatever it was) or convert a final row space to a bonus that might end up netting you points instead of losing them.<br/><br/>On the back of the 6 nimmt! Brettspiel game board is a second board to be used with the &quot;professional version&quot; of the game. In addition to the &plusmn;bullhead spaces, this board has spaces that force you to draw a new tile, claim all the tiles in a row (instead of scoring negative points), or draw an action card. These action cards let you play anywhere, swap your played tile for another from your hand, skip to the front line, and more. This version can be played with or without the &quot;good luck cards&quot;. When one player is out of tiles, players lose points for the bullheads on tiles still in hand.<br/><br/>",

The rate of each currency is randomly fixed but it may vary during the game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player will choose a character card with their category symbol and will receive a random set of currency cards for a value of 35. Then, a first collection of 1 to 3 object cards to be sell is revealed and players begin to bid at the same time. Each object card shows the object itself and two category symbols from eight existing.<br/><br/>The higher bid will win the collection as usual, but the players can use some powers during the bid. For example, they can change the rate of a currency, forbid to use a currency to buy a collection, or use the currencies they want to pay a bid. Of course those powers are one shot! Well, almost.<br/><br/>After the winner of the first collection has paid their bid, they put the collection in face up in front of them and then the next collection is revealed.<br/><br/> How does it ends?<br/><br/>As long as there is still something to bid for and someone has currency cards in their hand, the auction sale continues. However when the auction sale is over the players count their victory points.<br/><br/>For every 3 identical category symbols it's 3 points, for every Luxury, Antique and player's character category symbol it's 1 point, everything is cumulative. The one with the most victory points win the game.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/> Bienvenue au Peanut Club !<br/><br/>En tant qu&rsquo;illustres collectionneurs, vous &ecirc;tes invit&eacute;s &agrave; une prestigieuse vente aux ench&egrave;res se d&eacute;roulant &agrave; la crois&eacute;e d&rsquo;univers h&eacute;t&eacute;roclites. <br/>Votre but, repartir de la vente avec le plus bel assortiment d&rsquo;objets.<br/><br/> Comment &ccedil;a marche?<br/><br/>Peanut Club est un jeu bas&eacute; sur une m&eacute;canique d'ench&egrave;re biais&eacute;e...<br/>Pour ench&eacute;rir, trois monnaies sont accept&eacute;es : les Millions de dollars, les Chameaux et les Cacahu&egrave;tes. La valeur de chaque monnaie est fix&eacute;e al&eacute;atoirement au d&eacute;but de la partie et pourra &eacute;voluer au cours de la partie.<br/><br/>Au d&eacute;but de la partie, chaque jour re&ccedil;oit une carte Personnage avec sa cat&eacute;gorie pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielle et re&ccedil;oit al&eacute;atoirement des cartes Monnaie pour un total de 35 en valeur. Ensuite, un lot de 1 &agrave; 3 cartes Objet est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; et les joueurs peuvent alors commencer &agrave; ench&eacute;rir simultan&eacute;ment. On peut trouver sur chaque carte Objet l'Objet en question et les deux symboles des cat&eacute;gories auquel il appartient (parmi les 8 cat&eacute;gories existantes).<br/><br/>Le plus haut ench&eacute;risseur remportera le lot comme traditionnellement, mais les joueurs auront quelques pouvoirs &agrave; leur disposition pour influencer la phase d'ench&egrave;res. Ils pourront, par exemple, modifi&eacute; la valeur respective des Monnaies, interdire l'utilisation d'une Monnaie, ou encore utiliser n'importe qu'elle Monnaie pour payer l'ench&egrave;re remport&eacute;e. Bien entendu ces pouvoirs sont limit&eacute;s &agrave; une seule utilisation... Enfin presque!<br/><br/>Apr&egrave;s que le meilleur ench&eacute;risseur a pay&eacute; son offre, il place le lot d'Objets devant lui et un nouveau lot d'Objets est mis aux ench&egrave;res.<br/><br/>Quand le jeu se termine-t-il ?<br/><br/>Tant qu'il y a des Objets sur lesquels ench&eacute;rir et au moins un joueur &agrave; qui il reste de la monnaie, les ench&egrave;res continuent. Lorsque la vente est termin&eacute;e, les joueurs vont compter leurs points de victoire.<br/><br/>Chaque s&eacute;rie de 3 symboles de cat&eacute;gorie identiques rapporte 3 points. Chaque symbole Luxure, Antique, et chaque symbole du type de votre personnage rapporte 1 point suppl&eacute;mentaire. Tout est cumulatif. Le joueur avec le plus de points de victoire remporte la partie!<br/><br/>",

You will move around tables, have a stop at the bar, meet friends and dangerous guys. Drink beers and try to leave before you have wasted all your money, or the bouncer will immediately throw you out of the Pub!&quot;<br/><br/>The goal of the game is for your Fantasy Characters to move from table to table, drink beer (collecting points for doing so) and leave the Pub before they are either completely drunk or lose all their money!<br/><br/>The 4 types of characters each have Special Character Skills (except the Warrior), and are ranked in strength. Stronger characters get beers bought for them by weaker ones.<br/><br/>Hobbit - weakest, but filches coins from the tables.<br/><br/>Dwarf - The 3rd strongest, can move either direction around the Pub.<br/><br/>Warrior - No special skill, but almost as strong as the Orc.<br/><br/>Orc - His skill is a disadvantage. He leaves a coin each time he leaves a table. But he's  <br/>      the strongest, so he always gets beers from the weaker characters. And never has to<br/>      buy them any beers!<br/><br/>Whichever player collects the most points (beer tokens) wins.<br/><br/>",

The game system, shared with our earlier popular Panzer game (which covers battles on the Eastern Front), easily incorporates myriad details such as armor thicknesses at various points, shots from various angles, heights, and altitudes, and the effects of terrain. The rules cover the important aspects of small unit tactics - armor piercing shots, small arms fire, high explosives, artillery barrages, air support, communications, turret rotation, gun depression, mines, roadblocks, barbed wire, smoke, and much more. The flexible scenarios cover a variety of combat situations that are resolved on the six-piece geomorphic mapboard, which also features movable terrain pieces. The types of units include infantry, anti-tanks guns (including the deadly 88mm), Matildas, Crusaders, Bren Carriers, Long Range Desert Group Trucks, Honeys, Grants, Shermans, M13/40s SEM 41s, a large variety of Pz IIIs and IVs, halftracks, and much, much more.<br/><br/>",

One of those is designated the secret subject and one player becomes the &quot;Gooseberry&quot;.  The Gooseberry does not know which of the sixteen subjects is the secret and the other players do not know who is the Gooseberry.  The goal of the Gooseberry is to remain hidden and figure out the secret subject while all the other players are trying to keep the secret hidden and find the Gooseberry.<br/><br/>A code card is dealt to each player, with one player receiving the Gooseberry card that has no code. Players use the code to identify the correct subject word. Everyone prepares in their mind a ONE WORD clue related to the secret subject.  The challenge is to choose a clue that shows other players that you know the secret subject but is not so obvious that it reveals the secret to the Gooseberry.  When all players have prepared their clue and are ready, each player, in clockwise order and without hesitation, says out loud the clue they have prepared.<br/><br/>Players may now discuss, question and accuse each other.  When ready everyone votes on who they think is the Gooseberry. The Gooseberry wins if either they are not correctly identified or if they can guess the correct subject word.<br/><br/>The rules are currently only available in English. But the cards are universal (no language) and due to the low complexity of the game it's easy to play in any language.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "On April 24, 1809, Napol&eacute;on had proclaimed at Ratisbon, &laquo; We will be in Vienna in less than a month ! &raquo;. Although he did seize the Austrian capital on May 13, the Danube still separated the Emperor from the army of the Archduke Charles. To pull off a decisive victory, he now had to force a crossing of the river and defeat the Austrians as swiftly as possible. On May 20 in mid-afternoon 200 skirmishers of Molitor&rsquo;s division crossed the backwater which separated the island of Lobau from the left bank of the Danube. By the next day, a beautiful Pentecost Sunday, the French were on the left bank with 30,000 men, including 6,000 cavalry, and were ready for battle. Grounded on the villages of Aspern and Essling and covered on the wings by the river, their base was solid. For his part, the Archduke Charles decided to go over to the attack quickly so as to destroy the troops who had just crossed the Danube. He had over 60,000 men available, organized into five columns, and before long the Austrians would have 90,000. After the battle had begun, several of the bridges over the Danube were temporarily broken, preventing the French from receiving the reinforcements necessary for victory. During the two days of May 21 and 22 the divisions on the ground, commanded by Mass&eacute;na and Lannes, would have to resist heroically as the enemy launched a series of massive assaults. The victory was delayed until later : in less than three months, that would be Wagram !<br/><br/>Aspern-Essling 1809 is the 26th battle of the series Jours de Gloire, launched in 1997 with Rivoli 1797 (Vae Victis n&deg;18). The game covers the two days of the battle (May 21 and 22, 1809), with special rules dealing with the command situation of the French army (Lannes and Mass&eacute;na). The bridges between the island of Lobau and the left bank of the Danube also hold an important place in the simulation.<br/><br/>Aspern-Essling 1809 includes :<br/>a 59 x 40 cm map,<br/>216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,<br/>a color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.<br/><br/>Units : Regiments and brigades<br/>Map scale : 330 m/hex.<br/>Turn : 90 minutes<br/>Complexity : 6 / 9<br/><br/>French or English Rules / Charts (1st edition).<br/>French and English Rules / Charts (2nd edition).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gentlemen Thieves is a board game with secret identities, bluffing and theft featuring Ars&egrave;ne Lupin and other characters inspired by author Maurice Leblanc. Whoever ends up with the biggest stack of loot at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player secretly takes one of the five burglar tiles, which come in five different colors; each player also receives 2-4 helping hand tokens. Five locations are set out, each with two randomly chosen equipment tokens next to them; equipment tokens come in five types, with each type appearing in the five colors of the burglars. Special tokens are placed out as well: two loot tokens next to the bank, one lock on the museum, and one tunnel next to the manor; six additional loot tokens, along with a car token and the second tunnel, are placed to the side. Three randomly drawn equipment tokens are placed face up.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, the matchmaker determines the alliances for that round, placing two alliance markers &ndash; each showing a burglar in the appropriate color &ndash; in one area and the other three in the other area. Thus, the burglars form provisional teams for the round and are trying to work together to rob a location &ndash; any location! &ndash; but they don't necessarily know who's who. On a turn a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Chooses one of the face-up equipment tokens, places it next to a location (with no more than three tokens of the same type being allowed at a location), then reveals a new equipment token.<br/>    Draws the top equipment token from the stack, then places it at a location.<br/>    Plays a helping hand token to move a special token or add a new special token to a location.<br/><br/><br/>As soon as all five types of equipment are at a location, a burglary takes place there. Who steals the goods? The alliance that has the larger presence there based on the colors of tokens. These tokens are then flipped face down (becoming loot), added to any loot tokens present there, then split among the burglars in the alliance and placed on the scoreboard. The matchmaker token passes to a new player, who must move at least two alliance tokens, then a new round begins.<br/><br/>The special tokens naturally change the rules: The location with the lock cannot be robbed, although someone can choose to move the lock so that a burglary does take place. The car allows someone to move an equipment token to a new location. When the second tunnel is placed next to a location, the two locations with tunnels are now linked and the types of equipment present are considered to be together when determining whether a burglary takes place &ndash; although if the lock is on one of those locations, then nothing can be stolen!<br/><br/>A brigadier token is shuffled into the final six equipment tokens, and when it's drawn, the game ends immediately. Players then reveal their identities, and the player with the most loot wins!<br/><br/>",

These gangs are commanded by major crooks (boss cards), each of which can have an additional number of secondary burglars (action cards). The more criminals that a player places in a particular district, the more influence they obtain there, so the more likely they are to earn the valuable reward awarded by the district. In addition, players can also collect sets of art pieces that will provide extra victory points at the end of the game. In the end, the player whose gang scores the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>It's Mine is a gamers' game played in six rounds with a colorful and minimalist design that combines card drafting and set collection with area control mechanism. Players have challenging decisions such as commanding thugs, stealing precious works of art and burning evidences. Each city has its particular set of cards, so the game has a high replay value.<br/><br/>",

Players secretly take on the role of police and thieves, and they must co-operate to achieve their objectives: The thieves have to take the money and escape with it in a vehicle, while the police have to arrest the thieves.<br/><br/>Script: England, 1928, following a period of scarcity in the wake of the first world war, Europe is experiencing a period of artistic and economic splendor.<br/><br/>In celebration of this new era of prosperity a grand dinner has been organised at the Davis Manor. The greatest Luminaries and elites of the time are set to attend, however all is not what it seems!<br/><br/>The police have received warning that a master thief is planning to attend the event and steal the Davis Manor fortune. This thief is rumoured to never act alone, pulling off heists using hidden accomplices.<br/> Instead of cancelling the event a daring plan has been hatched! The chief inspector himself will attend the party, along with hidden detective agents. Using their skills, cunning and powers of deduction they will attempt to catch a thief! But be careful.. Not everyone is as they seem in Davis Manor and a lot can happen in the Secret Night.<br/><br/>How to play resume:<br/><br/>Roles: The Master Thief and the Chief Inspector reveal their roles and keep them shown.The rest of the players will keep their roles hidden.<br/><br/>Characters: Each character has a special skill.<br/><br/>The mansion: There are 16 rooms in the mansion.They are represented by their names on the perimeter of the Main Board. At the beginning of the game the object cards are shuffled (green circle at the back) and 16 of them are randomly placed face up in each room held by the Main Board. The rest of the object cards are stacked face down as a draw deck.<br/><br/>Mechanics: Draw one card, spin the roulette to move the pawn around the board by the number rolled, and perform actions with object cards and/or the Action Square.<br/><br/>During their movement, the player can do as many actions as they wants/are able to.<br/><br/>The most common action is to perform a search. Being on a green search hex gives you the opportunity to take the card stored in the associated room slot on the edge of the Main Board.<br/><br/>Once checked, you should keep one of the cards in your hand (at your choice) in the slot of the room hidden face down.<br/><br/>Inventory: The maximum number of cards at the end of your turn is 3, and 1 must always be shown face up next to the player board (even if you only have 1 card in total).<br/><br/>Action square: Once per turn, when you are next to another pawn, you may use the Action Square to perform an action:<br/><br/>-To Trade cards with another player, either, 1 for 1 , 2 for 2 or 3 for 3.<br/><br/>-To Steal a card: The target victim shuffles all his cards (shown and hidden) before he is robbed. The player performing the action then chooses 1 card blindly.<br/><br/>-Push: Move a player up to 2 squares. If he encounters an obstacle: (wall, other player) stops.<br/><br/>-Whisper a secret: Use it to have a private conversation (whispering to the ear) with another player. This can be useful for plotting strategies or bluffing.<br/><br/>In addition to these actions, players may use the object cards.<br/><br/>End of the game: The game ends at dawn (9 turns - 6:00 am) or when a team's score counter reaches 10 points. If the game ends in a tie and the Deceiver (the role for games with odd players) is not in play, the first team to score wins.<br/><br/>",

Army Group South launched its multi-national forces (including Rumanians, Hungarians and Italians) with their principal target defined &ndash; Objective: Kiev.<br/><br/>Facing them was the Red Army weakened from the recent purges of its officers by Stalin. Still, the Soviets put together a strong counter-attack early in the campaign, but their advantages in numbers of tanks committed could not overcome the German's superiority of skill when employing their veteran panzer units. The Axis forces advanced eastward to the Dnieper River and south toward Odessa, but as the front kept expanding, forces were spread thinner to cover the front line.<br/><br/>Objective: Kiev is a new historical board game from renowned game designer Frank Chadwick, iterating the classic Battle for Moscow game system used in The Arduous Beginning, combining ease of learning and design elegance with the kind of dramatic gameplay that Frank has long been famous for.

The game starts with the first player drafting a Railcar card from his hand, attaching it to his train, then passing the rest of his hand to the player to his left. This draft continues until all players have added one Railcar to their train for each round of the game. The trick is, while each new Railcar must match the resource type or value of the one previously played, players always have the option to play any card face down as a Wild Railcar; the Wild Railcars don't have much value, but they can be used to save a player in a bind or to thwart your opponents by &quot;hiding&quot; a card they need.<br/><br/>Yardmaster Express plays in ten minutes and consists of just 32 cards (no tokens, no cargo cards).<br/><br/>",

This involves a chit pull for strong units to determine strength upon entering combat. The basic turn sequence is classic IGO-UGO which consists of movement and combat, with possible attacks for mechanized units during movement. Planes are simplified through the use of Air Points. The Axis player is limited by supply limitations with a support system that easily restricts him from having the strength to attack everywhere at once!<br/><br/>Each scenario breaks battles off into smaller pieces for shorter playtime. Basic units are divisions, with Soviet corps, brigades, and tank battalions, as needed. Order of Battle from various sources, largely from the works of David Glantz, and fine tuned to give a reasonably accurate flow to the campaign.<br/><br/>Five maps run from Kursk in the north to towards Baku in the south across the diagonal. A sixth map is included for playing three of the smaller scenarios with larger hexes. There are a few extra German divisions available as options. The Eleventh Armee can be kept from going to Leningrad and sent to help capture the oilfields as an option. Free setup options are available and automatic victory goals based on Hitler's whim.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3 days<br/>Hex: 6.5 miles / 10 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Three 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Two 21 x 24&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>One 10 x 21&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>Four dual-side printed countersheets (980-1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page Fall Blau rulebook<br/>Six single-side (9&quot;x11&quot;) Player Aid Cards<br/>Six dual-side (9&quot;x11&quot;) Player Aid Cards<br/>Three dual-side (11&quot;x17&quot;) Player Aid Cards<br/>One 10-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-50 Hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Red Dragon Rising: The Coming War With China (RDR), is a strategic-level investigation, with operational undertones, of the possibilities inherent in the first 30-or-so days of a hypothetical war between the Peoples Republic of China and a US-led counter-alliance. The time frame is the not-too-distant future, roughly between now and the end of 2014. On the Chinese side, the viewpoint of the player is that of Peking's top-rung national leadership. On the US side, the opposing player represents the top-rung military commander in the Western Pacific theater. The game is easily adaptable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>The system &ndash; given we're dealing with events that haven't happened and therefore can't be studied in detail after the fact &ndash; has been crafted to present the war as a unitary vision rather than a strictly sequenced process. The action can alternately telescope or expand, sometimes moving ahead in whip snake lunges, at other times decelerating to dream-like slow motion. The system is more quantum mechanics than Newtonian, more Escher than Rockwell. Its presents a time-space inter-flow that can only be grasped in totality by the human mind once play is over and the entire war can be looked back on and chronicled in a reconstructed linear fashion (much like day-to-day reality).<br/><br/>Three initial assumptions are as follows. First, the Chinese are cast &ndash; not unreasonably, we think &ndash; as the aggressors. Put in terms as politically correct as possible: they're the &quot;revisionist power&quot; here, the nation wanting to overturn the present-day status quo in the Western Pacific: they're conducting a strategic  offensive. Second, the war inevitably starts over Taiwan, as that island is the unavoidably the first strategic block Peking must neutralize on the way to becoming East Asia's hegemon. Third, the war will not begin with a nuclear attack; though the danger of that kind of escalation may not be far off.<br/><br/>Most ground units in the game represent brigades (&quot;brigade combat teams&quot; or &quot;BCT&quot; for the US). The exceptions are: 1) the Singaporean army is entirely represented by just one unit-counter; and 2) the Taiwanese and Philippine armies are represented by their corps components.<br/><br/>Aircraft units are mostly represented by mixed-type combat wing formations, though only one aircraft type &ndash; the predominant one for each such wing &ndash; is shown on each counter. Long range bombers have their own mono-type units that can't combine operations with the other tactical air wings in the game.<br/><br/>Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groupings of vessels (Surface Action Groups). Aircraft carriers and cruise missile attack submarines each represent just one such vessel of those types. Other submarines are represented in groups called &quot;Subrons.&quot; On the area map, each inch equals approximately 100 miles.<br/><br/>",

The Divinus app provides a narrative for players and sets the stakes for what is to come. Each turn, players spend dice from their pool to explore new tiles from the world board. Laying tiles into their demigod map, they must place tiles adjacent to one another and with matching features while working towards overall quest and God goals.<br/><br/>Throughout the campaign, players make permanent changes to their demigods by collecting powerful artifacts, forging their dice by altering their faces, and earning titles for the feats they achieve. Players will also permanently change the game world by altering tiles and placing new locations, heroes, and monsters onto the map tiles. When players complete quests or other significant goals, they can make pivotal decisions through the Divinus app.<br/><br/>Players will decide the outcome of dilemmas such as choosing which side is victorious in battle, building or destroying a holy site, and choosing whether a God lives or dies. Whichever outcome the player chooses, the game components may be changed and the Divinus app will remember and present contextual options in the future that are impacted by the decision. Returning to a fort that you helped the Norse Gods build could see you praised, while demigods favored by the Greek pantheon could be shunned.<br/><br/>The Divinus campaign is ideally played over several game sessions due to the persistent and changing world. The rulebook grows with each scenario as new rules and content are unlocked. Once the campaign is complete, players can replay their unique copy of Divinus with a post-campaign Infinite Replayability mode.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

That is, they must discard 1 or more cards from their hand until the offering is equal or greater than the number next to that deity (oriented to the active player) on the Olympus. At least one of the offerings must match with the chosen deity.<br/><br/>After the offering, the player gains that deity&rsquo;s favour. And so that player moves the deity to their closest location on the Olympus, moving the other deities one position if necessary. A deity grants their special ability immediately.<br/><br/>Each hero is related to one deity. This connection is symbolised with an offering, which is different depending on the Greek or the Trojan side. The small offering represents the offering the opponent has on the other side.<br/><br/>If, at the end of the turn, a player has 2 or more heroes on the opponent&rsquo;s Protection area can build the troja  horse (greek player) or advance Hector throught greek ships (trojan player)<br/><br/>The Greek player wins the game immediately if they finish the Trojan Horse.<br/><br/>The Trojan player wins the game immediately if they move the Hector/Paris token through the four sections.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players are gods who transfer one of these images onto the night sky as a new constellation of stars. Which one is transferred is determined in such a way that all players but one know the picture in question. The one who doesn't know which picture was chosen tries to remain undetected during the round.<br/><br/>Star by star, the players now transfer the picture onto the night sky (i.e., the central mat) until all stars are placed. There is a good chance that different players will emphasize different aspects of the picture in question. After the placement phase, the &quot;Gods&quot; try to detect the &quot;ignorant&quot; player, while the ignorant player tries to name the picture that was chosen. The right balance between keeping the imposter in the dark and not giving the regular players cause for suspicion has to be struck...<br/><br/>",

Dice indicate the type of actions that players can perform: move, attach, draw new cards, etc. The fist player to align the dice to his interest will yell &ldquo;Waaagh!&rdquo; and everybody else need to make do with the results they have on the table at that moment. Regarding attacks, players won&rsquo;t know for sure if the cards they have at hand are good enough for their intended action. Players hold the cards in their hand in such a way that they will not be able to see the relevant side of their hands (while the rest of the players can actually see the fire power of the rest of the opponents).<br/><br/>",

You may now ONLY play cards in other players&rsquo; solar systems.  The round ends once all solar systems are filled.  The final card in each player&rsquo;s hand is placed into the discard pile.

For now the mountain pass remains secure but our scouts have reported large gatherings in the valley and we're expecting a full scale assault before the season's end. If that wasn't enough to worry about, our neighbors are also preparing for war and petitioning the king for his troops and supplies which are already spread thin. It seems you'll not only be fighting a war of steel, but one of words as well.<br/><br/>In Dragon Valley, players take turns dividing items such as knights and archers, building materials for blacksmith shops and towers, special powers and even attackers. The attackers consist of dragons, orcs and battering rams that emerge from mountain passes into each player's lands. After dividing, other players select the group of items they prefer and leave the remainder with the player who did the dividing. After that, players use special cards to interfere with each others plans. The last step each round is for players to setup defenses, destroy the attackers or laying siege on the orc strongholds scattered throughout Dragon Valley.<br/><br/>",

Now it's time to flee, ideally making it out with both our treasures and our lives.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player can either advance boldly, flee cautiously, or cry like a baby. If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you're injured twice, you die and are out of the game.<br/><br/>When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly. Your sacrificed treasure is still lost.<br/><br/>When you cry like a baby, you don't draw a location card, instead discarding a treasure worth at least two coins. Having shown your obeisance to the dragon, the turn passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Players start with four treasure cards; while some cards are worth 1-5 coins, others provide a one-shot potion or a talisman that stays in effect until the location deck is shuffled, which ends the round. Gameplay lasts from 5 to 8 rounds. Each player has a unique power that can be used once per round: the thief can steal cards from opponents, the cleric can heal opponents in exchange for treasure, etc. If the dragon loses its final temper point, the game ends and whoever holds the most valuable treasure wins; if all of the adventurers are charred to death first, then the dragon wins instead!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clever and crafty, this liar's dice experience is an evolution on the classic bluffing game. Fluff features palm-fitted rolling cups for poker-style peeking, and critter-adorned dice for &quot;wild-style&quot; play to inspire bolder bidding. Fluff up the bids, or challenge the calls. Be the best fluffer to outlast the other cast of characters.<br/><br/>Each player places dice in their cup and gives them a good shake. Take a peek at the dice. Your goal is to &quot;call&quot; the total number of a particular dice across all the hands at the table. So the first player places a bid, such as &quot;I think there are 4 threes across all hands.&quot; Player to the left increases the bid or calls. You can only raise the value of the last bid by either increasing the value or quantity. So if I'm the next player, I can say 5 THREES, or keep the quantity the same and raise the value to 4 FOURS.<br/><br/>Your other option is to call &quot;Fluff!&quot; on the existing bid. Say I bid &quot;9 FIVES&quot; and you have no fives. You might think I'm bananas, so you call &quot;Fluff!&quot; All players reveal their dice. If there are 9 FIVES or more, you would lose a die. If there are fewer than 9 FIVES, I lose a die, and I'm sad. You may also call &quot;Fluff!&quot; when it's not your turn, but you will lose two dice if you're wrong and the bidder still loses only 1 if you're right. It's risky and frisky!<br/><br/>When you lose a die, set it aside for all to see, and start fresh with a new roll. The person who lost the die starts the next round with the opening bid.<br/><br/>When you lose your last die, you're out. Now you're sad, too. Play continues until only one player has dice left. That player wins and may celebrate in any way they choose.<br/><br/>So be the best fluffer to outlast the other cast of characters.<br/><br/>",

Individual companies are no longer the focus, but large holding companies which add more and more new railways to their portfolios. At this abstract level there is no need for the game board and route tiles used in traditional 18xx games.<br/><br/>The two players buy and sell stock in holding companies, and the holding companies they control buy railways to generate revenue.  Corner the market in the best companies, and exploit the weaker companies, to edge out your opponent and gain any possible relative advantage.<br/><br/>Like other 18xx games, there are no random elements, merely a battle of wits between two ambitious financiers.  Assets that are profitable in the early game rapidly become obsolete, so you must always plan ahead for future growth and investment. Growth or Bust!<br/><br/>This game is purely about the money, as there is no map or track tiles!<br/><br/>Cards and tokens are used to represent:<br/><br/>5 Holdings (with a Director's share of 40% plus one share each of 30%, 20%, and 10%) <br/>Railroad companies (with a fixed income) which become obsolete as more modern Railroads come into play.<br/>5 private Investor cards (similar to the 18xx Private companies)<br/><br/>",

After joining contingents of the Russian and Prussian armies, this new army marches north out of Bohemia nearly two hundred thousand strong. They march along the west bank of the Elbe into Saxony, this army's large lumbering columns stretched across the Erz mountains.<br/><br/>From where he has been pursuing enemy forces to the east, Napoleon sees this new threat aimed at his line of communications and the city of Dresden, the main supply depot for his army. Only a single French Corps stands in its way. Outnumbered nearly ten-to-one, it cannot hold. In a flurry of orders, Napoleon redirects his guard and several corps to march to its rescue.<br/><br/>La Bataille de Dresde details the titanic battle that ensued on August 25th and raged through the 27th. Up to four players control the Prussian, Austrian and Russian forces commanded by Feldmarschall Carl zu Schwarzenberg, while up to a further four command such French personages as Marshals Ney, Marmont, Mortier, Victor, St. Cyr, or Napoleon himself. Every battalion of infantry, squadron of cavalry or battery of artillery that was present at the battle is included...and are at the players' command.<br/><br/>",

Air, naval, and ground units are all involved.

The Soviets may attack Germany first which was likely their plan.<br/><br/>The USA might enter the war in 1942, perhaps earlier, perhaps later.

        "description": "Very nice combination of tile placement and betting. Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest. The trick is that when you lay a tile to raise a tower one, two or three stories tall, this controls how much you can bet (1,2 or 3 tokens) and crucially, which draw pile you take from (pile 1, 2 or 3). Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I've bet on, but that means I have to lay a card three stories, and so I might have to play a tile from my hand that helps the other players! A very nice mechanism which gives those simple, frustrating choices we all enjoy. The scoring gives points to the first and second majority backers on each tower.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introducing What Next, the brand new 'Pick-Your-Path' adventure game where you never know what's waiting around the corner. Could be a gigantic koala, a fleet of rampaging robots or an old lady with a rocket launcher &mdash; there's just no telling.<br/><br/>Working together with the rest of the players, your goal is to navigate your way through the adventure, conquer any obstacle you encounter and make it to the end in one piece. Oh. and you'll want to keep an eye on that Tower of Peril too. Let it topple before you reach the end and it'll be game over for everyone.<br/><br/>Unlike most adventure games, What Next isn't just about picking the right path. Buried inside these adventures, you'll find over 60 dexterity challenges, each one designed to stop you dead In your tracks. Want to grab a vine and swing from the trees? You'll need to throw a card into the air and catch it first. Decide to walk over that old rope bridge? Well, first you'll need to flick the wooden puck across the table, without it falling off. It's important to master every mini-game you come across in these adventures &mdash; or you might not make it to the finish line.<br/><br/>The players turn over the next location card, read out the story and then choose which path to take next. If there is an event, the player reading the card must complete the dexterity challenge.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the players reach the end of the adventure (win), or the tower of peril collapses (lose).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The greatest single sports show on earth takes place in South Africa this year (2010). The World Cup Card Game allows players to play through the whole tournament in around 75mins.<br/>The game consists of 65 cards. 32 of these represent all the national teams taking part. Another 32 cards are Action cards which are used to create the scorelines for each match. The final card is a summary list of what the Action cards can be used for.<br/><br/>All the teams are randomly divided between the players. These are kept face-down on the table in front of the player until required.<br/><br/>Each group is played match by match. The players controlling the four teams in Group 1: South Africa, Mexico, Uruguay and France now reveal those Team cards.<br/><br/>Each team card is coloured according to the national football team strip, it also shows the national flag and a note stating their best performance ever achieved in any World Cup tournament. There is also a grey rectangle with the number of cards that team receives in the group stage - this is always 7 or 8. There is also a 2 Goal and 3 Goal symbol, sometimes covered by a cross. Any crossed symbol means that this particular team cannot use that type of card to it's full potential e.g, Argentina have the 3 Goal symbol crossed but the 2 Goal symbol uncrossed, therefore Argentina can only play a 3 Goal card as a 2 Goal card.<br/> The number of cards and the status of the 3 and 2 goal symbols distinguishes the better teams from the lesser teams. Brazil, for example, have 8 cards and no crossed symbols which gives them the maximum options; New Zealand have 7 cards and both symbols are crossed which gives them the fewest options. Despite the small difference between the various teams, the better teams generally have a better chance. However, the differences are not as great as in The World Cup Board Game.<br/>Play continues with the first group games being played in the order on the tournament format in the rules. The first game is South Africa v. Mexico, so each player controlling those teams play from 1 to 4 cards out of that teams' hand. The number of cards should be kept secret until both players have chosen, then they are both revealed. Goals are scored for that team in that match, Defences, Fouls and Offsides can reduce goals whereas Penalties and multiple Attacks add goals. Any spare Attacks and penalties require a card draw from the unused deck to see if they can be turned into goals.<br/><br/>Each match is resolved in the same way. All scores from all games are recorded - best to use the pre-formatted scoresheet on the <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gamesfortheworld.co.uk/Downloads\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.gamesfortheworld.co.uk/Downloads</a> web page.<br/><br/>The KO stages are played differently, more akin to the Board game. The Round of 16 is split into 2 sessions with 3 cards dealt to each player involved, irrespective of the number of teams. Cards can be played on any active team until the deck is exhausted and all cards played.<br/><br/>From the Quarter-Finals onwards all games are played in each round simultaneously.<br/>Draws are resolved by card draws to determine if goals have been scored.<br/><br/>Easy to play and a great sequel to the Board game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On the morning of 4 June 1942, fifteen TBD-1 Devastator bombers of Torpedo Squadron Eight took off from the USS Hornet to attack the Japanese carrier force operating off Midway Island. All fifteen of them were shot down as they pressed their attack, yet not a single pilot veered away. While Japanese fighters slaughtered the low-flying torpedo planes, American dive bombers passed overhead and began their screaming dives onto the Japanese carriers, sinking three of them and dooming the Japanese Empire. The sacrifice had not been in vain.<br/><br/>Both Japan and the United States had sought a final, decisive battle for control of the Pacific Ocean. When the Japanese unleashed their MI Sakusen plan to capture Midway Island in June 1942, the U.S. Navy was more than happy to meet them.<br/><br/>Midway covers the turning point of the Pacific War, with 11 separate scenarios, or game situations. These include the Battle of Midway in June 1942, the Wake Island relief operation of December 1941, the retaliatory raid on Wake Island in February-March 1942 and Pearl Harbor. There are options to allow the Japanese to bring in the forces historically allotted to the Aleutian Islands campaign instead of Midway, and the American battleship force that was not risked there but was available.<br/><br/>There are 210 &quot;long&quot; playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 280 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers.<br/><br/>The United States has her entire early-war Pacific Fleet, from the dreadnoughts of Battleship Row to the aircraft carriers that saved the world from fascist-imperialist domination. Aircraft like the F4F Wildcat and B17 Flying Fortress are present, as well as the Devastator.<br/><br/>The Japanese have their own battle line, headed by the incredible super-battleship Yamato. There's also the First Carrier Fleet of six modern first-line flattops, sporting the awesome Zero fighter and the famous Val and Kate bombers.<br/><br/>The operational map depicts the seas around Hawai'i and Midway Island.The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship's capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.<br/><br/>Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.<br/><br/>The third game in the Second World War at Sea series of naval campaign games by Avalanche Press.<br/>Midway covers the Battle of Midway, the Raid on Pearl Harbor, the Invasion and potential relief of Wake Island and other early war situations in the central Pacific. The map includes Wake, Midway and the Hawaiian islands. The game includes 1/2-inch counters for aircraft, 1-inch counters for ships, a strategic map, a tactical map, rules and charts.<br/><br/>Original production in 2002, re-printed in 2007 and again in 2014.<br/><br/>",

Depending on the category of field they are currently standing at, one player has to act (pantomime) or to describe or to paint a phrase given on a card and the other members of his team have to find out what that should be. If they manage to do so, their meeple moves forward.<br/>There are several editions and expansions for this game.<br/><br/>Nominated for the Deutscher Spieler Preis in 1993 (ended at the bottom of the nominations).<br/><br/>A new edition, Activity 2, was created in 2002  and is nowadays sold under the name Activity.<br/><br/>",

The second action is to randomly draw cultural advancement tokens and place them on the map. The third action allows the players to attack other players' pieces, and the fourth action is taking money.<br/><br/>With money, &quot;wonders of the world&quot;, such as the Hanging Gardens, the Great Wall etc., can be purchased, and migrations of peoples are possible.<br/><br/>Victory points are awarded for building civilization tokens; after three (or four, depending on the territory) placements, the player with the most pieces gets additional points, the player with second most armies half of that, while the third player only gets victory points equal to the lowest token.<br/><br/>",

Supershow is the worlds first UCG, or Unpredictable Card Game, that takes place in the underground wrestling world of the Legendary Fighting Federation. The goal of the game is to hit your finish card for a chance to defeat your opponent.<br/><br/>The Supershow gives players the back and forth excitement of a live wrestling match using its unique turn structure. Players attempt to build up to their Finish cards by using Lead and Follow-up cards. Once you hit one of your three devastating Finish cards, you will attempt to keep your opponent down for the three-count. If your breaks out of your finish, the crowd's excitement goes up, and the next finish is more likely to end the high-energy match. The simplicity of the rules allows games to last just 5 - 10 minutes, while still being highly competitive and too exciting to just have one match.<br/><br/>The Supershow also has mechanics for multiplayer formats: three-way, four-way, 2-4 player tag team, and tornado tag team. Each format can be elimination style or first to Finish. This is on top of different match types (stipulations) that are played with no additional purchases, such as escape the cage or submission match.<br/><br/>With over 90+ players at the Supershow World Championship at GenCon 2017, the Supershow is more than a game you play with some friends; it's a community of players competing year-round to have the bragging rights of World Champion. The founders of SRG Universe are life-long gaming and wrestling fans and treat the Supershow as a wrestling promotion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Adapted from the box:<br/><br/>The game is a simulation of events within a conjectural future history in which telekinesis is used to move ships through space. It is played on a map which displays 74 star systems in a three-dimensional &quot;sphere&quot; of space measuring roughly 40 light years in diameter, with Earth's home system at the center. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position of pieces.  Pieces' exact locations are not known until they &quot;meet&quot; in the same three-dimensional &quot;hex space&quot;.<br/><br/>The pieces in the game represent groups of four interstellar spaceships (StarForces) and space stations (StarGates). Each Player maneuvers his pieces (via Stellar Shifting) to engage those of the enemy. Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.<br/><br/>Battles take place when units are in the same three-dimensional location.  In the Basic Game, the attacking Player compares the total variable strengths of the involved units and consults a simple probability table to determine the outcome of each battle.  In the Advanced Game, a small tactical maneuver map is used. When enemy forces engage on the main map, they are transferred to the tactical display. Here they move (in three dimensions), attack and defend using a fixed number of action points per tactical turn.<br/><br/>Combat outcomes result in pieces not being destroyed but being &quot;randomised&quot;; usually to a location far from all the action.<br/><br/><br/>Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with Outreach and StarSoldier. There are also special rules to use Starsoldier as a tactical game for StarForce.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hey Waiter! is the first published design from Tichu fan extraordinaire Anthony Rubbo, and while it's not a trick-taking game, it is a game with tricky card play. Each player is a waiter trying to deliver his stack of dishes before anyone else, with the dishes being represented by a stack of colored chips on a face-down card.<br/><br/>Players each have a hand of cards, a few of which might be special action cards while the majority will be divided into two narrow rectangles. To play these cards, the player chooses two cards and uses the right half of one card and the left half of the other. Thus with a handful of cards, each half of a card can be combined in up to a half-dozen ways. The cards let you take actions like moving a token from one stack to another, with the primary action being to deliver food. When you deliver a dish, however, everyone with that type of dish on top of his stack gets to deliver it, so ideally you can first place a token on the opponent&rsquo;s stack in order to lock down that dish.<br/><br/>You can also split your stack into two or more stacks, thereby giving you more opportunities to deliver dishes &ndash; but doing so reduces your hand size and limits the chances that you'll be able to do what you want!<br/><br/>",

Search chests and lockers, find socks and be the first to collect three pairs. Monsters are eager to steal lone socks. Watch out or, better yet, unleash them on your opponents. Explore new rooms, find useful items in the hidden compartments of the game box and watch the game evolve as you play.<br/><br/>Your game character is a brave and industrious elf trying to rescue socks from sock monsters. You start at the center of the game board, while monsters move from the corners in. Players make moves as monsters first. The monsters lurk around the house, always eager to steal a lone sock from a careless elf and carry it into a dark corner.<br/><br/>The next player to make a move takes a color die and puts it underneath his or her monster figure. When making a move, the players lift the figures slightly above the board, so the die underneath moves with the figure but is not visible from the outside. After making the move, the monster figure can be lifted to see the die. If the top face is showing a closed eye picture, this means the monster has fallen asleep and the player&rsquo;s turn is over. If the die is showing an open eye picture, the player can perform an action.<br/><br/>After finishing the monster turn, the players then take a turn as elves, trying to find colored socks in chests and cabinets on the game board. If a matching pair of socks is collected, elves put them on their hands, feet and ears &ndash; and that&rsquo;s really hard work!<br/>The game ends when any one player has collected three pairs of socks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>n.b.: The German edition does not have the legacy elements, and has a separate entry here.<br/><br/>",

King Artus sends them to the valley of Camelot to prove their ability to reign and become the lord of Britain. <br/>Each game turn is divided into 4 seasons. It starts with spring when everybody can either supervise the seed with his knights or move his knights and mercenaries to conquer new fiefs, fight the other players who might retreat in castles, then siege and loot the villages or one of the two monasteries in the valley. Movement is either simultaneous (in three phases) or secretly written down, depending on what the players agree.<br/>In summer and autumn it is the same but in autumn you have to be back at your own fields to supervise the harvest and make sure the farmers give all their grain to their master. <br/>Winter gives time to reorder the belongings and spend the gold earned over the year. You have to pay salaries for your men which improve their combat strength for experience, may hire new knights and mercenaries or concentrate on your economy. If you expand too fast without buying beehives, hire fishermen and  foresters you won&acute;t be able to maintain your landed properties. This is the time to build castles and mills as well. At the beginning of the next year a random event happens (such as plague, floods or robber barons coming to the valley).<br/>The optional rules add religion (you have to choose a religion and build churches or celtic stone circles) and honour, weather (which influences the harvest) and loyalty of your troops. <br/>Winner is the player who owns first 21 of the 40 fiefs or has the highest amount of honour after ten years of play (optional).<br/><br/>",

You play as either the Coalition, pushing to nationalize the oil industry and later rise to oppose the Shah and remove him from power, or as the Royalist, fighting to keep the Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, in power and protect American and British oil interests.<br/><br/>1979 is a card-driven wargame for two players. Unlike many other event card games, each turn begins with a draft of event cards before alternating action rounds. Factional influence is each player's primary resource. It is used to trigger events, take actions and most importantly, mount opposition to those in power.<br/><br/>Scoring is not open information, keeping tension front and center from start to finish.

When you win a game of Playtest: Legacies, you claim ownership of the last card you played, by writing your name in the Owner box.  FOREVER. If you own a card, you ignore it if it ever tells you that you lose.<br/><br/>Playtest: Legacies is a full stand-alone game (60 cards plus mystery packs).

Until the very end nobody knows which snail belongs to which opponent, which guarantees great excitement. The game has simple rules, and victory is decided by tactics and the ability to bluff.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>In Pędzące Ślimaki: Na jednej nodze (&quot;Running Snails: On one leg&quot;) every player controls two out of five snails. It may happen that some snails are controlled by two players. On a turn, a player rolls the dice, chooses one of them and moves a snail with a color corresponding to the chosen die. After that, the player passes the dice (except for the previously selected die) to the next player. When the number of dice passed is reduced to one then the current player receives all of the dice.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the snails finishes the race. At this time, snails are awarded points: 5 for 1st place, 2 for 2nd place, and 3 for last place. Snails can also earn points during the race by landing on a mushroom or pushing back other snails. The player who has the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Pędzące Ślimaki is a third game in Egmont Polska series (all designed by Reiner Knizia) containing the following games:<br/><br/>    Pędzące Ż&oacute;łwie (Ribbit)<br/>    Pędzące Jeże (Bucket Brigade)<br/>    Pędzące Ślimaki<br/><br/><br/>",

Choose from one of five villains, each with unique abilities and weaknesses. First, build a secret base by drafting from over seventy different rooms, such as a Robotics Lab, Massage Parlor, or Torture Chamber. These rooms will attract a motley assortment of henchmen to your lair:  Beasts, Criminals, Scientists, and Mystics. Want more brainy Scientists around? Build rooms that appeal to them (a Planetarium? or perhaps an Intrinsic Field Chamber?). In this way, each player will construct a unique secret base and recruit a unique crew of henchmen.<br/><br/>Then, assign your henchmen to evil contracts posted around the globe. Become a local warlord in Asia. Steal a nuclear warhead in Europe. Build a floating fortress of doom in South America! Time, however, is a critical resource. The farther away a contract is from your secret base, the more weeks you spend and the fewer contracts that you'll complete in a round. Succeed at contracts to earn infamy and money. Fail, and your henchman might get injured, captured, or serendipitously gain a superpower.<br/><br/>Build your secret base, recruit henchmen, and complete as many missions as you can. Along the way, hire mercenaries, hatch schemes, and chastise your lackey. Do so, and the history books will remember you as the best of the worst!<br/><br/>",

Players are the defenders of the ocean and will do whatever it takes to stop the formation of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a.k.a., the Ocean Waste Island.<br/><br/>On each turn, ocean waste occurs on rivers, along seashores, and within the ocean. All players co-operate and place their workers by choosing from two actions: waste clean-up or environmental activity. Roll a die to determine whether a piece of garbage is cleaned up, or place road tiles to launch an environmental activity. At the end of each turn, all garbage flows downstream along the river, and the ocean current board will spin randomly, bringing a piece of garbage from the ocean to seashores, or from seashores to the Garbage Patch!<br/><br/>Environmental activities are mostly preventative measures, including adding a skill such as recycling or reusable products to a player, researching a certain type of garbage for waste reduction, or designing an ocean clean-up machine that can be sent out to clean ocean waste by itself.<br/><br/>If players survive a six-turn bombardment of ocean waste without having the Great Pacific Garbage Patch form completely, the ocean crisis seems to be solved (for now), and players win the game together!<br/><br/>Ocean Crisis also comes with six environmental side missions and scenarios for players to challenge, including dolphin rescue, sea turtle nesting, and shark defender, completing the full picture of ocean protection from an ecological point of view.<br/><br/>",

Legends say that during its descent it gathered the most marvelous specimens of ancient life. When its descent had come to an end and the Sun finally thawed the formidable permafrost, a Valley full of wonders and mystic powers was revealed to the World.<br/><br/>With time, Alchemists started to settle in this region, studying the marvelous properties of local wildlife. Years of experience and failed experiments brought them to the mastery of preparation of exquisite mixtures. Their skills grow with each newfound ingredient and acquired knowledge bear fruit in new mixtures. For the Valley hides much more undiscovered secrets.<br/><br/>Each year, when Winter leaves the Valley and Mother Spring wakes the World to life anew, Alchemists arrange a slight contest of mixture preparation. There&rsquo;s no lack of mixture recipients and enthusiasts, and domesticated mystical beings ceaselessly spread the fruit of the hard alchemic work to the whole World.<br/><br/>It is you, my dear Player, who will have the honor to take the role of one of the greatest Alchemists known to this World. Learn and strive for greatness, and maybe it will be you who wins the Spring contest and with it, the title of the best Alchemist in the Valley for the whole upcoming year.<br/><br/><br/>The game is made up of a series of player turns, that are played one by one, starting with the First Player and<br/>continuing clockwise.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player can perform any 2 actions out of the 5 available ones; the chosen actions can be car-<br/>ried out in any order and combination. The same action type can be performed twice.<br/><br/>1. Collecting the Ingredients<br/>2. Brewing the Decoctions<br/>3. Making Elixirs<br/>4. Rearranging the Elixirs<br/>5.

It focuses on the core gameplay of Warhammer Underworlds: Shadespire, without the spellcasting introduced in Nightvault, the hunter/quarry mechanics of Beastgrave, or the hunger and primacy of Direchasm. The 36-page rulebook has been written to be fast and easily comprehended, while incorporating some of the terminology employed in later 'seasons' of Warhammer Underworlds to ensure consistency with the latest editions of the game.<br/><br/>This set serves as a streamlined core set for players and includes two double-sided game boards that feature maps previously released for Shadespire. 90 tokens required to play are included as are 8 black and white combat dice.<br/><br/>Two warbands new to the system are included and can be used in other games of Warhammer Underworlds. Drepur's Wraithcreepers are represented by four glaivewraith miniatures and their associated fighter cards while Storm of Celestus offers three Stormcast Castigators and their gryph-hound to oppose the nighthaunts. Miniatures are designed as easy-to-build push-fit models. Each warband comes with a pre-made deck of 32 upgrade, ploy, and objective cards exclusive to their faction.  These cards have a stylistic re-design from previous Warhammer Underworlds releases but retain identical card backs and functionality. There are no universal cards in this starter set.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Learn to Play Rulebook<br/>4 Push-fit Storm of Celestus Minis<br/>4 Push-fit Drepur's Wraithcreeprs Minis<br/>2 Double-sided Game Boards<br/>5 Attack Dice<br/>3 Defense<br/>Fighter Cards<br/>Warband-specific Cards<br/>Tokens<br/><br/>",

The players make flowerbeds using double-hex tiles with flowers and place butterflies on them. The goal is to make meadows - the flower areas of the same colour. The challenge is that you can't place a butterfly on the meadow where there is another butterfly. These wonderful insects do not stand rivalry. Think of smart and artful ways to create separate meadows, and then unite them. <br/>At the end of the game, each player scores points: flowers are multiplied by butterflies on each meadow.<br/><br/>Cloomba contains a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple and intuitively clear rules.The game features an interesting market and superflower tiles.<br/><br/>For more experienced players there are 21 option cards with extra points and abilities. All the option cards are unique: they do not replicate each other and allow a great range of strategy traded for butterflies.<br/><br/>Cloomba: Summer and Strategy in one box.<br/><br/>",

Players spend Action Points (AP) during their turn to activate cards or move units on the game board. The game was originally designed for professional military education, but has been adapted for commercial release.<br/><br/>The units in the game represent current and future project capabilities for the US Marine Corps / US Navy and the Chinese Navy and Marine Corps (PLAN/PLANMC). The gameplay emphasizes coordination within teams to successfully find and engage the enemy through both kinetic (like missiles) and non-kinetic (like cyber) means. Over 200+ Joint Capability Cards (JCCs) represent a wide range of joint and adversary capabilities. This includes cyber-attacks, influence operations, bomber strikes, submarines, key enablers, and more.<br/><br/>The system highlights the importance of reconnaissance, long-range strike, logistics, and cyber capabilities in modern combat. It is designed as an accessible and modular system for both experienced and new players.<br/><br/>The game features a scenario system, where players can play on four different maps: Luzon, Taiwan, Straits of Malacca, and Okinawa. Players can play one of the baseline scenarios provided, but are also encouraged to adapt and create their own scenarios for the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The most successful Musketeers will be awarded gems. Those who fail will be sent to prison and will remain empty handed.&quot;<br/><br/>Setup: remove some specific cards depending on the number of players. Shuffle and place all Guard cards in the center, along with the Gem and Prison cards. Shuffle the Musketeer cards and deal 12 each.<br/><br/>Play: players select 3 cards to place face down; these are their potential rewards (Pay cards) this fight. Reveal the top Guard. Players simultaneously select a card, then reveal. If the sum is lower than the Guard strength, the player playing the lowest card places a Prison card on one of his Pay cards. Otherwise, the player with the highest card either places a Gem card on one of his Pay cards, or returns one of his Prison cards to the center. If center area doesn't have a card you need, take it from another player. If all you have 3 Prison cards, your played card doesn't add to the other players' cards.<br/><br/>The round ends after 9 fights. Players earn silver for their Pay cards, doubled if a Gem is on top and reduced to 0 if a Prison is on top. The player with the most coins wins. Alternatively, keep playing rounds till someone gets 100 or more points, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Poppies Campaigns (RPC) enables players to game WWI battles from the perspective of battalion and regimental command posts.  Players unleash opening bombardments and then maneuver infantry companies against machine gun fire to fight battles on historically accurate maps of actual battlefields.  The streamlined system for fire and movement enables a rapid ebb and flow with minimal dice rolling and lots of historical chrome.  Generally speaking, units can move or fire once per turn &ndash; machine gun fire is the notable, unpredictable exception &ndash; and can initiate melee after a move.  Fire resolution requires only one dice roll, made by the target and modified for the relevant circumstances such as incoming firepower, terrain, visibility, etc.  Throughout, players must effectively manage the dynamic tension between top down control and bottom up initiative to get their units onto the objective before their ever-eroding control crumbles to nil.<br/><br/>A tragic irony of WWI unifies all aspects of game play.  For most of the war, effective command and control of tactical units required a degree of concentration which threatened their survival.  In other words, the game illustrates the inverse relationship between a unit&rsquo;s responsiveness to orders and its durability.  So players must &ldquo;form&rdquo; infantry units to get them moving and then &ldquo;disperse&rdquo; them at the right moment to hold the ground gained.  Enemy fire can force premature dispersion which must be remedied to get an attack moving again.  For infantry, the formed condition represents troops arrayed for the convenience of top down command such as those deployed in skirmish line or a column-of-march while the dispersed condition represents troops spread out and hunkered down for their own survival.<br/><br/>The game illustrates the evolution of tactics during WWI.  In time, gas wafts across the battlefield, unit statistics change to show better performance while dispersed, a new method of tactical command and control (the &ldquo;blob&rdquo;) emerges, mortars pop up like mushrooms after the rain, and artillery becomes more responsive.  In addition to short, standalone scenarios, RPC has a &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; mechanism so players can link a series of interdependent scenarios to simulate battles that spanned days, and nights.  During these campaigns, the results of one scenario affect the start of another so conservation of force, supply lines, and replacements all become issues.  Players will get a sense of slogging forward in yards per day - at great cost &ndash; as they plot days of grinding combat.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/><br/>     Complexity:                 6 out of 10<br/>     Solitaire suitability:      8 out of 10<br/>     Time Scale:                 10 minutes per turn<br/>     Map Scale:                  200 yards per hex<br/>     Unit Scale:                 Companies, squadrons, sections<br/><br/><br/>",

Your mystical influences will link these lounge-goers into social cliques that give you access to the coolest party-people that all the hipsters want to be near. Mix a few drinks, rack up the magical monkey points, and crown yourself king of the Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge.<br/><br/>Score monkeys to hang on your martini glass by adding Jivecat contacts to your clique and claiming Trend cards through skillful manipulation of your lounge contacts. Be the player with the most monkeys at the end of the round in which a player scores their fifteenth monkey and be crowned the winner!<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of four cards and on their turn use those cards for their face value to claim low-brow contacts in the lounges or use the card's special powers to claim Jivecat contacts and cast spells (Zombie, Rada, Cheval, and Voodoo).  For example, a 4 Zombie can be used to claim a &quot;4&quot; contact in the Lava Lounge. Card values can be added and subtracted from each other, allowing players to pinpoint just the right contacts to advance their plans.<br/><br/>However, the player could use the card for its Zombie spell, instead. By paying a skull, they can place the card in their tableau as an extension of their hand allowing them to use that card's value for many turns in the future.<br/><br/>In these ways, players create &quot;cliques&quot; of linked contacts in and among the four cocktail lounges (Lava, Cocoa, Tiki, and Neptune) trying to schmooze their way to the Jivecat contacts that score points. The contacts are limited though, so several players may be angling for a specific Jivecat.<br/><br/>During play, a series of Skull Cards allow players to gain skull token reward that power their voodoo spells, and a Trend Card track presents players with monkey rewards for achieving specific contact configurations. The Trend cards also provide special bonus abilities to the players if they can maintain the required configurations.<br/><br/>Each player has a martini glass to hold the contact chips and scores are kept through hanging cocktail monkeys on the rim of the player's glass. Orange monkeys are 1 point and blue monkeys are 5 points.<br/><br/>Game end is triggered when one player reaches fifteen monkey points. The round is completed, bonus monkeys are rewarded for trends that have been maintained, and the player with the most monkeys wins.<br/><br/>To add to the cocktail themed fun, each card also has a different cocktail recipe for adult players to mix and enjoy.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a unique charioteer competing on the giant track for two or more laps. You can also play with up to four teams of two chariots, each representing a different Roman faction.<br/><br/>But there is more to winning the laurel wreath of victory than just handling dangerous corners! Charioteers can whip and ram their opponents to hinder them during the race (to the crowd&rsquo;s delight). The gods are watching, too, along with the tens of thousands in the crowd, and they may be inclined to influence the race in their favor!<br/><br/>So strap yourself into your chariot, ready your whip, and pay tribute to Caesar in Chariots of Rome!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sydney's Royal Botanic Garden holds a special place in the hearts of locals. World renowned for its location, beauty, and historical and scientific significance, each of its 29 hectares are not only stunning, but a calming retreat from the city's streets.<br/><br/>In The Gardens, players draft cards depicting different features of the Gardens, using them to build their own portion of it in front of themselves. Players then score points based on what their visitors see as they walk past the Gardens' various flower beds, ponds, native trees, and statues. The tableau you build will have three rows &mdash; waterside, grass, and cityside &mdash; and you add one card a turn until the area is filled.<br/><br/>The game is accessible and simple to learn, yet offers strategic choices. Its included modules add variability and depth for experienced players, with landmarks such as the Opera House and Harbour Bridge that players can gain for extra points or special abilities, so join the picnickers, joggers, lorikeets, and bin chickens, and enjoy your day in the beautiful Botanic gardens.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Place two tokens on a turn, combine their effects, create more lines than your opponent, rule the grid!<br/><br/>To play, you have only three principles to follow and five special effects to master&hellip; more complex game of tic-tac-toe with fewer rules than the game of chess that puts two into a battle of wits, with no luck involved, and which opens more than three dimensions to explore endlessly! ... A smaller 3x3 grid of colorful stacks makes HYPERGRID a challenge like no other.<br/><br/>Players gain points for each newly created line of three chips of the same elements (colors) on a 3x3 grid. Each player starts with six chips in each of the five elements, and on each turn a player places exactly two tokens. When an element is placed on top of at least two chips, the player can use its elemental effect.  When a player can no longer place a chip, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS : Play-mat, 65 chips (13 pcs in 5 colours), 9+2 6-sided dice, 2 quick reference cards, user&rsquo;s guide.<br/><br/>",

The battalions of Imperial France , pitted against a desperate coalition of Spanish, Portuguese and British troops, must rid the field of their enemies, thereby lifting the siege of Badajoz, capitol of Estremadura. All of western Spain hangs in the balance, no to mention the reputation of The Empire!!!<br/><br/>Played on a 34&quot;x22&quot; period map, over 400 multi-colored, die-cut counters beautifully represent the units that took part in the day's action. Infantry are portrayed in their regimental or battalion organization; cavalry are shown by regiment and/or squadron; artillery by battery or or section. Distinctions are made between line or light infantry and cavalry, grenadier or other elite forces. Important personalities also appear.<br/><br/>The game is ideal for one-on-one play or solitary study. Each turn represents twenty minutes of real and simulated time.; each hex an area roughly one hundred meters across; each unit individually rated for morale, movement, combat (both fire and bayonet) and range. Players are faced with the same tactical dilemmas their historical counterparts faced, though play balance depends entirely upon their own skill.<br/><br/>The rules are a revision of the award-winning system developed by the Marshal Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic Battlefield. In-depth historical commentary is also provided. Les Batailles dans L'age L'Empereur Napoleon 1er is the only game series that can claim.... a Marshal's baton in every box!<br/><br/>scale = 100 m/hex; <br/>time = 20 min/GT; <br/>strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)<br/><br/>",

There are a number of different auctions: sequential money bidding (akin to High Society), by blind bidding one of the three building types with clashes determined by money bids (akin to Basari), blind influence point bidding with like bids cancelling (akin to Raj/Hols der Geier).

Red and the pigs are in danger of being eaten! Rather than surrender to the plate, though, they decide to trap the wolf and shoo him from the village. Can they drive the wolf away &ndash; or will they all be eaten?<br/><br/>In Eat Me, If You Can, the wolf player tries to eat one of the other players to score points while the players, being prey, score by trapping the wolf. In each round, one player is the wolf and the other players are given Little Red Riding Hood (worth 3 points), Mother Pig (2 points), or a little piggy (1 point). Each non-wolf player then secretly chooses one of two cards in hand: Will the player sleep and rest, hoping not to be disturbed by the wolf? Or will the player set up a trap, thinking that the wolf will be coming for her? Once the players lay down their cards, the wolf chooses one of the players. If this player went to sleep, the wolf takes points from this player equal to the value of her character; if she set up a trap, on the other hand, she takes points from the wolf. Everyone else who rested this round scores points from the bank for their character &mdash; but only if they got their beauty sleep!<br/><br/>Whoever lost points that round becomes the wolf for the next round and hands out the character cards to players as she wishes. As soon as a player has ten or more points, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The guests are here, and they're hungry, so try to be the best waiter at this caf&eacute; by making sure that all the guests get their Just Desserts!<br/><br/>In this card game, each player starts with a hand of three dessert cards while three guest cards are placed in the center of the table; each dessert card shows 1-3 tastes that it satisfies, such as chocolate, fruit, or pastry, while the guest cards show what they crave as well as what they refuse to eat. On a turn, you draw a dessert card, add a guest card to the table from the deck, then take one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Serve (and claim) one or two guests by discarding one or more dessert cards to give them what they want (while avoiding what they don't want); if you give a guest their favorite item, you get tipped with an extra dessert card.<br/>    Draw one more dessert card.<br/>    Dump as many dessert cards as you want, then drawing that many cards from the deck.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of your turn, discard guests from the table so that only one guest of each &quot;suit&quot; is still waiting to be served &mdash; but the guest heading out the door (on top of the discard pile) can still be claimed by any waiter. If at any time you've served three guests of the same suit or five guests of different suits, then you win!<br/><br/>Just Desserts includes game variants that allow you to steal guests from another waiter by sending more sweets their way, to force other waiters to each give up one guest, and to hold a surprise party to claim a guest out of turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the card game Sandwich, you want to prepare the best sandwiches possible &ndash; well, the least disgusting ones anyway &ndash; with the ingredients you collect.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player is dealt nine ingredient cards face-down; ingredients range from the traditional (tomato, cheese) to the more unusual (mussels, melon). Each player stacks these nine cards face-down. At the same time, they each take the top card of their stack and reveal them in the center of the table. Each player then grabs one card that he desires, possibly his own. This process is repeated nine times, giving each player nine ingredients that they &quot;chose&quot;.<br/><br/>Each player then creates three sandwiches, each containing three of their nine ingredients. The players give one sandwich to three neighbors on the left (dividing them differently in a three-player game), so that everyone has three sandwiches in front of them created by other players. Players then take turns &quot;tasting&quot; the sandwiches on their plate, reading the ingredients aloud, then stating which one sounds best (worth 3 points for its creator), which is second-best (2 points) and which would be left on the plate (0 points).<br/><br/>After three complete rounds &ndash; nine sandwiches total &ndash; the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Financial simulator.<br/>Players start the game by managing their corporations (1 of 4) and using them as a tool for increasing the value of private property (like countries in &quot;Imperial&quot;). By effective speculation on the stock market, a player may take control of more than one corporation. Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential.<br/>The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.<br/><br/>THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR.<br/>Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.<br/><br/>Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&rsquo; plans.<br/>Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.<br/><br/>Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.<br/><br/>The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &quot;Imperial&quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.<br/><br/>There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible. When an experienced player plays versus a beginner, he/she shouldn`t have a problem with it. Moreover, keeping control of the corporation is useful, because it is a way of generating money for the leader, although speculating by buying and selling shares is a bit more efficient. It is the best to go both ways at the same time, choosing and changing your engagement alternately.<br/><br/>Well, it is also possible to play without any corporation and increase the value of private property only by playing as a stock market profiteer, but this way is recommended only for very experienced players.<br/><br/>There is a fixed variant of playing 2 vs. 2.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Decision Games' website)<br/><br/>ON 6 JUNE 1944 the greatest armada the world has ever seen approached northern France. That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germany&rsquo;s veteran Wehrmacht.<br/><br/>ATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg&rsquo;s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.<br/><br/>There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.<br/><br/>This is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set that&rsquo;s been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games. In addition to the basic rules, Atlantic Wall includes a set of exclusive rules to cover the special requirements of the amphibious and airborne landings and the logistical system required to support the armies coming ashore.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense is a cooperative board game in which players take on the roles of Rick, Glenn, Daryl, Michonne, and other characters. The Survivors must defend four key locations from Walkers &ndash; the Farm, the Prison, the Town and the Highway &ndash; in order to stay alive. The game board is assembled at random for each game, providing for variability in the locations; a 25-card resource deck &ndash; containing either Equipment, Allies, Food or Ammunition &ndash; is placed at random on one of the locations.<br/><br/>Walkers and other calamities are triggered in different locations by a 48-card Event deck (every card is unique!), which players draw from each round. They must then figure out how to minimize the effects of these Events, using dice to resolve combat and determine the outcome of some events. Survivors can work together to combine their combat abilities or split up to cover more ground. If the Survivors don't clear the Walkers out of a location, they'll lose resources &ndash; and if any resource deck runs out, the players lose the game. Thus, players need to keep the Walkers at bay while not using up too many resources themselves.<br/><br/>Unlike most cooperative games, The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense includes a leadership role that a player can take for one or more rounds. Each player character has a unique leadership ability that provides a bonus while that character is in charge.<br/><br/>The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense includes two gameplay modes. In the &quot;Beginner&quot; mode, players share all information on their Event cards so that the leader and others can take everything happening in the game into consideration. In &quot;Expert&quot; mode, players may not share their Event cards, which means that leaders might make decisions that are detrimental to other players &ndash; but those players can defy the leader (for a cost) and make their own moves. Why would they do this?<br/><br/>In addition to just trying to stay alive, each player has a secret &quot;Ulterior Motive&quot; card that specifies a mission for that player. If he completes that mission, then he earns a partial victory, even if the Survivors as a group would otherwise lose. The Ulterior Motive cards are recommended only for advanced players who like a bit of conflict in their co-operative games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The world's cities are founded on the aspirations of many people.  Their secret ambitions are seldom in agreement and rarely fully satisfied, but the interplay of their efforts leads to the unique character of each city.  So it is in every round of Cityscape.<br/><br/>Before beginning a city, the players set secret goals for their view of the buildings in the completed city.  Each line of sight gets a separate goal, such as the number of buildings that will be visible, or how many are equal in height.  These are recorded with dice as simple codes.<br/><br/>Then the players take turns adding freely a block at a time to the rising city until all the blocks have been placed.<br/><br/>The more buildings you set out to see, the more points you can score - But you only score points for meeting a goal exactly, so don't be obvious - play slyly to hide your plans till the end!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Is population a power or a burden?<br/><br/>if the economy is doing well the population will increase, as the population increase, does it necessary mean that the productivity will also increase? In most worker placement games like Agricola, Stone Age that seems to be the case.<br/><br/>This game plays like a typical worker placement game. At the first round each player has 2 workers and they take turn placing their workers one by one onto the basic tiles. The basic tiles consisted of quarry(get a card and take first player),mining(get a card), construction(build a building), Education(increase a worker). At the end of each round you'd have to pay your worker salaries. If you don't have enough money to pay for the workers this round, you'd have to sell some of your private properties and it'd become public to cover the cost.<br/><br/>Here is the most interesting aspect about this game, unlike most other worker placement games, as long as you place workers in the farming/gathering tile the resource for feeding your people is unlimited, they can create enough food for themselves. In this game, the cash flow is limited even if you place the worker in the market tile you can only receive money up to the amount that is available in the pool. The only way to increase the money in the pool is when players cannot pay for their worker and sell their property to bring cash flow into the game, otherwise, there is no way to add more money. At the end of the game, the sum total of the selling prices of all the assets is the victory point.<br/><br/>in this game, If you want to increase population, you can increase it as you like, but unlike other games, population will not score at all except for the effects of some buildings. On the contrary, if the workers cannot produce they will become a huge burden and consume the economy, making accumulation of wealth absolutely impossible.<br/><br/>Essentially, this players have to learn to balance between development of population and the economy. Too few people can not maximize profits. However, if there are too many people they will eat up the profit. Initially, increased workers to increase productivity seems to be very attractive, but when the workers begin to be a burden in the latter half of the game. there is no way to reduce the workers. There is no family planning nor natural disasters, major famine, massacre and cultural revolution in this game. Once the population have increased and if the economic development does not catch up, you will quickly understand what it means to be debt.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Murus Gallicus is a two-player breakthrough game in which players try to create impenetrable walls of stone reminiscent of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s Gallic Wars.<br/><br/>The object of the Murus Gallicus is to reach your opponent's home row or to stalemate your opponent.<br/><br/>The game is played on a rectangular board consisting of an 8x7 array of cells. Each player starts with a set of 16 tokens referred to as stones; one light set and one dark set. The board is placed between players so that there are seven rows and eight columns. To start the game, each player takes a set of stones and stacks two stones on each of their eight home cells; their nearest row. The Roman player uses the light set and goes first. The Gaul player uses the dark set. Players alternate turns.<br/><br/>The basic units of the game are towers and walls. A tower consists of two like-colored stones in a cell. A wall is a single stone in a cell. Only towers move. The main function of walls is to block the opponent's movement and secondarily they act as stepping stones which can be used later on to create new towers. Towers move by sowing as in Mancala with a stacking limit of two and only like-colored stones may be stacked. Each of the destination cells must be empty or contain a friendly wall. Tower stones can be used to remove adjacent opponent walls. This is done by sacrifice! Material remains equal throughout the game but slowly erodes for both players as players defuse threats. A player is stalemated if unable to move/sow or sacrifice at the start of his or her turn. Going flat out (stalemating yourself) in order to stalemate your opponent can be very satisfying.<br/><br/>Murus Gallicus is a game of balance, space and timing. Players must balance defense and offense. By controlling the board's center, a player can gain mobility. Players must wait for the right moment to squeeze through the opponent's defense. The endgame can be very tense thanks to the balance in material.<br/><br/>There are several useful structures players can employ. The Gallic Wall consisting of orthogonally connected walls (and sometimes towers) requires the opponent to go around the wall or blast his or her way thorough using a sacrificed stone. The Chariot consists of a tower, wall and empty space aligned. By sowing the towers stones in the direction of the wall, the two-celled formation glides forward. The battering ram consists of two towers and an opponent wall aligned. By sacrificing a tower stone, the opponent's wall can be removed. The remaining chariot formation can then move through the breach on the player's next turn. Lastly, a siege tower is a tower sitting within striking distance of the opponent's home row. Such a tower can tie up many of your opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>The true excitement of the game is in the playing. A sneak attack that squeezes through a breach or a well-timed all out assault can be quite satisfying.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The towers go up, the towers go down &ndash; that's the flow of the game in Ka-Boom, and whether you want the towers to stand or not depends on whether you're the master builder for the round or a saboteur aiming to cause destruction.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players lay out the 26 tower tiles, with one large tile in the center of the playing area and the remaining tiles placed randomly around it. Each tile depicts a stacked arrangement of blocks as well as a point value. On a turn, the master builder takes the sixteen tower blocks, flips the sand timer, then starts building whichever towers he wishes, with each tower being built on the tile that depicts it. Each other player is a saboteur and has 2-10 ammunition dice that she tries to shoot at the towers with her catapult (which is more like a tiny teeter-totter really). If she knocks over a tower, great! No points for the master builder, although he can use the fallen blocks to rebuild if time remains. If an ammunition die lands on a tower tile, the builder can't build on this tile; if he's started building on this tile but hasn't finished, he must stop and move elsewhere.<br/><br/>If an ammunition die lands with the &quot;Ka-Boom&quot; symbol face-up, nothing happens. However, if a second die shows this symbol, the player who shot this die gets to slam her fist on the table once; if the ensuing earthquake knocks over towers, too bad for the builder. One player has a giant ammunition die, and this can cause an earthquake all on its own, but saboteurs can't cause more than one earthquake a round.  [Note:  The Blue Orange version of the game removes the earthquake mechanic and giant ammunition die.]<br/><br/>When the sand timer runs out, the master builder claims any tiles on which he has correctly built a tower that still stands. The next player in clockwise order then becomes the new master builder. As soon as a player reaches 16 points, the game ends and he wins!<br/><br/>",

In Approaching Dawn: The Witching Hour, players are coven members who are blood bound, meaning that what one witch does affects another member of the coven. Black magic begets corruption, which is given to other members; conversely, White magic can heal your own corruption. But both types of magic are used to bind and banish the demons, imps, fey, possessed animals, and warlocks entering our world.<br/><br/>Each witch starts with spells that they know, but throughout the game can gain corruption to learn new spells and get familiars and artifacts. But how they choose to use these new cards each hour &mdash; whether as Black or White magic &mdash; will determine the successful completion of the scene (mission).<br/><br/>In this cooperative card game, each scene (mission) determines the goal of the game. If the scenes are played in order, they form a story arc, but you can play any scene in any order.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The words are printed in several colors (black, red, blue, and yellow), sizes (big and little), and styles (hollow and solid), and they have different numbers of letters (three, four, five, and six). The challenge is to read one word and quickly match it with the description of another word &mdash; without regard to what the second word says.<br/><br/>In the first round of the game, players are dealt an equal number of cards, and a card is turned face-up in the center of the table, forming the base of a pile. Players then race to find a card in their deck that the center card describes, and place this on top of the pile, changing the center card. Play continues until one player runs out of cards.<br/><br/>The second round of the game is similar to the first, except that the rule for eligible cards to play is reversed: now a card may be played only if its text describes the qualities of the card in the center. The player with the fewest cards remaining wins.<br/><br/>",

It covers operational land, air and sea warfare in Central Europe and the Northern Atlantic, while also keeping an eye on the strategic situation around the world.<br/><br/>Red Strike is a highly interactive game. Its detection and interception mechanisms allow for simultaneous actions and reactions from both sides. Having to constantly monitor the battlefield minimizes player downtime and maximizes their ability to recreate a very fluid &ldquo;What if&ldquo; representation of a Cold War gone hot. The mechanisms can seem complex at first, but will soon become second nature.<br/><br/>The rules that make Red Strike so interactive, also make it perfect for team play. Players can divide responsibilities between air, ground and possibly naval forces. The ground forces could be split by army/front or corps.<br/><br/>The crucial naval/air war over the North Atlantic can be played either as a standalone game, or as part of the Campaign Scenarios. As would have happened historically, its impact on the battlefield in Germany can be decisive; the interception and sinking of convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements making the difference between success and failure.<br/><br/>",

Actions are:<br/><br/>&bull; Slide a boat: You can move a boat any number of unoccupied spaces either forward or backward; a boat cannot move sideways.<br/>&bull; Rotate a boat: You can rotate a boat 90&ordm; around its sailor through unoccupied spaces.<br/>&bull; Move your figure: You can move your figure one space from a pontoon to a space on the boat that's empty or occupied by merchandise tokens or from one boat space to another or from a boat to a pontoon; you cannot move your figure over a sailor. When you move your figure onto a merchandise token showing on your objective card, you can pick it up.<br/><br/>If you don't spend all of your actions, take coins equal to the number of unspent actions to bank them for later. As soon as you have all of the merchandise needed for your objective card, return to your pontoon.

        "description": "In King's Pouch you take the role of a feudal lord in a kingdom divided by internal strife. After the king's death, the powerful dukes and counts of the land are fighting for supremacy. You are one of these nobles, looking to write your name in the annals of history. You will use your citizens to develop your lands, muster armies, and amass wealth. You may even try to secure the goodwill of influential public figures, like the remainders of the royal family. But never forget to keep the dishonest parts of your society in check: Excessive corruption may lead to your downfall sooner than you think. The goal is clear!<br/><br/>But the path you take to get there is yours to decide: Will you be a peaceful protector of the royal family? Or maybe a warlord, taking what you want by force? Or will you fail to fulfill your ambitions and be lost among the anonymous masses? Take up the king's pouch and find out!<br/><br/>King's Pouch is a &quot;pouch-building&quot; strategy game set in a medieval kingdom. Each round offers tough choices on how to expand your pool of citizens and buildings. Using the resources you acquire, you may raise powerful armies or secure the support of powerful characters. In the game, you will use several kinds of citizens (cubes and prisms) in different ways, with the ultimate goal of earning prestige points. Your pool of citizens is represented by your pouch: You draw available citizens from there and return used citizens to the pouch only when you cannot draw any more because it is empty. (This concept is similar to the deck-building concept seen in other games.)<br/><br/>The game takes place over nine rounds. At the end of rounds 3, 6 and 9, a great council allows for the scoring of additional prestige points from influential characters and conquered territories. After the ninth round, the game ends with the third great council and a final scoring in which you can gain or lose points depending on your corrupt officials and buildings, then the player with the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>",

By mid-August the Russian offensive crests on the Oder River, laying siege to the fortress of C&uuml;strin. Force marching from Silesia through blazing summer heat, Frederick races to bring about a decisive battle. On 25 August near the village of Zorndorf 43,000 Russians and 36,000 Prussians fight one of the most savage battles of the war. For nearly 10 hours they hammer one another, yet by day's end neither army yields, despite staggering losses - nearly half the Russians and one-third of the Prussians were casualties. Finally, both armies limp away, each claiming victory: the Russians back into Poland; the Prussians to Saxony and a new Austrian threat.<br/><br/>Zorndorf is the second game in the acclaimed Battles from the Age of Reason (BAR) series. The system presents a detailed simulation of warfare in the age of linear tactics. It is the framework through which players maneuver historic armies while seeking to discover which combinations of units and formations lead to victory, or are a formula for defeat.<br/><br/>",

Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Belgium. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River<br/><br/>The Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.<br/><br/>During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.<br/><br/>As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive? Play Tigers in the Mist and discover what might have been.<br/><br/>From the GMT website:<br/>An impulse based movement and combat system which forces both sides to hoard reserves to respond to both opportunity and disaster on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Four scenarios playable in one-to-five hours, including an introductory scenario, two tournament scenarios of three hour duration, and a campaign scenario which covers the first week of the battle.<br/><br/>Rules, charts, and examples are organized for ease of use.

Each area represents a city, town, or crossroads. Each area is named and identified by a unique number. The area numbering system may be used to facilitate PBM or PBEM play as well as to aid in locating a particular area. The system is set up such that a numbered area is always adjacent to consecutive areas in the numbering sequence, ie. 75 is adjacent to 74 and 76. Areas are connected by roads. Brown lines are minor roads. Gray lines are major roads. Units move from area to area along roads.

        "description": "Zeppelin Raider: Imperial German Naval Airships is a solitaire, tactical level game placing you in command of one of several models of WWI Zeppelin dirigibles as part of the Imperial German Navy. Your mission is to destroy as much English war facilities as possible via bombing raids, or to conduct reconnaissance over the North Sea...and still survive and come home. Zeppelin Raider is based on the popular Hunters game system by Gregory M. Smith that delivers a tense and nail-biting narrative throughout the course of play.<br/><br/>&quot;England shall be destroyed by fire!&quot; &ndash; line from a popular German children's song, circa WW1.<br/><br/>So hoped Germany after the initial successes of World War 1 turn into a quagmire and stalemate in the trenches...and now, a new weapon arose, capable of crossing the channel with impunity and bringing destruction to England. Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin's brainchild, the lighter-than-air rigid airship, came to the forefront of new weapons in this most brutal of wars. It took a certain amount of courage to go to war riding over a half million cubic feet of flammable gas, but there were no shortage of volunteers. Despite the arguable effectiveness of the world's first strategic bombing campaign, it without question tied up a huge amount of resources that England could barely afford, and for that reason alone was worthwhile. One hundred and seventy seven Zeppelin sorties pummeled England during the war, with high explosive and incendiary bombs, which caused a strong British response. The Zeppelins finally lost the arms race to aircraft and explosive/incendiary bullets, however, and losses were grievous. Over half of the German Navy's airships were lost on combat missions, most of those in flames. It was not a job for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>Players will find it challenging to survive an entire tour from 1914 to 1918, at which time, if still alive, you will surrender at base, having done your part on the front lines. If desired, a player may start with a more advanced model of Zeppelin which may actually increase their chances to survive. You may start at any month/year you wish, but notice that some Zeppelins are available right away, but others are not available until later. Players may be reassigned to a newer model of Zeppelin under some circumstances, but typically will stay in the same airship until the end of game or until shot down in flames, sunk, or wrecked in a crash landing.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to conduct numerous missions which include two main types: Bombing missions are required to bomb a specific geographic location in England (London, for example), whereas Scouting missions are required to scout a specific location in the North Sea. Players are not limited by the mission parameters for success; as you may choose to bomb or successfully scout somewhere else. The success of each mission can result in promotion and crew advancement. Just as in the real war, the game system involves a great deal of chance (as was the case historically), but ultimate success rests on the decisions, you make during your career.<br/><br/>A strong historical narrative is presented without overly cumbersome or complex rules to memorize so the focus is always on game play and what critical decisions you will make during each mission. Rules cover mission selection, altitude adjustment and gas cell tracking, venting, emergency jettison, maximum altitude, dynamic lift, wind and weather effects, fuel management, bombing missions, aircraft and ship encounters, zeppelin damage, crew advancement, awards and promotion, reassignment to a newer ship, a special resupply mission to Africa, and much more!<br/><br/>This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters or Raiders of the Deep. While Zeppelin Raiders is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player gaming sessions and organized tournament play.<br/><br/>",

You can choose to play either a single round for a quick game (20-30 min) or a complete game in which you'll tally scores over three rounds (60-90 min)<br/><br/>Each player is dealt two sets of 10 cards at the start of a round. You'll pick up one set, this is called a hand. The second set, called a cache, remains face down on the table until you've played all of the cards from your hand.<br/><br/>You'll take turns drawing, playing, and discarding cards as you work on creating your own collections and sabotaging the collections that belong to other players.<br/><br/>Collections consist of Antiquity and Treasure cards. The six suits of Antiquity cards represent six ancient civilizations. Treasures are their own suit and are more rare and valuable. The more challenging a collection is to create. the more it's worth.<br/><br/>A round ends once a player has completed at least five collections and played through all of the cards in their hand and cache. That player earns a bonus for going out first. Every other player takes on last turn and then scores are tallied.<br/><br/>Your score at the end of each round is the combination of bonus points from going out first, points for completing collections ,and points for the cards you play. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Here's what to expect in this bold and exciting set collection game:<br/><br/>     You'll strive to create collections of Antiquities and Treasures.<br/>     The more challenging a collection is to create, the more it's worth.<br/>     Beware! Your competitors can, and will seek to sabotage your efforts.<br/>     Careful planning, brilliant strategy, and a stroke of luck will bring you success!<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Diceborn Heroes is a 1&ndash;4 player fantasy dice game similar to the old school JRPGs. Players control a party of heroes whose quests send them to far off lands facing monsters to protect innocent bystanders. They must band together to gain strength and defeat the evils that plagued the fair lands of Dievalice. After each encounter, players will have a chance to level up their classes and learn new skills, giving them more abilities and dice to use in the upcoming battles.<br/><br/>Players choose 1&ndash;2 heroes to control on a team of 3&ndash;4 heroes and gather a green die for each one, then add 4 attack cards per hero to make an attack deck. Following the setup on the quest card players would then reveal a monster card for each hero into the center. Players roll a pool of dice then assign one to an available attack slot on their hero card(s). Once all dice are assigned players reveal an attack card for each monster then resolve attacks from the lowest to the highest value of card or die. Enemies target the hero that has an assigned die that is equal to or greater than their attack card value. Heroes choose enemies to target and can use hero abilities at any point to gain an edge in battle. After all attacks the attack cards are discarded and heroes gather their dice again, roll and assign all over.<br/><br/>Defeated enemies add cards back into the attack deck; if the deck runs out, heroes start taking additional damage. Once all enemies are defeated, Heroes have the opportunity to buy items and choose the next quest that matches the symbol on their quest card. They also level up by either flipping over their hero card and either taking an ability from one of those cards or covering up the bottom with a new class card.<br/><br/>Together you will either win and defeat the boss or have your party get knocked out by the overwhelming peril. If you win the next time you play the choices you made before will affect the next generation of heroes. Relics that you previously found on quests get added to the item deck and the enemy attack cards that you added will stay and affect the next generation of heroes. The choices you make will continue the story.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The King has commissioned a magnificent Castle that will span the ages. The ones who build it will be blessed with riches, power, and Renown for all time. This is where you come in. To build a Castle require workers, and your Guild is ready to answer the call.  You are one of the few, the clever, and the devious, who aims to scheme and expand power by any means necessary. Use care though; the King will visit the Castle and Inspect it to make sure that everything is to his liking. If he finds you have been participating in shady deals, he will strip your Guild of its Influence and resources. Claim credit for building his Castle and prove to him that you are the greatest Guild in the land.&rdquo;<br/><br/>CastleScape is a deck-building area-control game set in medieval times. It is a time of Kings and Guilds, money and power, deception and influence. In CastleScape, each player represents one of four Guilds who are building a large castle, containing many Baileys, for the King. Players build Walls into Baileys, gather recruits to spread their Guild&rsquo;s influence, spend gold, perform questionable deeds in the Back Alley, and complete Goals and Quests. However, they must balance their actions with how much Infamy and Corruption they will accrue from performing them. Whenever the King visits the Castle to inspect it, he will strip Influence from the Guilds based on their Infamy.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a basic deck of cards (gold, recruits, walls, and a few clumsy thieves) and a couple hidden goals. The game board starts with one wall in the center, and players must build outward, always adding walls adjacent to other walls. Whenever a Bailey is completed, Renown(points) will be awarded based on how large that Bailey is, and the player with the most Influence in that Bailey will claim the Renown. Starting in the same area and building outwards forces all players to have a high level of player interactivity and decision making so that no two games will ever feel the same. Inspections will remove significant amounts of Influence from the game board, giving players additional ways to influence how things play out.<br/><br/>CastleScape is highly strategic and incentivizes players to play differently each game. Besides each player&rsquo;s hidden objective cards and a Castle that is procedurally built each game, players will plan multiple turns ahead to build the castle how they see fit. The Market also has both static and rotating card options to keep gameplay fresh and interesting. Points can be earned by building and claiming credit for Baileys, purchasing cards, and completing hidden or public goals; but points will be lost based on Corruption.<br/><br/>CastleScape has been created to give a fresh take on the Deck-builder genre, adding heavy player interaction on a central game board, with far more to think about than just what cards you want to purchase. It offers deep strategy, nearly unlimited replayability, and interesting/fun interactions and combos.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungeon Saga Origins is a thrilling board game of classic fantasy adventure, fast-paced action, and beautiful miniatures.<br/>Set in the dungeons of the fantasy world of Pannithor, players have a number of quests with different win conditions, all connected to the game&rsquo;s story.<br/><br/>This game has been designed with a wide audience in mind. The rules are intuitive enough for family gaming (from 10 years and up), but also support clever synergies by experienced players. Suggested difficulty modifiers are also included for those wanting a high level of challenge. While very playable and accessible, success will come from good decisions and teamwork, rather than just through good luck.<br/>There are two ways to play the game:<br/><br/>1. With a traditional human Overlord, who controls the dungeon, traps and enemies. They can decide whether they want to run a game that is more challenging, or more casual, depending on the player group.<br/><br/>2. With an Overlord controlled by the game rules, and all the heroes controlled by human players.<br/>Mission setup is very fast due to pre-assembled miniatures and large numbered dungeon tiles. Variety comes from changing the numbered tiles, their side/orientation, door placement and furniture placement. The tiles have a square grid to simplify measuring distances, defining line of sight, and item positioning.<br/><br/>The game is played in Rounds. In each Round, all the Hero players will each take a Turn with a single Hero, and then the Overlord player will take their Turn.<br/>When a player takes a Turn with a Hero, they may both Move and take an Action (act) with their Hero.<br/>Aside from movement, players can take the below actions:<br/> &bull; Fight <br/>&bull; Shoot<br/> &bull; Cast Spell <br/>&bull; Use a Feat <br/>&bull; Explore <br/> &bull; Revive  <br/>&bull; Trade<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Some actions are resolved automatically, and others use dice rolls. Combat actions use opposed dice rolls and a dice matching mechanic.<br/>Exploration is a key theme in the game, and the heroes may discover loot (including legendary items), find secret passages or activate deadly traps. Exploration is driven by a shuffled card deck, which creates unpredictability on repeat play-throughs.<br/><br/>There are post-game sequences for campaigns. Hero players are free to trade items, equipment and even gold between games if they wish as they prepare for their next adventure.<br/><br/>",

In each round, players lay out knights before them who have different strength values. The color of the knight symbolizes the country one wants to conquer. If one lays down further knights of the same color in later rounds, they will be arranged in a row below each other. It is important that only one knight per color may be part of the conquering squad.<br/><br/>To conquer a country, one needs a knight with a higher strength number as the one defending it. Once a country has been conquered, the former owner receives his or her knight cards back. However, the other players will try to conquer the country anew by laying down knights with higher overall strength. They also must bear in mind the different special functions of each country. Most countries serve as income sources; some enable the player to enforce his defense troops and so on.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you will receive a &ldquo;general rating.&rdquo; The player owning a country receives the sum of his defense knight&rsquo;s value points in that country. Cards that have not been used will earn minus points. The player who now owns the highest amount of money wins the game and becomes the new king!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lone Sherman puts you in charge of a single Sherman Tank and its crew somewhere in France in World War II, and tasks you with navigating your Sherman through eleven varied and challenging Missions. Whilst this game is not a &lsquo;narrative driven&rsquo; game as such, with a little imagination it will provide memorable stories. The Missions allow the Player to invent any kind of back-story they like in order to enhance the feel of the game. Some events are randomly generated, but the Player always has at least some degree of control over the level of risk they wish to take and how vulnerable they leave their Tank to these Events.<br/><br/>The aim of this book game is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. Each of the 11 Missions can be played in around an hour, although sometimes a Mission will last a much shorter time if your Tank is destroyed! Each Mission provides plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and the many Events and decisions in the game.<br/><br/>This book is a solitaire hex and counter style wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo;). You will need to bring at least 5, but preferably 7, standard six-sided dice. Full colour 'Mission Maps' are included, as are suggested counters which can be removed and mounted on card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

What resulted was the most intense armored and mechanized combat since World War II. And this is what the game of BAR-LEV is all about.<br/><br/>Using two highly detailed map boards, BAR-LEV completely captures all the fluidity of this, the Yom Kippur War. Everything is there. For the Israelis you have battalions of Centurions, M60, M48 and Super-Sherman tanks plus a wide variety of mechanized infantry. Also, you have all their artillery to support this fast moving array. For their big counterattack, the Israelis will be using everything from the long ranging 175mm guns to captured Russian 130mm cannons.<br/><br/>In the air, the combat is equally exciting. The Air Module is almost a complete game in itself. Once again everything is there. The Israelis have Mirage IIIs, Skyhawks and the deadly Phantoms; all individually represented. There are even separate counters for both Huey and Chinook helicopters.<br/><br/>And now pouring across the canal and up the Golan Heights come the Arabs. With their low silhouette T-62s and fast moving BTR personal carriers, they represent a formidable challenge to Israel.<br/><br/>And they too are accurately represented, complete with Saggar anti-tank missiles and both mobile and fixed SAM sites. Their air force also has individual counters for the MIG-21s, 19s, and a few 23s, in addition to SU-7 and SU-11s. They too, have their divisional and corp level artillery. All of it is there.<br/><br/>BAR-LEV is not just another scenario, but the most complete and accurate simulation of modern air and mechanized combat yet designed. Each major participant has over a 150 military counters.<br/><br/>BAR-LEV is played in daily turns and may be fought with or without a &quot;cease-fire&quot;. It is an open-ended game, with the &quot;what-ifs&quot; limited only by your imagination. And now, it is 0700 hours, October 6, 1973 and the fate of the Mid-East is in your hands.<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/>* Map<br/>* Ground Module rulebook<br/>* Air Module rulebook<br/>* 450 counters<br/><br/>Inspired Frank Chadwick's Bar-Lev 1977 game which  included updated graphics and new concepts such as Headquarters, Allocation Points...<br/><br/>Which in turn inspired Chris Fawcett's Bar-Lev 2019 game with even more enhancements.<br/><br/>(back cover and user's description)<br/><br/>",

The real magic of the game is in the pseudo-real time action system.<br/><br/>When you want to take an action - say, seat a table in your section - you have to have an action token in front of you. When you perform the action you pass the token to the player next to you. Sometimes those action tokens can pile up allowing you to do multiple things at once. Other times you&rsquo;re urging the other players to hurry up a bit so you can serve your tables.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a very madcap, social experience, with lots of table talk. With the action tokens, though, it&rsquo;s not total chaos like many real-time games - there is a lot of control worked into the mechanics. It&rsquo;s a brilliant design, and one that will appeal to many gamers whether they like real-time games or not. Guaranteed.<br/><br/>",

In each round of the game, each player takes a puzzle board that uses four shapes (or six on the tough side) to create two images. Players are presented only with the images' silhouettes, so they need to determine how to combine which shapes &ndash; with which sides face up and in which direction - to create the two images on their card.<br/><br/>The first player to do so starts counting down from 20 (30 for the tough side), and any other player who doesn't complete her board before that first player reaches zero gives her card to that other player as a point; any player who does complete the puzzles in time (including the first player) keeps his own board for a point. The player with the most points after eight rounds wins!<br/><br/>",

In this game, players take on the roles of foreign traders who try to become the most prestigious trader of Dadaocheng. During the game, through swapping and flipping resource discs in the central area, players obtain resources and either trade these resources to the rest of the world or spend them to develop their own advantages within the city of Dadaocheng.

The choice is yours.<br/><br/>The game is resolved in less than an hour, which is quicker than a real match. FUBA is played in turns, with an average of 23 turns per each half. The player controlling the ball chooses the action his team will go for, then both players roll the dice to see the outcome. After this, both players move their team according to the tactics they have chosen. There is always a small chance of random events such as a yellow or red card.<br/><br/>Thanks to the flexible rubber board, FUBA can easily be played outdoors, too.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://fubaboardgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://fubaboardgame.com</a><br/><br/>",

It is a new game using the original&rsquo;s system and theme.<br/><br/>This is a worker placement game for 1 to 5 players, featuring strong player interaction. Playtime lasts approximately 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>Players find themselves as inventors trying to breathe life into their designs, all of which draw their inspiration from the notes of the master himself:  the Codex Leicester of Leonardo da Vinci. Ranging from relatively simple to epic, all these inventions require materials and time to bring them to fruition.<br/>Of course, genius alone won&rsquo;t get the job done. Get support from the Council and sponsors. You will need to expand your workshops and procure Automata designed by Leonardo himself &ndash; all this to increase your work efficiency. Hire apprentices straight out of the academy to nab highly coveted materials from the market before your rivals.<br/><br/>Time is of the essence. Race to be the foremost in completing inventions. You will unlock rewards and special abilities if you are the first player to complete the inventions. Otherwise, you will get less rewards without special abilities.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds, the player who has amassed the largest fortune will be awarded victory!<br/><br/>Who among you will be the most ingenious Renaissance inventor?<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t=Changes from Leonardo da Vinci (2006):<br/><br/>- The allocation of start game resources has changed. 4 resource selection cards are distributed,  of which 2 are kept, and their corresponding resources are collected. Receive additional resources according to to turn order.<br/><br/>- Competitive elements have been strengthened for a 2 or 3 players game, allowing enjoyment of a similar tension at any player count.<br/><br/>- More invention cards!  An increase from 25 to 40 cards,  with each card having special effects that players can use instantly, once in a round, and permanently.<br/><br/>- More enticing Council options!  An increase from four to eight options, with florins piling up on tiles that no one has chosen each time a new tile is placed.<br/><br/>- Card resources have been replaced with meeples, and player screens have been added.<br/><br/>- Invention card completion has been modified so that everyone knows what inventions are being worked on at any given time.<br/><br/>- Invention cards are now divided into current and future spaces, adding a new dimension for strategic play.<br/><br/>- The 15-week inventions are now only revealed at the start of the game,  allowing players to prepare in advance.<br/><br/>- Restrictions of the workshops have been lifted so that you can upgrade them, as well as add automata,  in the middle of working on an invention.<br/><br/>- Each player now gets six objectives, all of which yield rewards upon fulfillment.  So if you find yourself falling behind in completing inventions, these objectives will help you catch up.<br/><br/>- New effects have been added to the Laboratory and Academy. You can buy 1 work from the Laboratory and 1 resource from the Academy. Now there&rsquo;s a reason to use the Laboratory and Academy in the later of the game.<br/><br/>- The game consists of 7 rounds. Players pay salaries to hired assistants at the end of rounds 3, 5, and 7. Some effects of the Laboratory and Academy change in rounds 4 and 6.  In round 7, players can sell resources instead of buying them.<br/><br/>- The game comes with a double-sided game board; double-layered player boards; premium wooden, glass, and plastic resource tokens; and 12 transparent containers for storing components.<br/><br/>",

A roll-to-hit system enables air and (optional) naval combat to scale from the small dogfights of the Fokker Scourge to the mighty clash of dreadnoughts at Jutland. On land, corps entrench by flipping which opens up an in-hex dimension for every trench battle to simulate the tactical ebb and flow that animated the front even during strategic &quot;stalemate&quot;.<br/><br/>Since victory hinges on territorial control, the opposing sides feed men into the mill hoping to win a war of attrition before accumulated demoralization triggers a domestic political crisis to upset their balance. The prospect of a &quot;breakthrough&quot; to the green fields beyond motivates ceaseless attacks, but it's ephemeral until tanks and planes arrive in numbers. The presence of specific admirals and generals, including the U-boat ace Lothar von Arnauld de la Periere, makes the game personal.<br/><br/>A haggle-based diplomacy system enables history buffs to recreate the land-swap politics of the period, or players can opt for a simpler, streamlined schedule of neutral entry with a dash of randomness added for surprise. Production is as simple as 1-2-3 to avoid excessive math while enabling players to comprehend the &quot;cost&quot; of their losses.

To accommodate this, as well as to depict salient features of an 18th century siege event, several new mechanics including an abstract siege and bombardment table, and a random events deck have been added to the core game system.  Unlike previous games in the series, initial turns are strategic, reflecting troop movements over 1 and 2-day periods and allowing for the buidling of defenses by both sides.  When the American/French player decides to assault the city, the game switches to the familiar tactical game turns reflecting a single hour of battle.<br/><br/>Random Events is one of ten new features and a deck of 55 Random Event cards is provided, most of which define historical events from the actual siege and assault. Players have a maximum of nine opportunities to draw from the deck, although players may use Momentum Chits to &quot;purchase&quot; extra card pulls. Some cards benefit only the Allied Player(s), others benefit only the British Player and some can benefit either player. The cards include both political cards, which may add or dismiss troops to the battle, and tactical cards which effect single combat turns or even single rolls.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Look, Enemy Anemone is a trick taking game featuring cards with numbers. There's not really a lot of theme here, but you've got to admit the name is pretty fun to say. Anyway, let's get to the game.<br/><br/>Choose one suit per player; each suit has ranks 1-10. Shuffle the deck, then deal ten cards to each player. Set the nine anemone cards within reach. The start player plays one card face up in front of themselves. Each other player in clockwise order must play a card face up in front of themselves in a suit that has not yet been played into the trick. If a player cannot play a suit that has not been played, they discard a card from their hand into their score pile. The highest card played wins the trick and takes all cards played into their score pile. The lowest card played takes an anemone card, which can be added to a card in a future trick to increase that card's value by 1 per anemone card played. If cards tie for the highest or lowest value, the later played card breaks the tie.<br/><br/>Once all cards have been played, players score 1 point per card taken, with the 3s, 5s, and 8s of each suit being worth an extra point. The player who has the lowest score at the end of the hand gains one anemone card.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score starts the next round. Play four rounds, then the player with the highest score wins! In case of a tie, the player with more anemones remaining wins.<br/><br/>",

Makeshift towns cropped up around rich mines of copper, silver, gold and other precious commodities, only to fade away as the resources ran out. Now only ghost towns are left as testament to the community that once lived there. While the lucky ones made their fortunes; most folks barely scratched out a meager existence in these harsh and lonely towns. Some died lonely deaths in these places far from home, and now their souls wander around these ghost towns haunting them until the day when their soul can return home to achieve final peace. The ghost trains are these lost souls&rsquo; ticket to rest. These spectral trains glide majestically along ethereal rails looking for lost souls and give them passage homeward. You are the engineer of a ghost train. Your job is to find lost souls in various ghost towns and deliver them to their home towns so that they can achieve final peace<br/><br/>Players are Engineers of Ghost Trains traveling through the American Southwest. Each player uses their standard set of Ether cards (1-4) to move, picking up souls and delivering them to Ghost Towns. As you move, you expend Ether to lay track behind. Other players can move along on your Ether track for free, but you may never travel along your own Ether.<br/><br/>As you lay down more track, your old Ether disperses -- you can pull up your track to clear the way for yourself or to leave someone in the lurch.<br/><br/>A portion of the game revolves around managing your discard pile, as you only get half of your ether cards back each turn.  But most of the game comes down to proper planning along with timing your movement to take advantage of what other people have left you, while trying to disallow easy passage for others.<br/><br/>",

When Frederick II led his army into Silesia a long duel began between a still fragile Prussia and the first class power that was Austria. Featured here are eight battles from the fearsome contest: Mollwitz, Choutusitz, Hohenfriedburg, Kesseldorf, Kolin, Leuthen, Hochkirk, and Liegnitz. The game closely aligns with the Hold the Line system, but includes more advanced command rules, more detailed cavalry rules, optional rules for each warring nation&rsquo;s units, and much more.<br/><br/><br/>The Prussian army is well drilled and led by a bevy of talented generals, including Schwerin, Zieten, Leopold von Dessau, and of course Frederick the Great. The Austrian army is slightly weaker, but is aided by fearsome light infantry units and in later scenarios are led by such capable commanders as Daun and Loudon.<br/> As Prussia can you humble the Austrians and make your kingdom a first-class power? As Austria can you weather the Prussian storm and halt the first steps towards decline? The enemy approaches, the sound of cannon deafens, men shout commands, smoke fills the air. You must HOLD THE LINE!<br/><br/>For each scenario each player receives a number of command points to activate the units in his army for movement, close assault, and fire combat.  Each side also receives a random number of command points for the same, but never knowing how many creating a battle field chaos that makes the game highly replayable.  Scenarios take approximately 1 hour to play so you can get in multiple plays in an evening.<br/><br/>",

During each turn you collect cards from the grid by using your Gems and choosing how to use the collected cards to maximize your strategy.<br/>There are 3 types of cards: Golem cards, Gem cards, Rune cards.<br/><br/>To pick a card from a row that contains 3 cards, place a Gem from your reserve on each of the 2 undesired cards and then take the card.<br/>To pick a card from a row that contains 2 cards, move the Gem from the desired card to the undesired card.<br/>To pick the last card of a row, collect the Gems and then take the card. Immediately refill the row with 3 new cards from the deck.<br/><br/>During your turn:<br/>- You may use a Golem card as a resource by placing the card upside down in front of you. <br/>- You may summon a Golem if you have all the resources needed to do this, by placing the card face-up next to your resource cards and by discarding 1 to 3 cards with the matching resources of the Golem you want to summon. Tuck the cards under the summoned Golem. These resources cannot be used anymore, but each card will score 1 point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>- You may use a Rune card as a resource.<br/>- You may take a Rune card in hand and use it to score additional points, but only if you have at least 3 Gems in your reserve and pay 1 Gem to the supply.<br/><br/>- You may take a Gem card in hand to gain the bonus shown on the card.<br/>- You may take a Gem card to gain set-collection points by placing the card face-down next to your Rune cards and creating Gem dust.<br/><br/>The game ends when you are not able to refill a row with new cards. <br/>Score 2 points for every summoned Golem, 1 point for every card under your summoned Golems, additional victory points for your collected Gem dust symbols, and additional points depending on your Rune cards in hand.<br/>Whoever has the most points, wins. In the case of a tie, whoever collected the most points for their summoned Golems wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blocky Mountains is a dexterity game playable with 2-7 players in either a cooperative or with 2-4 players in a competitive manner or as a solo game. The core of the game consists of 3D landscapes that you build with large wooden blocks, after which you try to maneuver a large wooden pawn (&quot;the trapper&quot;) over this course.<br/><br/>In competitive play, you want to be the first to reach the mountain summit on the score track (&quot;the route map&quot;), and to do so you must master several challenges. Each challenge consists of a parcours built out of the wooden blocks according to the challenge card you draw randomly from three piles: A - C, from easy to difficult. After having built the landscape course, you have to push, pull, lift, slide or swing the &quot;trapper&quot; from the start to the end block. This trapper has a metal eye on top, and you move it with a wooden rod with a hook at its end. Some challenges require an intermediate string between rod and pawn, while others require both hands to simultaneously move pawn and grizzly bear, the bear being another wooden piece. A third kind of piece to be moved is provisions, which you &quot;kick&quot; with the trapper.<br/><br/>When you master the challenge, the next player decides whether to change to the next parcours or try to master the same one again. Depending on the difficulty of the challenge, your piece can move 2-4 steps toward the summit. If you lose track, fall down, or lose your provisions, you have lost this challenge and must move backward! The game includes other details &ndash; e.g., owls and squirrel tokens for managing your skills and special actions &ndash; but this is more or less the whole game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;Spartacus&quot; is a two player, card-driven, point-to-point wargame simulation pitting a loose coalition of forces under Sertorius against the Roman Republic as restructured under Sulla and his lieutenants.<br/><br/>As the Sertorian coalition, your objective is to force the Republic into collapse in order to rebuild it as it was before the Sullans changed the constitution. This is done through putting pressure on the Republic by territorial conquests, by exacerbating the tensions in the Republic, forcing it to utilize the services of new, potential Sullas to counter your armies in the field, or by taking Rome itself!<br/><br/>As the Republic, you must defeat and neutralize Sertorius quickly, before he can conclude an alliance with Mithradates VI and cause a two-front war. However, the levying of too many troops to fight the enemy coupled with the utilization of ambitious generals can bring on the very circumstances you are trying to avoid, collapse of the Republic. In addition, care must be taken with Italy itself because in the background, civil war looms in the guise of Lepidus, and even worse, a slave revolt under the able gladiator-leader, Spartacus.<br/><br/>Both sides can battle their adversaries using conventional forces, conduct guerrilla and pacification operations with the intention of denying your opponent control of strategic spaces and provinces, and attempt to hasten or delay the political collapse of the Republic. The central mechanism that influences all actions in the simulation is the Republican Crisis Track, which monitors the level of crisis in the Republic. All actions on the battlefield, the state of the empire, the strain of recruiting legions and utilizing ambitious generals, and the use of power politics, are ultimately reflected on the Crisis Track. The Sertorians hope to move the track towards heightened crisis while the Republic hopes to keep it well away from a political collapse. In the end, if the Republic manages to avoid collapse, it can still lose by having a strong, Sertorian presence on the board.<br/><br/>Spartacus requires the player to successfully exercise many facets of military-political acumen in order to defeat his opponent while preserving the most precious asset of all, survival.<br/><br/>",

The old city walls have just been torn down, finally freeing the city's growth outward towards the old villages that surround it. Based on the plans by Cerd&agrave;, the construction of Barcelona's famous Eixample (Catalan for &quot;expansion&quot;) has begun. It is a period of great prosperity when the burgeoning upper middle class families found their fortunes and used their wealth to demonstrate their power by constructing unique buildings and supporting initiatives for the city's inhabitants. However, not everything is so pleasant in the city. Its prosperity is drawing more and more people to work in the big city, and revolutionary movements are taking hold among the city's unemployed workers.<br/><br/>Barcelona: The Rose of Fire is a board game for 2-4 players in which the players compete for social prestige and personal wealth while trying to avoid the revolution that is spreading through the city.<br/><br/>In more detail, the players take turns using cards to build their influence by constructing buildings (tiles) in the new city, outside the old medieval walls. The better and more spectacular the construction, the more notoriety they gain. But at the same time, this construction boon brings many workers who are living in much cheaper venues. Building high-class buildings, while rewarding in terms of prestige, may generate unrest amongst the popular classes. In order to avoid strikes and riots, players have to make sure that they construct buildings for the popular classes as well.<br/><br/>During the construction phase, players place workers in the Raval zone depending on the sort of buildings they construct. At the end of each era, all those workers are placed into a bag, alongside peacekeeping soldiers. Depending on the level of unrest, a number of these figures are drawn from the bag and the player with more figures drawn from their color suffers a strike.<br/><br/>",

When you discover the culprit, you must go to the dragon he is hiding in.<br/><br/>The most important witnesses are the Spy and the Wise Man, so you must reach them as soon as possible in order to get vital information for the case.

Each campaign takes place in a different era, so your weapon options change with each campaign.<br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You get to decide how your Hornets are to be armed, and which pilots are best for the mission based on their Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground skills.<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved with the priority placed on speed and realism. Hornet Leader II has retained all the key decision-making aspects of the original game, while greatly streamlining the game mechanics.<br/><br/>While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices, the more suppression munitions, you haul to the target, the safer your pilots will be, but the less likely you are to destroy the target.<br/><br/>Available in two formats:<br/><br/>- Virtual Tabletop Game using the Vassal Engine<br/>- PDF files to download and print.<br/><br/>(<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.dvg.com/.sc/ms/dd/Vassal%5E2FPDF%20Games/3/Hornet%20Leader%20II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.dvg.com/.sc/ms/dd/Vassal%5E2FPDF%20Games/3/Hornet...</a>)<br/><br/>Hornet Leader II was a nominee in the Charles S.

        "description": "Battles of the American Revolution Series:<br/><br/>The Siege of Pensacola pits a numerically large but fragile Spanish army, supported by a small corps of French allies against a smaller, feistier British army enjoying strong fortifications and highly mobile Indian allies. As the Spanish player you will need to determine where you will build your siege gun redoubts and will then have to protect your soldiers from raiding British units to finish the works in time to mount an effective bombardment. As the British player, you have far fewer forces, but armed with special raiding rules, your Regulars, Tories and Indian allies must harass and erode Spanish morale, while delaying the construction of Spanish siege works for as long as possible in the hope of keeping your three forts intact to face the coming coup de main.<br/><br/>The game begins with Don Bernardo de Galvez&rsquo;s army of 5,000 having just landed on the mainland. How many forces actually are present is decided in a special phase during the initial set-up wherein that portion of the Spanish army that sailed from Havana must run the gauntlet of the Red Cliffs Fort guns. Hence, the starting forces for Spain are likely to be different for each game played as units and leaders are eliminated or delayed in their arrival. Once these forces are ashore, the Spanish player faces some hard choices. Does he send forces to take out the Red Cliffs Fort, to protect his turn 7 Spanish and French reinforcements from having to run the same gauntlet, or does the Spanish player immediately begin construction of the siege works, to achieve the longest possible bombardment before the coup de main?<br/><br/>The British player is outnumbered, but must employ his small forces in aggressive and often risky raids to slow down siege construction, wear down Spanish morale and worry the Spanish lines of supply. Getting a small force into one of two Spanish stockades can be devastating for the Spanish. Thus, though numerically superior, the Spanish player has much to do and protect, and will often be spread thin by a well-conceived series of raids. Giving the Spanish too many siege turns to bombard your three forts and/or permitting the Spanish to launch the coup de main with high army morale is likely to spell disaster for the British player.<br/><br/>",

During dangerous spacewalks, the astronauts try to repair the sabotaged spaceship, unaware whether their companion is helping them or secretly trying to undermine the mission. After each spacewalk, the Captain decides the fate of his crew members. However, a crew in panic can easily overthrow his shifty captain and send him to the void.<br/><br/>Houston, We Have a Dolphin! is a card-based social deduction game especially designed for a low player count of 3-5 players. The game consists of two alternating phases. During the spacewalk phase, the players try to trigger certain events by combining their cards, only knowing their own though. The actual happenings can lead them to find out who's on which side as the dolphins are working against the arrangements.<br/><br/>In the following Captain phase, the captain decides whether to sacrifice an astronaut from a team of his choice; flood the spaceship, which means the victory of the dolphins; or reset it, the goal of the humans, which is only possible after repairing the spaceship. At this point, the crew has the chance to revolt against the captain and his order, by secretly voting with their panic tokens.<br/><br/>Houston, We Have a Dolphin! is app supported, which allows an in-app narrator and an easy-to-follow game tutorial. To combine the physical astronaut cards with the digital spaceship, HYBR primarily uses magic, helped by their in-house developed image detection algorithm.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of an airship captain. As a recent recruit to the band of vigilantes called Zephyr, each player must outfit their own vessel and work together defend the last remaining shred of civilization from malevolent marauders and unrelenting warlords.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players upgrade their ship and hire crew members. Each of these brings unique abilities and can help you customize your ship and fill a unique role on your team. Each game you select a mission which shapes its overall structure, length, and difficulty. Join us, a vessel in Zephyr awaits its captain.<br/><br/>Game Details:<br/>This is a 1 to 4 player cooperative modular adventure with rogue-like elements set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk environment. Players pick their ship and can spend their starting resource to add tokens to their ship and cards to their deck. They can also hire crew which are a modular component that comes by combining two cards, which each give unique abilities, and adding them to your ship. Players choose a mission which each has a different lengths and difficulty which maps out starting supplies, the win event and the structure between. Players travel on their selected mission through a series of regions. Each of these has a unique global effect for the area. Each turn, or day as we call it, each player draws an exploration card which causes them to make decisions, deal with random events or fight in battles. Battles are a large portion of the game since you will deal with them on the way to and during a warlord battle or most end events. During battles, players draw a hand and decide what cards to play based on what their ship and crew enable them to play. They roll for the actions of their enemy and resolve the damage. This process repeats until one side or the other has been destroyed. When you win a battle you take the due rewards which can be used to trade for additional ship upgrades or crew members. These augmentations help to prepare your ship for the end conflict and ultimately win the game.<br/><br/>",

Nehemiah heard about the situation in the city, travelled from Babylon, and lead the rebuilding works.<br/><br/>&quot;The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the capital, that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem.&quot;<br/><br/>And they said to me, &quot;The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire.&quot; As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. &ndash;Nehemiah 1:1-4<br/><br/>In Nehemiah players take the role of Israelite leaders who help to rebuild the Jerusalem wall. The game is based on a unique, worker-placement mechanism:<br/><br/><br/>    Players will place their workers on ever-changing labor cards.<br/>    When a player activates his worker, he may activate other labor cards in the same row of cards that have already been activated. Doing this will cost him gold, but it may help him utilize his resources better.<br/>    When players are not watchful, the row of labor cards may be changed before they have a chance to use their worker(s), so it's important to place new workers on good cards, but also to use the workers already placed.<br/><br/><br/>Nehemiah is a fast-paced family/Euro game with different possible strategies. The course of the game is highly variable and intense. Players take very short turns, so everybody has to be engaged all the time. The game also has two, well-polished variants.<br/><br/>",

Whoever is able to arrive with the most valuable resources will garner the best profits. But it's not as easy as it first may appear as other Tuareg are secretly hiding their goods in caves and may steal away some of your business when they unexpectedly show up with goods that are more valuable than yours.<br/><br/>Tuareg consists of two stages in which each player tries to gain a majority of the various resources. At the end of each stage points are awarded for a majority of a resource, as well as for strategically played special cards (donkeys, caves, thieves and maps).<br/><br/>To set up the game, a number of special cards are laid out face up according to the number of players, and the top two resource cards are placed face up in the market. On a turn, a player can:<br/><br/><br/>    Draw three resource cards from the deck, placing one in the market and holding on to the rest (up to a maximum hand size of four, with excess cards also going to the market).<br/>    Load one of your camels with goods from your hand. Each camel can hold up to four cards, with at most two types of goods. Water can't be mixed with another resource, and a camel can carry no more than two gold.<br/>    Take up to four cards of the same type from the market and load them onto a camel following the loading rules.<br/>    Buy a special card for 3 dinars, paying for the cost by discarding cards from hand or the top of a camel's load.<br/><br/><br/>The special cards give you additional places to store cards (donkey or cave, each with different rules), a way to steal cards (thief) and a way to score bonus points (map).<br/><br/>Once the resource deck runs out, players take one more turn, then sort their resource cards on camels and donkeys and in caves in piles of particular types; whoever has the most or ties for the most of a type scores points. Used special cards are returned to their stacks, and players can optionally cash in unused special cards for one point each (or two points for a map). Players then shuffle the resource cards and play a second stage following the same rules, starting with cards in hand from the first stage. After the resource deck runs out again, players score majority points and special cards once again. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The players collect points in two ways: by completing the edicts and by connecting the various icons in their kingdoms.<br/>The game is divided into 9 turns during which the players perform actions simultaneously. The players simultaneously pick one card and play it on the table. Next, they pass the unused cards to the player on the left. Using the received cards, the players play another card and add it to their kingdoms. The game continues to the moment of playing the ninth, final card.<br/>Each played card makes your kingdom grow. You just have to follow 3 simple rules:<br/><br/>     Apart from the first card, each following card must be placed adjacent to the card which is already on the table.<br/>     Your kingdom has to form 3x3 square.<br/>     The cards can be added freely and don&rsquo;t have to match the ones already added to the kingdom.<br/><br/><br/>After completing their kingdoms the players go to the scoring phase. Firstly, the players receive the edict cards, starting with the &bdquo;Kingsroad&rdquo; edict. It goes to the player with the longest connected road in the kingdom. Next, the rest of the edict cards are handed to the players who met their requirements.<br/>Additionally, the players score points for the individual terrains in their kingdom.  The terrains with the highest number of different symbols generate points, which are then indicated by the scorecards. <br/>The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>Note: The Kickstarter edition included both Expansions and Variants expansions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Prospectus, players are mages trying to earn the most money by trading potions in the Kriztus potion exchange. As mages, players can of course see into the market futures to gain an edge in their trading. However, your skills at this are somewhat limited, as things will not always go according to your predictions. The game makes use of a unique and eye-catching crystal ball mechanism (inspired by the cube tower in Wallenstein, Shogun, and Amerigo) ensuring no market prediction is a sure bet!<br/><br/>Also beware, each mage is armed with an array of spells that can affect the market in unpredictable ways, thwarting the other mages' plans! Clever and timely use of these spells will turn the markets in your favor, while frustrating your opponents' plans.<br/><br/>In addition to the potion market, the High Council also has its own demands and interests in the markets. However, due to their immense power, they have been banned from the trading floor, and must purchase their potion directly from other mages. They will be a good source of income for the mages, and reward the markets if they get what they need; but beware, they'll also do their best to crash the values of those potions they fail to receive!<br/><br/>The mage that is able to earn the most money through cunning investments, shrewd spell-casting, and timely sales to the High Council will be the most successful potion trader and win the game!<br/><br/>",

Head on over to the Jurassic Hunting Grounds to capture dinosaurs for your ranch by luring them with their favorite foods. Watch out for tar pits spreading on your precious land, reducing the number of dinosaurs that can live on your ranch.<br/><br/>Fill your ranch with the most valuable dinosaurs to become the top rancher and win!<br/><br/>In Dino Dude Ranch, players roll custom dice each turn in order to collect resources used to capture dinosaurs from the Jurassic Hunting Grounds. After dinosaurs are captured from the hunting grounds, new dinosaurs are randomly selected to replace them. Players continue to collect resources and purchase dinosaurs until all of the dinosaurs have been captured from the Jurassic Hunting Grounds or until one rancher has completely filled their ranch. Players' ranches will be filled faster if they roll tar pits during resource collection. These tar pits not only take up precious space that could be used for housing dinosaurs but they are also worth negative points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players may also choose to purchase cards, which can be used to produce more resources, collect free dinosaurs, and add or remove tar pits from ranches.<br/><br/>This easy to learn game is a fantastic introduction to set collection/resource management games and is designed to be engaging for families, gamers, and non-gamers alike.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spains fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.<br/><br/>The opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.<br/><br/>From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.<br/><br/>Help Arrives! (HA) is a stand-alone game in the War Storms series 100% compatible with A las Barricadas! including the international help received by the Nationalist and Republican as well as many other units that fought on both sides during the SCW: The International Brigades, the Italian Corpo Troppe Volontarie (C.T.V.)<br/><br/>HA while utilizing &quot;PTH&quot; base rules, incorporates new and adapted rules and additions for this new tittle. The WSS promises many hours of fierce fighting between the infantry, tanks, artillery and aircraft belonging to the armies enveloped in this conflict. Just a few of the additions include:<br/><br/>Battalion officers<br/>Communist Commissars<br/>Recon rules<br/>Flamethrower tanks<br/>International Brigades<br/>Corpo Troppe Volontarie (C.T.V.)<br/>Condor Legion<br/>One 8'5 x 11&quot; chart with many overlays<br/><br/>HA has a moderate complexity with good solitaire suitability. The system emphasizes the role of officers. Officers can activate units, coordinate with other officers and their units, call for artillery support, air support, influence moral checks, coordinate assaults, and much more. Rules for special actions.<br/><br/>Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit leaders to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units<br/><br/>Representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFvs-Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews. Scenarios are divided into turns representing about 12-15 minutes of action.<br/><br/>Turns are divided into the following phases: Command Phase, Initiative Phase, Activation Phase and Marker Removal Phase<br/><br/>The game uses isomorphic mapboards, each of which are aligned to any edge of equal length on any other mopboard. This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios. Each map hex represents a distance of approximately 150 to 200 metres.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>4 Isomorphic Maps<br/>8 Overlays<br/>5 sheets of Counters (3 of 5/8&rdquo; and 2 of 3/4&rdquo;)<br/>1 Standard Rulebook<br/>1 Exclusive Rulebook<br/>7 Scenario Cards featuring 13 scenarios <br/>3 Charts and Table Cards<br/>2 Battalion Charts Cards<br/>2 six-side dice<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Fatal Alliances: The Great War 1914-1918&quot; is a World War I version of World in Flames. Like its predecessor, Fatal Alliances is all encompassing and represents every theater and aspect of the First World War. Fatal Alliances expands upon the military system of World in Flames to highlight the diplomatic and civilian fronts.<br/><br/>When we think of the First World War, we often think of miles of static trenches stretching along the Western Front. Indeed trench warfare was a huge component of the war, but many theaters in the Middle East, Russia, the Balkans, and even Africa were very dynamic &ndash; as even the Western Front was at times. Moreover, Fatal Alliances focuses on the major technological changes the war brought on, on land, at sea, and in the air. In order to prevail on the battlefield, you must coordinate artillery, elite ace-led air forces, gas units, shock troops, engineering units, infantry, cavalry, and early tanks.<br/><br/>The First World War was truly global, and in Fatal Alliances, the Eastern Front, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Africa, and even Asia and the Americas play a major role. German forces are loose in Africa, and South Africa's loyalty is uncertain. Italy will go to the highest bidder. The Ottomans face Russians in the Caucasus and British Forces along the Suez Canal. China is in turmoil, and could potentially join either side. Japan is nominally an Ally, but Japanese expansionism is already at odds with the interests of other Allied powers. Russia is primed for revolution, with Bolsheviks facing Tsarist forces in a battle for control of the largest swath of land in Eurasia.<br/><br/>To guide your nation to victory, you must navigate the world of international politics, swaying both minor and major powers to your side. Can you survive civil unrest or military revolution at home, while instigating it abroad? Can you prevent your troops from refusing to fight, and maintain control of your far-flung colonies? Strategic warfare on the seas and in the air must form a vital part of your strategy, preserving your nation&rsquo;s own will to fight while degrading the enemy&rsquo;s. Whatever your strategy, Fatal Alliances: The Great War is a truly dynamic and all-encompassing simulation of every theater of the First World War.<br/><br/>1680 counters represent the armies, navies, and air forces, which fought in the Great War. Two to five players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations. What forces to produce, where to commit them, when, and how? No two games of Fatal Alliances play the same, no strategy is foolproof, and any decision may have unforeseen consequences.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 20XX, a mysterious object fell from outer space. Not long after, zombie outbursts have been reported all around the world!!<br/><br/>In Zombie Tower 3D, you will play as a one of the characters trapped inside a building crawling with zombies. Working with your teammates, you must try to evacuate the building before it collapses. But beware! Zombies will appear out of nowhere every so often, craving for your flesh. There are also other desperate survivors in the building, waiting to be rescued. You must search the building for various tools to fight off the zombies, save survivors, and evacuate from the building!<br/><br/>Zombie Tower features a revolutionary 3D stand-up board. During the game, you may only look at your own play space, so you will have to actively communicate with your teammates about your situation to call for help or offer rescue. Items are also passed through small slits between the walls, and not directly to other players. After fulfilling the escape conditions, each player will get victory points depending on the number of survivors saved and completion of their minor objective cards, and the true winner will be determined.<br/><br/>",

Warriors who slay monsters, adventurers who grab loot, heroes who level up. Heck, halflings who stay at home eating pie all day. But the world of Munchkin is also sad and benighted, a place where those very same Munchkins are all too often backstabbed by buddies, dined on by dragons, and discovered by doom ducks. Heroes delve too deep, plummet down pits, and lose their loot &mdash; and that's before they die.<br/><br/>Now what if you combined Gloom with Munchkin? Keith Baker of Atlas Games is doing just that! In Munchkin Gloom , players shepherd their parties through terrible travails and troublesome tribulations until &mdash; inevitably &mdash; they perish in pain. Naturally, the most miserable fellowship wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Romans traces the history of the Roman Empire from its inception as a small Italian Kingdom, through its development and expansion as a Republic and thence to the full blown Empire that dominated the classical world. Enemies mount challenges throughout the game and ultimately the barbarian invasions drive deep into the Empire with Rome itself as their target.<br/><br/>But this is not just a game of conquest. Senators grapple for power in the buildings of the capital and players will score victory points by developments through the game.<br/><br/>Players start with four Senators and their number increases through the game as five buildings come into play. These Senators can be placed in the various buildings to gain promotions, recruit legions, take revenue and build cities, fortifications and fleets, gain victory points, and a whole lot more. Alternatively, the Senators flip to become Generals which the player then deploy with armies on their own map board to expand the Kingdom, Republic and Empire.<br/><br/>Players make a range of decisions as there are multiple scoring opportunities and routes to victory. Game play is speedy and at time simultaneous. The fortune of dice rolling is mitigated by the sharing of many rolls and players who fall behind in the game will benefit from three recovery mechanisms that ensure the game remains tightly balanced until the dramatic climax of the game.<br/><br/>This is the third quantum game from the Ragnar Brothers and gives players a unique opportunity for each to experience the thrilling rise of Roman power. The game also builds upon the auto-player mechanisms which have been a feature of the solo rules in their recent games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is based on the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; game book of the same name.  This series of books is similar to the &quot;pick your path&quot; type of adventure books that TSR and many others published around this time (mid 1980's).  Fighting Fantasy was somewhat different in that you created a character and rolled for combat and other effects instead of automatically succeeding in whatever path you chose (like a Tunnels and Trolls solo dungeon).<br/><br/>Anyway, the game is very similar to Dungeon from TSR.  Characters roam the labyrinth fighting creatures and gaining treasures to increase their power.  Characters have three stats: Skill, Stamina, and Luck and these affect both combat and various perils that are held in the dungeon such as traps.  The object of the game is to travel to the end of the dungeon and open the Warlock's treasure chest.  Along the way players must deduce the correct combination of three keys which will open the chest, and find or steal the appropriate keys.  This is done through a mechanic exactly like Parker Brother's Clue game: you ask players if they have any key cards of a particular number and secretly note down what their answers are.  The first player to open the Warlock's treasure chest wins the game.<br/><br/>The Fighting Fantasy Game Book is located Here<br/><br/>",

They may reroll any or all of the dice up to five times. There is also a board with spaces marked with aforementioned six categories and four sets of pagoda roofs, with 15 pieces per player. The result of dice roll specifies where a player's roof can be placed. As soon as the player puts four pagodas in a row (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally), they win the game.<br/><br/>The trick is that the player can place their pagodas on already occupied spaces on the top of other players' pieces if they achieved necessary result in a number of rolls less or equal to five minus the number of pagodas. (For example, if two pagodas are on a space designated to three of a kind, the player must achieve this result in no more than three dice throws.)<br/><br/>",

Now it&rsquo;s up to you to appease the five council members on the Selection Committee to win the Regency. The catch...each Committee member is appeased in a different way, so you must choose wisely as you can only appeal to one each Age.<br/><br/>Roar and Write is a competitive press-your-luck game about impressing different council members on the selection committee, garnering favor throughout the five kingdoms, and completing your own personal objectives to rise to the top of the selection committee's choices for the new ruler of the Animal Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to impress the Selection Committee over your opposing candidates?<br/><br/>Roar and Write is played over 5 ages, and in each age a communal pool of 6 dice is rolled three separate times. You&rsquo;ll select dice in order to make offerings to members of the council and gain favour in the 5 kingdoms, ultimately trying to meet a council member&rsquo;s unique preferences (such as a certain sum, all 1&rsquo;s, only odds, etc).<br/><br/>The more selection council members you appease throughout the 5 ages, the more you are rewarded. The sooner you write down your last council offering of the age the better. But don&rsquo;t forget your own needs too! Fulfilling your own personal agenda will boost your score as well.<br/><br/>At the end of the 5th Age, your personal agenda is revealed, scores are tallied, and the new Monarch is revealed!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The creature, if that is what it is, seems to learn and evolve to counter their every move. They must hunt it down and destroy it, before it finds them first.<br/><br/>Anomaly is a hidden movement, deduction, and combat game for 2-4 players. Players in this game are divided into 2 teams. One player is the Anomaly, while the other players are the Students. The goal of each team is to eliminate the other by depleting their health pool. Students share a collective health pool. All students and the Anomaly execute their movement behind a player screen, so it's rare to know exactly where another player is. Students will try to signal their location to the other students using location hint cards, and the Anomaly in turn will use these cards to triangulate the students' positions.<br/><br/>The Anomaly needs to feed to stay alive, either on the fuel or the students themselves. The students will be working to destroy the Anomaly's fuel sources, and to damage it with improvised weapons like traps and stun batons. The students have cards with abilities on them that let them and attack or take other actions. However, when they use one of these actions, they must give the card to the Anomaly. The cards have inverse abilities for the Anomaly that will give it new powers, like Possess or Teleport. If the Anomaly gets enough cards, it will also be able to evolve and develop even more powerful abilities. The game ends when the health pool for either the Anomaly or the students is depleted.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The East India Company grows quickly through the delivery of exotic goods from New World and Far East &ndash; but to operate on such a large scale, the company needs money, so the first world stock market is opened in Amsterdam. Rich citizens see the opportunity to acquire even more riches, so they invest in the stock market, while also wanting to take part in even more opportunities to make profit. Thus, much wanted exotic goods can be bought and sold, too, and with no secure routes a player can make even better profits by trading them.<br/><br/>In Mercurius players take on the role of rich citizens in Holland in the 17th century. They invest their money in stocks of different branches of the East India Company or try to earn much more profit through risky trade in exotic goods. Players have their own information about activities in the far lands and about events which can influence prices at the market, but each of them sees only part of the picture, so they have to look at what other players are doing and which prices are influenced by them.<br/><br/>Players have starting cash at the beginning of the game, along with five &quot;changing prices&quot; cards and four cards which allow them to take special actions during play. The game board shows prices for stocks of six branches of the East India Company and for six goods those branches trade. On a turn, a player can make up to three purchases or sales of stocks or goods as he wishes. He then plays one &quot;changing prices&quot; card from his hand. Each card changes the price of one stock and one good. Each card changes the prices three times, once on the turn it's played and on two consecutive turns. The tricky part is that cards move the value of goods twice as much as the value of stocks, so players can earn more by trading goods &ndash; but doing so is far more risky.<br/><br/>Who will become the richest citizen of Holland and win the game?<br/><br/>",

The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.<br/><br/>Rules apply to either game:<br/><br/>Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.<br/><br/>The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Long ago, there was an island nation in the southern sea that enjoyed a great period of cultural prosperity. Surrounded by natural beauty and gifted with tremendous intellect, the island's residents believed their peaceful lifestyle would go on for all time. But one morning, a fearsome demon broke free and began to drag the island into the depths of the sea. With the end growing near, the king ordered his most loyal retainers to gather as much of the nation's knowledge and as many of the island's treasures as they could, and flee to the northern lands.<br/><br/>In Pralaya, your goal is to secure island relics and people and evacuate them&nbsp;from the sinking island. The more you&nbsp;evacuate, the higher you score. But don't press your luck too much or you'll risk&nbsp;valuable&nbsp;points for saving yourself.<br/><br/>Will you collect the most valuable relics,&nbsp;coins, and buy your safe passage from the island before it sinks into the deep?<br/><br/>遥か昔、南海には美しい島が存在しました。しかし恐るべき悪魔が島を海に沈め始めたのです。島が沈む前に多くの宝を集め北の地に脱出しましょう！<br/><br/>島の遺物と残された命を集め、北の地へ脱出する事が目的です。より多くを集めた人が勝利しますが、島が完全に沈む前に脱出しなければ命を落としてしまいます。遺物を効率よく集める事はもちろん、脱出のタイミングを見極める事も重要となります。なお、逃げ遅れたとしても集めた遺物だけでも事前に船で送り出していた場合、その功績は評価されるので必ず負けるわけではありません。新しいタイプの戦略型チキンレースです。<br/><br/>",

Investigating reports of a 'creature' stalking the area, you venture into Castle Mordengraf, the Gothic castle overshadowing the village.<br/><br/>Captured by an unseen force, you must escape the castle's dungeon or become the creature's latest victim. But you only have three hours before the creature resumes its hunt ...<br/><br/>Curse of the Dark is a co-operative escape room game, where players must build out the floorplan of Castle Mordengraf, uncovering and exploring new rooms of the castle to advance the story. The game features puzzle books, map tiles and other interactive components and features.

        "description": "This CCG plays more like a board game than a card game.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a Guardian, a very powerful creature with special abilities.  In front of the Guardian you place a set of 3 stronghold cards.  These are locations that give you bonuses.  In front of these are 3 empty spaces that terrain cards will be placed.  These will match up to the other players 3 empty spaces thus creating the board.<br/><br/>Onto your stronghold you can place creatures under a shield to keep them hidden.  Only creatures under a shield can move and they can move up to 2 spaces with some restrictions.  There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.<br/><br/>When two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.  The weaker army must then retreat or the attacker in case of a tie.<br/><br/>To win you must either control all six of the lands between the strongholds, destroy 5 of the opponents shields or destroy the opposing Guardian.<br/><br/>After the first release, a revised edition was published ('Guardians Revised Edition'). The game has three expansions, namely<br/><br/>    Dagger Isle<br/>    Drifter's Nexus<br/>    Necropolis Park<br/><br/><br/>",

On each of your turns you choose to either explore the islet to receive resources, or position yourself to create the perfect nests in which to spawn your precious eggs.<br/><br/>This way, together - as much as against one another - you&rsquo;ll build a tropical islet with its different biomes, and whoever spawns all their eggs on the islet first will be the winner.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Whoever has touched an egg most recently starts the game.<br/><br/>Starting with that player, take turns clockwise. On your turn, you must take either an EXPLORE or a MOVE action.<br/><br/>When you EXPLORE, EXPLORE you lay 1 to 4 tiles from your reserve, expanding the islet, and receive resources in return.<br/><br/>When you MOVE, you can ADVANCE your pawn and SPAWN (lay<br/>eggs), as many times as you want and in any order and combination, as long as you can pay the required resource cost.<br/><br/>The end of the game can be triggered in 2 different ways:<br/>● When a player SPAWNS their last egg, their turn ends as normal and then the current round ends (so that everyone plays the same number of turns).<br/>● When a player takes the last islet tile from the bag, the current round ends and a new round is played (so that everyone plays the same number of turns).<br/><br/>In any case, the player who spawned the most eggs wins the game.<br/><br/>ISLET in the 2nd game in the series that started with Coral.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

A deck of numbered cards from 1-100 is shuffled and players start with 4 each. You may either play a card and stick a peg in, or draw a card, the hand limit being 4. And of course, you're trying to get five of your pegs in a row to win. Simple, except that playing a card allows you to place a peg in that number, or any empty number above. So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block. Very good fun and nice for non-gamers.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Take 5<br/>    5 in a Row<br/>    Go-Moku<br/>    Renju<br/>    Pente<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Admirals' War: World War II at Sea (AW) is a board game recreation of the strategic naval situation in WWII from the early months of the Atlantic war to the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea in late 1944. All the major combat ships in the Axis and Allied navies are portrayed in the game in a simple (but not simplistic) simulation of the war on a strategic level with most of the tactical details represented by simple game mechanics. The resulting game is fast-paced and fun to play, while remaining true to history.<br/><br/>Much of AW has some similarity to the mechanics used in Avalon Hill's classic game Victory in The Pacific (VITP), applying a modern application to the sea wars in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. This game combines both theaters into one game.<br/><br/>Players familiar with these older titles will immediately notice that the map-board representing the Pacific has some similarities to its predecessor, whereas the map for the Atlantic theater has greatly changed. This was done to more seamlessly combine the mechanics of the two games, and to better reflect the nature of the Atlantic naval fighting.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In Hunting Party, players race to kill the Dark Agents and solve the prophecy by building the destined party from 36 unique Hunters. Players will hire hunters by bidding with shares of the King's Bounty. These hunters will give players the skills they need to hunt, and the abilities to make a difference. With your share of the bounty, you can buy items that will increase your party's skills, abilities, or even level up your hunters into champions.<br/><br/>Hunting Party is psychologically intense in the bidding of hunters, misleading of the prophecy, and in making deals of both cooperation and aggression. Players must balance the utilization of their shares and gold while planning carefully how they will use their hunters' abilities and their items to create opportunities and combos. However, the main challenge of Hunting Party is the use of Multiple Build Paths. Players are repeatedly asked,<br/><br/>How do you want to play?<br/><br/>Do you want to build a large party, a cheap party, a party of champions, a diversified party, or a specific one?<br/><br/>Do you want to focus on ability combinations, killing Dark Agents, or attacking other players?<br/><br/>Do you want to hoard gold, hoard items, or solve the Prophecy?<br/><br/>It's all in how you want to play!<br/><br/>Each game, you'll start off with a different Hero, a variable game board, and a different prophecy to solve, ensuring that you'll never play the same game twice.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     VASSAL (real-time or PBEM)<br/><br/><br/>",

Get keys to open doors, find magic elixirs to boost health, and acquire weapons and armor to improve attack and defense stats and reduce damage from future enemy encounters.  Prepare to fight a deadly boss at the end of each area to win and advance the story.<br/><br/>The book pages are laminated and you track your play progress, inventory and stats, and enemy encounters right on the page with a dry-erase pen.<br/><br/>",

The latter is the original &quot;Cantaloop&quot; experience, where all the text you shouldn't see from the beginning is covered with colored scramble text. As a result you will need to use a red foil to read the text --- and your printer is probably going to request new color cartridges afterwards.<br/><br/>There is also &quot;clear text&quot; version.

Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.<br/><br/>Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: BMO vs. Lady Rainicorn, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!<br/><br/>Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box.

The hungriest animals race to catch their prey first. Others become angry and shout, while the chameleon hides. When the hunter appears, there is panic as the animals race to protect themselves!<br/><br/>Jungle Speed Safari is a standalone game that's part of the Jungle Speed family. The core gameplay is the same, with players turning over cards from their personal stacks one by one in front of themselves and reacting when certain cards or combinations of cards appear, but Jungle Speed Safari features five wooden totems to grab instead of one, and you interact with them in different ways, with every card that's revealed possibly triggering an action. If a player reveals a hungry animal card, for example, all players must race to grab the appropriate totem to satisfy the animal. Whoever grabs that totem adds the hungry animal card to his score pile.<br/><br/>",

Its size is dictated by the three randomizing discs embedded in its base, which are used to generate a new playing area every time (there are 1,728 (12^3) different setups possible).<br/><br/>You buy properties, drill for oil, link properties with pipelines so as to collect royalties and try to be the richest player.  Event cards complicate matters.  Drilling is resolved with a little rig whose plunger is pushed up if it doesn't go through the hidden disc; if it pushes through all three, the well is dry.  Deeper holes cost more, of course.<br/><br/>Pipelines can be bought once you have 4 producing oil wells on a property; they reach across that property's boundary to another player's property, and are used to siphon royalties from him every turn.  This is a clever mechanic that accelerates bankruptcy and keeps total playing time within reasonable limits.<br/><br/>Once all players but one are pushed into bankruptcy, the remaining one is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gameplay overview<br/>Saigon 75 is a simple and swift strategic wargame, simulating the fratricidal struggle between North and South Vietnam from summer 1973 to spring 1975. Everything is contained within a few pages of rules and 1 hour of strategy, with pressure at every moment! The game portrays the differences between North Vietnamese divisions and the Rangers/Marines/Parachutists and other units of the South Vietnamese. Air power and desertion are also featured, with the whole thing being completed by event cards that give the game great replayability. An ingenious mix that provides a game on tenterhooks right up to the last turn! If, at the end of any turn, the North player controls Saigon province the game ends with a North victory. The South player wins by successfully defending Saigon until the end of Turn 8.<br/><br/>Solo Rules<br/>In the solo mode, you play the South, while the North is controlled by a deck of cards (AI). There is not a lot of difference between the solo and two-player modes in terms of the rules and the winning condition. During each turn, there are phases (movement, attack, etc.) where the AI draws one card and does a specific action.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grow a beautiful garden of tiles on which flower meeples bloom down connecting vines of the same color. Players race to be the first to play all their flowers first in this cascade of color and fun for 2-4 players. The twist? When growing the garden, helping others bloom can be really good for the active player - even secure the immediate win! Well chosen tile placement is the key to success in this evolving puzzle of a game that will grow on you.<br/><br/>In Trellis, each player has a supply of flower meeples in their unique color that they are working to place in the garden. Each player also has a hand of hex tiles depicting a tangled weave of differently colored vines.<br/><br/>On their turn, the active player must plant a tile on the table, growing the size of the garden. Once a tile is placed, automatic blooms happen first. All newly connected vines will bloom flower meeples, if the newly connected vine matches color with the neighbor tile and only if the vine on the neighbor tile has already been claimed with a flower.<br/><br/>The active player then places a flower claiming a vine on the tile they placed that has not yet bloomed. Immediately, each unclaimed vine of the same color on neighboring tiles connected to the vine just claimed will automatically bloom for that player.<br/><br/>Finally, if any opponents had flowers bloom due to the tile placement, then the active player gets to place a bonus flower - one for each flower bloom they helped their opponent place! If there are no unclaimed vines available on the tile the active player placed, they get to place a bloom on any unclaimed vine anywhere in the garden!<br/><br/>The first player to play all fifteen of their flowers immediately wins. Which vines to claim and when to help opponents grow flowers in order to gain bonus blooms for yourself is very furtile soil to ponder during a quick play of Trellis.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the beautiful beach of Karekare, on the wondrous archipelago known as Aotearoa (also called New Zealand), in the South Pacific Ocean! In the 13th Century, Polynesian explorers discovered this unique place. Over the decades they colonized it, and a new culture arose &mdash; the Maori &mdash; who called these islands home. This game challenges you to lead one of the iwis (tribes) who settled there. Explore the islands, take control of territory, accumulate mana (honor) for your iwi, and claim your place in history!<br/><br/>In Karekare, 2 to 4 players become leaders of different Maori iwis that reached Aotearoa in search of a new home. The players explore the territory by adding new land tiles, which gives them the opportunity to perform specific actions that will help their iwi expand and settle new lands. When a player lays a tile on the table, that triggers a reaction depending on the other tiles adjacent to the freshly placed one. These reactions will generate resources, will allow players to place control tokens on the board and eventually grant them mana points. The winner is the player whose iwi can acquire the most mana before the end of the third era.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(&quot;There's No Turning Back!&quot;) is played in two phases, with players collecting tiles in phase one, then scoring their tiles in phase two. People move into phase two at their own pace, and once you go in, you're there for the rest of the game &mdash; which might not be long!<br/><br/>The game includes 132 tiles, specifically two sets of tiles in six colors, with the tiles being numbered 1-11 in each color. Each player starts with eight tiles in hand, and you can discard and redraw once before the game begins. On a turn, you either (1) discard up to four tiles in your hand from the game, then draw that many tiles from the bag or (2) play one or more tiles from your hand to a color on your board, then draw that many tiles. You can play tiles of only one color, and all the tiles played must be equal to or less than any tiles of that color you already have in play. You place these tiles in descending order, and you can build at most six rows during the game, one of each color.<br/><br/>Whenever you want, you can switch to phase two. Once you do this, on a turn you either (1) discard up to four tiles in your hand from the game, then draw that many tiles from the bag or (2) clear tiles from your play area to score them. To do this, choose one or more tiles in your play area of only a single color, starting with the lowest valued tile (or tiles), then sum the tiles you want to score. You must then &quot;pay&quot; to score these tiles by discarding tiles of one color from your hand that sum to this same amount or higher. The tiles you discard from your hand don't have to be the same color as the color of the tiles you're scoring. Remove the tiles you paid from the game, and place the tiles you've cleared face down in a score pile. Refill your hand to eight tiles at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>As soon as someone draws the final tile from the bag, you complete the round so that everyone has had the same number of turns, then the game ends. A player's score equals the sum of the tiles that they've cleared minus the sum of the tiles they still have in play. (Tiles in a player's hand are discarded.) Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

Agents assigned to the Warehouse risk their lives to retrieve these artifacts to keep them away from nefarious individuals who seek to use the artifacts for personal gain. In Warehouse 13: The Board Game, players take on the role of Warehouse Agents who must work together to retrieve these artifacts. But is everyone looking out for the Warehouse's interests, or might one of the Agents be secretly working for the Warehouse's most ruthless adversary?<br/><br/>Warehouse 13: The Board Game can be played by three to five players in about two hours. Each game of Warehouse 13: The Board Game is considered a Season, played over a series of Episodes. Each Episode will involve the investigation and retrieval of one artifact. Warehouse Agents must investigate clues, then use those clues to retrieve the artifact. However, one player is the Traitor, who secretly works for the Adversary. For every artifact that is lost, the Adversary becomes more powerful and thereby more difficult to defeat.<br/><br/>Each Episode begins with the Ping Phase, in which the artifact's location is revealed and clue dice are rolled. Clues are represented by 13 custom six-sided dice.<br/><br/>After the Ping Phase, the Investigation Phase begins. During the Adversary turn, the Adversary will act. Afterwards, each Agent must perform an Action, such as drawing Traits, playing a Trait, performing Warehouse Maintenance, or traveling to the Field. Next, each Agent must attempt to claim a clue die. If an Agent cannot claim a clue die, one must be neutralized, removing it from play for the remainder of that Episode. Finally, each Agent must draw a free Trait.<br/><br/>The Investigation Phase repeats until all of the clue dice are either claimed or neutralized, then the Retrieval Phase begins. Each artifact displays symbols that correspond to the symbols on the clue dice. During each round of the Retrieval Phase, the players secretly roll all of their clue dice and each player chooses one to apply to the artifact. The chosen dice are revealed simultaneously. The Adversary will intervene by rolling Goo dice which can neutralize clue dice. If enough clues are applied to match the artifact's symbols, the artifact is retrieved. If the Agents run out of clue dice before rolling enough symbols, the artifact is lost to the Adversary.<br/><br/>Play then continues to the next Episode. After three artifacts are retrieved, the Warehouse Agents win. However, if three artifacts are lost, the Finale begins, in which the Agents have one last chance to thwart the Adversary's grand scheme.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the Traitor is hidden. The Traitor can impact the game by failing to assist the Warehouse Agents, by failing to claim clues, or by failing to apply clues properly. If the Agents believe they have determined who the Traitor is, they can vote to Bronze that player, which reveals their Loyalty.<br/><br/>",

A player&rsquo;s turn is broken down into three parts: First they can either take two gold or a gossip card, then they can decide to either: hire an available servant, marry an available suitor, attempt to have a child with a married couple. or take an additional gold.<br/><br/>At any point during the round players can team up to spread gossip about other families. This is accomplished by one player playing a gossip card on another player's family or servants. Gossip only becomes confirmed when another player plays the same gossip card or a True card against the targeted player. Unconfirmed, gossip cards only last one round and then are shuffled into the discard pile.<br/><br/>Players can also use their servants' powers against other players, use their fortune to buy status and bribe other players to stop gossip. The game ends when the first player ends a round with 18 status points.<br/><br/>",

The only way to reach this illustrious title is to hire stars and build  attractions...while occasionally sabotaging the other players and adding devious sideshows to your opponents' carnivals!<br/><br/>The game is fast and family-friendly. Each player starts with three cards, and on your turn, you draw one card from the deck, then you may play one card, following these rules:<br/><br/><br/>     Stars &amp; Attractions are played in front of you.<br/>     Event cards trigger effects when played to the discard pile.<br/>     Sideshow cards are played in front of your opponents.<br/><br/><br/>Now, here's where things get tricky. Each player's win condition changes throughout the game. For example, the &quot;Three Ring Circus&quot; card states that you win the game when you have three of them in front of you. Be careful, though, as your opponents can sabotage your best efforts, preventing you from becoming the &quot;Ringmaster&quot;!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The invitation is signed simply by an individual known as &ldquo;The Host.&rdquo; The letter promises you the opportunity to play a game to win a reward greater than you could possibly imagine. You arrive at a decaying mansion on a hill along with five other strangers. A tall, narrow man in a tuxedo opens the huge ominous doors to usher you inside. &ldquo;Thank you for attending this evening...&rdquo; The Host says in a deep, ominous voice. &ldquo;The entertainment will be&hellip; to die for!&rdquo; The Host bursts into a sinister echoing laugh. Behind you, the door slams shut and the sound of a heavy deadbolt clicks into place. You and your fellow guests are trapped at the mercy and whims of The Host.  &ldquo;Shall we play a little game?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Grind House is a narrative horror game for 2-6 players where you would be considered lucky if survival only costs an arm and a leg. While survival is the ultimate goal, each player has a classic archetype with a secret motive. Some characters like the Doctor may try to keep everyone alive, while the psychopath with surely attempt to split everyone apart.  Others, like the Pianist, just want to keep their hands intact.<br/><br/>For those unfortunate souls who do perish in the house, the game is not over.  Players may return as ghosts to haunt the remaining survivors as they try to make it through the Grind House unscathed.  After exploring all 5 randomized rooms in the house, any survivors left total up their score to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

As the vast Allied armada came into view, as Allied munitions began to burst upon the quiet French beach and among the German strong-points, the greatest drama in military history began to unfold.<br/><br/>This game simulates this historical conflict on a five-section map representing the actual area, across which cardboard playing pieces move and engage through an hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in the outcome of each combat and the success of failure of various game operations.<br/><br/>Atlantic Wall is a battalion-level game of the D-Day invasion.

The animals are laid out in rows and columns. On a turn, a player can play one of their two action cards. These cards can exchange positions or flip a card so the animal looks the opposite way. When several of the same animals are looking in the same direction, they will escape from the net, while any animals on top of them will slide down (tetris-style), which may lead to other groups of animals being able to escape. After each turn, another animal is added at the top of each column. When a column is seven cards high, all players lose. When all animal cards have been played, players can compare how many animals were left in the net (cooperative mode) or how many they freed (competitive mode).<br/><br/>The game has a campaign in which difficulty rises in each level. For one, each animal has a special ability. These make the game easier but also more complex. On the other hand, more animals are added, which makes it harder to form groups.

In an all-out attempt to defeat Russia and end World War Two, the Germans managed to see the spires of the Kremlin as their high water mark for both this battle and for the war. Over two million men fought in this desperate battle that would decide the war and the future of mankind.<br/><br/>Masahiro Yamazaki, the designer of the MMP games Red Star Rising and Stalingrad Pocket has designed his greatest game on this great conflict- Last Stand; The Battle for Moscow 1941-1942. Using all the tricks in his designer&rsquo;s bag, Mas has made this titanic struggle playable but without sacrificing a great sense of history. Offering 3 scenarios to show different aspects of the campaign, and a unique way of showing the plight of the Soviet morale as a nation faces possible complete military defeat, all in a manageable size, Last Stand is a game that has no competitor.<br/><br/>As seen in Mas&rsquo; other games, Last Stand features an interesting sequence of play:<br/><br/><br/>    A.) German Player Turn<br/>        ) Supply Phase<br/>            a.) Weather<br/>            b.) Reinforcement/Supply Placement<br/>            c.) Receive Air Points<br/>            d.)

Supply Unit Consumption<br/>        <br/>        ) Combat Phase<br/>            a.) Resolve Combat<br/>            b.) Remove Supply Units in Expend Mode<br/>        <br/>        ) Soviet Reaction Phase (The Soviet Player is allowed to move and overrun with eligible Mechanized units)<br/>        ) Exploitation Movement (all German units may move again with one half of their movement allowance) <br/>    <br/>    B.) Soviet Player Turn<br/>        ) Supply Phase<br/>            a.) Reinforcement HQ and Combat Unit Placement<br/>            b.) Receive Air Points<br/>            c.) Combat Unit Supply Check<br/>            d.) Isolated Attrition Check<br/>            e.) Red Army Morale Check<br/>        <br/>        ) Katyusha Gun Phase<br/>            a.) Katyusha movement<br/>            b.) Katyusha Fire<br/>        <br/>        ) Movement Phase<br/>        ) German Reaction Phase (Like the Soviets in his reaction phase, but with different parameters, the German player may conduct reaction move with his eligible Mechanized units).<br/>        ) Combat Phase<br/>            a.) Ski Unit placement<br/>            b.) Resolve Attacks<br/>        <br/>        ) Exploitation Movement (identical to the German Phase)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>In addition, the game features unknown unit strengths for the Soviet Units, variable and shifting victory conditions, Soviet Army morale breakdown, German variable supply consumption, and of course, substantial weather effects as General Winter arrives as a reinforcement for the Soviet cause.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most unique aspect of Last Stand is the Victory Conditions. As the game begins, neither player knows what they must accomplish to win the game. As the game progresses and the Germans advance towards Moscow, the Germans will find out what it takes to win. Soviet Morale will continue to fall until the Soviets can strike back - and when they do, the damage is healed twofold - but defeat can happen at any moment.<br/><br/>Last Stand features three scenarios of different lengths to give players options depending on how much time they have to play.<br/><br/>Scenario One - the Soviet Counterblow<br/>This scenario covers only the great Soviet Counterattack that pushed the Germans to the brink of defeat in the late Winter 1942. Playing time is about 3-4 hours.<br/><br/>Scenario Two - The Germans Attack<br/>This scenario covers the German attack to defeat the Soviets before winter comes. Playing time is about 5-6 hours.<br/><br/>Scenario Three - the Campaign Game<br/>This scenario covers the entire offensive and the Soviet counterattack. Combining both scenario one and two together, this has a playing time of about 10 hours.<br/><br/>Last Stand components:<br/>One 34 by 22 map <br/>560 &frac12;&quot; counters <br/>32 page full color rulebook <br/>2 player aids<br/><br/>Game Details:<br/>Solitaire Rating: very good to excellent <br/>Complexity: Medium <br/>Playing Time: 3-10 hours <br/>Scenarios: 3 <br/>Game scale: Units are divisions, turns are ten days, and hexes are 17.2 kilometers across.<br/><br/>",

The Dragon Clan attempts to reconcile the two armies, even as it refuses to reveal evidence that might exonerate the Lion, and incriminate the Scorpion. And the Phoenix Clan races to intervene before the situation becomes a War of Honor to turn the Empire against itself.<br/> In this exciting new multiplayer format for the Legend of the Five Rings collectible card game, you will form and dissolve alliances, engage in political maneuverings, and wage mighty battles to determine which Clan will triumph.<br/> &middot; Features a deck for each of the four following Clans: Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, and Scorpion.<br/>&middot; Includes a scoring board, markers, and movable tiles that give a different game play experience every time.<br/>&middot; Also included: tiles for each of the other five Great Clans, making War of Honor fully expandable with your existing Legend of the Five Rings cards.<br/>&middot; The basic game is for 2-4 players, but can be played with more if customized using your own L5R cards.<br/><br/>Releases June 2011.<br/><br/>- Publisher blurb<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Legend of the Five Rings<br/><br/><br/>",

New rules could then be added to the binder and rule updates and expansions replaced existing pages.<br/><br/>Other expansions for the Commander's Edition of Star Fleet Battles included SSD books.  Each of these expansions contained 48 revised and new SSD's which were larger then the basic SSD's and had charts for weapons and movement along with other locations to track Ship Systems.<br/><br/>This edition of the game was designated as Star Fleet Battles Commander's Edition, and was the third edition of the Star Fleet Battles series.<br/>...<br/>Star Fleet Battles Volume I of the Commander's Edition included everything from the old boxed Star Fleet Battles (Designer's Edition), plus all the errata from the 3 expansions for Star Fleet Battles (Designer's Edition), and certain rules from them.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Star Fleet Battles<br/>     Star Fleet Battles Designer's Edition<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented-by:<br/><br/>     Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition<br/><br/><br/>",

Digging cards determine where digging may be carried out - naturally the digging starts at the top and works down. Finds can be exchanged for profit immediately or used as protection against curses.

The game uses a simplified version of the D-Day at Omaha Beach system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Publisher website :)Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942 (OJ) is a purpose-designed solitaire game, by John Butterfield, simulating the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It uses an evolution of his well-liked system from our earlier boxed game release: D-Day on Omaha Beach.<br/>Historically, a mixed force of Canadian troops and tanks and British Commandos landed on several beaches along a 16-mile stretch of coast, with a variety of objectives. While the commando raids on the flanks met with some success, the major action against Dieppe was a costly failure. It didn&rsquo;t come close to achieving its objectives, and over 75 percent of that landing force were killed or captured. You control the CW forces assaulting the beaches and struggling to achieve their objectives against intense German resistance. The game system controls the German forces that oppose you.<br/><br/>The overall 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map, which is cut in half and reassembled into a 17&quot;x42&quot; play area, consists of three sector maps: the main map showing the French port of Dieppe and surrounding areas, and two smaller maps portraying coastal areas east and west of the main map. The main map is divided into four areas: Blue Beach, Dieppe town, Green Beach and Rear. Each hex represents 400 meters (438 yards) across; each game turn equals 20 minutes. Units of maneuver are companies and batteries; there are 176 large-size NATO-style and iconic counters in the mix.<br/> Rules cover such things as: coastal battery fire, random events, unit depth, command-control and communication, air attack, &ldquo;what if&rdquo; variants, amphibious warfare and much more. The game can be completed in about three to four hours. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. CW Amphibious Transport Phase<br/>1. Unit Transport<br/>2. Landing Check<br/>II. Operations Phase<br/>III. Commonwealth Action Phase<br/>1. Beach Landings or Evacuation.<br/>2. CW Actions<br/>3. Recovery<br/>IV. End of Turn Phase<br/><br/>",

He fancied himself an adventurer and often rode saddled atop his turtle through the Great Wood to spy on the big folk, bringing back to the village tales both strange and wonderful.<br/><br/>On one such adventure, Rowan returned to the village with a tale that captivated them all: chiseled castles, towering windmills, plaster dragons, and tidy green lawns under a glittering and majestic sign reading &ldquo;Mini-Golf.&rdquo; The gnomes set to work immediately, intent on recreating this verdant wonderland.<br/><br/>After a week of diligent trimming, digging, and weeding, Helna&rsquo;s golden Acorn Trophy was sitting atop a pedestal beyond the last hole. The course at Stottingham Shire was open and the game was ready to begin!<br/><br/>Overview.<br/>Just like in the big folk game of miniature golf, you and your fellow gnomes are doing your best to recreate the game by earning the lowest score. Over the course of three rounds, you&rsquo;ll be collecting and arranging cards into a 3 by 3 grid.<br/><br/>Drive your score as low as possible by placing Negative value cards in your grid or by creating rows or columns of 3 identical Positive value cards, which will earn you Negative points equal to the matching value of the set (example: a row of three 6&rsquo;s would earn you -6 points).<br/><br/>As soon as one player has no more face-down cards in their grid, each other player takes one final turn and the round is over. After three rounds, total your scores and find out which gnome has won the game. Celebrate their victory by carrying them around your home and cheering their name!<br/><br/>It's a tee-rific time you'll never fore-get!<br/><br/>",

Though outnumbered, the French won a decisive victory at the cost of the bloodiest fighting of the entire Italian campaign (1st edition: VaeVictis #18).<br/><br/>Zurich 1799: at the head of the last French army still in a condition to carry out an offensive campaign, Mass&eacute;na profited from a favorable position to save the Republic. The maneuver of Z&uuml;rich and its results figured among the most glorious pages written by the soldiers of the Revolution (1st edition: VaeVictis #29).<br/><br/>Montebello 1800 is a clash between advance guards. The French columns hurled themselves against Austrian advanced posts and the battle expanded. The two leaders, wanting to seize the opportunity to shine, ended up committing the greater part of their reserves  (1st edition: Canons en Carton).<br/><br/>Marengo 1800: an intense battle that the French were losing for a long while was transformed into a stunning victory when the French were able to reconcentrate and strike hard against the over-confident Austrians. Desaix and Kellermann thus brought a fresh title of glory to the young First Consul Bonaparte (1st edition: VaeVictis #35).<br/><br/>Early Glories places the players at the head of small or medium-sized armies which had to fight over broken terrain or terrain cut by numerous obstacles. The fighting took place over one or several days. With your back to the wall, can you do as well as Bonaparte, Lannes or Mass&eacute;na and find ways to defeat the armies of their adversaries?<br/><br/>Units: 1 strength point equals 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 cannons<br/>Scale: demi-brigade or regiment, battalion<br/>Complexity : 7 / 9<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>&bull; 4 maps, 59 x 41 cm<br/>&bull; 432 die-cut counters and markers<br/>&bull; 1 rulebook<br/>&bull; 1 battle book with 4 battles and 14 scenarios<br/>&bull; 1 player aid card<br/>&bull; 10 storage bags<br/><br/>(from the publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.<br/><br/>This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.<br/><br/>In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.<br/><br/>From the website:<br/><br/>&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

The game covers the Nanboku-cho period of Japanese history and simulates one of the most dynamic and important periods in Japanese history.<br/><br/>From 1336-1392, all of Japan was aflame with war. After the fall of a corrupt and ineffective emperor, the two great courts of Japan dueled to determine the future ruler of the country. Warriors of Japan covers the vital period following the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate and the fight to find a successor.<br/><br/>Players of Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453 will find much familiar here, however, unlike the enormous time period covered in Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453, Warriors of Japan covers only 4 years. Subtle changes in the system to cover this unique period have been exchanged in Warriors of Japan. For example, Leaders no longer die from old age but rather can switch sides unexpectedly during a combat. Subtle changes in the movement and combat rules will add to the strategy to a greater extent than in Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453. A random game start generator will keep each game fresh and interesting. Warriors of Japan also brings us home to our wargaming roots.

How many points on each turn depends on how good you are at spotting sequences and by playing a set which will create multiple combinations on the board. Even when it's not your turn, unwitting opponents may gift you points by creating sets using tiles in your bonus spaces, so always keep your eyes peeled to claim those extra points.<br/><br/>SETUP is a game of strategic tile placement, making sets of numbers of matching suits. You can't always plan in advance though as the tiles stack, so a sequence you had in mind may disappear when your opponents take their turn.<br/><br/>The strategy is even more intense when you try team play mode, work with a partner to plan your sets together. You'll work hard to maximize points, help your partner create sets, and gift each other bonus points. Careful how many points you score because the game ends when the first player crosses the finish line, but being in first place doesn't decide the win; it's the team that avoids finishing last when the game ends!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players are able to create multiple forces called Hordes. The city of Tarsos is made up of many districts, which start play face down and unknown. As hordes enter new sections they are flipped and if defeated they can offer benefits such as additional troops and varying victory point values.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to control the highly valuable parts of the city before the endgame is triggered, which is done when key parts of the city are controlled by the players.<br/><br/>The game features a modular board, allowing for the game to be tactically different with each play.<br/><br/>Further expansions will introduce new rules and options as well as allow additional players to join the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "France 1944: The Allied Crusade in Europe, Designer Signature Edition, marks the return of an original game covering the historical events that led to the liberation of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands during the Allied drive on Germany by renowned game designer, Mark Herman. This new signature edition has been re-mastered and updated and will be linking with an all-new companion game, Russia 1944, slated for release in 2019.<br/><br/>Changes from the 1986 version include an updated combat system that has been simplified and bloodier.  The game updates attrition rules.  The Brittany Campaign is captured in the game along with V1 rockets.  The mounted map has more terrain features, covers more area.  The game includes an additional scenario that takes the war past the Rhine River and goes to the end of the war.  The game also includes 70 additional counters and a second map that zooms in on Normandy and features larger hexes to better manage the initial breakout.<br/><br/>This original game influenced Herman's classic Empire of the Sun in that the player will activate a headquarter piece, which in turn activates armor divisions and infantry corps within command range of the headquarters unit.  Instead of cards, though, this game uses chits drawn from a cup.<br/><br/>The most unique feature, though, is the attempt to model real time through a simple increment chart.  The result is that if a unit moves, it captures an instance of time where all units must do something, even if that means sitting still.  There is no movement phase where you move units of various speeds adjacent to an enemy and then go into a combat phase where they all attack. Coordination is captured more realistically, but in a manageable and simplistic system.<br/><br/>The game emphasizes logistics in how you coordinate combat and movement.  Also, if you move too rapidly, like George Patton in 1944, you outrun your supplies and have to wait while it catches up.<br/><br/>The game plays in one sitting and has a relatively low complexity for a wargame.<br/><br/>Scale: 20 miles (32 km) per hex; eleven (11) one-month turns; units are infantry corps, armor divisions and army-level HQs [taken from back of box].<br/><br/>",

Managing their hand of five cards players need to make tough calls on what to play while carefully managing their resources of health, food and cards left in their draw deck.<br/><br/>The players will free themselves from the Tomb of Maeshowe once they've removed enough rubble blocking their escape. By playing a set of four &quot;Excavation&quot; cards to the row, the players are able to remove rubble. The timing of when to start a set of &quot;Excavation&quot; cards will be critical since a row of less than four will result in those cards being lost decreasing player chance for survival.<br/><br/>If the player ever find themselves having zero health or having run out of cards in their draw deck, they have lost and their dead bodies will be found in the Tomb of Maeshowe by archeologists hundreds of years later.<br/><br/>Other threats presented by their draw deck includes such things as the passage collapsing and running out of food while some well-needed sleep or Odin himself sending a Raven to watch over you can provide you with some much-needed relief.<br/><br/>This updated version of Lee Broderick's Print and Play game Maeshowe offers a streamlined version of the core gameplay while adding a series of mini-expansions and alternate set-ups for more variety, challenge, and replay-ability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fuentes de Onoro 1811 focus on the last events of the fight between Mass&eacute;na and Wellington in Portugal and Spain. It includes three battles: Foz do Arouce, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and El Bodon 1811 which are thus be the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battles of the series.<br/><br/>The game is also the 6th entry in the Vae Victis Wargame Collection. The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.<br/><br/>Foz do Arouce, 15th March 1811<br/>The fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.<br/><br/>Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811<br/>On the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.<br/><br/>El Bodon 25th September 1811<br/>The fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports. The British had to hold on, to allow time for the widely separated parts of 3rd Division to retire.<br/><br/>Fuentes de Onoro 1811 includes:<br/><br/>    A 59 x 40 cm map,<br/>    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,<br/>    A color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.<br/><br/><br/>Units : Regiments and brigades<br/>Map scale : 500 m/hex.<br/>Turn : 120 minutes<br/><br/>Complexity : 6 / 9<br/><br/>Bilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Glory: The Battles of First &amp; Second Manassas and Chickamauga, 1861-63 is the first game in GMT's Series: Glory (Richard Berg). Glory presents three American Civil War battles - First Manassas (1861), Second Manassas (1862) and the Battle of Chickamauga (1863) - as never before seen. The new game system combines sophistication with ease of accessibility: the rules are less than eight pages and there are practically no charts. The system combines mostly familiar mechanics with just enough new ones to add spice and challenge to comfortable familiarity. And while you can start playing in about 15-20 minutes, it will take far longer to master the nuances of play. To add to all of that, there are four different ways to play the game, from Igo-Hugo all the way to command oriented LIMs.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 75 minutes<br/>Hex: 250 yards / 229 meters<br/>Units: Brigades<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (240 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page Glory rules booklet<br/>One 8-page Glory scenario booklet<br/>One single-sided Charts &amp; Tables players aid card<br/>One 10-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-10 hours<br/><br/>",

In a few short years, this group of brokers would be known as the New York Stock Exchange, one of the greatest and most influential pillars in the global economy.<br/><br/>Exchange is a stock trading game of strategy and wit. Players carefully plan their strategy, phase by phase, trying to cash in big in a constantly changing market. However, playing the market is only half the battle- the only thing harder to predict than the stock market might just be the players sitting at the table with you. The one who can best match wits with their opponents will reign victorious in this fast-paced battle of social elite.<br/><br/>The game lasts 5 rounds, and each round is made up of 3 phases; 1.) The Stock Selection Phase, 2.) The Buy/Sell Phase, &amp; 3.) The Market Influence Phase.<br/><br/>During each round players make their selection by putting the desired card face up in the phase sleeve and then placing it face down on the table. When all players have made their decision, all players reveal simultaneously before moving on to the next phase.<br/><br/>This lets players see what other people are doing so they can adjust their strategy during the following phases. However, the phase sleeves only reveal part of the information, so while you may find out what that a player is selling a specific stock you will not know how much.<br/><br/>Finally players get adjust the market, by moving the price of a single stock up or down. A Market Forces card will also be drawn, which produces a random effect on the market.<br/><br/>After the price for each stock has been adjusted, players complete their transaction with the bank at the new price, being mindful of the Market Bubble which can flip the price of a stock if the price gets too high or too low.<br/><br/>At the end of 5 rounds the player with the highest net worth (value in stocks + cash) wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Risorgimento 1859, the Second Italian War of Independence, covers the second such war, the first, in 1848, having resulted in heavy defeats at the hands of the Austrian/Hapsburg armies. But the 1859 war was different. The Piedmontese, the Italian province pressing the issue, had gotten Napoleon III and the French Army to help them. Garibaldi and his partisans were most effective in creating havoc. And the Austrians were woefully weak in high command ability and unit morale.<br/><br/>Risorgimento 1859 is a big game, yet easy to play. The battle games are very enjoyable with lots of maneuver and combat. The Campaign game uses a point-to-point map system. The focus is on coordination and concentration, the ability to guard avenues of approach, and the capability of units to engage in combat.<br/>Battles and Campaigns<br/><br/>Players fight the two major battles of the campaign, Magenta and Solferino (one of the largest battles in European history). The rules are relatively short and very accessible, as the battle system is designed for ease of play. For example, combat units do not have any numerical Strength! However, they do differ in Morale.<br/><br/>Magenta<br/>A wild battle fought in the vineyards, where no one could see anything. Reinforcements coming from all corners of the map, as the French have to cross a major river to take the important rail center.<br/><br/>Solferino<br/>The Austrians and the French literally stumble into each other in teh difficult and hilly country south of the Lombardian lakes. The battle that followed, pitting 4 French corps against 7 Austrian corps, was one of the most brutal in modern history. So brutal that it led directly to the founding of the Red Cross. The French, having started first, get to attack an Austrian-held position that takes advantage of every hill and valley.<br/><br/>The Campaign<br/>Play out the entire Campaign and see if you can avoid the mistakes the Austrians made. This version uses a point-to-point system and some very unusual mechanics to model one of the first military campaigns that used railroads.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     1 hour per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     325 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Battalion &amp; Regimental (battle); Division &amp; Corps (campaign)<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four<br/><br/>DESIGNERS Richard Berg (Battle game) and Peter Perla (Campaign game)<br/>DEVELOPERS David Fox, John Alsen, and Richard Berg<br/>ART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

Be it at the brothel or at the market, men such as the Pope or the Emperor can be seen hard at work at any time of the day. Even the most miserable miser, though, would be well advised to also strive to get hold of enough precious stones and wine to make sufficient donations towards the Lord's cathedrals. After all, it is through pious generosity that a poor soul can gain the all-important letters of indulgence and be pardoned for a life of greed and lust. When all is said done, what matters is to have sinned just enough to have achieved all goals and gotten away with it, while others took the fall.<br/><br/>In more detail, to win, players have to end the game with their &quot;poor souls&quot; closer to heaven's gate than their opponents. Alas, throughout the game these poor souls pretty much exclusively move in the opposite direction, i.e., towards Hell. Only at the very end of the game might players climb back towards heaven, depending on the letters of indulgence that they managed to collect up to that point.<br/><br/>The accumulation of these letters of indulgence is each player's primary goal. To this end, they take on the roles of different people: the Pope, the Emperor, the Merchant, or the Little Sinner. Each round, these roles in turn grant them access to different special actions. On their turn, players buy or sell goods on the market, visit the brothel to benefit from personal connections, or secretly donate money and goods to the church. Meanwhile, the construction of the game's three cathedrals proceeds. As soon as a cathedral is fully erected, the church will hand out the all-important letters of indulgence. However, only those who have donated the most in either of three categories will actually receive anything.<br/><br/>Many perks that can be used during the game require the players to &quot;sin&quot;. Sins are tracked by means of a tally stick and will move the player's poor soul closer to hell. The player who strikes the right balance and picks the right roles at the right time will be able to collect the most valuable letters of indulgence and might stand chance at winning the game. If a player has burdened themselves with too much sin, though, all will ultimately be for naught.<br/><br/>",

The emperor Julius Caesar asks his four best generals to recruit and equip soldiers: legionaries, doctors, gunners and barbaric mercenaries to face the people who heroically resist in Lusitania. The emperor promises the greatest riches to those who join his cause.<br/><br/>There is, in the most remote part of Iberia, a people that is not governed nor does it let itself be governed. Alea jacta est.<br/><br/>AIM<br/><br/>In this game, you take on the role of a Roman general whom the emperor, Julius Caesar, has ordered to recruit and equip an army of soldiers: legionaries, barbaric mercenaries, doctors and gunners.<br/>The game is won by the player who recruits an army whose score is of twenty or more victory points.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/><br/>A game immediately ends when:<br/>1. The first player recruits an army whose score is of twenty or more victory points. <br/>2. The musician card appears on the training field, having been turned from the draw pile or played by a player who trades the musician card (which they are holding) for a card that is on the training field. In this situation the game is won by the player who, at that time, has the highest number of victory points. In the event of a tie, the game is won by the tied player who has recruited less barbaric mercenaries. If the tie remains, the game is won by the player whose turn is last (farthest from the commander card).<br/><br/>",

Place the trade cards &mdash; numbered 4-3-3-2-2 in a four-player game &mdash; on the table in a row, then place a gold coin worth 3 rupees on each trade card.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either takes the leftmost gold coin from a trade card or pays the cost shown on the leftmost trade card bearing a coin to purchase one of the antique cards on display. After doing either of these, the player can claim a collection card as long as they own the antiques depicted on that card; many collection cards force you to discard one of the antiques depicted, which then sets you back toward claiming other collection cards. To end your turn, pay taxes so that you have at most 8 rupees. As soon as all the gold coins are claimed or the antique cards purchased, the round ends, after which you refill the trade cards and lay out four new antique cards.<br/><br/>Once the antique cards run out, the game ends and players discard any antique cards they hold if they have only one card of that color. Then they tally their scores based on their collection and antique cards and the money they still hold. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Jeff Davis: The Confederacy at War&quot; is a Strategic level solitaire board wargame designed by Charles S. Roberts Award-winner R. Ben Madison and published by White Dog Games. You play President Jefferson Davis, managing the Confederate government and the Southern war effort. Your choices help determine the fate of great armies and the titanic struggle between Lee and Grant as well as peripheral or more dispersed campaigns like Morgan&rsquo;s Ohio raid and Indian Territory.<br/><br/>Decide which famous generals are worthy of scarce artillery and ironclads resources, while you unleash bushwhackers behind Union lines and rush reinforcements into battle on your rickety rail network. Back in Richmond, you&rsquo;ll push the Confederate Congress to enact your reforms and overcome the inefficiency of States&rsquo; Rights as you defend key cities vital to your political survival. Dispatch your cabinet members as economic troubleshooters to prop up agriculture, industry and infrastructure for the war effort.<br/><br/>Slavery is a major factor in your economy, but you will pay for most of your actions through the cat-and-mouse game of blockade running. Choose which armies to supply, or to invade the North as you calculate where the next Union hammer might fall.<br/><br/>Can you hold out long enough, or trigger British and French intervention? Re-fight the Civil War as Jeff Davis!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only Britain still stands, isolated and defiant, readying itself for a mortal struggle between the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force. For the first time in history, air power will decide the fate of a nation.<br/><br/>August 1940: The Royal Air Force has been awaiting massive German air raids since Churchill refused to make peace with Germany. And they did not have to wait long - in fact, far too short to build up the RAF to a strength that would be able to match the German Luftwaffe. But besides its fighters, the RAF has other weapons to help deal with the &quot;Huns&quot;: a chain of RDF (radar) towers along the British coast, and an elaborate system of communications, signal evaluation and fighter control and guidance. If those are used skilfully, the resulting economy of Fighter Command operations might just be able to offset the sheer power of the German Luftflotten (&quot;air fleets&quot;).<br/><br/>You are in command of all four RAF Fighter Groups to match them against the incoming raids. Can you deny the Luftwaffe its objective to weaken the British air defence system beyond the breaking point?<br/><br/>",

To play, roll three dice and add two of them to an ever-climbing stack of dice. You can choose to stop rolling and score your stacked dice at any time, but pushing your luck will net you more points if you succeed. Continue as long as you dare &ndash; but like the stonecutter of legend, who was never satisfied, you may find yourself with naught, right back where you began. The wise will distinguish ambition from reaching beyond one's means.<br/> SUTAKKU is beautifully crafted with classic Japanese design aesthetics and features hand-inked brush art characters on premium engraved dice. These twelve dice are &frac34;&quot; on a side, perfect for stacking. The game also includes a cloth dice bag, stacking board, and scorepad.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Briscola Chiamata (English: declaration Briscola) is the five-player version of Briscola. Every player is dealt eight cards, so that no cards remain undealt. Then, each player, starting from the dealer's right and proceeding counter-clockwise, bids in an auction to declare how many points they will score. A player may pass, and hence cannot bid again in that game. The bid represents the number of points that player believes he is capable of accumulating. Bidding continues until all but one player have passed in a round. This remaining player has then &quot;won the bid&quot; and therefore gets to declare the Briscola, i.e. the trump suit. The declarer also declares a specific Briscola card (example, the &quot;Ace of Cups&quot; if Cups was the declared Briscola) and the holder of this card is then determined to be the declarer's partner. Logically, the declarer would  declare the highest Briscola card he does not already hold in the hopes of creating the strongest combined hand between him and his partner.<br/><br/>The remaining three players are partnered with each other, without their knowledge. Each player, other than the declarer's partner, acts independently, until it is clear which players are partners. Infrequently, the declarer may declare a Briscola card he already holds (if he feels he has a very strong hand), in which case the other four players are partenered against him.<br/><br/>Because of the unique method of declaration and blind partnering in this variation of the game, it is considered to be one of the most entertaining variations of the game. Game strategy is often devised to determine which player is partnered with the declarer, whereas the declarer's partner may devise ruses and decoy strategies to fool the other players, such as not taking a trick, or playing points on a trick that will be won by an opponent.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe &quot;advanced&quot; versionThe more advanced and most commonly played version of Briscola Chiamata requires the players to first bid the rank of the Briscola they wish to call. As the bidding progresses, the rank is reduced, all other players pass. If a two (the lowes card) is bid, players start bidding the point total they must earn to win the match, starting from 62 (since 61 is the minimum possible to win during normal bidding). Then, the last bidder may declare the suit of the Briscola. In this version, the objective is for the declarer and his partner to earn at least 61 points, or the amount of points bid by the declarer, if the auction got to that phase.<br/><br/>",
