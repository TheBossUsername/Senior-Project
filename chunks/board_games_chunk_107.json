        "description": "Karl-Heinz Schmiel's entry into the flicking games category.  This is a children's game.  Ages 8 and up  Players are racing to achieve the goal at the end of the shuffleboard-like game board.  Instead of throwing the usual 2-sided dice markers (1/6; 2/5; or 3/4) a player can toss the special 2-sided marker (spiral/lightning bolt).  If a lightning bolt is tossed, the player may use a striker to flick a player's piece from their position on the score track.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tryopoly is a property-purchasing game -- similar to Monopoly -- but played on a triangular board, with hexagonal tiles that are placed on the board as the game progresses. Players roll a die and move 1 to 3 spaces towards the red corner or the blue corner of the board, depending on which color was rolled. Property tiles may be bought and placed onto empty spaces that have been landed on or passed over. Existing properties may be moved in the same way, usually to form a TRYOPOLY: where all the property tiles within a group occupy the same row, and command a much higher rent.<br/><br/>The properties in this game were meant to be local and recognizable to the players, so there is no &quot;official&quot; version of this game. Each version features a different city (such as Cleveland, Kansas City, and Washington D.C.) and the businesses and organizations found there.<br/><br/>",

The game ends when all 80 tiles are placed on the board, but only the top tiles are valued; adjacent tiles of the same color give bonus points.<br/><br/>To reduce the influence of luck, the hand of 10 tiles is not filled randomly, but can be taken from 10 open tiles. Anyway, it's a game where you need a good memory, because you should remember which tiles have been played already and thus can't help you getting some bonus points.<br/><br/>This game is very easy to learn and play, but it's not so easy to find the best strategy.<br/><br/>",

Players are also given a tree, the hexagonal base of which matches the color of the head of their particular snake. The trees serve as markers, defining start &amp; finish points and course layout.<br/><br/>The plastic hexagons which form the 'body' of each snake come in six colors; these correspond to the colored dots on the sides of the die used for gameplay. Snakes move forward depending on the color thrown on the die; the color thrown becomes the TAIL of the snake and all hexagons situated behind this are moved to the front of the snake. The hexagonal segments must remain in the same sequence throughout the game.<br/><br/>The first player to complete whatever course was determined prior to the game starting is the winner (generally snakes start adjacent to their tree and return).<br/><br/>",

A variant of the Axis &amp; Allies board game system, it offers an easy to play D10 based combat system and territories with resource values for production. <br/>The War to End All Wars presents the First World War in a couple different ways. The first of these is a historical simulation that offers alliances, political structures, and entry times for the various nations designed to mirror the actual historical chain events that transpired in real life. The second scenario is the semi historical scenario and makes allowances for player choices and deviant actions by many nations. This scenario can see Japan get more active in the war, the US and/or Italy possibly enter on the Central Powers side, the Ottomans stay neutral or even join the Allies, and much more.<br/><br/>While not a complex game that breaks down the individual national armies into named brigades or divisions, the level of historical detailing in The War to End All Wars is enough that multiple professors now utilize this game to help teach the WW1 era to middle, high school, and even college students.<br/><br/>The War to End All Wars comes with:<br/><br/>1) 2 piece 17&quot; x 44&quot; color game map on thick glossy paper. Map provides an enlarged game area for Europe, then smaller map zones for Asia, Africa, and North America to allow for representation of the entire global war. <br/>2) 40 page Rule &amp; Scenario booklet <br/>3) Score pad with 30 nation sheets <br/>4) 1D10 <br/>5) Approx. 190 Plastic Unit Stands <br/>6) 1,100+ Card Stock Land &amp; Sea units for: <br/> -- British Empire <br/> -- French Empire <br/> -- Russian Empire <br/> -- German Empire <br/> -- Austro-Hungarian Empire <br/> -- Ottoman Empire <br/> -- Italy <br/> -- Japanese Empire <br/> -- United States of America <br/> -- China &amp; Neutral nations <br/> -- Ports, Ind.

That single large die is labeled on 4 sides and also has 2 clear sides that you can see into.  The marked sides show a STRIKE, a BALL, a FOUL Ball and these are in fact the results of the die roll if those sides how up on the roll.<br/><br/>BUT  If the clear side of this large DIE is rolled you can see inside of the die and what you see are a pair of dice, one colored red, and one colored green. If you can see dice instead of a pitch then what has been rolled on those dice determine the results of the play.<br/><br/>Also one of the Clear sides also has red dot on it. The results of the dice looking through this side of the clear facing are different than results determined if looking through the clear side without the red dot.<br/><br/>The results code shows what happens depending on the dice roll and if men are on differing bases.<br/><br/>Information about this game was gathered and approval given from BUTCH7999 and his BASEBALL GAME SITE.<br/><br/>",

There is a round of trading, in which you may force a trade with a neighbor.  Some cards trigger special effects during trading.  After the trading, the worst card loses the round.  The heart of the game is in judging whether or not to do a forced trade in the interest of being not-worst.<br/><br/>",

If a player is dealt a sequence of Number cards that add up to 8, 9, 10, or 11, they can turn over one or more Adventure cards and place a counter of their color on them, or displace an opponent's counter from an already-revealed Adventure card. If a player busts (is dealt a sequence totaling more than 11), he or she has to remove one of their already-placed counters. The first player to get counters on all five of the Adventure cards in any row or column is the winner.<br/><br/>The approximate playing time printed on the box is 5 to 15 minutes. The box recommends the game for children Ages 6 - 12.<br/><br/>Although the box says, &quot;Based on the Movie,&quot; the game uses comic-book art rather than art or stills from the film, and in fact doesn't seem to have anything to do with the movie at all. No Richard Pryor, no fractions of cents, nothing.<br/><br/>",

If you don't, you're penalized by drawing 2 cards.  Things get a bit more complicated as you are not supposed to make the animal sound when you play a red card.  There are other special cards that reverse direction and other effects kind of like Uno.  Easy to learn and play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RAGS TO RICHES is a dice-based stock trading game where each player races to accumulate enough wealth to build his/her own luxury mansion and &quot;retire&quot; to a quiet life.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are quite simple.  Players move around the board, buying and selling stock shares in hopes of creating a profit for themselves so that they can make even bigger investments later on.  Stock prices are always determined by a dice-roll, so prices move up and down quickly and randomly.  Certain &quot;safe&quot; stocks don't move around in price that much and offer higher dividends, while riskier stocks are much more volatile, but tend to offer higher returns.  The challenge is for each individual player to determine how much money he/she can afford to risk in any particular situation since an unlucky dice roll can wipe that player out.<br/><br/>There is also a simple, yet elegant means of borrowing money in this game.  Players are allowed to borrow money from the bank as long as they pay back double the borrowed amount by the time that his/her token completes two full turns around the board.  This helps to make the game more strategic since players will often find themselves in need of extra cash which they can only borrow with a pretty high interest penalty.<br/><br/>Overall, RAGS TO RICHES is a nice blend of strategy and luck (probably 70% strategy, 30% luck).  The games typically last around 120 minutes (depending on who is playing) and usually keeps everyone in the game until the very end.<br/><br/>",

(Source: The Game Makers: the Story of Parker Brothers by Philip Orbanes)<br/><br/>The board is a stylized map illustrating activities which an American Tourist might engage in as they travel around Europe. The players start in the houses at the top left of the board, each with two tokens, and using a &quot;spinner&quot; or one or two dice, travel through the &quot;shopping district&quot;, making purchases for their trip. Exiting the &quot;shopping district&quot;, they take a cab to the Depot, and begin their trip on the railroad to the city. Some spaces have red dots, and include instructions that the players must follow, such as taking alternative routes (which can be shorter or longer than the main path), or moving to other red dots on the board, either forward or backward. Midway on the track (at the center of the board) is the &quot;Centerville Depot&quot; which a player must enter, and spend more for a meal. The end of the game has several water routes branching off from the railroad, which must be taken if they are landed on. If a player lands on another player on the railroad or a water route, the player landed on is sent back to the Depot.<br/><br/>Players have two tokens, and a choice about which to move, which affects how much debt they incur, and whether they get stuck into bad situations.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the first one to reach the end with both tokens, unless the second player reaches the end with both tokens, having spent less than half as much as the first player.<br/><br/>",

The player's tokens are casks, the city marker is a tiny cognac bottle in a clear plastic case.

        "description": "The game is based on a successful movie of the same name. Each player gets a number of chips with which to bid on cards of various colors. Bids are hidden and simultaneous, high bid gives his chips to the lowest bidder (in case of a tie, the next highest non-tied player wins). Each card, once obtained, has an assignment / action on it that must be carried out. There are also Taxi cards that make players do certain things and bad cards (Jens-Maul Cards) that are awarded randomly but in typical party game fashion: when a bad card turns up, each player has to run to the anti-gravity machine (set up somewhere else in the house, for example) and press the button. Whoever is randomly selected by the player has being the heaviest (i.e. too fat to float) gets the bad card. Each bad card increases the number of cards in a single color needed to win by one: normally you need three of a kind, so having one bad card ups it to four.<br/><br/>",

Downloadable from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://cheapass.com/free/games/rotgb.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://cheapass.com/free/games/rotgb.html</a><br/><br/>From the website:<br/>Well, here's a very cheapass way to simulate large battles without having to deal with maps and counters and fifteen hours per turn. Obviously, it can't cover a lot of things, but if you want more detail, get a regular wargame of some sort.<br/><br/>Basically handfuls of dice of different numbers of sides represent different size units on a battlefield.  Different 'fronts' can be declared.  ROtGB uses the Button Men mechanics renamed as 'Direct Assault', where the value on a single attacker die is equal to or greater than the value on a defender die and 'Flanking Maneuver', where multiple attacker dice add up to exactly one defender die (one of the flanking dice must be at least half the value of the defender die to keep a horde of d1's form overcoming it.)<br/><br/>Both players roll at the same time (identifiable dice or seperate rolling areas help.) Players take turns attacking.  After successfully attacking (wherein the defender die is removed from play and the attacker scores the number of sides,) the attacking dice are re-rolled.<br/><br/>A fun way to use a big dice collection.  Advanced rules liek Terrain and Reinforcements round out the game.  Scenarios for medieval and space combat are there as well.<br/><br/>Simple, fast and fun!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Generic land battle strategy board game.  Box measures 20&quot; x 11 1/4&quot;.  Single-fold mounted color game board with 21 x 19 one-inch-square grid superimposed to regulate movement.  Terrain represented includes Mountain, Forest, Plains, Fords, and Rivers.  Multi-square Airfields also represented.<br/><br/>Miniature plastic pieces include Tanks, APCs and Airplanes (six Tanks, six APCs and three Airplanes per side; complete set of each in Yellow, Brown, Green, and Blue).  The APCs are eight-wheeled turreted vehicles strongly resembling a USMC LAV.  Tanks resemble a cross between the US Army M-109 SP gun and an Israeli Merkava tank.  Airplanes slightly resemble early speculative depictions of a Stealth fighter with twin tails and an unflattering forward-swept projection on the leading wing edge.<br/>  <br/>All of these units are moved according to the roll of two six-sided dice.  Die results are added together; the sum (&quot;dice units&quot;) is allocated among friendly pieces for movement.<br/><br/>Terrain costs vary for Tank and APC units.  Pieces may be moved in any direction including diagonally, but may not stack together or pass through an occupied space.<br/><br/>All unit types have a &quot;range&quot; of two spaces.  Tanks may not attack Airplanes (unless all friendly Airplanes are destroyed).  Airplanes must be &quot;airborne&quot; in order to attack (they must &quot;take off&quot; down the &quot;runway&quot; of their &quot;airstrip&quot;).<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by die roll, &quot;attacker&quot; and targeted &quot;defender&quot; each rolling one die.  The result of subtracting low roll from high roll is referenced to a &quot;Battle Chart&quot; yielding a result of &quot;Safe,&quot; &quot;Disabled&quot; or &quot;Destroyed.&quot;  APCs are destroyed on a difference of &quot;1&quot; or more.  Tanks are &quot;disabled&quot; by a difference of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; and &quot;destroyed&quot; by a differential of &quot;3&quot; or more.  Airplanes are &quot;destroyed&quot; by a differential of &quot;3&quot; or more vs. another Airplane or an APC or a &quot;4&quot; or &quot;5&quot; if beaten by a tank. Airplanes are &quot;disabled&quot; by a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; differential vs. another Airplane or an APC.<br/><br/>Destroyed units are removed.  Disabled tanks are turned on their side.  &quot;Disabled&quot; tanks may be &quot;captured.&quot;  A friendly or enemy APC may &quot;capture&quot; a &quot;disabled&quot; tank by moving adjacent and surviving until the next friendly turn.  At the start of the next friendly turn, the tank is turned rightside-up and is considered friendly to the capturing player.<br/><br/>Disabled Airplanes &quot;crash land.&quot;  The &quot;disabled&quot; Airplane travels three spaces in a straight line (in any direction the owning player chooses) and is turned upside-down.  During this &quot;descent&quot; the Airplane may &quot;pass over&quot; other units, but the space it &quot;crashes&quot; in must be vacant.  An APC (friendly or hostile) may &quot;recover&quot; the downed Airplane in the same manner as a Tank is recovered; however, when the Airplane is turned rightside-up, it is immediately returned to a friendly Airbase parking space.<br/><br/>&quot;Disabled&quot; pieces may be attacked and destroyed instead of being captured if a player so chooses.<br/><br/>A unit may only inflict damage on the first unit to attack it in a given turn.  If a piece survives an initial attack and is attacked again, it rolls in defense as usual, but will not inflict any damage on its attacker even if its die roll is higher.<br/><br/>Airbases may be captured by disabling or destroying all hostile pieces on the Airbase and then occupying at least one square of the Airbase with a friendly Tank or APC.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the last player with a surviving APC unit.<br/><br/>Rules include options for a short game with less equipment.  A small paper insert, dated 1991, provided a simpler version using the same movement rules but capturing by simply moving a piece onto an opposing piece space, moving and capturing until all &quot;dice units&quot; have been used.<br/><br/>The box art painting accurately portrays the pieces inside.  One of the modernistic tanks advances firing, evading a near miss while the moon lights APCs crossing a stream to the rear in Ardennes-type terrain as jets swoop above.  The title &quot;Battle Command&quot; appears in large red letters all the way across the top of this illustration.  In smaller white letters across the bottom: &quot;A Fast-Playing Game of Strategy, Daring, and Chance!&quot;<br/><br/>In the lower right corner is the logo of &quot;Precision Toy,&quot; white letters superimposed over a line of evergreens with the title and evergreens &quot;reflected&quot; oppositely beneath.  The back cover features a large black-and-white photo of the board and components.  &quot;Precision Toy&quot; was located in Julian, CA 92036.  The game was made in USA.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MATCH OF THE WEEK is a boardgame based on the game of Soccer and uses a simplified version of the actual rules used for Association Football.<br/><br/>Any number of players may participate but the playing pieces represent two teams of 11 (10 field players and a goalkeeper), as in Soccer.  Teams take it in turns to move their players and the ball.<br/><br/>The movement of players and the ball is determined by the roll of two D6 in the colours of the two teams (blue and red).  Either one playing piece, or a combination of pieces are moved forwards, backwards, sideways and diagonally the number of spaces corresponding to the score on the dice of the colour of that player's team.<br/><br/>After the players have been moved the ball is then moved (assuming that a players piece is next to it) the number of spaces shown on the combination of both dice.  The flight of the ball is affected by the direction in which it is &quot;kicked&quot; and the presence of friendly or opposing players in its flight path.<br/><br/>Particular rules apply to the kick off, kicking the ball in the air, dribbling, free kicks, penalties, throw-ins, goal kicks and corners.  Even the infamous offside rule is included.<br/><br/>To score a goal, the player must kick the ball across the goal line between the two posts.<br/><br/>The winning player (team) is the one that scores the greatest number of goals with in a pre-agreed time limit, or is the first to reach a pre-agreed number of goals.<br/><br/>",

On his turn, a player rolls the die and places the corresponding prop either on Harry&rsquo;s crossbar or on Harry&rsquo;s coat hanger (which is &ldquo;balancing on his forehead). Once the prop is placed, the player must roll Harry down his tightrope by using a lever located at one end of the board that tips the tightrope forward and backward. Press too quickly and Harry smashes into the building, probably losing his props. Press too slowly and you&rsquo;ll fail to ring the bell that signifies a successful roll (and suffer the derision of the other players!). Any props that Harry drops become the active player&rsquo;s and will have to be loaded on Harry again.<br/><br/>Once you have loaded all your props, you have to take Harry for one last run, this time with his pet monkey riding on his hat!<br/><br/>",

The circles are connected by lines which the footballists and the ball may travel along.<br/>Each turn, both player rolls a die, and divides the result between his footballists. For each point a footballist may be moved to an adjacent circle. After that, the ball must be moved the same total amount of spaces. Unlike footballists, it can only change direction if it hits a freindly footballist. The ball's required movement may force the player to give the ball to the opposing team. <br/>In addition to that, the ball goes to the opposing team anytime a 1 or 6 is rolled.<br/><br/>Has some similarities to Street Soccer, but predates that title by many years.<br/><br/>",

If producers don't have the right compliment of actors in their &quot;stable&quot;, they may have to barter with other producers to borrow an actor with the right talents.<br/><br/>Another part of the game board are a few 'Make Or Break' spaces, which add in a number of random events, such as losing or gaining an actor, or added box office revenues.<br/><br/>Winner is the producer who first reaches a certain dollar number, which the players pre-determine.<br/><br/>Rules specify four players, don't know why it couldn't be played with fewer.<br/><br/>",

The center area is called &quot;The Arena&quot; and it is 4x4 grid with alternating black &amp; white squares like a chessboard.  On each side there is a 3 x 4 &quot;Safety Zone&quot; which serves as the starting area for each player.  The safety zones are also arranged with alternating squares, although the squares are gray and the color of your pieces.<br/>Pieces move diagonally away from their &quot;safety zone&quot;.  No piece may enter any safety zone once it has entered The Arena. The goal is to move your pieces into the arena and create kings.  <br/>Initially, all pieces are &quot;pawns&quot; and can move only diagonally forward (away from their safety area).  Once they enter the arena, they can move diagonally in any direction but may not leave the arena.<br/>A player may create a &quot;prince&quot; by landing on an opponent's pawn with one of his pawns.  The stack of two pieces can then move either 1 or 2 spaces, still diagonally, but may move forwards or backwards.  It may not enter any safety zone (it must remain in the arena).<br/>A player creates a king when his prince takes a pawn or his pawn takes a prince (princes may not take each other).  A king is a stack of three pieces.  Once formed kings are removed to the scoring area.<br/>The game ends when there is no possibility of additional kings being made.  The winner is the player who has the most kings.<br/>Note that while the game says it will play 2-4 there are no rules offered for any number other than 4.<br/><br/>",

Players gain support from one of the two warring families, either the Pandava or Kaurava. To win, players must obtain 1 Celestial Weapon card, 1 Flag or Conch card, 8 Virtue Cards and 18 Coins.<br/><br/>Players roll 2d6 to move around the board, each square of which is an event. Warrior squares grant the support of individual warriors (such as Arjuna or Karna), or require a Joust (if the warrior square denotes someone who is in the same family as those that support the player) or a Fight (if from the other family). Karma squares confer a card with random events, such as &ldquo;you grab 2 Coins from each player!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Give up 2 coins to receive 2 Virtue Cards.&rdquo; Prowess squares give cards that confer either Virtue cards (needed to win) or Wrath cards (which cause a Virtue discard) to the various warriors. Many squares are a people (Krishna, Queen Kunti, etc.) or places (Indraprastha, Abode of Yama, etc.) that confer a random event, often a Blessing or Coins. Subtracks allow special 1d6 movement through Exile or Trial where players can obtain the key winning elements of Celestial Weapons and Flags/Conches.<br/><br/>The cards and board both relate some of the many events from the epic. The designer is a noted educator, and this was clearly intended to be an educational game.<br/><br/>",

Or maybe you can finish the word Simba. Use your letter tiles to build crosswords on the picture-filled game board. Each time you finish a word, you get a scoring chip. When all of the tiles are played, the one with the most chips wins! Have twice the fun with the two-sided board. Flip over the board and build words like Mirror and Fawn.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Instead of finding a matched pair on your turn you must find a matched trio of pictures.  This makes the game somewhat more difficult than the traditional matched pair style of gameplay.  Don't fret though, rules are included to play the routine memory style game of matching pairs.  The game was published by BETEXA which is in the Czech Republic.

The competition is at its best every four years, like the Olympics, when the elections come.  The contenders must make an effort; it's the final sprint and the goal is near.<br/><br/>Now, for the first time, you can participate in this struggle for power with The Political Game (El Juego de la Pol&iacute;tica).<br/><br/>In this game, you'll lead a political party and must win the elections.  To do so, you have to make a political program, taking left, right and center positions on issues such as NATO, taxes or autonomy. You'll have to get money, needed for the electoral campaign, to pay publicity, meetings, or launch attacks against other political parties to snatch votes away from them.<br/><br/>In The Political Game, an ideal game for groups, like in politics, agreements with other political forces are indispensable.<br/><br/>You'll have to negotiate with the other players, make agreements with them, and betray them if you're interested in doing so.  You may loan them money to attack your most fierce rivals, and exchange favors or information.  Everything is valid in your effort to win the elections!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this abstract strategy game each player has 4 pawns, each one in a different corner of a game board depicting a jungle and divided in squares. On the game board are various S- and L-shaped tiles with an illustration of a crocodile on them, that act as barriers. Every turn a player gets to move between 0 and 3 crocodile tiles, decided by a special oblong die. A player can move the crocodile tiles out of the way to clear a path, or move them to block an opponent. The player may then move the 'father' pawn 4 spaces, the 'mother' pawn 3 spaces and the two 'children' pawns 2 spaces each. The first player to get all four of his pawns touching wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players determine the amount of coins in 8 stacks as well as the maximum movement (slide) along the grid by secretly writing down numbers and adding them together. The player to move the final piece into the 9th box (Home) is the winner.<br/><br/>From Gladstone&rsquo;s Games to Go:<br/><br/>Part of the appeal of Sliders is the strange sense of ritual at the beginning of the game.  Secret numbers are scrawled, then revealed, and finally, a miniature landscape of towers is constructed.  If you play in public, casual observers will first be mystified, then drawn to you.  Be prepared to let others in on the fun!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the Introduction to the Witchlord rulebook)<br/><br/>Witchlord is the natural adaptation of fantasy role gaming converted into a board game. There is a distinct advantage to fantasy role gaming from a board; and that is it gets rid of the need for a Game Master or scenario creator. The board, cards and matrix tables contain all the information necessary and the dice determine the outcome of your adventure. No human arbitrator is necessary.<br/><br/>All the passages, rooms, treasure and monsters are randomly generated. This makes no two adventures ever the same. Each time you enter the Witchlord's Castle you can expect a completely different scenario stocked with new treasure and monsters. As the player moves around the board, he will receive information about the configurations of the Witchlord's Castle. This will enable the player to plot his progress on the graph paper given.<br/><br/>The player will choose one of the six Adventure Classes to play. this determines the player's spell and weapon capability.<br/><br/>The player's objective in the game is to collect proficiency points. This is done by the slaying of monsters and the collection of treasure. Encounters and treasure are dictated by the playing cards and matrix tables.

From the middle of the board a pawn is moved according to the number of squares mentioned on the start counter.  An even number makes the pawn land on on counter, an uneven number lets the pawn get next to a counter. The start counter can be removed from the board and is the first gain of the first player. When the pawn lands on a counter, it is turned upside down, then the pawn is placed upon it, so the number becomes invisible. The player must name the right number in his next turn. When he is right the player may take the counter as a win, when wrong he loses a turn. When there are no more counters that can be gained in one turn, the game ends and the player having acquired the highest total when adding the number of the counters won, is the winner of Zipher.<br/>NB the game is a 3 player game.<br/><br/>",

Players operate one of four plastic sliders that they may use to block the opening on their quarter of the circumference by sliding it back and forth, much like a hockey goalie.  As the turntable spins, the disk will bounce about the edges. Each player must prevent the disk from escaping through their opening by operating their slider.  Points are acquired for failing to block the disk from escaping, leading to player elimination.  Two plastic barriers are included to block player spaces that are either not being used or have been eliminated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bilderschlange (Picture Snake) matching game by Selecta is similar to a cross between a jigsaw game and dominoes.<br/>The objective of the game is for children to find a picture that matches with a picture on a tile already played.  As play continues, the row of pictures grows slowly. Encourage storytelling during play.  The clown needs his umbrella, the tower needs a roof and the moon needs the sun.<br/> Picture Snake matching game requires children to think logically developing cognitive and reasoning skills. Picture Snake is manufactured in Europe by Selecta Spielzeug and consists of 20 large wood tiles (2&quot;x4&quot;) with beautiful painted pictures. In step with Selecta's history of quality, this game is of excellent quality featuring hard beech wood and child safe finished surfaces that will withstand years of children enjoyment!<br/><br/>",

He was helped by his dogs. As evening approached and it was time to bring the sheep and lambs into a pen for the night, Paul busied himself with putting the logs together for the pen while the dogs rounded up the sheep and lambs. It was a game they all enjoyed. The dogs hurried about trying to get the sheep and lambs into the pen before Paul could lay all the logs together to close the two entrances. See if you can help so the dogs can win again.&quot;<br/><br/>The players try to drive home the sheep by using their dogs. They have to achieve this before the shepherd completes a pen in the middle of the game area (which is variably set up from tiles, some of which are the sheep). The building speed is determined by the same die that also moves the dogs which can proceed to the next tile of the color that was rolled. As so often with Herder games, players can pass their die results to other players. All players win or lose together (if the pen is completed before the sheep are in).<br/><br/>Game play is varied by the fact that the meadow is completed by the forming of paths using 28 interlocking tiles that feature the sheep, poppies, etc. The number of tiles can be reduced to make the game easier for younger children.<br/><br/>",

The gameboard depicts the North Sea, with six harbours and six offshore platforms. At the start of the game, eighteen ships are placed at sea.<br/><br/>A Weather Card is drawn, which shows the weather in different areas, and two ships which are in jeopardy. The players attempt to reach these ships and tug them to a harbour. If a player succeeds in doing so, he collects a number of coins as reward. At the end of the game, the player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Movement is determined by rolling two dice. In fair weather, the a tug-boat moves a number of squares equal to the sum of the two dice, in unstable weather only the number shown on the highest of the two dice and in a storm only the number shown on the lowest of the two dice<br/><br/>Rolling doubles results in a special event. On a double 5 or 6, the weather shifts and new ships are placed in jeopardy. On any other double, the player draws a Log Card, which will often have some one-time effect or give him a special assignment with which he can gain coins.<br/><br/>",

It is also handy when a multi-computer LAN isn't immediately to hand.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The players are in two teams, Counter Terrorist and Terrorists. The game is just about an assault - which has a time limit - in which either the objective is secured or the operation is bungled.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each player team has a separate map of the operational area, and a set of figures representing their them, and the rest of their team, and the enemy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ideally, a separate map for each player should be used, but if space and time are limited, a map per team is ok. It is important that the layout of each map is screened from the opposition.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Game Control updates these maps each turn, showing what they can seen from the team's perspective. Strict observance of lines of sight must be followed and enemy figures not in sight are removed from the map.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Want to bet?<br/><br/>The game consists of a board showing a track of 60 spaces between &quot;start&quot; and &quot;finish&quot; and 3 places for certain piles of cards. Additionally the box contains 126 cards (66 &quot;Pfiffikus&quot;, 30 &quot;R&uuml;ffel&quot; and 30 &quot;Belohnung&quot;), 64 reward marker, 1 bag made of cotton, 8 wooden figurines (4 girls and 4 boys, each in blue, red, yellow and green), 2 wooden dice (one to use and one for replacement) and a rulesheet.<br/>Looking at the components it seems to be a fair simple game of &quot;Roll and Move&quot; (sorry, I don't have the rules). I guess that the shuffled cards have to be placed on the corresponding place on the gameboard from where a card is drawn and read to the player who ended up on a certain space. Each space of the running track shows one of 3 symbols: a question mark, an exclamation mark or an explosion bubble.<br/>The question mark belongs to the Pfiffikus-cards. In this pile you find action cards giving you a special task to perform (like balancing a figurine on your left foot while walking once around the room) or question cards. The player receives reward chips for giving the right answer or fulfilling the action task.<br/>R&uuml;ffel-cards are showing the exclamation mark. On them you find a description of what you might have done wrong (like wasting energy etc.) and the punishment you receive (lose markers, go back etc.).<br/>Cards for Belohnung (meaning reward) are showing the bubble. They are listing exemplary behaviour and a reward for it.<br/>Seems to me that you are winning when you reach the finish line and have more reward markers than the others.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the game) THE OIL IS RUNNING OUT! The days of easy drilling are long gone and oil companies are searching in ever deeper, riskier and more fragile places just to secure our daily fixx of capitalist cog-grease. The battle is on to protect these areas from the next 'Deepwater Horizon' and with a couple of dice, a few coins and a friend, you can re-enact this struggle. It's Greenpeace vs. the Oil Company, trying to establish marine reserves in the very territory the other player wants to exploit. Through a mix of strategic lobbying, exploration, occupation and reserve creation, one of you will triumph. But beware: too many blowouts and you'll have a deepwater slaughter on your hands. And if all the animals die, you both lose!<br/><br/><br/>You only need some coins and 2 dice to play. Everything else is included in the files. Game play takes place on a grided map of the ocean, containing squares of varying depths of water. One player takes on the role of environmental activists, Greenpeace, while the other, the role of a Big Nasty Oil company. Greenpeace is trying to establish marine reserves in the very places that Big Oil is trying to drill. You see, oil (in the form of coins) is available everywhere, but severely limited in shallow and medium depths. So once the easy oil runs out, the oil company is pushed into deep water. Drilling involves rolling two dice, one after the other. If the second number is larger than the first, this drill results in profit (coins equal to the difference in the two numbers) but if you roll a double, it's a blow out. Blow outs are more damaging in deeper water and any blow out might affect surrounding wildlife (animal counters are distributed randomly for each game). If any one species gets totally wiped out, both players lose.<br/><br/>Each player has 3 strategies to choose from each turn and there is enough variation to ensure that no single outcome is guaranteed (although a lot of animals consistently die).<br/><br/>",

The loser is either the player who adds the piece which causes the tower to fall in the construction phase, or the player who removes the piece causing the collapse in the removal phase.<br/><br/>The tower itself is made up of eight levels, each level having six pieces which can be removed, a central support piece and a flat 'floor' piece.  The full tower stands about 33cm tall (13in).<br/><br/>There is also a sloping base piece which can be used for a more difficult challenge.  Starting with this piece means that the whole tower is on an angle (like the real Leaning Tower) and is much more unstable.<br/><br/>",

By creating the Zombie Attack Prevention and Extermination Machine (which, with your characteristic acumen for catchy names, becomes the ZAP &lsquo;EM), you have enabled your town to weather even the most severe zombie invasion. Unfortunately, the ZAP&rsquo;EM is rather expensive to run, and after building it you are pretty short on cash. You decide to turn your ingenuity into a money-making scheme. By renting out your zombie-slaying capabilities, you can become one of the richest and most respected people in town. That is, assuming you can kill all these zombies in the first place...<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game you will place tiles representing homes, buildings, and terrain features-and, of course, zombies. As the zombies spawn and move around the board terrorizing (and killing) the inhabitants, you must chase them down and ZAP 'EM! If you are lucky, you may even earn some cash! Win the game by killing every zombie in town. You can also keep track of your high score (the amount of cash you have at the end of the game.) Other options include varying difficulty levels and a campaign system that allows you to string multiple games together.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most points from completed scenes when the last card is drawn wins.<br/><br/>The game comes with 2 decks of cards (68 blue-backed and 12 green-backed) plus 9 cardboard characters. To start the game players claim the characters one at a time and are dealt 3 blue cards. Then a green card is turned up. Players take turns drawing 1 blue card and playing 1 blue card. Here are the different types of cards in the game:<br/><br/><br/>    Green-backed cards = These cards give special responsibilities to the player who holds Agent P or Dr. Doofenshmirtz. For example &quot;Say 'Ahh, Perry the Platypus!' before you start your turn. If you forget, you turn is over!&quot; These cards also give the indicated player an extra penalty or bonus. For example &quot;You may play 1 extra card.&quot; A new green-backed card is flipped over and takes effect whenever the Agent P or Dr. Doofenshmirtz character moves to another player.<br/>    Blue-backed Character Cards = These cards move the characters around. For instance &quot;Take 1 character from another player.&quot;<br/>    Blue-backed Power Cards = These cards give you special card-play powers. For instance &quot;Take 1 random card from each player.&quot;<br/>    Blue-backed Challenge Cards = These cards allow you to do weird challenges against other players. For instance &quot;Challenge another player to a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. If you win, take up to 3 random cards from the other player.<br/>    Blue-backed Scene Cards = These cards are how you score points. If you have the character(s) shown on the card you can play it for the number of points indicated on the card. For instance the &quot;Unfair Science Fair&quot; card is worth 10 points if you currently hold Baljeet.<br/>    Blue-backed Special Cards = The Mom card forces everyone to discard everything and draw 3 new cards. The 50 Bonus Points card gives 50 points to the player holding it at the end of the game.<br/><br/><br/>",

Players who enjoy high risk and high rewards will feel at home with the Tiamat while players who like to calculate the optimal path to victory will enjoy piloting the Fatboy.  During the game players will roll dice to increase the speed of their rockets, but pushing too hard may cause your rocket to disintegrate before the race ends.<br/><br/>The game uses a persistent ranking system and lifetime record cards to track each player's accomplishments between games.<br/><br/>",

In the first case, the opponent acts, then the active player follows; in the other cases, players have thirty seconds to complete the challenge. In the speed challenges, the first player to complete the challenge wins, while in the others the remaining players vote on who completed the challenge in the best way. Ties are possible.<br/><br/>The player or players who win the challenge roll the flavor die once or twice, winning one of the six flavors of Klondike bars if they're lucky or stealing a flavor from someone else who is unlucky. The first player to collect all six types of bars wins.<br/><br/>",

There was peace, then shots were fired, and then there was war.&quot; <br/>-Official statement, as provided by Anonymous Pilot-<br/><br/>Indeed, there was peace. But once a package is opened, up to 16 various Pilots (players) have stumbled into the growing conflict, and each turn shots are exchanged until only 1 leaves the battlefield alive.<br/><br/>Each package (the game comes in booster wrapping to provide a random drafting feel similar to various card game tournaments) includes the instructions and enough randomly assorted Pilot cards for a full game of 2-16 players (16 players means that each player only gets 1 Pilot for a game, but additional packs or fewer players allow for more Pilots per player.) The front of each card includes their ship name, their health/damage values, and up to 4 actions (1 on each card edge)that the played Pilot can choose to take for a turn.<br/><br/>Combat and damage plays out in a form similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors with a couple of twists. Each turn, all players play a Pilot card from their hand face-down, with the action of their choice being pointed towards the center of the group of players. The active player then chooses a target, and both of them flip over their Pilot cards and resolve the combat, the loser reducing and keeping track of their remaining health. If the targeted player has chosen a &quot;Pass&quot; action, then the target becomes the player in the direction of the Pass and they participate/resolve the combat instead. These steps continue until only one player has any Pilots remaining.<br/><br/>",

The player who lays out the highest number takes the hand and then moves their pawn one space forward on the game board. Every fifth or so space is marked &quot;Dynasty&quot; and a player landing on this space may select one of the trump tokens to place at the lowest possible space on the &quot;trump track&quot;, in the center of the board. As the suits are added to the track, the order in which suits may trump each other follows. For instance, the first placed (and therefore lowest on the track) suit is jesters. Jesters can trump all cards. The next placed suit (set above jesters on the track) is kings.  Jesters will still trump all cards but kings, kings trump all cards. If a player lands on a &quot;dynasty&quot; spot and all six suits have been set, they may swap two suits. Game ends when one player has traversed the entire board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Translated from description on publisher's website.<br/><br/>This is Liar Kingdom. Funny people lie for the good of the kingdom, but the poor citizens despise them for their lies. YOU are the authority of darkness, dominate in the shadows of this crazy kingdom. Even the king is afraid of you. Nobles and slaves alike will die not even know your existence. You are invincible and your power is absolute, but one question has been asked that might change the kingdom's fate: <br/>&quot;Who among the kingdom's people has the most power?&quot; <br/> Using only three cards and three &quot;declaration chips,&quot; play a game to earn victory points faster than your opponents.<br/><br/>Each player plays one of their three cards face down and one of their three chips face up on top of the card. The face up chip can be the true identity of their played card or a lie to try to trick the other players into believing what they are playing. There is an optional round where players can change the chip on their card to a different one. Then the cards are revealed and the way they interact decides who won the round and receives VP. Also, if you were lying or telling the truth with your chip determines if you receive or lose additional VP.<br/><br/>Designer's summary:<br/>暗殺者、王様、奴隷のカードを１枚ずつ持ってゲームをします。プレイヤーは順番に手番を行います。自分の出すカードがどれかをチップを出して宣言する。任意のカードを裏向きで出す。全員がそれを行ったら勝敗の判定を行います。自分の出したカードが次のとおりだった場合、勝利します。暗殺者を出して王様がいた場合、それを１人敗北させて勝利します。王様を出して自分を殺す暗殺者がいなかった場合、奴隷を全員敗北させて勝利します。奴隷を出して王様がいなかった場合に勝利します。勝利したプレイヤーは得点を獲得します。勝利しなかったプレイヤーは全員敗北。宣言と異なるカードを出していたプレイヤーはマイナス点を獲得します。誰かが８点以上を獲得するとゲーム終了。得点の高いプレイヤーの勝利です。<br/><br/>Each player has 3 cards and 3 tokens, each of which represents Royalty, Assassin, and Slave. Starting player declares a card he will be playing by placing corresponding token face-up, then plays one card face-down. He may lie about the card he's playing. Then next player does the same, and so on. When all players are done, reveal all cards they played and resolve the outcome. If one or more Royalties are in play, each Assassin in play kills one of them. Successful Assassins win the round. After the assassination, if one or more Royalties are still in play, survived Royalties win the round, otherwise all Slaves win the round. Winners get points, and players who have lied and still didn't win the round lose points. A game ends when a player gains total of 8 points. A player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Set in an eclectic fantasy world, players build a board during the game, but can also change the board throughout the game. The board is consisted of 3x3 tiles with a random assortment of different terrains on them, including grass, water, marsh, boulder and lava.<br/><br/>Each player can also change the board in unique ways by swapping tiles, removing tiles or rotating tiles. This is most important because there are lava squares and players always need to be aware of how those tiles can change and move so they don't end up in lava and die.<br/><br/>There are also items to take including Weapons, Armor, Potions and Boardcrafting cards. On a turn, a player can make an attack, pick up an item, as well as play a &quot;Genesis action&quot; which means they can add a tile to the board.<br/><br/>The goal is to collect achievement points by completely missions and killing other players. Missions are randomly distributed and might be anything from collecting items, to performing in game actions such as pushing someone into water.<br/><br/>Players can play in teams or free-for-all in completely new environments each game.<br/><br/>",

Can you do it?<br/><br/>Flatten out Monsters is a new type of memory game in which you need to memorize only six cards! Can you effectively lead the heroes and flatten out the monsters?<br/><br/>To set up, monster cards are placed in a 3x7 grid and double-sided hero cards are placed in a 3x2 grid in front of the monsters. Heroes in the same line &mdash; that is, a line of two hero cards &mdash; will fight the seven monsters lined in front of them. On a player's turn, he must swap two hero cards, then flip them to the reverse sides. These two cards activate the cards in the same line with them and become the attacking groups, then you resolve the attack on the monsters one by one in each activated line. If the two hero cards show the icons needed to defeat the first monster in line, they win the fight and score the monster card. Then they fight against the second monster, and so on until they fail. Play continues in clockwise order until at least two lines of monsters are all defeated, and whoever has the most monster cards wins!<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop. You can use stations if you wish.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of cards for the &quot;cities&quot;, each with a value to be earned by visiting that &quot;city&quot;. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for these.  There are hikes and flights in addition to the train rides.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn. This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.  There are also facilities to gain double points.<br/><br/>",

If you know a fan of the red and white jumper-wearing character, then they'll love the chance to show their stripes in this exciting fast and furious search and find game where they'll say goodbye to school holiday boredom and so long to rainy day blues. Great for girls and boys alike aged seven upwards (and fun-loving grown-ups too!), the Where's Wally? Board Game is a race against time where being eagle-eyed and speedy is a winning combination! Players must find the picture on the board which matches the picture on their card. It might sound simple but try doing that when the sections of the board have been rearranged and there's a constant tick telling you that time is running out. The aim of the game is to be the fastest player to find and cover Where's Wally? pictures on the board with a Wally token. The next player tries to do the same and so the game continues until the timer stops. A card with a number '2' on it means double the challenge - you have to match the picture on your card to the picture on the board twice before play moves on. And if you collect a card with an 'R' on it, the direction of play is reversed and the four sections of the Where's Wally? board must be rearranged too. Simply super stripy fun for Where's Wally? fans who like a challenge!<br/><br/>",

Players are then dealt a hand of action cards that allow them to move cards in the tableau, search the dig field, dig in one column of the field, or transfer cards to the collection site (in a separate area). &quot;No Trespassing&quot; cards will block digging in a particular column and force a player to play a (limited quantity) &quot;Permit&quot; card in order to access any artifacts locked above that card.<br/><br/>The game ends when the 15th artifact or dirt sample card has been moved to the Collection Site or when players are blocked from moving any more cards.

        "description": "User summary:<br/>浄土双六 (Joudo-Sugoroku) is a traditional Japanese game originally produced during the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573) and later developed into Tobi-Sugoroku in the Edo Period (1603 to 1868). As with the later Tobi-Sugoroku (and Mawari-Sugoroku), the original designers' and illustrators' names are lost to history.<br/><br/>Joudo-Sugoroku is themed on the Buddhist tradition of re-incarnation. Joudo means 'The Pure Land', that is the celestial realm or pure abode of a Buddha.  The players are human souls, wandering through the many Hells, gradually gaining enlightenment through training and meditation, to finally ascend to the Pure Land.<br/><br/>Game-play is based upon the text in the squares on the scroll. The players roll dice (labelled in Chinese text for the numbers 1 to 6) and move as instructed, so a player does not move from one square to an adjacent one, but instead jumps across the network. (Sugoroku means literally 'double-six').<br/><br/>An edition has been produced by 望月哲史 (Satoshi Mochizuki) for Plenluno (プレンルーノ) and uses the classic artwork and language of the &quot;Sugoroku Ruiju&quot; game held in the collection of the National Museum of Japan in Tokyo, but also updated into modern language. The game is produced as a large sheet poster, with additional playing pieces, and is available at Spiel 2016.<br/><br/>The game is played by 1 to 8 players, aged from 5+ years and takes around 20 minutes to finish. It's a roll-and-move racing game using dice, with mythological and educational themes.<br/><br/>Game description from the publisher:<br/>江戸時代に遊ばれていた「飛び双六」の現代語訳版です。<br/>日本の東京国立博物館に収蔵されている「双六類聚」を現代語に翻訳しました。<br/>人間界から出発し、地獄を巡り、修業をして悟りを開き、仏になることを目指す双六です。<br/>江戸時代、お寺などで遊ばれていた双六です。<br/>400年以上前のものの復刻版です。<br/>盤面は仏教の死後の世界を表しています。<br/>地獄をさまよったり、修行や瞑想をしたりして、悟りを開いて仏を目指します。<br/>輪廻転生を繰り返し、仏を目指しましょう。<br/><br/>",

What makes the other happy, what makes him happy?<br/>During the Spirit Butterfly board game, players try to figure out which of their players to choose from. The Soul Butterfly will test how deeply we know others and ourselves. With its unique, special beauty cards and situational situations, it offers many gaming surprises to newcomers to the world of board games.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play the game. Basic game and situational game version.<br/> For the base game, the board must be placed on the A side. Each player chooses one color and receives the corresponding tip puck and puppet. The starting player receives a gray marker card and one of each player's suit. The butterfly card 60 and the gift card 21 must be shuffled and placed face down on the board. This will be the draw deck.<br/> The dealer draws one less card than the number of players and puts it face up. Place at least one face down card on each card. You can also use gray for a card you think is not close to any player. The players then try to guess which card the dealer intended for them by using the tip disc. Depending on how confident you are with one or two point sides. Then the markers turn and the evaluation follows. For correct tips, the player's dummy moves on the scoring bar to score points.<br/> In the situation version, if the dealer is on a situation field, you will have to draw two situation cards and read one of them. You will need to place your marker cards accordingly. The dealer on the smiley field acts according to the basic game. While a player on the doubling field will score all points, but in the case of a dealer, the player can decide whether to play the turn normally or draw from the situation cards.<br/> The winner of the game is the one whose puppy crosses the finish line first or moves to that field.<br/><br/>",

In Clue: North Pole Edition, instead of solving a murder mystery, players attempt to solve the mystery of the missing presents.<br/><br/>Players move from building to building at the North Pole to solve the mystery of: who did it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, item, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the Sleigh Room in the middle of the board. Players must move to a location and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific item. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, item, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the hidden in the Sleigh Room.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes a coloured writing card. Keep the other game materials close at hand.<br/><br/>The youngest player starts and is the first narrator. He/she thinks up a name (person, animal or thing) and writes it on his/her writing card without showing it: this will be the mysterious object. Then he/she draws a card from one of the piles and places it face up in the centre of the table, clearly visible to all players.<br/><br/>At this point the narrator has 1 minute to think up a way to describe the mysterious subject starting from the picture on the card face up on the table. As soon as he/she has thought of a sentence he/she pronounces it aloud. At this point, the narrator turns over the hourglass and all the other players must try to guess the mysterious object. Each player can say its name aloud.<br/><br/>When a player guesses correctly, the round ends and points are awarded. If no one guesses in time, a new round begins and the new narrator becomes the player to the right of the last one who narrator.<br/><br/>Here are some examples: if the mysterious object is a BOOK and the uncovered card represents a TABLE, the narrator say &quot;it is a paper TABLE&quot;, or &quot;it is a TABLE with a cover&quot; and so on. If the mysterious object is a pair of TROUSERS and the uncovered card represents a LEMON, the metaphor or riddle could be: &quot;it's a LEMON made of fabric&quot; or &quot;it's a LEMON that is peeled by unzipping it.&quot;<br/><br/>Both the player who guesses correctly and the narrator earn one point. The player who reaches 5 points first wins. Before starting the game, the players can also decide on more or fewer points in order to win. Scores are recorded and updated on the scoreboard by using the erasable marker.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ride is an adrenaline-pumping card game inspired by the film of the same name released in September 2018. As the two protagonists of the film you will have to be able to get to the finish line safe and sound, only one of the players will win, but the collaboration to be able to reach the finish line at least alive will be essential!<br/><br/>Play your cards wisely, help your ally in desperate moments hoping that he too will do the same with you, under penalty of a scorching defeat by the Dark Rider!<br/><br/>After preparing the decks, each player chooses a Rider (or one is assigned to them at random), taking the relative Card (if it is the first game, mount the appropriate characteristic clips on the card), the Rider marker to be placed on the first card of the Path.<br/><br/>There are four different phases that follow each other in a precise order: Route phase, Dark Rider phase, Events phase and Rider phase.  The first essentially creates the path that the players will be required to tackle: in each Path phase, 4 cards are added in front of the leading rider and all those in the queue of the last rider will be eliminated.  If there are no tiles behind them, the first one will be eliminated and the rider on it will suffer a penalty.<br/><br/>In the Dark Rider phase, on the other hand, the action passes into the hands of the mysterious antagonist who will act following the action diagram shown on his card depending on the result obtained by rolling the RIDE die. It should be noted that this disturbing element will not be present immediately in the game, but will appear the first time a Rider should pass on a Path card with his symbol.<br/><br/>Should the Dark Rider not be present, the Events phase will take care of complicating the players' life: here a card will be drawn from the relative deck and covered place on the Path.  It will be revealed, and activated, should a player end his turn on that specific card.  Note that there is nothing to prevent different Event cards from hitting the same route segment: in this case, all effects will be applied.<br/><br/>In the last phase, the players can take turns taking action.  After drawing 4 cards (or less depending on certain situations) they will be forced to play one.  Therefore, according to a precise schedule they will have to: apply the indicated effect and advance by a number of Movement Points equal to, or lower than, those provided by the card.  Having determined the card on which you decide to end up, you will have to apply any reported effects, reveal and activate the Events and, if possible, fight against the other Riders.<br/><br/>The aim of the game will be to accumulate more points than the others and, not secondary, to stay alive.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "トリッククエスト (Trick Quest) is a trick-taking role-playing game from Japan. Players have RPG roles such as mage or fighter, and progress along an adventure path by winning tricks. When a player wins cards in suit matching their character, they can improve their abilities.<br/><br/>Each player gets a RPG character and work together to complete the quest. Players move along a path on a game board, and where the path diverges, they can split or stay together. Players can work up and down the path, repeating sections to build up their characters.<br/><br/>As players face each challenge, they play a trick-taking game. The suits correspond to the characters; armour for the martial artist, tools for the mage and wizard, ornaments for the monk and so on. By collecting cards in their suit, a character can get Trick Points (TP) and use them to upgrade their abilities, and to level up to unlock higher strengths.<br/><br/>Players win the game by completing the quest, finding the legendary GodBird and ridding the world of disease.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Players have the task of retrieving the stones and protecting their vineyards.<br/><br/>At the beginning, each player draws a vineyard board. Vineyards have different bonuses for specific suits of cards and attack or defence bonus.<br/><br/>Each turn player draws 2 cards from the deck or the face up tableau. Then they choose to play a set of cards, attack other player or pass. Additionally, they may also play any number of olivine cards (special powers).<br/>A set of 2, 3, or 4 identical cards gives 2,  5, or 9 stones, respectively. Player may get additional stone for their suit. There are 4 suits: sun, water, volcano, and peasants. A set of 4 different cards gives 7 stones.<br/>To attack, a player plays an attack card and add its bonus to a dice roll. The defending player rolls another dice and may choose to play a defence card afterwards. The totals of attack and defence are compared. The attacker takes number of stones equal to their advantage from opponent's vineyard.<br/>If player doesn't play a set or attack, they pass.<br/>Then they may discard unwanted cards and draw an equal number from the deck.<br/> The players continue until one gathers 25 stones in their vineyard.<br/><br/>",

The primary mechanism of play is the Activation Cards that give players the opportunity to operate within the political environment of the Gulf War (in addition the the military realm). It is not enough for players to simply engage in combat; every decision must be weighed against possible political repercussions. Iraq may invade Kuwait, but can the Iraqi player play the proper political cards to foment division among the potential Coalition partners so as to control Kuwait, or at least control Kuwait long enough to leverage additional options? Can the Iraqi player actually invade Saudi Arabia before the Coalition partners prepare Operation Desert Shield? Might Iran become embroiled, or even Israel, or possibly even the Soviets if the region becomes thoroughly destabilized? Players must not only fight and win ground campaigns, but must do so deftly within the present political environment (as created by the card play) to maximize their chances to win the game. Perhaps the Gulf War might never happen, or perhaps an entirely different kind of war will erupt, a war that might see a larger war throughout the Middle East.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GAIA, the super AI designed to protect the Earth, has identified the biggest threat of them all - HUMANKIND.<br/><br/>In this semi-cooperative game, each player controls 2-6 characters with which they journey across the Earth and space. Your mission is to shut down GAIA by discovering a special reboot code. This is done by navigating the Earth while GAIA pours her wrath over it, and by finding the Code Tiles hidden there. For each active Code Tile discovered the players earn Victory Points. The players have to cooperate to successfully perform Space RUNS to the different destinations: the Moon, Mars, and the GAIA Space Station. Code tiles are hidden on these as well.<br/><br/>Each turn a player chooses a character to move on the Earth or one of the destinations, trying to reach the Code Tiles and play Action cards that also give them Victory Points. While moving they have to steer clear of the spaces destroyed by GAIA's attacks. Reaching a functioning space vessel and gathering a suitable crew is also essential.<br/><br/>There is no time to lose, as GAIA is wreaking havoc on the Earth with natural disasters and deadly drones. If the reboot code is not discovered in time mankind is destroyed and GAIA wins. If the reboot code is discovered, the single player with the most Victory Points earned wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These card are placed left and right besides the gold seeker card with the backside up.<br/><br/>In the middle of the table you can find the river, where to search the gold.

You can see the river, but not the gold printed on the other side of the card.<br/><br/>If it is your turn, you have to turn a around a river card. If it shows gold nuggets you have to find the tools printed on the card. For that you turn around the cards which are next to the gold seekers. If you turn around the right tools you get the river card with the nuggets. If you do wrong your turn ends. After that a new river card is placed in the middle. If you turn around a river card showing gold teeth you don't have to find tools, but whiskey bottles.<br/><br/>The game is getting harder, because every time a player shows a wrong tool, all players with a open tool card change this card with another player, so that the tools are now located somewhere else.<br/><br/>If all river cards with gold are used the game ends and the player with the most gold nuggets and gold teeth win the game.<br/><br/>",

Play as a &quot;team&quot; or jump overboard and go it alone, overcoming torrential storms, blabbering parrots, pirate attacks, and simply losing your mind. Hoard food for an end game bonus. Oar Else! is a &quot;cooperative&quot; card game for 3-5 players, ages 8+.<br/><br/>Everyone starts together, adrift at sea in a lifeboat. The game can be played cooperatively by paddling to shore together in the boat, collecting cumulatively fifteen paddle cards. An alternate win is for the group to find three out of four items necessary for the boat's immediate rescue.<br/><br/>However, players also have the option to jump overboard and &quot;go it alone&quot;, taking their paddling contribution with them in the hopes of either paddling to shore before the boat or by achieving their personal immediate rescue scenario.<br/><br/>Once the boat reaches shore, food cards are used to break-the-tie. When food cards are drawn during a player's turn, they do not get to keep the card. Instead, the others in the boat must bid on the card by using cards from their hand.<br/><br/>Thank you to Chris Baylis at the Games Gazette (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gamesgazette.co.uk/gg/main.php?p=content/Board+Games/OAR+ELSE+card+game+fun.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gamesgazette.co.uk/gg/main.php?p=content/Board+Ga...</a>) for writing this great review of Oar Else!.

It works like many other quiz games, as you can keep a card if you can answer a question on it (there are different categories, such as animals, technology, history etc.). However, there is a special movement mechanism that determines how far you can move on the game board: There is a pawn on an outer section of the game board which you can move forward by one or two squares. The number printed on the square you reach is the number of squares you can move, so you need to keep an eye on your own movement and of the possibilities you open for the next player(s). You can also challenge an opponent if you reach the same square as he or she, and if you are successful, you can take a card from him or her.<br/><br/>",

The other players also play cards to affect the outcome. If the active player has any Control over the shot, they may disregard one or more of the cards played. The shorter the shot, the more control a player has. After the cards are applied, they place their ball token on the aimed spot and the next player goes. In between rounds players draft the cards used in that round for future use. When players make it in on each hole, they move to the next. When all players finish a hole, the last player to finish gets to keep that hole card for future use. The game ends when the first player makes it into the 9th hole. For a full 18 hole game, score is kept and the game is reset for the 'back 9' at this point.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Calmness and concentration.<br/>Just one right motion and the card will be fixed in the needed position.<br/>Step by step, card by card &ndash; in front of you a fragile and elegant tower of a Japanese castle appears.<br/><br/>Japanese castle is a three-dimensional meccano and a competition of skill and accuracy. Laconic fascination of traditional Japanese architecture, ancient European card-building passion and a native Russian talent of constructing magnificent edifices without any nail are united in this game.<br/><br/>The game concept is familiar to everyone who has built a card castle at least once: vertical piers are leaned together and horizontal cards are placed at their top becoming a base for the new floor, and it continues till there are no cards left or one clumsy movement ruins all the construction. Moreover standard cards called heki which are used only for walls there are some other building elements: gamen screens (twice bigger than heki) and yanegae overlaps with the special fixed stops for heki. Vertical cards stay at their places because of it so castle levels can be built as a tower one right above another, not only like a pyramid. Yanegae cards are of two sizes &ndash; small ones with the space for one leaned pair of heki (this construction is called karigoya) and big for two pairs which can be placed transversely to each other as well as parallel. The last variety of big yanegae with two perpendicular pairs is called antei and works as the basic unit for the most of constructions.<br/><br/>Rules offer many varieties of the game: for one player or for the company of 2-4 builders. There can be up to 8 players if two game kits are used. Solo gameplay is simple &ndash; you need to build a castle as high as possible. There are no strict rules &ndash; you can use any element conditionally to your imagination. Competing versions usually offer to build a tower of exact height in a pelter or make the most solid building &ndash; in this case players jolt the table trying to ruin opponent&rsquo;s castle and not to damage own. Especially amusing version tenders to take your castle and move it to another table keeping it all-of-a-piece, of cause. There is also some kind of gameplay resembling Jenga &ndash; players put some cards into a heap, place a few karigoya at the top and try to pull the cards out of the heap without busting the buildings.<br/><br/>Building castles with special elements is easier than with common cards but still the same interesting. Japanese castle can be even built by a child nevertheless nobody suggests to play it in the after-party morning. <br/>The game differs favorably from the common cards by design &ndash; building elements show off the authentical Japanese pictures and interiors from the rich collection of the &ldquo;Yugen&rdquo; antiques gallery. Japanese castle will give you hours of creativity and excitement and maybe can become a first step to a high-altitude card building champion title for someone. Theoretically 5 Japanese castle game sets will be enough to build an eight-meter tower &ndash; the last registered record doesn&rsquo;t haul a bit to this point.<br/><br/>",

Players now take turns playing cards on this discard pile. If the number played is higher than the current top card of the stack, the player moves his/her rocket forward by the difference between the cards in fields. If it has the same value, the player must move another player's rocket by one field. If the played card is lower, the active player has two options: Either move his/her rocket back the difference, or draw the difference in cards (this is the only way of getting new cards). <br/>A round ends when either a player has reached the moon, or someone runs out of cards, or the stack is used up. Then each player deducts the number of cards in his/her hands from the number of the field his/her rocket is on, and scores that number of points. Play as many rounds as there are players. The player with highest overall score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The player then tries to answer a question determined by both the color of the space he or she lands on, and the actual number rolled on the die.  If the question is answered correctly the player moves forwards an additional three spaces as a reward.  There is no penalty for getting the answer wrong.

You can play the classic game with the street names, landmarks and locations which give the city its distinctive character.<br/>From Edinburgh Castle to the Palace of Holyrood House, the Royal Mile descends the sloping rocky ridge on which the medieval Old Town of Edinburgh was built.<br/>Scotland's story reverberates through every close and wynd on the historic thoroughfare.  Each summer provides a dramatic backdrop to the annual Edinburgh International Festival, the world's largest arts and cultural extravaganza.<br/>The cramped and irregular architecture of the 'Old Town' stands in contrast to the neat symmetry sought by the planners of the eighteenth century 'New Town'.<br/>The city's cherished open spaces, the imposing heights of Arthur's Seat and the gentle panorama of the Pentland Hills combine to create a sense of spaciousness rare in urban areas.&quot;<br/><br/>Not that the above tells you anything about the game!<br/><br/>In addition to local streets, most properties have been branded/sponsored by appropriate businesses (for example, Jenners on Princes Street).<br/><br/>",

In Battle of Souls you deploy (summon) warriors of different ranks and warrior sects to drain your opponents soul points (life points) and win the game. The theme of the game carries alone with historical warriors such as Samurai, Mongolian, Roman etc..<br/><br/>In Battle of Souls, each player starts with 8000 life points which in our game is referred to as soul points. The objective of the game, or otherwise stated the win condition is to be the first player to reach 16000 soul points.<br/><br/>This is done by dealing damage to your opponent from the attacks of your deployed (summoned) warriors.<br/><br/>Each time your opponent takes damage of any type, including any cost to activate an effect, you gain that much SP (soul points) and vice versa.<br/><br/>This mechanic insures that there will always be a definite victor and never a draw game. <br/>The second win condition is if one player runs out of cards to draw from their decks, they lose the game.<br/><br/>GAME FLOW:<br/>Each player starts the game by drawing 5 cards from their deck to their hand. The first play to take a turn draws one additional card at the beginning of their turn. Each turn the player is able to deploy only one fighter (warrior, elite warrior, warlord, legendary warrior) to their side of the field. The first player to take his/her turn may not attack on that turn. The last player to draw is the first that can attack.<br/>The fighter cards are ranked in the following order, along with deployment requirements:<br/>Warrior &gt; No special requirements<br/>Elite Warrior &gt; Tribute a warrior that has 3 kill counters on it (kill counters are gained whenever a fighter destroys another fighter in battle)<br/>Warlord &gt; Tribute an Elite Warrior with 5 kill counters on it<br/>Legendary Warrior &gt; Tribute a Warlord with 7 kill counters on it, in addition to an Elite Warrior and Warrior on your side of the field.<br/><br/>Equipment cards can be played face up or set face down to be used at a later time. Some are one time use and others are continuous<br/><br/>Tactic cards are played face down on the turn you play them from your hand and may be activated by flipping face up on any turn after they were first played as long as the effect conditions are met (if any)<br/><br/>Battlefield cards are played face up and only one Battlefield card can be active on the field at any time. If a Battlefield card is in play when another is played, the previous one is destroyed.<br/><br/>FIELD LIMITATIONS:<br/>On the field, each player can have a maximum of 5 fighter cards in play 1 battlefield, and 6 total equipment or tactic cards<br/><br/>PHASES:<br/>The game phases are as follows for each turn<br/>Draw phase &gt; Player draws a card<br/>Ready phase &gt; All fighters that are currently in rest position (This is the position a fighter is changed to after a successful attack) are switched to attack position<br/>Main phase &gt; Player can deploy, special deploy, activate equipment, battlefield, or previously set tactic cards as well as utilize any effects whose condition is met.<br/>Battle phase &gt; Player sends his/her warriors to fight<br/>Main phase 2: do the same as the first main phase with the exception of deploying a fighter if the player already did so during the first main phase. Special deployments are limitless and can be done any number of times up to the max allows fighters in play.<br/>End phase: player ends their turn and discards a card from their hand if they are carrying 7 or more cards in hand.<br/><br/>",

During your turn, you can move 1 piece, by either moving 1 space, or 'jumping' over any ship or ships, checkers-style.<br/><br/>After you move, you then roll a die and the board spins from 1 to 3 spaces left or right! The end-game usually consists of everyone moving their last ship back and forth until a lucky die roll is made.<br/><br/>Note: There are separate game pages for the 1975 card game from Whitman and the 1974 board game from Omnia, as well as the Italian game Spazio: 1999.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you play one fuel card to move your ship that number of squares either horizontally or vertically, but not both.<br/>There are also two fuel ships.  Every player on his turn rolls a die and moves one of the fuel ships.  If you land next to a fuel ship, you can retrieve any one used fuel card.  When you are out of fuel, you can only move one square per turn. You also retrieve any 3 used fuel cards on every planet you land on.<br/>Each planet has a series of 10 to 12 dots that describe its entry/exit orbit.  To leave Earth, you have to follow the 12 orbit dots before you enter the vertical and horizontal grid of open space.  Likewise, when you want to land on a planet, you have to start on the outermost orbit dot and follow the orbit down to the planet's surface.  Sorry, no transporters in this game.<br/><br/>",

Two separate decks, one for Oxford and the other for Cambridge, each with three suits of eight cards, plus three incident (wild) cards.<br/><br/>At the start of each hand, a player chooses the precedence of the suits. Only five tricks are played with each hand, this stops card counting and makes the game more luck-dependent.<br/><br/>Tricks count both for a boat (corresponding to the deck used) and for the player. Players that win a trick select which deck will be used and therefore which boat will win the point.<br/><br/>The first boat that scores 26 points wins. Players then score double for points won from the winning boat. Score is kept on an attractive pad with maps of the Boat Race course.<br/><br/>",

The fleas are placed on a 7z7 grid while the dogs wander the streets between the rows and columns. Fleas are placed picture-side (flea-side) up, with no identical fleas allowed on adjacent squares. After the grid is filled, the fleas are turned over, displaying the color of the player who placed them. The player with the most fleas on both sides of a street captures the unsuspecting dog on that street. Points for captured dogs are totaled, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players pieces start in the boxes on the sides of the outer ring of the board. These middle squares along each edge and the square in the center of the board are safe places where pieces cannot be attacked. Movement is determined by coins, casting sticks or cowrie shells (traditional).<br/><br/>On a turn, the player throws four cowries and may move a coin from 1 to 8 places according to the result. If the player lands on a space occupied by the opponent, the opponent's coin is &quot;cut&quot; and must return to the starting space. Once a coin has returned to the space before the player's starting space, provided the player has cut the opponent at least once, the coin moves to the inner ring and continues around the board and then into the innermost square. The first player to move all of their coins to the innermost square wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players stack dice chosen by one of them and score points when the tower holds... or lose points if it collapses. The difficulty depends of course on the size of the die, but especially on the order in which it is placed and the tower on which it is placed. And these two conditions are dictated to the player by the face value of his die.<br/><br/>The first player rolls the dice and chooses, following a few simple rules, which ones they will give to their opponents and to whom. The player who rolls first becomes the first player and, in turn, will try to score points and cause his opponents to fall by forcing them to try risky balances.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hasbro released this &quot;ultimate 'Mystery Game'&quot; under the Parker Brothers brand label. It is a murder/mystery game which plays with virtually identical mechanics to Clue, with some notable exceptions.<br/><br/>The object is to deduce who committed the murder of an unnamed victim, with what weapon and in what room. There are 6 possible suspects: Madame Rubie, General Umber, Mrs. Azul, Mr. Pine, Sir Use, and Dr. Rose; 6 possible weapons: Cast Iron Pan, Golf Club, Butcher Knife, Revolver, Wrench, and Hammer; and 9 possible rooms: Entrance, Game Room, Spare Bedroom, Master Bedroom, Garden Room, Theatre Room, Sitting Room, Dining Room, and Kitchen. Cards representing these elements are shuffled separately, with three randomly drawn from each category and placed in the center of the playing board, with the rest dealt to the participating players.<br/><br/>Three to four players take on the role of detective and roll a single die to move around the board via a delineated path, moving separate suspect tokens and weapon tokens into the rooms as they make suggestions. The player to the left must reveal any cards they may be holding to disprove the suggestion, until all players have passed.<br/><br/>The game itself measures 10.5&quot; square, with miniature playing cards, and &quot;token&quot; cards representing the 6 suspects and weapons. Four player pawns are included in Red, Orange, Blue and Green. Thought there are substantial similarities to Clue, there are some notable rule differences: the corner rooms no longer provide a &quot;secret passage&quot; to the opposite room in lieu of a move; and players may now land on the same space occupied by another player.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The gameplay in itself is simple and each player will play the part of a space trader shipping goods across the galaxy. The goal of the game is to generate a net of 150,000 credits and return to your home planet before any of the other players.<br/><br/>Players move on already existing trade routes which they later can choose to buy to make their own for a set price. Once a trade route has been bought it will earn that player revenue each time another player is forced to use that particular route, as well as create safe passage way for your own trading ship when traveling in the sense that you do not have to pay the expenses to another player and give them the edge.<br/><br/>Trade routes are different in length and usefulness and players will also be given the option to upgrade their ship to go in Hyperdrive, thus allowing them to move around the board to their destinations faster. The game uses a table where you look up the revenue from each trade between the starting planet and the goal for your shipment.<br/><br/>The element that makes the game difficult is that you cannot actively choose your trade route. It is randomly generated by dice rolls through a table to see to what area and which planet on the board you have to go to. This is also where owning and buying trade routes plays the part of a tactical element.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Rail Baron<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a newer version of a much older, traditional English children's game.  There are 60 cards and they depict the hat, face body and two legs of a silly, cartoon-type character.  At the start, each player has seven cards and the first to shout that they have a hat starts.  The idea is to create full characters (5 cards per character).  It does not matter which hat goes with which face, goes with which body etc...but legs must match!  Each new character must begin with a hat and players must play a card each turn if at all possible.   Each time you play a card, you draw another, and the winner is the player with the most completed characters after every card has been played.<br/><br/>",

Ms Pac-Man's goal is to eat the pellets on the board and the ghosts try to capture her.<br/><br/>Moving according to the results of flicking a spinner, Ms Pac-Man gobbles (removes) pellets by moving over them.  The ghosts move according to the result of a die roll.  They start in their strong state and capture Ms Pac-Man by moving onto her.  When a ghost captures Ms Pac-Man, the ghost's player takes control of the titular character and removes his or her ghost from play; the former Ms Pac-Man player puts the ghost of his or her color into play.  Ghosts turn weak if an F2 is rolled on their die, or if Ms Pac-Man gobbles a Power Pellet (located at the four corners of the maze).  Ms Pac-Man can capture weak ghosts and gain an extra turn by doing so.<br/><br/>The first player to have his or her quadrant clear of pellets wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game uses scalable rules ranging from basic (Go Cower Under Your Blankie While Crying For Your Mommy), Intermediate (fearfully challenging) which adds in monster powers and more complex combat rules, and Advanced (Hero Worship) which adds in even more combat rules, monster abilities, and allows one or all family members to be significantly stronger than the rest.<br/><br/>",

Located in the center of the playing board, the Ring waits to be claimed by the first player who traces his way through the maze from the point of beginning in his Hobbit Shire. Once claimed, the Ring is placed over the successful player's pawn and the chase is on! To win the game, a player must successfully elude the pursuit of his opponents and carry the Ring back to the starting space of his Hobbit Shire.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the Winter Olympics!<br/><br/>You have become an Olympic athlete! Compete in nine different events to score points and win medals.<br/><br/>The game consists of a board, videotape, cards, plastic medals, and pawns. On your turn you watch a 10-15 second random video clip of one of the nine events. At the end of the clip is a section with rapidly changing point values. You then pause the VCR and score whatever points are shown, double them if the space on the board you are on matches the event you just watched. You will then be given the number of spaces to move your token on the board which represents a mountain with three different ski trails down it and ski lifts back up. You can begin to collect medals by accumulating 500 points in a certain event and then landing on a special space for that event to collect the next medal. The first to do this in each event gets the gold for that event, the next the silver, and so on. There are also spaces on the board that can set you back or have you draw a card. The cards can add to your score, set you back or be a lift ticket, which entitles you to move back up the board at any time. After all nine gold medals have been won the game is over and the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>This is a great game for the whole family and the replayability of this game is very high. Even after going through the tape many times each game is still unique.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to win the gold?<br/><br/>",

This is a basic roll-and-move, follow-the-trail game, which includes shortcut spaces for those fortunate to land on them, and also the Bear Den spaces, which forces the unlucky hiker to re-roll the die and move back the indicated number of spaces.<br/><br/>The six-sided die has a bear where the &quot;1&quot; would go, and would normally be treated as a 1.  The &quot;bear&quot; prevents players from using the shortcuts, and if it comes up on a player's penalty roll (after landing in a Bear Den), that player must move back to Start.<br/><br/>This game, along with others in Channel Craft's Vintage Game Series, comes in a small tin.  Movement is made with pegs, which rest in a hole after each move, making it a suitable choice for travel.<br/><br/>",

If a player has enough mana (mah-nah) (spiritual energy), they can also capture other players and send them back to Start.

Last frog player wins; the crocodile player can't win.<br/><br/>According to the box cover, the game needs 2 batteries. They are only necessary for the voice output, not for the mechanic.<br/><br/>",

Then the next player does the same, and so on.<br/><br/>The object is to lay a card so that at least 3 mouse faces are visible. If this is acheived, the player can play another card. And so on, but no more than 3 cards can be played in a single turn. Should a player play a card that has three cat faces shown, that player must take up all the cards played so far and put them at the bottom of his stack.

        "description": "In this lightweight fantasy game you get a random race (elf/undead/human/orc or demon) and a random saga (fight/duel/treasure/mist/crown).<br/><br/>The races all have a leader and 3-4 soldiers. Elf, undead and human have 1 character with a ranged attack.<br/><br/>Each saga has a different goal. Fight saga is a battle between all characters. Duel is just the leaders fighting it out. In Treasure saga you&acute;ll fight to get the most treasure chests. Mist saga is a bit like chinese checkers were you&acute;ll have to get your characters over on the other side and stop your opponent getting across. The crown saga is a battle to have most characters around the crown at games end. The end of the game is random. An hourglas will start at a given time, and when you draw a red hourglass the game ends. The board is also  randomly drawn. You&acute;ll start at opposite ends.<br/><br/>The 5 races has small variations in their stats(move/dodge/attack and defend) and a few characters can shoot, if line-of-sight is good. Each round you can move and attack (close combat or ranged). If you start your turn in combat you&acute;ll have to dodge to be able to move away from combat. All characters have 1 life, so if a character is hit and fails to defend it is dead. You have to roll equal-to or above your stat.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>An easy and challenging game for the whole family. You are in charge of a group of warriors and must win the saga by using strategy and fantasy. The different groups, sagas and sceneries make the game a new adventure every time you play.<br/><br/>Each player selects a team of generic fantasy creatures, ranging from humans and ełves to undead and demons. Each team consists of 4 to 6 pieces.<br/><br/>When teams have been selected, one of the players rolls a ten-sided dice to determine which saga the players will play. These range from simple &quot;Death matchs&quot; to gathering chests.<br/><br/>Now the players form the board by placing lagre hexagon map pieces. Each map pieces contains smaller hexagons and terrain features like houses, trees and rocks.<br/><br/>Each saga (scenario) has a trigger. When a certain point in the game is reach, for example by losing half of your team, a set of &quot;Time piece&quot; markers is placed beside the game board. Each full turn a marker is turned and when a red time piece is revealed the game stops.<br/><br/>In the end points are calculated by simple measures such how many playing pieces you have left or how many treasure chests you've got.<br/><br/>",

The game board also displays all six characters that correspond with the dice.<br/><br/>Bau Cua Tom Ca is also known as Bau Cua Ca Cop or simply bầu cua in Vietnam, but its also played in China known as Hoo Hey How. Variations of this game also exist in other cultures such as Britain and France.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>To play, you will need a dealer (the house) and 1 or more players. There is generally no limit to the amount of players that can play which is one of the reasons it makes for a great party game. Each round starts after the dealer shakes the dice (covered in a dice bowl/plate. Once the dice have been shaken, players are allowed to guess the at the dice and place wagers on 0 or more character spots on the game board. Once all wagers have been placed, the dealer reveals the dice, by uncovering the dice. If the 1 or more of the dice match the player's wager, the house (dealer) must pay the player the amount equal to the player's wager. If the multiple dice match the player's wager, the dealer must pay the player his wager times the number of dice that match. If none of the dice match the player's wager, the dealer takes the wager.<br/><br/>",

Or, better yet, he quickly changes boats, or has someone else change boats. Whoever wins six medals first wins the game!<br/><br/>Four boats are mounted on long sheer plastic stripes, with the far end over the table edge and weighted by a big fish. The boats are occupied by crew members of the players.<br/><br/>In turn, the players roll a die, and (depending on the roll) either move a boat towards the waterfall, or let a crew member switch the boat. At some point, the boats will slide towards and down the waterfall (table edge). The crew members of the last boat in the race score 1-2 points (depending on size).<br/><br/>A player wins when he reaches 6 points after multiple races.<br/><br/>",

In this game the inspiration is found with Home Make-over programs.<br/><br/>The cows have big plans with the farm.  Bertha, Gretha, Johanna, Jacoba en Klara search the best bulls who have the best tools to do the job. Of course the girls like a bull with heavy tools. But the bulls are nowhere in sight when the heavy works begins. It's time to search for the bulls to get them in action.<br/><br/>In this game you are the foreman who has to keep the bulls at work. Bulls with heavy tools give high victory points, but they have several weaknesses. Some of the bulls are not &quot;doing it&quot; in a safe way. Other bulls are lazy, hungry, noisy, bull shitters or not very smart or handy.<br/><br/>The game works as a standalone but can be combined with &quot;Koe zoekt Boer&quot; (Happy Cows) and &quot;Gooishe Koeien&quot; (Trendy Cows).<br/>There also is a special card that is an expansion to &quot;Koe zoekt Boer&quot;. This is the Power Bull, which allows you to take over a turn of another player. This way turning the nice teasing game Koe zoekt Boer in a really nasty party game.<br/><br/>",

The cards have the name of the location on one side and a map on the other side, showing contiguous locations.<br/><br/>The object is to void your hand by playing a card with something that shares a borderline with the last card played. Wild cards when played are automatically considered a match and can then be named as any location in the deck except for those in the player's hand. If a player cannot play a contiguous card, cards are drawn from the deck and added to the player's hand until a card can be played.<br/><br/>Instead of drawing, a player can play a card that does not share a borderline and hope to not be challenged. Challenges can happen after any play. If the challenging player is correct, and the card played does not share a borderline, then the challenged player has to take back the card and take a card from the challenging player's hand. If the challenge is incorrect, the challenger takes a card from the deck and the challenged player gets another turn.<br/><br/>",

The Race is on! Be the first player to MIX, BAKE, FROST, and TOP your cupcake by visiting all 4 corners, and collect sprinkles along the way. The first player to reach the party with a completed cupcake and a sprinkle of each color wins the cherry to put on the top! &quot;Mix it, Bake it, Frost it, Top it!

Every player gets a total chip<br/>value of '20'.<br/><br/>Each player must play one card when it is their turn. The starting player begins and plays one of his Devil cards onto the table. Then its the next players turn. The starting player must play a Devil card in one of the colors of the cards in the hand of the player to his left. The colors of the cards in each players hand are visible on the backs of the various cards. The player, whose turn it is, now has 4 possible alternatives for playing a card from his hand.<br/>- He can play a Devil card with the same value as a 'free card', whose color is not yet represented on the table, face up. The player thusly starts a new row. This play costs the player no chips.<br/>- He can play a card with a higher value in an already started color row at the top or bottom end of that started color&rsquo;s row. This play costs the player no chips. <br/>- He can play a card with a lower value in an already started color row at the top or bottom end of that started color&rsquo;s row. This play costs the player the difference between the value of the card he is playing and the card onto which he is playing it, in chips. The player pays this value in chips to the player to his right.<br/>- He can play an Angel card onto the free end of any row in which there is no Angel card played so far. This play costs the player no chips.<br/><br/>The game ends when the dealer plays his last card. Since the dealer is last in the round, the dealer is always the one to play the last card. Whomever has the most chips at this point, is the winner if this heavenly hand.<br/><br/>",

The cards have the name of the location on one side and a map on the other side, showing contiguous locations.<br/><br/>The object is to void your hand by playing a card with something that shares a borderline with the last card played. Wild cards when played are automatically considered a match and can then be named as any location in the deck except for those in the player's hand. If a player cannot play a contiguous card, cards are drawn from the deck and added to the player's hand until a card can be played.<br/><br/>Instead of drawing, a player can play a card that does not share a borderline and hope to not be challenged. Challenges can happen after any play. If the challenging player is correct, and the card played does not share a borderline, then the challenged player has to take back the card and take a card from the challenging player's hand. If the challenge is incorrect, the challenger takes a card from the deck and the challenged player gets another turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was released at the same time of the movie &quot;Bibi Blocksberg und das Geheimnis der blauen Eulen!&quot; (translated as Bibi Blocksberg and the Secret of the Blue Owls!) in Germany. The movie (with the title character Bibi, who is a young witch) is based on a decades-old, long-running radio play and animated series but was also inspired by the success of the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>It's a roll and move game for juniors with four quests to complete. Roll and move effect is mitigated in a number of ways - players can re-roll once in each turn and they can collect helping cards when arriving on specific spaces or rolling a pentagram. The four quests are as follows:<br/>- Library: find the book that opens a secret door to the secret passage. For this, find the same-colored book as the spaces you arrive on.<br/>- Maze: to find your way through the maze, move the 5 moving pentagon tiles showing parts of the maze. These can be moved (turned or moved to different spaces) when rolling a pentagram or when arriving on a pentagon space. Cards might also help.<br/>- Suspended bridge: each step (space) has some hidden traps that are revealed when stepping on them, easily causing players fall into the abyss. Some of them can be avoided with knowledge (knowing which blue owl has which number on its bottom), others with planning and luck (e.g. tiles where you fall into the abyss if you arrived there with specified die rolls), others with discarding a card. If a player falls into the abyss they have to climb back to the bridge and try again. The task gets easier once tiles are revealed and players know what to expect.<br/>- The Five Owls: owls have to be placed on the five numbered spaces in order (the owl with number 1 to space 1 and so on). If a player fails they go back to the entrance of the owls hall. The numbers on the bottom of the owls can be looked at during game (with cards or when rolling a pentagram) but whenever they are checked (secretly, by the active player) they are placed back to another space so their location keeps changing and players must watch their movement closely during the course of the game.<br/>The first player to correctly place the fifth owl to its corresponding place on the last space of the path wins.<br/><br/>",

The start player reads one of special event cards and players have to follow the instructions on the event cards. The effects can be put certain cards in front of you, face up or face down, discarding a card or giving cards to another player. Once all players have 5 cards in front of them, the round is over. The 5 cards are your current poker-hand. The player with the best hand wins. The game is a nice variation of standard poker.<br/><br/>",

A ball of the same color is attached to the disk via a 12 foot length of twine. An outside player (&quot;the umpire&quot;) uses a spinner to direct the players how to loop their ball-on-a-string around another player's body part. For example, if the spinner indicates &quot;Yellow, Left Leg,&quot; then the current player must loop their ball-on-a-string around the Yellow player's left leg. Play continues until only one player is left who is able to complete an indicated move.<br/><br/>Tagline from the box: &quot;The most hilarious... knottiest... fun game for the whole family.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The spaces are connected with lines in all directions (horzontal, vertical, diagonal). The aim of the game is to be the player to isolate the white piece. To do so, players alternate picking a line and a color and remove all pieces of that color from the line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme: Willy Slowman was probably the best intergalactic merchant ever to tackle the business.  He started out with a hundred credits to his name and the keys to a small cargo hauler.  Over the years he forged intergalactic trade routes, stared down pirates and amassed a small fortune.<br/><br/>When Willy died he left behind a sizeable fortune and a single stipulation in his will, that one of his relatives would prove to be the rightful heir to his shipping empire by following in his footsteps.  Relatives started pouring out of the woodwork trying for a chance to win Willy's fortune.  You know nothing about trade routes, or pirates, or the galaxy at large... but this is a chance of a lifetime.  As one of Willy's recognized relatives (fourth cousin of a nephew, twice removed) the lawyers for the Slowman estate are going to provide you with 100 credits and a small cargo hauler, if you can be the first to amass 1000 credits you will prove yourself to be the rightful heir.<br/><br/>Gameplay: In this game the players race around the board to pick-up and deliver chits to amass their fortunes.  The board is modular in order to increase replayability, and the chits are not sorted to decrease the set-up time (chits only have to be added/removed when changing the starting worlds - not the board layout).  Chits include Events which have a timed effect, Goods, Passengers, Enemies which can harass the players or be hunted for bounty, Mined Goods and Ship Upgrades (increase your combat effectiveness or speed).  This allows for a variety of gameplay strategies.  The rules have been streamlined and every effort has been made to make it as streamlined and simple as possible without losing any of the flavor or depth.<br/><br/>But in the end the game is all about making money, and the first player to 1000 credits is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to sell your products at the biggest price and earn as much money for your farm, taking care of farm field, weather and law of need and demand.<br/><br/>Goal of the game: Goal is to collect as much money as you can.<br/>PLAYER AT THE END OF THE FOURTH ROUND WHO HAS THE MOST MONEY IS THE WINNER.<br/><br/>Mechanics: In the first stage players plant their Products card on the fields. There are seven fields with different values which grant different amount of crops planted on them. When the player in his turn draws a card from the deck card products, he looks it and then put that card on any of the fields. The player can place Products card on an empty field or on a field that already has products on the card itself, taking into account the following order.<br/>Apples can be planted on a corn, corn can be planted over wheat, wheat can be planted over pumpkin and pumpkin can be planted over apples.<br/>Crops get only the player with top card in the field when all Product cards are used.<br/>In second part of the game players take products on market to sell. But must be careful if to many player bring same product price for that product will be very low.<br/><br/>",

Create the perfect social media-inspired picture to accompany odd pairs of hilarious captions and hashtags!<br/><br/>Pull one caption card and two hashtag cards, then you have forty-five seconds to draw a picture inspired by the combination. When the time is up, each player votes on which illustration they find the most outrageously funny and grant the artist a LIKE token. You don't have to be a pro artist to steal the round -- in fact, the less practiced illustrators often end up with the funniest result! The player with the most LIKE tokens after four rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The system focuses on combined arms, combat effects can vary depending on the units in a stack (also called a force). Units feature both a Primary Combat Value and a Secondary Combat Value representing different types of arms/weapons available to units, and advanced rules are available to further simulate radio issues with command and control.<br/><br/>Forces are activated by chit pull, activating whole divisions at a time. Each unit is allowed two basic actions or one special action. The sequence of play is unstructured, allowing movement, assaults, fire-combat and planned assaults to occur as chaotically as they did historically. Unit types range from armor, infantry, artillery, anti-tank/air, engineer, and motorized units. Units can be placed in Overwatch status allowing them to engage in Opportunity Fire using their Primary Combat Value.<br/><br/>Each day turn is approximately 2 hours while night turns are 4 hours for a total of 20 turns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Like UNO, the object of DOS is to be the first player each round to get rid of all your cards and earn points for the cards left in your opponents' hands.<br/><br/>DOS Express offers all the fun of DOS but with a faster gameplay, allowing players to finish rounds more quickly! The smaller deck makes this version of DOS portable and easy to bring along while on-the-go.<br/><br/>On your turn you can play cards from your hand by matching their numbers to any of the face up cards in the center row. You can play one match for each card in the center row. You can also combine two cards from your hand that add up to the number you wish to match. If the card(s) you played match both number and color, you earn the right to place extra cards from your hand in the center row and even force other players to draw cards. Don't forget to yell &quot;Dos!&quot; whenever you have two cards in your hand or you could end up drawing more cards!<br/><br/>The round ends when one player gets rid of all his cards. That player earns points based on the values of the cards left in the other players' hands. Continue playing in rounds until someone reaches 200 points. That player is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an unusual two-player strategy game.  The board consists of five columns, within each of which a &quot;man&quot; moves back and forth.  The men are moved by both players.  At the ends of each column are the players' goals (one end belongs to one player, the other end to his opponent).  Each player tries to reach his goals by exact count, scoring a point every time this is achieved.  First player to reach 15 points wins.<br/>   The spaces within the columns are numbered in seemingly random fashion, except for the centre row, which is all numbered 4.  The game starts with all men in the centre.  One player calls out a number from 1 to 5.  His opponent then moves a man that number of spaces in either direction (no back-and-forthing allowed).  The number on the space onto which the man lands gives the move for the next man --and this mechanism applies throughout the game, so the only random element is the initial call of 1 to 5.<br/>   Each player moves three different men, then his opponent does the same (the first man he moves cannot be the last one you moved), and so on.  Every time a man reaches a goal (by exact count), a point is scored and the man teleports back to the centre.  To complicate matters slightly, there are two &quot;safe spaces&quot; in each column, those on one side of the centre belonging to one player, those on the other to his opponent.  A player may not move more than two men onto safe spaces at once.  You cannot move a man from your opponent's safe spaces, so this is used to constrain the opponent's possible moves.<br/>   A software version of this would be very interesting, particularly if the board could be randomised...<br/><br/>",

Provide your own dice.<br/><br/>Set in the Caribbean in the 17th century, the game can be played on two levels and in two ways, making four different games in all.  You can play it simply as a two-player ship-to-ship combat game, using either basic or advanced combat rules.  The advanced rules use a system reminiscent of Ace of Aces to track your opponent's sailing ship (and the wind) relative to your ship.  The basic game is much simpler, just keeping track of your hull points, guns, sails, and boarders.  (Boarding rules are similar to Battle Chips from Tim's Games.)<br/><br/>The campaign game can be played by four players - more if you photocopy player mats and don't mind people doubling up on roles.  With four, each person takes one of four roles: pirate, British privateer, merchant, Spanish galleoneer.  Each has different goals to win the game.  There is a simple map of the Caribbean with six ports (some British, some Spanish, some neutral, some cities, some towns, some villages) and two different sea zones.  You simultaneously select your destinations and reveal (you can't go directly from port to port - you must first go to one of the sea zones).  If you're in the same area as another player, there may be combat - use either basic or advanced ship-to-ship combat as described above.  Once that's resolved, roll on the encounter tables, modifying the result depending on if a port is hostile or friendly or neutral to you.  After resolving events and encounters on the tables, you may trade if in port.<br/><br/>Goals involve varying quantities booty, supplies, medals and legends.

Each Play card would have 2 functions. The first is to use it as an action, and the second is to use it for scoring. Players need to choose a player to be the first Host. Every player needs to give one card faced down to the Host. The Host player would then decide which cards to give back to each player, faced down again. These cards would then become Trace cards to be used for scoring. In a clockwise order, starting from the Host player, everyone would have 2 chances to perform different actions by using Play cards from their hand. Play cards can either investigate or alter the Trace cards on the field. After 2 Action rounds, players need to decide to either take or give up their Trace card. Since there are positive and negative Scores, players should make their decisions wisely. The next player would then become the new Host and starts a new round. The game ends when any player collects 10 or more Orbs. Everyone then needs to reveal their Role and determine which team is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Where the original comes with 106 cards, this try-out comes with 48 cards.<br/><br/>In Absacker, everyone's trying to grab as much as they can &mdash; but you need to close the deal to get the goods.<br/><br/>To set up, deal the deck out to all players, with each player creating a personal draw deck, then drawing three cards for a hand. The deck consists of cards numbered 3-7. On a turn, a player lays down 1-3 cards in the center of the table, creating a pile for each number played or adding to an existing pile for that number, so the 3s go on a three pile, the 4s on a four pile, etc. When you play the third 3, the fourth 4, the fifth 5, etc., you take all the cards of that number from the table and place them in a score pile. At the end of your turn, you refill your hand to three cards.<br/><br/>When one player has no cards remaining in his draw deck and in his hand, the game ends, and whoever has collected the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple dice game that requires 6 dice and a way to keep score. The goal is to score as few points as possible, while also attempting to knock the player to your left out of the game.<br/><br/>The player takes the 6 dice and rolls them with the objective of getting a total of 30 or more showing on the dice. After each roll the player must set aside one or more dice. The player's turn continues until all 6 dice have been set aside, and then the face value is added up to determine the total for that player.<br/><br/>If a total value of 30 is achieved, the player scores 0 points. If the total is LESS than 30, the player scores the difference in points (a roll of 26 would score the player 4 points). If the total is MORE than 30, the player takes all 6 dice and rolls again. Every die that shows their total - 30 is set aside and they continue rolling until they do not roll any more of that number or all 6 dice have been set aside. The player to the left then gains points equal to the total shown on the set aside dice.<br/><br/>Example: Player A's original roll totals 32. Player A rolls all 6 dice and gets one 2. That die is set aside and the remaining 5 dice are rolled. This time there are two more 2s. Those two dice are set aside and the remaining 3 dice are rolled. No more 2s are rolled so Player A stops. The player to Player A's left gains 6 points for the three 2s that were rolled.<br/><br/>The dice are then passed to the left and play continues.<br/><br/>Once a player scores 30 or more points, that player is eliminated from the game. The game ends when only one player remains and that player is the winner.<br/><br/>For a shorter game without player elimination, the game can be played until the first player scores above 30. When that happens, the player with the fewest points is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Individual board squares may be colored to match one player&rsquo;s color, or in a neutral color. The color of the landing site indicates which player (whether or not that is the active player) places one floor of a new building at this square.<br/><br/>The active player must then pay points to owners of all buildings over which the Helicopter has just flown. The pay rate is based on the total floor count for each color involved, and escalates steeply with increased floor count.<br/><br/>Turn ends with one additional floor of the appropriate color being added to each building flown over.<br/><br/>Some players may be eliminated early when unable to pay.  Game ends when one player cannot move (cannot reach an empty square), or when one player has no more floors to place.  Player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The experts sent out has built six home bases to explore the planet and its resources.<br/><br/>By mistake one expedition takes with it the complete set of ignition keys to the space rockets on the planet. Without these keys the rockets cannot be started and thus it is not possible to leave the planet. The expedition is closely monitored by all bases, but what must not happen still happens - the expedition vanishes without a trace!<br/><br/>As a player you must form a rescue team and be the one to find the missing keys.<br/>(Translated from the Swedish rules text)<br/><br/>Each player puts together a rescue team that braves the dangerous planet surface in order to move to the six scattered key sites of a lost expedition carrying the keys to all the rockets used to leave the planet. When you have found one of the three pairs of matching keys, return to any home base and point out the two identical key counters to win the game.<br/><br/>For your expedition you may choose 4 different members. You can choose between a captain, a doctor (who may heal wounded members), a technician (who may repair the terrain car), a zoologist, a geologist, and up to three soldiers (who collect food). Bringing along a varied team increases the chance your expedition contains a member with a chance of overcoming/avoiding the various hazards (terrains and events) you encounter on the planet.<br/><br/>Each turn you may you do one of the following:<br/>- Move <br/>- Hunt for provisions (only if there's at least one living soldier in your expedition)<br/>- Repair the car (only if you brought along a technician and he/she is still alive)<br/>- Perform surgery on a wounded expedition member (only if you brought along a doctor and he/she is still alive)<br/><br/><br/>     If you choose to move (drive the car), draw an event card. <br/>     If you move into difficult terrain, stop, and draw a terrain card. <br/>     Each turn, roll a die. If you roll 1-3, one piece of Provisions have been used up.<br/><br/><br/>Terrain and event cards generally contain hazards that are bad for you: your car takes damage, a member of your expedition becomes wounded, you lose one turn, etc. Most cards specify one or two types of crew that is given a chance of negating the effects, should your expedition contain it.<br/><br/>Event cards can also mean you found scattered objects from the missing expedition. Collect enough and you are given a chance to look at and memorize one of the six key counters regardless of where your expedition is.<br/><br/>The game only exists in Swedish. Ok&auml;nd planet = Unknown planet. Publishing year was 1984.<br/><br/>",

Players are of three average, good, exceptional and cost different amounts of money to &quot;hire&quot;. <br/>Money can either be a fixed amount in pick up games, or using the advanced economy rules, can be obtained from running concessions and selling broadcasting rights.<br/><br/>The dual-fold, multi-color game board folds for easy storage. Each comes with three teams of ten sculptured ABS figurines, each with individually stenciled numbers. A designated hitter is included on each team. Since the whole family can play BIG BUCKS BASEBALL, one set of figurines is female.<br/><br/>The game also includes 3 special challenging dice, 32 player upgrade snap rings, 12 ball/strike markers, 10 concession/broadcast replicas, 2 miniature game baseballs, 90 pieces of currency, 32 special event cards, 2 reproducible score sheets, and a complete instruction booklet and quick start guide. All of this is packaged in a compact 10-inch by 10-inch durable game box.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique system of roulette type spinner based on batter and pitcher's experience (3 levels) to determine the outcome of each pitch. Once a pitch is hit the defensive team can still field the ball using a system of color coded dice. Careful through, failing the fielding roll will increase the effectiveness of the hit (error). Also there are event cards such as injuries and automatic player upgrades (having a good night) which influence the game randomly.  <br/><br/><br/>",

The price of half of the fishing commodities are known and the other half hidden at all times. Navigation out to the fishing grounds is done by rolling a die. In addition, there are wind currents to speed up movement and shallows and rocks to avoid. The paths closer to the rocks are riskier, but generally faster. A collision with rocks causes a shipwreck and the loss of your catch.<br/><br/>The first person to reach the agreed-upon amount of money (through selling fish at market) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The kids have been placed on the planet TerraTopia and have to each find their colored stone before the planet's three moons meet (or something along those lines).  The players can choose to travel around the board together or separately.<br/><br/>The game was designed by Peter Olotka, one of the Eon Products team, and his son Greg.  The game definitely shows some of the Eon originality in the mechanics.  The players have to recover their stones by overcoming challenges at various locations on the board.  There are a large number of possible challenges, generated by randomly placing generic challenge markers (e.g., &quot;Fog&quot;) at the various locations and having a booklet which describes exactly what Fog means at each location.  The players have to be able to explain to each other how they would use their character's &quot;powers&quot; (shape-changing and normal talents) to overcome the challenges.<br/><br/>",

Its theme is based on life in the notorious Andersonville prison camp that operated in Georgia during the American Civil War. Originally designed to hold 10,000 men, the 26 acre camp would end up holding 33,000 prisoners during its busiest month of operation. Between the months of February 1864 and April 1865, 13,000 Union prisoners died there.<br/><br/>The object of Andersonville is to finish with the most Survival points. To achieve this end, players will need to use strategy, bluff, and some diplomacy.&quot;<br/><br/>Panzerschreck Magazine, Issue 7, Winter 2001-02.<br/>This card game has four Player Card decks (numbered 1-10) and a 46 numbered Action cards, Survival chits, and Health markers.

A player cannot win by concentrating on one phase of the game and neglecting the other. While advancing on an opponent's goal, he must also protect his goal. A player should be particularly aware of the position of both his and his opponent's backs at all times. They are the &quot;power men.&quot; Their versatility provides the offensive thrust of the game, and the need for good defensive planning.&quot;<br/><br/>Basically, this is a game of Chess with football players.<br/><br/>",

The game questions were written by parents, and the answers were selected entirely by 8-14 year old children at the San Francisco School in San Francisco, CA. Everyone will have fun trying to guess how kids would behave if they were in charge. It&rsquo;s a great way for parents and children to bond, understand one another, and discuss the myriad of issues that they will both face as the youngsters grow from kids to adults. (The kids&rsquo; answer, by the way, is to make the son wear a scarf or tie that matches the hair!) Game comes with 216 question cards, 4 playing pieces, game board, and instructions.<br/><br/>",

There are no straights, flushes, or full houses, only a specified card and the number of copies of that card in the hand.  Each player is dealt the same number of cards (1 - 7).  Players then bid on the combined hands of all players.  A player that bids seven kings is betting that there will be seven or more kings total in everyone's hands.  To bid, each player must bid either a higher number of matching cards, or the same number of a higher ranked cards.  (So, to overbid seven kings, bid seven aces, or eight or more of anything.)  When players think someone has bid more than the cards will support, they call &quot;liar&quot;.  Once everyone around the table has called &quot;liar&quot; rather than keep bidding, the cards are shown.  If someone is called a liar, but the cards prove him right, he wins the pot of chips accumulated during the bidding.  If he loses, the chips remain in the pot for the next hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the instructions:<br/><br/>&quot;Concept:<br/><br/>Life is a cycle of paychecks, bills and taxes that make it seem almost impossible to 'get ahead.'  It has even been said that there are only two certainties in life...death and taxes.  Today, of course, there is a third certainty...INFLATION!!<br/><br/>LIFE IS RUFF is about the cycle of income vs. outgo.  As in reality, the proper investments can help you beat inflation and ride the waves of a fluctuating economy.  In somewhat simplified terms, LIFE IS RUFF offers the player the same investment opportunities he has in real life and gives each player the opportunity to make investment decisions.  But any opportunity not taken may be lost, for inflation hits when you least expect it.<br/><br/>There are those who will gamble, who will feel lucky, who will try to beat the odds and make a killing.  For those we have included the stock exchange and futures market.  There is a fortune to be made there, or lost.  A player may choose to speculate in real estate, buy a home to get a tax break or keep his assets liquid by renting.  All of these choices, and more, are yours and after all LIFE IS RUFF is only a game...or is it?<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:<br/><br/>Each player attempts to obtain a survival package of items that have intrinsic value and are counter-cyclical to inflation.  (Their value rises with inflation instead of declining.)  Players, of course, must have cash to purchase these items (gold, silver, food storage, collectibles, diamonds, property) and the purchasing power of the dollar declines as the game progresses causing prices to &quot;rise.&quot;  The player who has the greatest number of survival assets (points) when RUNAWAY INFLATION strikes (making paper money worthless) is the best prepared and is the WINNER.&quot;<br/><br/>",

No dice are involved - movement and combat is decided by cards held by the players. The interesting part is in deciding when and where to play specific cards.<br/><br/>In addition to the various siege weapons, the players must contend with dwindling water supplies and disease. The game provided an interesting insight into the mechanics and psychology of siege warfare, while remaining an easy to learn, and fast paced game.<br/><br/>The game actually contains two separate versions of the game - a quick and easy version for younger players, together with the full-length version.<br/><br/>",

The game uses a spinner shaped to look like a television camera. On your turn, you spin the spinner and advance the number of spaces indicated. If you land on a competition space, you draw a card that tells you what score you received for that event. When you have cards from all the competitions, you place your contestant piece on one of the 3 Semi-Final spaces and start a new contestant. It is possible for a player to have 0, 1, 2 or 3 contestants in the Semi-Final judging. When all 3 Semi-Finalist spaces are filled, the player with the highest point score moves her contestant to a Finalist space. A new round is then played and so on until all 5 Finalist spaces are filled around the base of the camera. The spinner is then spun and the contestant in front of the camera pointer is named 4th runner up and removed. This process is repeated eliminating 1 contestant at a time. The remaining contestant is named Miss America, and the player who controls her wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was published in Finland at the dawn of information technology to show people what it was all about. The game board shows what would have then been a state-of-the art computer room; an input to the left, ie. card readers where the players start from, with lines running via disk storage to the central processor, from which data is sent to the matrix printers at the output on the right. In the middle, as flavour graphic, the operator is inserting a reel of magnetic tape into a magnetic tape data storage unit. The idea is to get your 'program' (set of pawns of the same colour) from your punch card reader through the CPU and into the printers, preferably your own as it nets more points - but pawns may end up in other people's printers too, giving them points, and being the one who ends the game by getting all of their pawns into the printers gives a good bonus too. A 'random colour generator' (turning disc built into the game board) at the CPU tends to mess things up however, as it may send the player on a loop (which the second part of the name of the game, 'luuppi', refers to) within the CPU, or to an opponent's printer. Winner is the player with most points from all parts of their program at game end.<br/><br/>(The 'Mini' in the name of the game presumably refers to a minicomputer, which was the next step up from the single-user microcomputer just becoming available to the public; large operators such as banks and government agencies would own their own mini-computer to which various users would connect via terminals, using 'computing time' allocated to them.)<br/><br/>",

Players interact in both Earth Life and in the Spirit World and are eventually judged and assigned to a degree of glory. The game was created by Kathryn Matthews over a period of 12 years.  Her son, Jonathan, suffered from kidney failure at a young age which prompted her to donate her own kidney to him.  Over the following ten years, Jonathan suffered deteriorating health and required constant tending until his death in 1999.  It was during this difficult time that Kathryn found comfort in learning the doctrines of the Plan of Salvation and spending time creating a learning activity that teaches about the joy it brings.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each Character starts off with items that have different strengths and weaknesses. You must use your items to your advantage in knowing who to attack and who not to attack when and where. This is a game of strategy and the player who is experienced will have a definite advantage over a beginner. It was made so that luck is not as important as skill and strategy. You can bribe the different people in the game to attack your opponents and take their items from them. You may battle opponents when you land on the same square as them deciding which items to use in each different situation. You may warp to different areas of the board using the tunnel either to attack an opponent or strategically move into a position which is more beneficial. Receive money when passing the Castle to be able to buy items when you land on the store squares. Pick up Destainia cards and follow the instructions of the card which may be to your advantage or to your peril. The object of the game is to move along the board purchasing different items from stores along the way. Each item you buy has points, and once you have achieved enough points you will be able to challenge and defeat the Sorcerer. Instead of like other games where you have to be the last player alive, this is a race to the finish where everyone is trying to defeat the Sorcerer and claim the Medallion. The action is fast paced and there is never a dull moment. Destainia the game includes 100% cotton canvas material for the board, 6 different color pawns, 2 dice, 60 plastic coins, a drawstring pouch, instructions, 143 playing cards, and a convenient clear plastic tube to put everything in, which is easy to store.<br/><br/>Home Page:  <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.destainia.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.destainia.com</a><br/><br/>",

The counters representing the animals are spread across the board, face down. Each player gets the cards for five animals and the first to collect their set and get back to the zoo wins the game. There is an educational aspect as each card carries information about the animal depicted and the game is aimed at children and families.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.goingunderground.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.goingunderground.co.uk/</a><br/><br/>",

The rent increases if the business has one or more retail outlets or an office tower.<br/><br/>It will be helpful to compare this game to it's cousin, Monopoly; <br/>- there is no element of bidding for un-purchased properties, although players are encouraged to &quot;make your own deals!&quot; <br/>- Money paid for Socks or Bonds cards is put in the centre as a jackpot for landing on the Free Parking square<br/>- On rolling doubles, a player may move the the token the sum of both dice, or double that amount.  The player does not get to roll again after rolling doubles.<br/>- There is no payment for passing Go on each lap of the board, so financial resources are more limited.<br/>- Players pay $100 to get out of Court (Jail).<br/>- The game ends when one player becomes bankrupt.<br/><br/>The game is very commercial.  The board and the Stocks and Bonds cards read like advertisements for local businesses. They often include real world addresses and phone numbers.  There are two Coupon cards included with the Stocks and Bonds cards that appear to be intended for use as real-world coupons at those businesses.<br/><br/>",

Each point along the track is a hole. Some holes are bigger than others. The playing pieces are circular, like a ball.<br/><br/>One player is a cat, the others are mice. Everyone moves along the track by a die roll. The mice must escape from the cat player who has a big advantage. If a mouse player lands on one of the bigger holes then it will fall through the hole and out of the game. The cat playing ball is too large to fall through a hole so he doesn't mind which space he lands on.<br/><br/>The cat wins if all the mice are caught or the mouse who gets to the end of the track first, wins<br/><br/>",

Only a player who reacts quickly and keeps his nerves can win the game.<br/><br/>The game includes a board (two-sided) with an obstacle course and a shortcut, three team members per player, a die, and a timer. The timer gets started, and the active player tries to race his pieces along the track. He rolls the die, moves one of his characters the full amount, rolls the die again, moves the same or a different character, and so on until the time runs out. Then the next player gets to act.<br/><br/>The track depicts barrels which act as obstacles; no player can land on such a space. The characters of other players are either treated as obstacles, or moved back to the next free spot if somebody lands on their space. The finish space needs to be reached with an exact die roll. The player who first finishes the race first with all his characters wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to move the ball counter into your opponents' goal and thus score. The ball can only be moved along the lines drawn on the playing board. This is achieved by winning tricks as per normal whist. However, trumps are chosen by the starting player who moves the ball onto a team's badge (which become trumps) on the playing board. The winner of the trick may move the ball one space. If the trick is won by leading with a trump, 2 spaces may be moved. When a goal is scored, the ball is returned to the centre spot and the player to the left of the scorer starts. The game ends when the cards are exhausted twice, once for half time and again for the end of the match.<br/><br/>",

Players start with 4 seeds in each pit and own the pits on the player's side of the board but this is one of the rare manqala games in which pieces are distinguishable, i.e., one player starts with white seeds and the other black. Sowing is anticlockwise starting in the pit adjacent to the starting pit and sowing one seed in each pit until the last seed is sown, without restriction on laps and sowing in the original pit if a sufficient number of seeds are in the original pit. Captures occur when the last seed is sown in an empty pit. That last seed and all seeds in the pits opposite it are captured. The winner is the player to capture more of the opponent's seeds and play continues until no more moves are possible.<br/><br/>",

Also, it is a word-play as the German word &quot;Harz&quot; means &quot;resin&quot; and this is were the card comes into play. Here is the card's text:<br/><br/>&quot;Wer einmal in die Harzfalle tappt, kommt kaum noch vom Fleck. Harz klebt sofort vier beliebige Gegner zusammen, die in dieser Runde nicht mehr weiter gespielt werden k&ouml;nnen.&quot;<br/><br/>This translates roughly into:<br/><br/>Whoever falls just once into the resin(Harz)-trap makes hardly any headway. Harz immediately sticks together any four enemies, who cannot be played any further this turn.<br/><br/>The two cards Harz IV cards you get are simply shuffled into your standard card deck.

        "description": "The Game consists of 3 games: The Steamboatgame (Het Stoombootspel), The Giftgame (Het Pakjesspel) and The Memoryvariant.<br/><br/>All games are based on a dutch special-day: Sinterklaas. This is the dutch version of SantaClaus and is celebrated on december 5th each year.<br/><br/>In The Steambootgame players use there playingfigure to collect presents from the hold of the ship on the gameboard. They do no know the value of the present they took.Via stairs and rooms of 3 different colors they attempt to bring them to the deck, to secure them. To do so, they throw a dice with the 3 different colors on it. A player must stop in a room of that color. When 2 players are in the same room, they have to switch presents. Two special actions which are in some rooms give players the chance to look at another players present, or his own, or to catch up with another player who is at max two stories higher in the ship. If all presents are on the deck, the player with the highest value of presents wins the game!<br/><br/>In The Giftgame players buy a few small presents upfront. They agree on the amount of money to be spent. You can also use the chips in the game and play for points.In this game also the colordice is used to decide to what field on the gameboard the player moves his playingfigure to. On each field is a different symbol, each giving a different action. The possible actions are: Take a present, switch presents and open them up, give present away to the player with the fewest presents, all presents in front of the players are passed to your neighbour in a clockwise fasion. and finally open up a present. When there are no more presents in the pile, the game ends. When playing with chips in stead of real presents, the game ends as soon as the last chip is taken from the supply. The player with the most points wins!~<br/><br/>The Memoryvariant is just another memory: There are 2 pairs of 12 different colored-and-valued chips. Turn them up-side-down so the sack is showing, shuffle them, and try to find the matching pairs as in regular memory. The player witrh the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

The first player to do so wins the round and scores points based on the symbol matched, the guards lost and the opponents guards eliminated. As pairs of symbols need capturing, if an any time a player has only one guard left they are eliminated - leading to a secondary win condition.<br/><br/>In each turn a player moves two guards eliminating (jumping over and removing) any opponets within reach. Chi symbols can only be occupied if capturing is not possible. There are 6 games, but as the rules (and aim) for each are identicle these seem to be more like variants rather than fully fledged games.<br/>Due to the mechanic of capturing these games play similar to checkers but the Chi matching alters the strategy quite well.<br/><br/>The six games are called: Tae Kwon Do (2 Players - Front Board), Aikido (4 Players - Back Board), Kung-Fu (4 Players - Front Board), Karate (2 Players - Back Board), Judo (2 Players - Front Board) and Jujitsu (2 Players - Back Board).<br/><br/>The theme of the game is martial arts, however this is not crutial and seems tacked on. The identical game would work, for example, with a space theme or a roman warrior theme. As with all abstracts the theme is not that important.<br/><br/>",

Features 'boasting' - a push-your-luck mechanic.<br/><br/>Each round, an auction is held for the right to be 'big fish', who will have a better hand and should win more tricks than any little fish. Unlike other card games, you bid points of your score - being a big fish carries a greater element of risk, since you need to regain at least the points you just lost in the auction.<br/><br/>A game lasts around 4-6 rounds, decided in advance. For 2 players, 4 rounds are recommended.<br/><br/>summary of a round:<br/>- DEAL 6 cards to each player. Deal out a face-up 'dummy hand' of 6 cards.<br/><br/>- Have an AUCTION for the right to be big fish. The winning bid is deducted from the big fish's score.<br/><br/>- BIG FISH declares the trump suit, then exchanges any number of cards from their hand with cards from the extra hand.<br/><br/>- Each player BOASTS how many tricks they will win.<br/><br/>- Starting with Big Fish, PLAY out the 6 tricks. There is no need to follow suit and the first-played suit has no special significance.<br/><br/>- Players who took fewer tricks than their boast win nothing.

Most of these categories require the players to explain or tell something with a handicap, such as letting your tongue hang out while you pronounce a difficult word and such, forming a sentence which contains the same word twice in a row, etc.<br/>For each fulfilled task, the team moves up ten percent on a kind of &quot;fun indicator&quot; (Stimmungsbarometer in German). At certain intervals, a &quot;fitness test&quot; is required before the team's pawn can move on to the next sector on the game board or eventually cross the finish line to win the game.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

The rules aren't extensive, but wide enough to cover many nuances of intense fighting in the Star Era. There are two ways of shooting: real and virtual. Some weapons actually launch plastic missiles. Virtual firing is resolved using dice rolls. The rules contain corresponding chapters if players wish to switch from one firing way to another. Warriors, cannons and fighting machines are snap together kits requiring no glue for assembly.<br/><br/>From the official rules of the game:<br/><br/>ARMORED INFANTRY is a sci-fi game that can be played by several players at the same time, each with their own army. To win, it is necessary to defeat the enemy army or complete some task - a mission. Missions can be very different, for example, to capture an object, destroy an enemy command vehicle, hold a line, etc.<br/><br/>Player armies consist of squads of armored infantry, manned combat vehicles, and artillery pieces. Their game parameters are indicated in special &quot;documents&quot; - Army Lists.<br/><br/>Each vehicle or squad of infantrymen is a separate unit. During the battle, players take turns operating their units &ndash; moving them, shooting at the enemy, or engaging the enemy in close combat. When one unit has finished its actions, i.e. has completed its turn, it is time for the next unit's turn, and so on. Each unit can only make one turn per round, so when all units have made one turn, a new round begins. At the beginning of each round, the players play the initiative, i.e. determine who will go first, who will go second, etc. If all soldiers - infantrymen and machine pilots - in the player's army are destroyed, then he is out of the game. The rest of the participants continue the battle without him. Thus, round after round, the battle continues until one of the players wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tournament Joust is a 2 to 8 player board game depicting heroic Knight&rsquo;s jousting in tournaments during the Middle Ages.  The game can be played as a single day tournament or as a campaign with multiple Knights competing in different cities across England, finally leading up to the world championship.<br/>The Basic Game &ndash; Players compete against one another in a single day tournament to find out who is the Champion Knight. <br/>The game board consists of the graphical layout of the tournament list as well as each players lance tip location chart, horse movement card locations, Impact and stability charts, Knight reaction card locations, Aim card locations, and random lance tip movement charts.<br/>Winning a match &ndash; Each match consists of three runs or passes, with the winner declared by breaking three lances across the Shield, Helm, or Crest.  An immediate win will be granted by unhorsing your opponent or knocking his crest from his helm.  In the event of a tie, the Knight with the most broken lances or strikes of his lance will win the match. <br/>Winning the Tournament &ndash; The tournament is won by the knight who earns the most points from each match and jousts with honor.  In the event of a tie, the Knight with the most match wins will be the tournament winner. <br/>The game components consists of cards, tokens, markers, jousting figures, a single 10 sided die, a game board and rules.<br/>Setup is relatively quick with minimal effort and game play can take around 30 to 45 minutes per jousting match.<br/>The Advanced Game &ndash; Players compete in a campaign across Europe competing in Grand Tournaments to become the Grand champion.  New rules cover fatigue, endurance, honor, and ransoms.  Plus different skill levels and horse modifiers add taken into account for each joust.  &ldquo;Coming soon&rdquo;<br/>The Solitaire Game &ndash; Rules for solitaire play consist of single player games with random card sequences and lance tip movement changes that pit you against different types of Knight with different levels of expertise.  &ldquo;Coming soon&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Unbuilt raw materials are vulnerable to card-play from other players that may require them to give over unused materials, or may cause a player to return all unused materials to the supply.

        "description": "De Magische Wereld van Pardoes is based upon a popular character of the Dutch theme park 'Efteling' and derived television series of the same name.<br/><br/>The game features a circular board, just like the previous games that have been released in the same series (Joris en de Draak, Raveleijn). In this case 74 spaces divide the starting square from the finishing square with an emerald.<br/><br/>The game is a typical roll-and-move game, combining some different genre elements. Before the game starts, players have to choose 1 of the 4 game's characters. Two of them (Pardoes, Pardijn) represent the heroes in the story depicted, while the two other characters (Rattar, Pantagor) are the villains in this game.<br/><br/>A basic turn consists of rolling 1D6 and moving your character the according number of spaces towards the finish.<br/><br/>The board contains a number 'white twinkles' and 'green lightnings' (4 of each), which work just like S'nakes and Ladders'. The white twinkles work as ladders for the heroes and as snakes for the villains; the green lightnings work the other way around.<br/><br/>The board also contains two sections with spinning arrows. If your move ends on a square in such a section, you spin that section's arrow and move to the square indicated by the arrow.<br/><br/>Other squares let you take an action card (some are to be executed immediately, others can be kept for later in the game) or invoke a duel between you and another player. Each of the duelling secretly chooses 1 card from a set of 3 (water, fire and wood) and reveal this card simultaneously. Water beats fire, fire burns wood and wood floats on water. The winner of the duel   gets a bonus move.<br/><br/>A duel is also fought when a player lands on a square with another player's piece. In this case the winner of the duel gets to stay on the square where as the loser goes backwards the number of squares indicated by 1D6.<br/><br/>",

The player may turn over another card if he/she wants.<br/><br/>A player who doesn't want to turn over another card may end his/her turn and take all the open elven and unicorn cards. But first he/she has to fight a duel with Panthea. With luck, he/she will be able to fight off Panthea's snake lassos. For the duel, the 6 chips are thrown into the air. Then players count how many green and blue symbols can be seen. More blue than green symbols: The player wins the duel. Equal number: If there is an elven card in the middle of the table or in front of the player, he/she can still fend off Panthea. The snake lasso and an elven card are set aside and the player wins the duel and gets to take the cards. More green than blue symbols: The player loses the duel. The open elven, unicorn and snake lasso cards are returned to the card stack, which is then shuffled again and it's the next player's turn.<br/><br/>End of game: The game ends when all six Trumptus cards have been turned over. Players count the points on the cards they have collected. The player with the highest number of points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

As in the real Gladiatorial arenas of old, fighting prowess alone is not all that is required for success. The love and adoration of the crowd is no less important if one seeks to triumph in the arena.<br/><br/>This game is played using Attack, Defense, Style, and special Prowess cards which are all used in their own unique way, and are the tools you will use to be victorious in the arena. Enter The Arena is played in a series of trumps that continue until the game end conditions are met. Every turn you can either go on the Attack or Defend yourself against incoming attacks. Properly gauging your opponents reactions and moves is an important part of the game. Each player is sent into the arena with the same &quot;tools&quot; to defeat the other gladiators. How and when you use them is up to each player as the game develops. Augmenting your attacks or defense with Style cards is another integral part of the gameplay. Gaining the favor of the crowd is another potential way to win the game rather than defeating the other gladiators.<br/><br/>Adding another level of strategy to gameplay are the Prowess Cards.

        "description": "In Circus Divas, a two-player dice-buying game, you play the owner of a Depression-era circus going from town to town parting fools and their money. But in order to do that, you need to hire some help and, ultimately, earn more than the rival circus that keeps hitting the same towns you do and draining your profits.<br/><br/>Each player can hire performers for his or her circus from a common pool. Those performers each allow the player to roll one additional die for profit, from the lowly d4 to the mighty - but unpredictable - d20. But these performers can prove to be real divas. When a performer rolls a 1, he or she throws a diva's tantrum and has to be consoled - or he or she will quit. And if you're consoling one diva, you can't console another if they should have a tantrum, so choose carefully.<br/><br/>The first player to reach $100 in savings wins. Play time takes about 15 minutes and requires at least one d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 to play. Counters for money are also helpful, but pencil and paper could work just fine. Enjoy it, and please let me know what you think!<br/><br/>",

The dice act as accuracy levels while the cards rapidly execute Attacks, Defense, and Special Moves. Each individual character has their own Character Abilities, Tactics, Basic Attacks/Defense and Super moves to change the flow of the game as well.<br/><br/>In Capes and Villains, you are already in the heat of the battle. There are no preparation or equipment phases, no pre-planning or gradual movement into battle. Nope, you are there, getting your cape tightened around your neck or dishing out the pain yourself. Gameplay should seem a bit crazy and even spontaneous at times, but believe us when we say that under the mask is actually a lot of strategy.<br/><br/>Another Alternate gameplay scenario includes multiple players going up against one Super Villain. &quot;Overpower&quot; dice are added to expand on special abilities of a character's Super Villain persona (located on the back of each Character Card) to turn them into a super villain caliber.<br/><br/>",

Combine your cards to score quickly, but beware -- the other side is out to get your points too!<br/><br/>There are 83 cards in the deck. They are numbered 1-10, twice. There are also 2 Re:Versus, 2 Wilds and 2 combo Re:Versus/Wild cards.<br/><br/>Each card has a white half and a black half. The two players (or two teams) each choose a color and draw seven cards. They must then play these cards in sets of three (either three-of-a-kind or a run of three) according to the number that is on the side of their respective color (white or black).<br/><br/>Each turn includes drawing a card, scoring (by laying down a Meld of three cards, as previously explained), and discarding a card. Melds (or sets) are scored by adding their values (e.g. three 2's would be 6 points; a run of 4, 5, 6 would be 15 points). Melds can also be stolen from the other player by setting down the same Meld, but in your color. The opponent's Meld that the active player matched then goes into the active player's hand.<br/><br/>Special cards in the deck allow for &quot;wilds&quot; in the sets as well as the two players switching colors.<br/><br/>A turn ends after the active player has discarded a card.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has scored 100 points.<br/><br/>",

Some players may get an extra card. Cards in players hand are always kept hidden from other players.  Any cards making pairs are laid down in front of players at this time.  Compass cards are not used at this time.<br/><br/>Game Play: The player to the left of the dealer draws one card from the dealers hand.  If a pair is made, the pair is laid down immediately.  The person now offers cards to the player on his/her left.<br/><br/>Compass Cards:  The compass cards are &quot;reverse&quot; cards.  If the person who is about to draw holds a compass card, he/she may place it at the center of the table, and then draw a card from the player on his/her opposite side.  The order of offering cards reverses until another compass card is played.  The game play direction may change up to 3 times as each compass card may only be used once.  If a player draws a compass card from another player, it cannot be used until his/her next turn.  When there are two players, a player may play a reverse card instead of drawing.<br/><br/>",

Produced with permission of Days of Wonder, for non-commercial use only.<br/><br/>Two variants on the traditional game on one board - a race through the stories and a traditional game based on scenes instead of cities. <br/>The race uses Ticket to Ride pieces and principles but the game is to move from the initial falling asleep as far as possible through the stories to the second awakening at the end of the looking glass epic. The winner has the most points.<br/><br/>The Ticket to Ride &quot;normal&quot; fan expansion follows the principles of the basic Ticket to Ride game with an Alice theme (scenes from the stories take tje place of cities). The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop). You can use stations if you wish.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of cards for the scenes, each with a value to be earned by visiting that scene. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn. This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

Each of the 2 players picks a colour with its 44 items: 12 balls and 32 poles.<br/><br/>RULES FOR 2 PLAYERS<br/><br/>The game starts with the player who selects the white items. The player can choose to start with a pole or a ball. Each player plays their turn using only one item at a time: a pole or a ball.<br/>Every piece played must be linked to the pieces played beforehand. As the poles are inserted in the ball holes a three dimensional figure will begin to form. Once an item is placed, no changes or modification can be made.<br/><br/>AIM OF THE GAME<br/>A player wins the game if during their turn they manage to:<br/>&bull; Insert 3 poles more than their opponent in any played ball<br/>or<br/>&bull; place in a straight line 4 balls of the same colour.<br/><br/>Given that each ball has 6 holes and each player wins by placing 3 poles of the same colour more than their opponent the winning possibilities are 3-0 or 4-1. The players build up a three-dimensional network where there are different diagonals (2D or 3D) that allow placing 4 balls of the same colour in line. The game is considered a draw when both players use up their pieces and no player can place 3 poles more than their opponent into a ball or 4 balls of the same colour in line. Positioning and placing the pieces of the game in a clever way is part of the winning strategy.<br/><br/>In order to create a solid structure and to minimise the risk of the structure breaking during the game, we suggest placing the poles firmly in the ball holes.<br/><br/>RULES FOR 4 PLAYERS<br/>The same rules for 2 players apply. Pairs of 2 players start the game with 44 elements each, playing on alternate turns and interposing one player of each couple.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Roll to Control is an entertaining &quot;new classic&quot; board game, where 2-5 players compete to control the most colored zones on the game board.  It was just named &quot;Best of 2015&quot; by Toys Bulletin as one of the &quot;Best games you have never heard of&quot; in a &quot;100% Independent Review&quot;.<br/><br/>The game contents include 360 Scout markers (one set of 72 for each player in 5 different colors) 21 Caprocks, 5 Captain player pieces used to move each player around the perimeter of the board, 2 &ndash; twelve sided multi-colored dice, a game board that measures approximately 19&Prime; x 20&Prime; and a nicely illustrated set of rules.<br/><br/>To play the game, players alternate turns by rolling one die and moving their captain from the space occupied on the perimeter of the game board to the matching color on the perimeter as shown on the die. Once there, there are several options open to the player, depending on the types of figures outlined on the space landed on. If there are one or more hexagons outlined in black, the player can place that many Scouts in the colored zone that matches his die roll. If there is a &quot;half-hexagon&quot; mark on the space, the player can replace any one of the Caprocks, positioned in the colored zone matching the die roll, with one of his/her Scouts.<br/><br/>An optional move that can be made on a player&rsquo;s turn is a challenge, and this can only be done if the space is marked for a challenge, either a regular challenge or a wild challenge. When a player performs a challenge, he chooses another player&rsquo;s Scout which is adjacent to his own Scout in the colored zone that matches his die roll, or in the case of a wild challenge, he may opt to choose an adjacent player&rsquo;s scout in any zone or even one that is in an adjacent colored zone, which greatly expands his choices. But the challenge must originate from the zone color that matches the die roll. To complete a challenge, each player rolls one 12 sided die, and the winner is determined based on a colorwheel that is conveniently located both on the game board and inside a player&rsquo;s storage box. The colors are arranged in a circular pie-chart manner, and the colors, starting at the top of the circle, beat the colors as they are displayed clockwise around the circle, much like the hands of a clock. In other words, the color located at 12 beats the color at 1, and the color at 7 beats the color at 6. The challenge winner replaces the losing Scout with one of his own. Challenges can continue as long as the player who initiated the challenge continues to win.<br/><br/>The last and most exciting part of a player&rsquo;s turn involves a closer look at those C-Traps. There is bit more here than first meets the eye. If at any time during a turn, that player&rsquo;s Scouts form a C shape by surrounding any competing Scouts, regardless of color, all Scouts caught within the C-Trap are replaced by Scouts of the player controlling the C-Trap. In order to complete a C-Trap, there must be a minimum of 4 Scouts to surround 1 competitor Scout. But, as the game progresses, careful placement of Scouts can create gigantic C-Traps and suddenly change the entire face of the game board. Players can easily lose 10 or more Scouts on a single turn. The game ends when all of the hexagons in all of the colored zones are covered by Scouts or Caprocks. The player who controls the most zones out of the 12 colors is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

The bull always goes straight, but when it steps on a tile, the tile is revealed and the bull's new direction is determined. When the bull hits a wall for the second time, it stops moving.<br/><br/>Use the tiles wisely to hit your opponent. A player falls prone and can no longer move once hit and is eliminated when hit for the second time.

        "description": "User summary<br/>Graduation Photo Records (グラデュエーション・フォトレコーズ！) is a photo-placement game by the Japanese publisher TRI Fol:um -Repens-. The game was released for the Game Market 2017 Kobe in Japan.<br/><br/>In this game, you play students about to graduate from high school. They have little time before their graduation to get ready a photo album with memories of their days as student friends.<br/><br/>A tabletop game where your objective is to collect photos of your youth life and create your student yearbook. Gameplay itself is simple: draw a photo, and mount them on the board. Though, each player character has hidden objectives (like which kind of photo they like, or who they are in love with), and since so, their interests should have some conflicts.<br/><br/>There are no special events in the game, but with many beautiful photos in a common Japanese school days settings, the nostalgic atmosphere should be appealing to many.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>You play as one of eight character, and each character has hidden objectives. The deck of photos is like printed photos shot on film, not digital prints. Each turn, you may 'shoot a photo' (draw a photo from the deck and place it face down in front of you), 'develop/print' (turn one of your face-down photos face-up), or 'layout on board' (place your printed photo on the shared album board).<br/><br/>The board doesn't have a grid, you may place the photo anyway you like. You may overlap any previously placed photos with just one restriction: at least one character's face must be fully visible from the underlying photos.<br/><br/>When the 'endgame' photo is drawn (it is loaded somewhere near the bottom of the deck), you tally points based on your hidden objectives.<br/><br/>The gameplay itself has low language dependencies, but the 8 student ID cards (with the face of the character and their hidden objectives) have Japanese on them. The photo itself has some handwritten Japanese scribbles with their character names, and some objectives refer to the other characters by these names (&quot;4pts: have 2 or more photos with Miki at the end&quot;). Therefore, if you cannot read JP letters well, you might struggle to properly recognise the names as they are presented. So the game needs a little more than a crib-sheet or memory, you need to be able to spot these names easily.<br/><br/>Publisher summary<br/>写真を撮影、現像して<br/>隠した想いを達成しつつ<br/>あなた達だけの卒業アルバムを作るボードゲーム<br/>～写真を重ねて創り出す、あなた達だけの卒業アルバム～<br/><br/>■簡単な概要！<br/>①写真を撮影、<br/>②現像して、<br/>③アルバムを編集していく<br/>――というボードゲームです。<br/><br/>各プレイヤーごとに秘めた思惑を達成しつつ、<br/>素敵な卒業アルバムを仕上げましょう！<br/><br/>青春が描かれた写真カードを集めて、思い出の卒業アルバムを作成するボードゲーム。<br/>システムとしては、写真を引いてアルバム台紙に置いていくだけのシンプルな物。<br/>ただ、それぞれが隠し持った点数目標(写真の好みや意中の相手によって差別化されている)に向かって利害関係を作っている。<br/>特別なイベントは無いが、日本の学生が思わず「懐かしい」と思えるような透明感のあるイラストとノスタルジックな世界観が魅力的。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Walk with Me&rdquo; is a Scenario designed for two Survivors (either two players, or one player controlling a Survivor and an Ally).<br/><br/>While the memorable The Walking Dead scene that serves as the inspiration featured Michonne and Andrea on a stealth mission to a downed helicopter while Woodbury rivals and Merle hunt them down, the scenario can be played with almost any two Survivors.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Walk with Me&rdquo; makes heavy use of Rivals.<br/><br/>The event deck is now called Lay Low, during the campaign they were referred to as Walk with Me<br/><br/>&quot;Clear&quot; reunites Rick and Morgan in a battle of sanity while Michonne and Carl retrieve a memento.<br/><br/>In this three-Survivor Scenario, you return to Rick&rsquo;s hometown in search of supplies, trying to grab an important memento while you&rsquo;re at it. When you arrive, you unexpectedly discover another remnant of the past waiting for you: Morgan, Rick&rsquo;s first friend after the apocalypse, who now stalks the streets of the town consumed by madness, driving away Walkers and people alike.<br/><br/>In terms of gameplay, Morgan behaves a lot like a Rival. Each round, after the Survivors have taken their turns, Morgan performs a Reaction based on the Approach type of the Event selected by the Leader.<br/><br/>Normally, when faced with an enemy as dangerous as Morgan, the simplest answer in the cold, harsh world of The Walking Dead would be just to kill him. However, in this Scenario that course of action actually causes you to lose! Your goal is to SAVE Morgan, pulling him out of the dark pit into which he has fallen. If you can get through to him, there may be a way to bring back the good man that still lies buried in his heart.<br/><br/>You can save Morgan through Coordinate Actions. In &ldquo;Clear,&rdquo; whenever a Survivor near Morgan uses any Coordinate Action (whether it&rsquo;s the standard Assist Action, or a Special Action like&ldquo;Inspire&rdquo; from Rick's &ldquo;Born Leader&rdquo; Survivor Card), there are two extra success effects he or she can choose from. The first lets the Survivor reveal the top card of the Clarity deck, and discard it if he or she wishes. This gives the Survivors a chance to either gain some insight into what Morgan will do next and adjust their plans accordingly, or to bypass something particularly dangerous altogether.<br/><br/>Clear Cards represent Morgan&rsquo;s more lucid moments and are basically &ldquo;safe&rdquo; cards when drawn from the Clarity deck, since&mdash;unlike the Hostile Cards&mdash;they have no instructions for Morgan to perform. While no Clear Cards start in the deck at first, more and more can be added over time, as Morgan begins to listen to reason. These cards not only help make Morgan more manageable during each cycle through the Clarity deck, but also happen to be the goal of the Scenario. While the Survivors won&rsquo;t be able to bring Morgan completely back, once all five Clear Cards have been moved to the Clarity deck, Morgan will be well enough for the Survivors to leave him and head home.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>- double sided map tile<br/>- 20 event cards<br/>- Morgan clarity deck<br/>- Merle rival board<br/>- rival board<br/><br/>(from Kickstarter page)<br/><br/>",

One die determines how many spaces you can move, and the other die determines how many spaces you must move the Malfoy figure. To win the game you must first collect the Gringotts Token, then you must collect each of the other five tokens by visiting the various stores on the map. If you land on a space with Malfoy, or he lands on the space where you are standing, you lose the token you most recently acquired. The first player to collect all six tokens and return to the &quot;Leaky Cauldron&quot; spot wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and your cohorts of crime have just pulled off the most successful bank heist of the century, including the theft of one of the world's most valuable diamonds. You must lay low for a week and guard your take; there's no honor amongst thieves here, and everyone wants the most they can get. Plus, rumors are there's a snake in your midst that might be out to get the prize jewel for themselves, and a rat could be trying to foil the whole operation.<br/><br/>Each player will be dealt a random crew card to tell you what your part in this band of thieves is. These are not hidden from other players, since teamwork is dreamwork, after all. Each person brings their own unique talent, or specialty, to the crew, usable throughout the game. You will also be given a random role card, possibly giving you a secret double agent part to play. These should not be shared and will affect how you can win the game. There are four regular crew member cards, one snake card, and one rat card. As with any squad, the more people you bring in, the likelier it is to have defectors.<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of seven rounds, or days. Every day will begin with players taking turns to choose their actions for the day by placing a token on the box next to the action of their choice. For morning actions, you will use the numbers on your crew cards to determine turn order. After that, turn order is based on the last round's actions going from top to bottom on the action card in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Your goal, as the thief you are, is to hoodwink your way through the week, exchanging loot with players and the score to end up with the best take for yourself. Don't get too greedy, though! If you end up with more than the score, your zealousness will be shown, and the crew will take you out. The prized diamond is also supposed to be shared, so any crew  member holding it at the end will mark you for an early demise, as well. Additionally, the bank loaded a tracker into the loot that will get you caught and disqualified if you're holding it at the end.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Sightseeing board game presents Budapest to the preschool and primary school age group on four large boards. It is the smallest of the four games of different difficulty and theme, and those who can already read will find it age-appropriate. The game guides both Budapesters and non-Budapesters through the capital.<br/><br/>The Br&uacute;n&oacute; in Budapest board game contains 4 different games that are related to the book series Br&uacute;n&oacute; in Budapest.<br/><br/>The rules are simple and easy to follow in all 4 games and can be played in an average of 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>Simplified, Erika Bartos's drawings introduce children to Budapest's famous buildings and public spaces in a perfectly recognizable way. The game is also suitable for children who like transport and means of transport.<br/><br/>The cube-based vehicle game is easy even for the little ones: the winner is the first to collect the six vehicles.<br/><br/>The second board is a classic party, where the winner will be the first to get from Vajdahunyad Castle to the Elizabeth Lookout Tower.<br/><br/>In the third game, we have to go around the border of the capital, and the surrounding settlements and the building drawings on the map and the numbers and boundaries of the districts help to get to know our capital.<br/><br/>The fourth answer table builds on the knowledge of Budapest.<br/><br/>The game is recommended for 3-10 year olds. It can be played by 2 to 8 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tables-Tastic is a fun family maths game for children aged 6+ that will help children learn their multiplication tables up to 12 x 12 without even realising they are learning.<br/><br/>Players start with a hand of seven cards each and the aim of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards. Each turn starts with the player rolling two dice, giving a number between 2 and 12, and they can play if they have a card in their hand in the correct times table.<br/><br/>Special rules if you roll a 7, 11 or a double add an extra layer of both strategy and luck. Feedback from customers is that the children are so engrossed in trying to work out whether they can play that they don't realise they are learning maths by stealth.<br/><br/>All packs come with &quot;times table checker cards&quot; for children (or adults) who are less confident with their times tables. The game can also be played solo for extra practice.<br/><br/>",
