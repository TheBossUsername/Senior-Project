        "description": "While many of the electronic sports board games from EDC shared a common board and used overlays to portray different sports, Computamatic Tennis is a unique game. It relies on a large array of 24 light bulbs under a translucent board depicting a tennis court. The game is battery operated.<br/><br/>Players sit at opposite ends of the board where they have a series of buttons they use to enter actions. Each player's set of buttons is divided into four categories (each with four buttons): Receive Volley, Return Volley, Receive Serve, and Serve Left/Right. The combination of buttons pressed by the players serves to illuminate the lights under the board to show the result of the serve or volley. Tracking of games, sets, and matches is handled manually by the players using tracks on the board.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is based on a Quartett type card game but extended by a quiz.<br/><br/>Each player draws 4 cards from the stack.<br/>The youngest player starts the game (active player) and asks any other player if he holds a card needed to complete a set of four. The enquiring player must always have at least one of the set in their hand before asking.<br/><br/>Unlike a normal Quartett game, the player asked does not automatically surrender the card in question he might hold, but has to ask one of the questions noted on the card. Only if the active player supplies the correct answer to the quiz question the card is surrendered. The player who was successful may continue to ask the one who has surrendered a card for a further card. The moment that player cannot supply the wanted card or any of his quiz questions isn't answered correctly, he becomes the one to ask any player for a card. Whenever a quiz question is answered wrong the asked player draws a card.<br/><br/>If a completed Four is obtained, the successful player should lay it on the table and that set is now safe. This continues round the table until all the sets are laid down and the player has tabled the largest number of four, wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The 2-to-6 players win by dominating the other kingdoms and earning the seat of Emperor, either by building a military hegemony or a powerful merchant empire. Both paths to success require careful planning, resource management and cunning strategy.<br/><br/>You will take the reins of one of the six Star Kingdoms that are part of the fallen Empire, ruled by the leaders that have the best claim to the throne after the late Emperor&rsquo;s demise: The Duchess, The Princess, The Marquis, The Baron, The Caliph, and The Khan.<br/><br/>Your mission is to guide your people to the stars, secure vital resources to support your growth, make important decisions that will forge your Kingdom&rsquo;s fate, and take back what&rsquo;s rightfully yours &ndash; the title of Basileus, Emperor of Mankind.<br/><br/>The Interregnum is played on a modular map divided into hexagonal Sectors and Solar Systems. These are each further divided into 3 smaller tiles that allow for a better random distribution of Planets and Resources on the map and also keeping the scale Galactic yet detailed enough to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>The Interregnum gameplay is structured into Rounds that each represent a galactic standard year. Within one Round, all players have a Turn &ndash; meaning that a Round is further divided into 2 to 6 Turns.<br/><br/>Within a Turn, a player has 1 or 2 Actions (depending on their position on the ISC&rsquo;s Turn/Dividend track). Actions are the following: Moving Fleets or Building. If a player has two actions he/she may move twice or move and build in the same turn.<br/><br/>During their Turn, a player may also do any of the following: trade once with the Galactic Market, repay their own debts, acquire loans, sell loans, buy a Technology card, use any number of cards, change their focus (but only when you are the Board Director). These are not considered Actions and can be done at any time during your turn after receiving your resource input.<br/><br/>While there is no actual combat in The Interregnum, players are required to use their Fleets in order to occupy Sectors and build structures inside them.  Generally speaking, Fleets move on the between the Sectors &ndash; called Hyperlanes. They can also be &ldquo;Parked&rdquo; within a Sector (Deep space or Solar Orbit), but cannot move from Sector to Sector while Parked.<br/><br/>Building Fleets, Miner/Traders or Space Stations use up Resources (gained from Deep Space resource tiles or from inhabited planets) and Research points (gained from Citizen or Immigrant population)<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players gathers 5 Reform Score (Mercantile or Hegemonic) through any means.<br/><br/>Once the end is triggered, your victory points are determined by your populations and assets. These are scored differently depending on which path you take when reforming your Star Kingdom into an Empire.<br/><br/>Hegemonic Empire path rewards military expansion while keeping the power in the hands of the few and alike. Citizen and Colonist Populations along with finished Space Stations add to your score, while Immigrants and Offworlders reduce your final score.<br/>Merchant Empire path rewards population diversity and powerful Trader presence. Offworlders and Immigrants along with Trade Stations add to your score, and indeed Citizens and Colonists reduce your score.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The game takes place in a 1920's &quot;gangster&quot; era where Prohibition is in full swing, making the use or trade of any item with magical properties against the law.<br/><br/>Players form small teams of heroic Runerunners to scour the streets of Sanctuary City, taking jobs to hunt down illegal artifacts, before rival teams can get them first. Teams are formed at random and each character will move about the board, exploring the town and looking for clues, but sometimes the easiest way to score an item is to steal from your enemies, or defeat them in battle and run off with all of their loot.<br/><br/>The game features large double-sided board tiles that can be arranged any way you wish, creating a different map every time you play. Your team of Heroes has taken a contract to search for contraband magical items. There will be a variety of different jobs or game modes, allowing you to have a regular battle game, or take an hold specific areas of the board, or search for clues to find special items. The rulebook will feature many different scenarios, and include instructions for how to create your own custom games as well.<br/><br/>Each board tile features a 9x9 grid for movement. Both players alternate activating one hero at a time, and each hero has a set number of actions where they can move, search for clues, and steal from or attack enemy heroes. Each Hero may only be activated once per game turn, and the game will typically last for 6 full turns. Whoever can score the most kills or gather the most loot before the game ends will win.<br/><br/>Runerunners is designed to be simple to learn, but also tactical and strategic, where each hero's unique skills can make or break a mission.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

However no revelation was as ground breaking as the discovery of the islands. Beautiful Oblivion, one of three islands, was formed by the synthesis of earth's geography with the fallen enemy of our past and with it a treasure trove of new resources. Harvesting these resources changed our future and quite possibly sealed our fate. Because of our ignorance a new gate is now forming and it is only a matter of time before a breach occurs unleashing Kaijus hell bent on destroying us all.<br/><br/>In Beautiful Oblivion, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you are the master engineer tasked with creating the next great mech (Krieger) to save us all. Your team of engineers are sent out to harvest the resources needed in order to construct such modern marvels. These new resources come with a cost though, as over harvesting only accelerates the end game.<br/><br/>During the course of play, you'll gain points by using those resources to build or upgrade your Krieger. Choose to follow a blueprint for additional points or shoot from the hip on your design. All the while, navigating world events that can help you or stop you dead in your tracks. The points you earn translate to the strength of your Krieger. Building bigger is stronger, but much slower to do. A light upgraded Krieger might do the trick but will it be strong enough. Either way you'll need to hurry, once the gate is inevitably opened, ending the game, only completed Kriegers will fight for glory against a variety of Kaijus for the possibility to gain bonus points. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Hero or Villain.<br/><br/><br/>        HOW TO PLAY<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Players will roam the Palm City streets on this 8x8 grid gameboard, using powers they gain to complete city events. At the start of the game all players will be competing against one another as heroes. Frantically moving around the board trying to complete city events before other players beat them to it. Each of the 54 city events are original and will make this city feel alive. City events could be anything from saving a family in a burning home, stopping a meteor from crashing into Palm City, or helping the mayor's cat out of a tree.

Palm City is full of stuff happening where your help is always needed but you know what they say. Live long enough... and you'll find yourself the villain. At any point in the game, a player may attack another player. The moment a hero player causes damage to another hero player, they become a villain. There is no going back from this. At this point in the game, your only objective as a villain, is to eliminate all other players using the powers you've gained. Each power in the game has a unique ability and with 38 of them, make sure you build your character carefully. All of this happens within a player's turn and a turn consists of two phases.<br/> Phase 1: Move<br/>Phase 2: Complete Action<br/><br/>Actions that can be completed include: Completing a city event, gaining a genetic mutation, trading &amp; discarding genetic mutations, applying powers, or attacking another player.<br/><br/>Win the game as a hero by completing city events found on comic book cards and getting your city respect to 100 before any other player.<br/><br/>Win the game as a villain by using your powers to bring the health of other players to zero, destroying them all, and taking over Palm City.<br/><br/>This is a large game featuring a lot of content.

Everyone feels different. Everyone feels powerful. You realize each time you touch it, your genetics are mutating.<br/>You're becoming stronger.

        "description": "For almost 600 years, from the fabled shores of the Bosphorus, the Ottoman Sultans ruled over a vast land in Europe, stretching from the Mediterranean to the Danube.  Sometimes enlightened, sometimes cruel, the rule of the Chalifs of Islam had steadily receded before the fury of national ideals and the rising might of European imperialism promoted by bayonet and capital. And yet it still survived, still stubbornly clinging to Balkan territories rich in history, industry and population. The &ldquo;Great Patient&rdquo; seemed to spite Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro; the states created by bloody struggle by those who once were termed the gavur rayahs of the Sultan. They saw with worry the growing appetite of aggressive great powers, all making claims to what they saw as their just inheritance. And then by coup and counter-coup, the fall of a Red Sultan, and the rise of a Committee, the rapaciousness of a young Great Power, and the entente of two old foes, the Balkan states saw danger and opportunity and struck. In the span of just a month of the greatest battles seen in Europe since 1871, the dream of Osman was shattered.<br/><br/>This scenario supplement for Bloody Big Battles! permits you to re-fight those great battles that saw the end of the Ottoman Empire in Europe and the formation of the basic modern borders in the Balkans. Nine scenarios cover some of the most important battles of the First Balkan War, covering the campaigns of Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria against the Ottoman Empire which would drive the Empire to the very gates of Istanbul/Constantinopole/Tsarigrad.  Five scenarios then cover the Second Balkan War, the conflict between the successful allies which pitted Serbia, Montenegro and Greece against Bulgaria over the legacy of the Ottoman Empire.<br/><br/>Each scenario provides a distinct operational and tactical puzzle for war-gamers to resolve. From straightforward assaults against fortified positions like the First Battle of Chataldja, to complex double envelopments like the Battle of Lule Burgas, from the extensive broad fronts of the Battle of Bregalnitza, to the knife fight in close quarters of the Battle of Bizani. There are small scenarios easily played in one or two hours, like the Battle of Dioran (the actual First battle of Dioran), and more substantive scenarios like the Battle of Kumanovo, still playable in an evening.  There are battles fought on rolling hills and plains, like the Battle of Kirkkilise, and battles fought in some of the worst ground people have ever thought of fighting each other in an organized manner, like the Battle of Kalimanchi.<br/><br/>You will see how these wars where similar and how they differed from The Great War. You will understand the crucial role of terrain as a military variable and grapple with key decisions of force to task distributions in an unforgiving strategic operational and tactical environment. You will see the last glory days of the bayonet charge, and the opening bloody howl of modern artillery.  There is challenge to satisfy all types of war-gamers.<br/><br/>An included overview of the historical events and biographies of many of the commanders whose roles you reprise on the table-top will provide you with the background to give you an inkling of the vast stakes and human drama associated with these battles. An annotated bibliography provides you both with the sources used to build the scenarios and further reading to enrich your understanding and experience. A figure guide helps you find suitable ways to represent the armies in almost all scales of miniature war-gaming.<br/><br/>A struggle for a vast future awaits! Take command and see how history was forged!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Rescue the self-proclaimed-hottest-girl-at-school Britney Blonde who's recently been kidnapped by the evil Professor Blender.<br/>Their mood? Pissed. <br/>Their genitalia? Hardened (with the notable exception of the Dyke.)<br/>Within his blender, Professor Blender has concocted a menagerie of unique monsters, different each time the game is played, to stop our heroes. Will he prevail?<br/><br/>Players will travel across Snotville, an island situated between  the mystical lands of Atlantis, Middle Earth, and the People's Republic of Kuwait. Landmarks at Snotville consists of Snotnose High itself, the rival highschool Harvord High, the Suburbs where everyone lives, the Arcade where we can all play games within the game, and the History Hut, a bar frequented exclusively by prominent figures of history, like Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, and John Cena.<br/><br/>Along the way, they will encounter, count, and account for countless Count Dracula-like creatures, all with a different head, body, and pair of legs, as blended in Professor Blender's blender.<br/>But they'll have to hurry - the evil Professor intends to blend Britney herself!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A few hundred yards away were the American Rangers, the three light infantry companies that formed the pickets of the American position. Behind them, about half way up the slop stood 300 American Militiamen, none of them eager to face the enemy. But at the crest stood the American line. Six hundred regulars, they were the heart of the American force. Wearing bright blue uniforms, they stood in straight lines measured carefully by their officers. At the crest of the hill stood Morgan, the swashbuckling American light infantry commander. The British had chased him for two weeks, and now they had him, for he could go no further.<br/><br/>This game is at best an experiment in muzzle-loading warfare. If it works out, and I feel it has, we shall produce a line of such games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>A game depicting the American Revolutionary War battle of Cowpens. The game does not define its time or unit scales.<br/><br/>American units, except for cavalry, are deployed on the map. Cavalry units being off-map but are allowed to enter at any time. British units enter the map on designated turns during the first nine turns of the game. The turn order starts with one side firing, moving, and then designating bayonet assaults. This is followed by a defensive fire phase, after which the bayonet assaults are resolved. The opponent then executes the same phases which constitutes a completed game turn.<br/><br/>A CRT is used for combat resolution. Unit rankings include an attack factor, defense factor, movement factor, and range. Victory conditions are based on points received for destruction of units, ranging from 3 points for destruction of a militia unit to 10 points for destruction of a cannon unit. You win by scoring 10 or more victory points than your opponent. A margin of less than 10 victory points results in a draw.<br/><br/>The Battle of Cowpens was published in the first issue of JagdPanther magazine. While the rules and counters for the game were re-released in a 2012 PDF reprint of the magazine, the game's map could not be located and the publisher has asked for a scan of the map from anyone who owns the original edition.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The Air Forces, finally granted independence from the US Army, carry the burden alone in Europe. The more familiar aircraft of 1943 are gone.

        "description": "Beat The Bookie is the highly entertaining, sociable and strategic board and card game depiction of a day at the races.<br/><br/>Celebrating a race days three main characters; the Bookie, the Punter and the Horse Owner, players can purchase and sell horses, win prize money and gamble on the Bookie's odds on each of the eight races at the race meet.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to collect the highest value combination of trophies from the eight races. Trophies are awarded to the player who makes the most profit from each race, either through prizemoney, bet winnings, payouts from players' cards or through horse sales.<br/><br/>There are three types of trophies on offer. Races 1-3 are known as Maiden Races, and are the least valuable. Trophies awarded for these races are bronze in colour and worth only 1 point each. <br/>Prize money for winning owners in the three maiden races are 1x the Profits (100k for a win, 75k for second place and 50k for third).<br/><br/>Races 4-6 are known as Handicap races, and are more valuable. Trophies awarded for each of these three races are silver in colour and worth 2 points each. Winning horse owners get 2 x the profits if their horses finish top 3 (200k for a win, 150k for second and 100k for third).<br/><br/>Finally, races 7 and 8 are known as the Feature Races and are the most valuable, worth three points. Prizemoney is tripled for these two races (300k for a win, 225k for second place and 150k for third). The trophies awarded for these two races are gold in colour.<br/><br/>Beat The Bookie can be played with 2-8 players. At the beginning of a race meet, a player is nominated to act as the Bookie. The Bookie is a banker of sorts, and is responsible for auctioning the horses, collecting money, calling the horses, laying the horse cards on the track and settling any successful or unsuccessful bets. The Bookie also assigns the trophies are the end of each of the 8 races, but counting up the winnings of each player. The Bookie can also play as a player, but must keep their cash wallet and assets separate from that of the main 'bank'.<br/><br/>Once a Bookie has been assigned, each player is provided with 300k of Beat The Bookie currency. This is to form each players 'cash wallet'. Player are also given six Bet Slip cards, which depict the names and pictures of each of the horses in the field. These cards are used to place the players' bets.<br/><br/>The Bookie then conducts the pre-meet auction, and auctions off each of the six horses in the race, with a reserve price of 100k. Players may or may not bid on the horses, with the successful/highest bidder awarded an ownership card for the particular horse bought. The new owner must keep the ownership card until he/she elects to sell the horse to another player or back to the Bookie.<br/><br/>Once the pre-meet auction has concluded, all players must draw a players card from the left hand panel of the game board. If a player owns a horse, they must draw an Owners Card, which features any fees due or payable to/from the Bookie for their horse. Even if a player owns multiple horses, they need only draw one Owners Card. If a player does not own any horses, they must draw a Punters Card, which offers a special or exotic for the upcoming race. Finally, the Bookie must draw a Bookies Card, which features the odds for the upcoming race. Players can then bet on the odds provided by the Bookies Card, by overturning their Bet Slip Card to reveal the name of the horse they intend to bet on, and placing their chosen bet amount on top of the Bet Slip Card.<br/><br/>Once all bets are placed and accepted by the Bookie, the Bookie then shuffles the Horse Card deck. There are six cards for each of the six different horses. The Bookie then lays the cards out in order of the Horse, with each horse advancing once space down the game board each time it is drawn. The Bookie draws all the Horse Cards until there is a winner, a second place getter and a third place getter.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the race. The Bookie pays out the prize money to the winning owners. If a horse, that finishes first, second or third, is not owned, no prizemoney is awarded in respect of that horse. For races 1-3 (Maiden Races), the Bookie awards 1x the Profits. For races 4-6 (Handicap Races) the Bookie awards 2x the Profits and for races 7 and 8 (Feature Races), the Bookie awards 3 x the Profits.<br/><br/>The Bookie must then payout any prizemoney owed under Punters Cards. Once done so, or if no prizemoney is awarded, the Punter must place his Punters Card back under the pile.<br/><br/>Once prizemoney and punters payouts are awarded, the Bookie either pays out or collects on players' bets on the calculation provided for by the Bookies Card. If the Bookies Card showed odds of 4:1, and the player bet 10k, the Bookie must pay the player 40k. Unsuccesful bets are collected by the Bookie and placed back in the 'bank'.<br/><br/>When all prize money and bet money is awarded, players must count their profits. A trophy (bronze for Maiden Races, silver for Handicap Races and gold for Feature Races) is provided to the player with the most profit from that race. The player keeps the trophy with their cash wallet for counting at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Once trophies are awarded, all players draw their players cards again ahead of the next race.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the players then count the value of their trophies. Bronze trophies are worth 1 point, Silvers are worth 2, and Golds are worth 3. A Player could win the game by not having won any feature races. Conversely, a player might head into race 7 not having won any races for the entire meet, and could win races 7 and 8 and win the game.<br/><br/>Players can trade their horses with other players at the conclusion of any races for an agreed price. Horses are valuable as they provide an alternative revenue stream. Horses drawn frequently in races may be worth selling, as chance would mean it's unlikely to win again. Players who do not purchase horses at the initial pre-meet auction may wish to purchase horses ahead of the more valuable Feature Races.<br/><br/>A player is eliminated if they are declared bankrupt and have no more money or horses to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Perpetual Anarchy is a game for the &quot;2019 Two-Player PnP Design Contest&quot;.<br/><br/><br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/>Perpetual Anarchy is a strategic 2-player game using a standard 52-card deck. Players are states in a world of international anarchy, attempting to impose their supremacy on the other state. Choose the money allocation between immediate benefit with armaments and wealth and long-lasting benefit with military and civil technologies. Finally, establish the state policy: focus on producing, defensing or attacking.<br/><br/>Perpetual Anarchy features bluff, push-your-luck and simultaneous action selection.<br/><br/>GAME THEORY<br/>Perpetual Anarchy was inspired by game theory researches, especially by the PhD student in political science Nathan Alexander Sears' article: Simulating War and Peace in IR Theory with a Classroom Game<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>1 scoring board<br/>1 technology board<br/>28 cards (from an ordinary 52-card deck)<br/>6 tokens<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Each player has 3 personal tokens (one for the scoring board and two for the technology board) and 14 cards in hand:<br/><br/>     11 numbered cards: two 0s (10s), two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, one 4s, one 5, one 6.<br/>     3 action cards: attack (King), defense (Jack), production (Queen).<br/><br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>The game is divided in multiple rounds. In each round, there are three phases. At the end of a round, players pick up all of their played cards back into their hands ready for immediate re-use.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Card Playing<br/>Players place 5 face-down card in a row on the table simultaneously. From left to right:<br/><br/>1. the action card (attack, defense or production);<br/>2. it is a numbered card representing wealth allocation;<br/>3. it is a numbered card representing armament allocation;<br/>4. it is a numbered card representing civil tech allocation;<br/>5. it is a numbered card representing military tech allocation.<br/><br/>There are some restrictions on playing numbered cards:<br/><br/>     Each state has a budget of 7 billion per round, so they have to choose how to allocate it: the sum of number of the player&rsquo;s cards has to be 7 or less. Unused budget is lost.<br/>     The maximum military tech allocation is 2, so it is possible to play only 0, 1 or 2 for military tech<br/>     The maximum civil tech allocation is 2, so it is possible to play only 0, 1 or 2 for civil tech<br/><br/><br/>When both players have placed their cards, every card is turned face-up. If a player wrongly played cards exceeding the sum limit of 7, the opponent decides which card or cards to decrease in order to be within 7. If both players make a mistake in the same round, the round is considered null and void.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Peace/War Scoring<br/>If a state attacks the other one or both states attack, a war begins. Otherwise, states are at peace.<br/>Based on the cards played and the tech levels, states score points as explained below.<br/><br/>Phase 3: Tech Increasing<br/>If a state didn&rsquo;t lose the war in the round, it can increase its tech levels based on its tech allocations.<br/><br/>PEACE<br/>If a state at peace chooses the production action, he scores as many points as the value on its played wealth card + civil tech level.<br/><br/>If a state at peace chooses the defense action, he scores as many points as the value on its played wealth card -1 (reputation cost).<br/><br/>WAR<br/>A state&rsquo;s firepower is the sum of its armament allocation, military tech level and action bonus:<br/><br/>     Production: +0 action bonus.<br/>     Attack: +1 action bonus.<br/>     Defense: +2 action bonus.<br/><br/><br/>If states are at war, whoever has the higher firepower wins the war.<br/><br/>If production or defense wins the war: it scores its own wealth allocation + the opponent&rsquo;s one.<br/>If attack wins the war: it scores its own wealth allocation + the opponent&rsquo;s one - 1 (reputation cost).<br/><br/>When production or defense lose the war, it scores nothing and it loses its tech allocations.<br/>When attack loses the war, it scores -1 and it loses its tech allocations.<br/><br/>ARMISTICE<br/>In case of equal firepower, the war ends with an armistice: attack scores its own wealth allocation &ndash; 1; production and defense score their own wealth allocation. Tech allocations are not lost.<br/><br/>MILITARY TECH<br/>A state can allocate part of its budget researching tech for military purposes. The number on the military tech card, namely the military tech allocation, determines how many steps a state can progress on the military tech board. The resolution of military tech cards occurs after the peace/war scoring.<br/><br/>Initially, the military tech level is 0; then, every 4 steps, a state increases its military tech level by 1. The military tech level contributes to a state&rsquo;s firepower.<br/><br/>If a state is defeated, he loses its military tech allocation (but it doesn&rsquo;t lose its military tech level).<br/><br/>CIVIL TECH<br/>A state can allocate part of its budget researching tech for civil purposes. The number on the civil tech card, namely the civil tech allocation, determines how many steps a state can progress on the civil tech board. The resolution of civil tech cards occurs after the peace/war scoring.<br/><br/>Initially, the civil tech level is 0; then, every 3 steps, a state increases its civil tech level by 1. The civil tech level contribute to increase the efficiency in the production processes: the civil tech level contributes to the score of a production state at peace.<br/><br/>If a state is defeated, he loses its civil tech allocation (but it doesn&rsquo;t lose its civil tech level).<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME AND SCORING<br/>The game ends when the first player gets 50 or more. Before the beginning of the game, players may arrange to play for less or more points.<br/>At the end of the game, the player who has more points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Charged Canada is an electric vehicle mission-based board game.  Charged Canada brings you back to a not too distant past where there are no charging stations across the entire nation.  It's up to you and your friends to decide where to put the charging stations as you see fit with your missions.<br/><br/>Missions include traveling from a specific city to city, collecting resources, and building charging stations or solar installation.  Each player receives their own mission cards at the beginning of each game playthrough.  With hundreds of mission cards to choose from, your three starting missions are not going to be the same as the other players.<br/><br/>Each round is determined using the actions cards, which can be used right away or held for later use.<br/><br/>Strategy game elements include:<br/>map building<br/>deck building<br/>point to point movement<br/><br/>With multiple ways to win, typically through completing a mission card for the victory point on that card.  Another way is to create charging stations or solar installations to earn a victory point for each.<br/><br/>The first one to the victory point limit wins.  The VP limit is dependent on the number of players as Charged Canada can have up to 8 players.  The higher the number of players the lower the VP limit.<br/><br/>Each playthrough will be different based on the mission cards that everyone has and decides how to proceed with those missions.<br/><br/>Charged Canada is easy to learn and play for even the most beginner to board games.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We are all Fools on our journeys through this world. It&rsquo;s dangerous to go alone. Take this game with you.<br/><br/>Fellowship of Fools: The (Friendship) Game (or FoF) is based on the Tarot, in use since the 14th century for games and since the 17th century for divination. The art for Fellowship of Fools dates back to 1761 to its creation in France by Nicolas Conver de Marseilles and is called the Tarot de Marseilles. Today, Tarot cards are widely used  for game playing, creativity, divination and personal development. Our hope is that FoF can turn that inward reflection of the Tarot outward to help players develop friendships.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve split the Tarot deck into its two parts&mdash;-the Major Arcana for Situations and the Minor Arcana for Topics. On each card are two different prompts&mdash;-corresponding to the upright and the reversed meaning of the card. Numbers next to the prompts indicate their difficulty, possible points that can be gained or lost for playing that prompt, as well as the number of Topic Prompts that can be played for that Situation Prompt.<br/><br/>There are multiple ways to play Fellowship of Fools: The (Friendship) Game: solo, with two players, or with multiple players. We encourage players to experiment with the cards and find their own ways to play. Visit to our Gamplay page to see the many ways to play, then experiment with the game and submit your own ways to play!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You have 3 types of cards: Animals, Kingdoms and Extras. Animals are your creatures, your babies, you take care of them. Each animal belongs to a kingdom. There are 6 Kingdom cards: Alpacas, Flamingos, Pandas, Unicorns, Sloths and Dinosaurs. Your goal is to own 3 animals of your kingdom on your field, complete of their &quot;poop markers&quot; aka being Wise. Extra cards can help you doing that! EXTRAS are 2 different types: TRICKS (can be used unlimitedly and in any moment) and TREATS (can be played max 2 per turn unless specified otherwise). Each turn has different phases. The first thing you want to do is to position &quot;poop markers&quot; on your animals card (does not apply in the first player's first turn). You get 1 poop marker per animal. Then you draw 2 cards, choosing between the 2 decks (animals deck, extras deck), the combination is up to you (1/1, 2/0, 0/2). You can play a maximum of 2 cards per turn, if there aren't cards in your field allowing you to play more. Playing cards, the player should try to prevent opponents to stack poop markers on animals while trying to fully stack his own animals. The winner is the first player owning 3 wise animals on his field. During the &quot;stacking poop&quot; phase, poop markers can't be prevented, so be sure to clean up the poop you want to delete before the next player's turn's begin (before your ending phase, to be clear). All this stuff fits into funny artworks and weird characters!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Haulin&rsquo; is an immersive game that will put you in the drivers seat of your very own semi truck. Traveling through an often changing world of natural disasters and dreaded road construction, as a semi driver, your job is to choose which loads you want to pick up and deliver to cities in need.

Be warned, trucking is a competitive business. As you race to haul more loads than anyone else, keep an eye on the other truckers.<br/><br/>The trucker who delivers all of their dedicated loads first, ends the game.

All player roles are non-gender specific.<br/><br/>Needed to play:<br/>5 cards, 9 cubes and 1d6 inside a d6<br/><br/>In this game, both players are playing cooperatively. Your goal is to move your player markers from their starting spaces to the &lsquo;Together&rsquo; spaces, at the end of the game board, during your shared turn. If you cannot do this before the marker on the board&rsquo;s time track reaches 0, or, if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you lose.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Place the two halves of the game board so that the sides marked A face each other. Place the 2 player markers on their respective               starting spaces at the end of the board. Place each of the 4 Hobgoblins of Sadness markers on the 4 black squares. Place 1 on the board&rsquo;s time track. Lastly, each player should choose one side of a personality card and place a marker, in their <br/>matching color, on the [8] space of their energy track.<br/><br/>Players play:<br/>One player rolls the die in a die. Each player then chooses one of die roll results to apply to either movement or energy.<br/><br/>For each 6 rolled, move the marker on the time track down 1 number. Remember: if the marker on time track on reaches 0, you have both lost the game.<br/><br/>Movement is either left or right, forward or back, never diagonally (unless a special action allows this).<br/><br/>At any time during their shared turn, each player may use the special action listed on their card. Reduce the energy on your card&rsquo;s track to pay for this, as specified by the special action. Your energy levels may never go above 8 or below 0. Remember: if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you have both lost the game.<br/><br/>Players may move to a space occupied by a Hobgoblin. If, at any time, a player&rsquo;s marker is on the same space as a Hobgoblin, they may spend 2 energy to send the Hobgoblin back to a starting space of their choice.<br/><br/>Hobgoblins of Sadness play:<br/>All Hobgoblins of Sadness now move 2 spaces - left, right, forward or back, never diagonally. Players will always move the Hobgoblins towards the player marker nearest to a Hobgoblin&rsquo;s position. If both player markers are equally distant, move the Hobgoblin to the player with the most energy. If still tied, move them towards the player of your choice.<br/><br/>If a Hobgoblin moves to a player&rsquo;s space they will reduce that player&rsquo;s energy by 1 or 2.<br/><br/>Next Turns and Game End: <br/>Players now move or gain energy on their shared turn, followed by the Hobgoblins movement. If both players enter their final &lsquo;Together&rsquo; spaces at the same time, during their shared turn, they win the game and have found their way to Together.<br/><br/>If you cannot do this before the marker on the board&rsquo;s time track reaches 0, or, if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you lose.<br/><br/>A new game in the &quot;Gameshop&quot; series.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is a card driven game where each player is dealt a hand of cards to play during a round that will allow them to take different actions in the game that also act as a fog of war. The simple rules make play easy but there is depth to the strategy and the players constantly have meaningful choices to make.<br/><br/>Since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC his empire has fragmented, the two most powerful factions being to the east; the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt. Meanwhile Rome has been solidifying its hold of the Italian peninsula and the Carthaginians have become the dominant trade and naval power of the western Mediterranean. Historically, 264 BC was the year the first Punic War began between Rome and Carthage. Many other wars followed and by 188 BC Rome had defeated, contained or occupied her foes.<br/><br/>In this game each player takes on the role of one of the four major factions; Rome, Carthage, Egypt or the Seleucid Empire and will fight so that they can become the dominant power.

In each turn, agents are set out one step at a time across the network of markets to establish horrea (warehouses), negotiate alliances or break them apart, establish a presence in a region or prevent another player from accessing it.<br/><br/>Trade functions through every market where a player has established a warehouse. The further from Rome, the higher the transport and information costs and the lower the profit. But agents who are connected back to Rome are better informed, and so can get a better return. Fortunes can be made by creating continuous trade routes accessing the wealth of the edges of Empire and the Barbaricum beyond!<br/><br/>Money is not the only way for a player to grow in prestige; a combination of clever board control and alliances and benefactions allow a player to move up the cursus honorum (prestige ladder) to become Consul!

        "description": "Mix &amp; Mayhem is a fast-paced family battling card game for 2 to 4 players. It can be played in 4 different ways, providing exciting variation and wide age range appeal.  One of the games aimed at young children is a simple mix and match stlye game. One of the other games is a Top Trumps style of selecting a category and the highest value wins. The other two of the game variations are trick taking games that involve trying to create the most powerful creatures and battling them against your opponent.<br/><br/>The game contains 72 cards, including 60 character cards and 12 special action cards.  The 60 character cards include 20 Head cards, 20 Torso cards, and 20 leg cards.  Combined in the right sequence, these cards create 20 fearsome characters ready to do battle, however, when the cards are mixed with cards from other characters they can create up to 8,000 unique characters each with their own unique name and powers. You will create crazy, scary, funny, unusual and wonderful characters to battle and try to defeat your opponents.<br/><br/>Mix &amp; Mayhem cards can be played in 4 different ways, You Complete Me, Wipe Them Out, Skirmish, and Bunch of Fives. The rules for each game are described below.<br/><br/>You Complete Me!<br/>Preparation: Remove all of the Action cards. Shuffle the Character cards and place them in a pile<br/>face down.<br/>Playing the game: Decide who goes first, then each player takes it in turns to take a card from the pile and lay them face up in front of them. As the game progresses each player will be able to mix their cards to create weird and wonderful creatures as the game progresses.<br/>The winner: The aim is to be the first player to create one of the 20 original characters made up of the set of correct 3 cards. If neither player is able to create one of the 20 original characters before the cards are all drawn then the cards are collected, re-shuffled, and drawn again until there is a winner.<br/><br/>Wipe Them Out!<br/>Preparation: Split the cards into 3 separate piles for Heads, Torsos and Legs (including the Action cards which are also marked on the back of the card as Head, Torso and Legs cards). Shuffle each pile and deal the cards face down to each player so that each player has their own separate piles of Head<br/>cards, Torso cards, and Leg cards. Each player should have the same number of body part cards.<br/>To play the game: Each player picks up the top card of each pile of body parts so they have a complete character, with a Head card, Torso card and Legs card. If they pick up an Action card instead of a character body part they should keep this and draw another card from the top of the pile until they have a character body part. The Action cards that they may have picked up can be used during the game. Players hold the cards facing themselves, so only they can see them. Decide who goes first, then that player will select a category &ndash; either Brains, Strength or Speed. Each player shows their card to reveal the value of the chosen body part. The player with the highest<br/>value wins the battle and the player with the lowest value must discard the body part card that lost. Then the loser must pick up the next top card from their pile of the same category until they have a complete character again. The winner of the battle can keep the same cards in play. However, each card can only be used a maximum of 2 times to win a battle. After an individual body part card has won 2 battles it must be discarded and a new one drawn. Players will take it in turns to select a category. Both players must always have at least 3 cards in play, including a Head card, Torso card and Legs card in addition to any Action cards that have been collected. To create some extra mayhem the Action cards that have been drawn by players during the game can be used when it is their turn at any stage of the game. Once a player uses an Action card it must then be discarded.<br/>The winner: The object of the game is to defeat your opponent by wiping out a pile of their cards so that they are no longer able to make up a full character and therefore unable to continue to battle. When a player is unable to make a complete character they are defeated and their opponent is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Skirmish!<br/>Preparation: Shuffle all of the cards (Character and Action cards) into a single pile.<br/>Playing the game: Each player will take it in turns to draw a card from the top of the pile. The cards are laid face up so they are visible to both players.  When both players have a complete character of a Head card, Torso card and Legs card they are ready for battle. Players can create the character of<br/>their choice to battle with from any of the character cards they have drawn. Each turn, players have the option to challenge their opponent to a battle, or to draw another card to<br/>try and create more powerful characters. Once a challenge to battle has been made by either player, the characters they both have created for the battle must be declared and put side by side. The total character score is calculated by adding together the brains, strength and speed values, and the player<br/>with the highest total character score wins that battle.  If a player is able to create one of the correct 20 unique character sets then their overall character score is increased by an extra 10 bonus points. The player who makes the challenge may think they have the most powerful character because they<br/>can see the values of their opponent&rsquo;s characters, however, their opponent may create mayhem by playing one of their Action cards that they have collected to swing the outcome of the battle. A player can use one or more Action cards at any time. Once a player uses an Action card it must then<br/>be discarded. The players continue to draw further cards and engage in new battles with new characters until all<br/>cards have been drawn and there are no further complete characters in the remaining cards held by both players.<br/>The winner: The player who has won the most individual battles once all the cards have been drawn<br/>wins the game.<br/><br/>Bunch of Fives!<br/>Preparation: Remove all of the Action cards from the deck and deal all of the remaining character cards into separate Head, Torso and Legs piles. Each player will be dealt 3 Head cards, 3 Torso cards and 3 Legs cards, allowing each player to make up 3 separate characters. The cards are laid face down so they are not visible to the opposing player.  Each player should then privately arrange their cards to create 3 different characters with their own unique name and overall value.<br/>Playing the game: Decide who goes first, then that player will lay down one of their characters to engage in battle with their opponent. The other player must then choose and lay down one of their characters. Whoever has the highest total score (by adding together the brains, strength and speed values) wins that hand. If a player is able to create one of the correct 20 unique character sets then their overall character score is increased by an extra 10 bonus points. Players will take it in turns to lay a character first. Once all 3 characters have battled the players will then be dealt another 3 Head cards, 3 Torso cards and 3 Legs cards for another round of 3 battles.<br/>Following the second round of 3 battles there will be 1 final round of 3 battles, so there will be 3 rounds of 3 battles making a total of 9 battles. <br/>The winner: The first player to win 5 battles is the winner of the game. It is possible therefore to<br/>win the game outright after only 2 rounds without the need for the final round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game is for 2 or more, with two decks being used if 5 or more play.<br/><br/>Ten cards are dealt to each player. During their turn, a player may do one of the following: <br/><br/>     Lay down a complete word from their hand.<br/>     Add letters to an existing word to make another word, either in-line or crossing it as in a crossword puzzle. Adding &quot;S&quot; to make plurals is not allowed.<br/>     Change an existing word into a different word by removing one or more letters and adding one or more letters from the hand. Cards not removed must remain in the same order. <br/>     Discard a card and draw a card from the top of the deck or discard pile. <br/><br/><br/>When one player empties their hand, each other player scores the sum of the values of the cards still in hand. Consonants are 2 points each, vowels are A 25, E 20, I 15, O 10, U 5.  When one player's total reaches 100 or more, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Curiously, however, no other information seems to be available on it except from these stamps, and it is not mentioned in any of the major games books in my possession, including that by L'H&ocirc;te, who is usually a good source for games of the Francophone world.<br/><br/>It is played by two people, on a board similar to that of Nine men's Morris, that is to say, there are 24 playing spaces arranged on the corners and mid-points of the edges of three concentric squares.  However, no diagonals are marked, and the spaces consists of holes, into which the players insert black and white sticks.  One of the stamps shows Eklan being played on an apparently traditional board fashioned into a small table, similar to those used in quality Go or Mancala sets.  The dimensions I give below have been estimated from those pictures (the depth being the approximate height of the illustrated table).<br/><br/>The board is shown as having a narrow raised 'lip' around its edges, except at open at the corners.  The part of the board between this lip and the outermost set of eight holes is coloured beige, and the regions within it are respectively coloured white, green, and - at the centre - yellow.  Presumably these details are merely decorative.  The sticks would seem to protrude about 6 centimetres out from their holes, and the white ones slant towards one player, while the black ones slant towards his opponent who sits opposite.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of community leaders, each of them with a specific vision of what their society could be. They will need to work together to keep the community safe, erect new buildings, and instill new ways of doing things among the populace, but always remembering that none of the other players shares their exact vision.<br/><br/>What We Became is highly competitive, but the environment presents enough of a threat that players will need to negotiate and work together with adversaries to stay alive, all while trying to outmaneuver them to come out ahead.

The player with the most points at the end of the 5 rounds wins the game. (BEDMAS is outlined in the rules for those who have forgotten it)<br/><br/>The excitement in this game is trying to solve for a common answer, using the cards you have, and get a better equation than all the other players. &quot;Better&quot; is relative though, as you don't need to be a math whiz to win. For example, to solve for 8, you can have 4+4+5-5 or (3-1)2+(15-11). Make them as simple or as complex as you'd like, just make sure you don't get stuck when you need to place down your equation.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players playing as warriors in Norse arena called Holmgang to claim their rights and glory. During the game, players play hidden cards on the board, once all actions are done players reveal cards one by one and execute their actions simultaneously. Move, Attack, Defend or do any of your special character ability to outplay your opponent. But be aware, you are slowly running out of options so be careful in your planning to always have some backup plan.<br/><br/>Each character is equipped with a unique set of weapons and 13 cards. Cards allow players to move with their weapons around the board or do some sneaky moves to try to find an undefended spot where they can hit the enemy with their attack. Attacking is the only way how players can deal damage to an opponent's character and defeat it. Each round players put 4 hidden cards on the board that creates their action decks. Once both action decks are complete, players execute all card from their decks one by one. The games end when one of the player's characters health is reduced to 0.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

With the first word played, one of the cards is designated as the center of the square. After the first word, each word must use all the cards played and at least one card already on the table. Consecutive letters in a word must be adjacent in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal, but the word as a whole may zigzag and change directions. It's like the array from Big Boggle, built up gradually with cards rather than dice.<br/><br/>Each word scores like this: letters already on the board score their printed value, letters played from the hand are double their value, unless they are played to a corner of the square, or are the last cards played in the square, in which case their value is tripled.<br/><br/>Their is also a solitaire game: one plays cards in a row, one at a time, and when a set of consecutive cards make a word, they are made into a single pile with any of those letters on the top.

First player to build their MegaBot wins.<br/><br/>The board is the Factory and consists of shared Workstation Tiles that players move around the Factory to form Assembly Lines. Blueprints show the pattern of Workstations required in an Assembly Line to build legs, torsos, arms, and heads, and all of these are needed to complete a MegaBot.<br/><br/>Players have a number of WorkBots and can build more. WorkBots are the driving force in the Factory and each Workstation needs a WorkBot on it. Only then will the Workstation be a functioning part of an Assembly Line. Only by moving Workstations around the Factory to match a Blueprint and placing a WorkBot on each Workstation will the next part of a MegaBot come rolling off the Assembly Line.<br/><br/>On their turn, players can move a Workstation and move a WorkBot. Each type of Workstation is limited in number, and players will try to move Workstations out of other players&rsquo; Assembly Lines to use within their own. Take control of a Workstation by having more WorkBots on it than anyone else, then it can be moved. Protect a Workstation by having enough WorkBots left on it to prevent the other players moving it.<br/><br/>Nuts And Bots has simple rules and simple actions but requires thought and puzzle-solving to win in an ever-changing environment.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Discards a card from the hand, unless they are going out.<br/><br/>Doubles, pairs, and triples are considered Wild cards for the purposes of impure words (it's impure if it ends in a Wild); and of freezing the discard pile (which cannot be drawn unless the top card is used for a new word of 5+ letters rather than 4+).<br/><br/>A player or team may go out if they have at least two Word Canastas (words of 7+ letters), or one Alphanasta (a word of 10+ letters played from the hand).  At this point all players score the sum of the letter values in the words they have on the table, plus these bonuses: <br/>100 points for going out<br/>300 an impure Word Canasta <br/>500 a pure Words Canasta<br/>1000 an Alphanasta<br/>100 for each letter over 7 in a Word Canasta.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 3000 points over several hands, or 5000 for partnership games, wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragons of Thruduit is an LCG game where you battle with elemental dragons!<br/><br/>Object of the game: in order to win you need to defeat all the opponents dragons. This can be done in any assortment of ways, but will be discussed later.<br/><br/>Dragons of Thruduit&rsquo;s play has phases to it. <br/>1: draw phase<br/>2: level phase<br/>3: play phase<br/>4: attack phase <br/>5: resolve phase<br/>6: end phase<br/><br/>-Draw phase-<br/>During the draw phase each player draws a single card. The player who goes first does not get to draw a card on their first turn.<br/><br/>-Level phase-<br/>For this phase each player gains soul tokens equal to their head dragon's soul cost. You can only have a max soul count of 20. If you go above this, just take 20.<br/>Now each player can choose to level up. If you have 10 souls then you can spend them in order to gain one level. Each player starts at level one.<br/><br/>-Play phase-<br/>You may now play cards. If you wish to play a card there are a few requirements you must meet. You must be that card&rsquo;s level or higher, and you must also pay that&rsquo;s card soul cost. If you do both of these things then you can play the card. After you play a card, remove soul tokens from your soul pool according to the cards soul cost. Example: if you play a card that costs 5 souls, you must remove 5 soul tokens. You can only play 3 cards onto the field a single play phase.<br/><br/>-Attack Phase-<br/>The first player will now attack. The player can choose any number of dragons to attack. Your dragon can only attack at an opponent&rsquo;s dragon with a lower than or equal level to that dragon. Once you attack that dragon its health decreases by the attacking dragons damage value. You may attack with any number of dragons on the board as long as they can fulfill the requirements above.<br/><br/>-Resolve phase-<br/>Both players now remove health counters from all their dragons that took damage this turn.<br/><br/>-End Phase-<br/>Your turn ends and your opponent's turn starts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each deck has: 3 A's and E's, 2 O's, I's and S's, and 1 of each other letter, all in red, and the same again all in black, plus two Joiner cards that can stand for any letter, making 68 cards. Each letter has a point value of 1-5.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 14 cards (children 10 cards), and during their turn a player draws a card, lays down cards if possible, and discards a card. The initial lay-down must be one or more words that have at least 14 points in value and include at least one 5+ letter word in one color (for children, at least 10 points and no color requirement). A word's value is the sum of its letters' values, plus bonuses for length, doubled if the word is of one color.<br/><br/>In turns after the initial lay-down, a player may also: draw the top discard instead of the top of the deck; add letters to any word on the table instead of playing a new word (this doesn't score points, though); replace a Joiner (wild) card with the letter it currently stands from from the hand.<br/><br/>The player who plays all the cards in their hand except one which is then discarded, wins the round. The game is won by the first player to win two rounds consecutively; for shorter games, the consecutive requirement is dropped.<br/><br/>In the party version of the game, points for words played are tallied and totaled -- a score pad is included -- and a round's winner gets a bonus of 50 points plus the values of the cards left in others' hands.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The goal is to build a self-sufficient hobby farm, by being the first player to earn the winning number of points by pairing livestock with crops to create sustainable habitats. 2-4 players, ages 6 and up.<br/><br/>On each turn, the player rolls the die and moves the number of spaces indicated. Depending on where he/she lands, the player may purchase livestock animals--such as pigs, horses, or chickens--or food habitats (aka, 'crops')--such as apple orchards, pasture, or vegetable gardens. When an animal or crop is purchased, a tile is placed on the player's farmstead in one of the 16 allotted spaces. Depending on how the player places his/her tile, points will be awarded. For example, placing honeybees next to a flower garden will award 2 points. The first player to reach 7, 10, or 14 points (novice, medium, difficult gameplay) wins.<br/><br/>Players earn currency in the game whenever someone lands on the &quot;Farmer's Market&quot; space. Cards are drawn from a special deck indicating which items are in demand at the Farmer's Market. Depending on which animals or crops the player has on his/her farmstead, he/she will be awarded currency accordingly. He/she can then use that currency to purchase more animals or crops to place on their farm.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Starting with nothing but your sugar shack and a good measure of determination, you must build your sugar mapling enterprise from the ground up. Exploring the forest and tapping the right kinds of trees will generate cash flow that you can use to upgrade your equipment and expand your operation. But beware, other settlers have similar ambitions and will try to beat you to the tap.<br/> To play, each player chooses a cabin site on the gameboard and places their cabin. They also place one tree tap on a tract of land that is adjacent to their cabin. On each turn, the player rolls a die and moves along a track. Depending on where they land, they may be able to purchase supplies or run into danger.<br/><br/>Whenever any player lands on the Sugar Maple tile, all players participate in the syrup harvest as follows: First each player draws one tree card for every tap placed. The tree cards indicate how many gallons of syrup are collected. After all the tree cards are counted, players receive currency (gallons of syrup) that they can use to purchase more land and place more taps.<br/><br/>The game is won by the first player to place all of his/her taps. In a 2-player game, this is 8 taps. In a 3-player game, 7 taps. In a 4-player, 6 taps.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Goals are the key to the game, as the victory points guaranteed by it make up the bulk of the final score. Among these objectives, there are 3 categories: the color standards of the cordels on the poles, the presence of players on the poles and the collection of cordels.<br/><br/>The match ends when one of the players reaches a certain number of goals, then the points are scored for the completed goals and other smaller forms of the score.

So to conserve the stewardsh... or rather, the Korruptonian democracy, the country's main political parties articulate an emergency electoral campaign in order to regain partisan prestige and elect a representative.<br/><br/>In order to be able to elect its representative, the party must increase its influence in the regions of the country, through the presence of its candidate or the support of the media, personalities, smaller parties and companies. With the use of mechanics like area control, auction and hand and resource management, Korrupt&ocirc;nia is a strategic game of fantasy themed.<br/><br/>There are five regions of Korrupt&ocirc;nia, and each one has different demographic characteristics in each game. All these regions begin with a high influence of the partisans and with almost no influence of the great political parties - each party only initiates with a minor influence in its original region. Each player will have five weeks (or five rounds) to reverse this scenario, gaining enough influence for his candidate to lead the polls at the end of the game.<br/><br/>To achieve this, players will have to manage well each of the phases of the rounds: the campaign phase and the political action phase. In each round, the position of the candidates in the polls will determine the order of the players, in descending order.<br/><br/>In the campaign stage, players must decide whether to move their candidate and pay the costs (of money and speech, which are two of the three resources that the parties must administer) to campaign wherever they are, gaining influence in doing so .<br/><br/>After that, in the political actions phase, each player must take one of the actions of the cards in his hand, eventually having to pay his costs (of money, speech and government positions, which are the three features of the game). These actions range from setting up campaign committees, influencing news media for or against candidates, and also hiring famous people for your campaign, joining smaller parties and attracting companies to fund the campaign (these last three actions require a auction with the other parties). After making an action, the player can exchange resources with the political market, which varies with each negotiation, and also use one of the political actions of the open cards on the table, paying extra costs for this. At the end of each round, the party influence in each region determines an update of the voting intentions of the candidates in the polls.<br/><br/>At the end of five weeks, the party ahead in the polls will win the match.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Whoever is the only one still has hidden parts of his own code!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Moscovis are a very friendly family of fly-spiders. However, all Moscovis have some peculiar and hereditary characteristics. The first is that they do not see the colors well, and they reverse the ability to identify each one a little. That would not be a big problem, were it not for another Moscovis trait: a serious food restriction. For Moscovis, eating flakes of certain colors can have serious consequences, from a bellyache to more serious things! That is, a Moscovis can never &quot;fly&quot; away from it's attention!<br/><br/>In this way, each player is in the shoes of a member of this family in &quot;The Moscovis&quot;, trying to correctly identify the colors of the flies, in the order in which they are arranged, using the colors they have in mind (or better, in the hands)! The letters have the name of one color, but the color of the letter is different, and each needs to put the names of the colors in order according to the colors of the flies, as soon as possible. The difficulty is heightened by the fact that each set of cards has different combinations of colors and names.<br/><br/>",

A great math game where you must calculate and stay sharp to win.<br/><br/>SWUP is based on Casino, but with added/changed elements.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt four cards, and four cards are dealt to the table (only first round). Then players either take a trick, by adding cards on the table to become the same value as the card they play, build new cards by adding their card to a card already on the table, or play their cards on the table. Doubles and triples can also be built (and they can't be changed). Once all players have played their four cards, each player is deal four new cards. Play continues until all cards are dealt and played.<br/><br/>Points are scored the follwoing in a players trick pile:<br/>Most cards: 1 point<br/>Most black cards: 2 points<br/>Last trick: 1 point<br/>Each star: 1 point<br/>Each SWUP (clearing the table): 1 point<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guide your squadron of spaceships to conquer the solar system! But be careful, with planet storms and other beings trying to conquer planets too, you&rsquo;re in one heck of a battle.<br/><br/>About: Cosmic Havoc can be played by one, two, three or four players that play sequentially.<br/><br/>Fight your way for control of the solar system - controlling the planets on the board. Space ship shaped discs are used by players by flicking them into the holes (planets).  The game is played by spinning the  Spaceship dial to select a planet to conquer.  There are 3 rotating rings on the board which assists in creating Havoc in the Solar System.  Players play in the following steps:<br/><br/>A Spaceship Spinner is used to determine which planets players try to flick their spaceship into. Once a planet is landed on with the Spinner, players draw Havoc Cards which tells how many spins the planet's-ring should be spun.  Players then flick their spaceship in the direction of the selected planet and aim to land their spaceship.  If a players spaceship lands in the planet, that planet is now controlled by the player and the planet is conquered. Up conquering a planet, the conqueror draws a Planet Card and follows the instructions on the card.<br/><br/>And then the next player spins the &quot;Spaceship&quot; dial again and play continues as per the above instructions.<br/><br/>About the board: The board is circular and contains 3 rings where the planets are located and in the middle of the board the sun is located - which holds the Spaceship Dial.  Each of the rings turns either clockwise or counter clockwise.  The board is divided into twenty quadrants.<br/><br/>Spaceship Disks: Each player starts with 16 Spaceship Discs<br/>Cards: Planet and Havoc Cards<br/>Planet Holes: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn:<br/>Uranus, Neptune. Other holes the Sun and Black holes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monster is a gambling game in which the best<br/>hand must defeat the Monster, a hand made<br/>from everyone&rsquo;s discards.<br/><br/>Equipment: <br/>A Pairs deck.  A button for indicating the<br/>dealer, and chips for keeping score.<br/><br/>To Begin: <br/>   Start by paying an ante into the pot. If you have 4 or 5 players, the ante is 2 chips. With 6 to 8 players, the ante is 1 chip.  <br/>   Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. The player on the dealer&rsquo;s left will act first. (Move the dealer button only after a full game, i.e., after the pot clears.)<br/>   Each player acts once, in turn. On your turn, you may discard zero to three cards, or fold. You are not allowed to keep a hand that includes a pair; if this is your only choice, you must fold.  You may want to fold some other hands as well,<br/>depending on circumstances<br/>   Your discards go facedown into a pile in the middle, which becomes the Monster&rsquo;s hand. Folded cards do not go to the Monster; they go completely out of play. Note: This is not draw poker. Your discarded cards are not replaced!<br/><br/>The Showdown: <br/>After each player on the next page) becomes the &ldquo;Champion,&rdquo; and<br/>must compare hands with the Monster. When the Champion faces the Monster,he must defeat it in order to take the pot. The<br/>Monster wins ties.<br/><br/>If the Champion loses (or ties), he pays 5 chips to the pot and is knocked out of the game.<br/><br/>Definition of High Hand: <br/>Any player hand that contains a pair is a losing hand, and<br/>can&rsquo;t be kept for the showdown. All hands in the showdown will be compared by highest card, then second highest card, and so on. The best player hand is 10-9-8-7-6-5. A card is better than nothing, so a hand of 10-8-7-4 is better than 10-8-7.  This is similar to comparing poker hands for high card, except that there is no limit on the number of cards that can play. The Monster uses the same rules, but it ignores duplicate cards. Treat the Monster as if it had only one card of each rank.<br/><br/>Winning: <br/>To win the pot, you must become the Champion and defeat the monster. If no one wins, play another round with only the<br/>surviving players. Players who folded, or who lost a fight with the Monster, are out. All cards are reshuffled in the next round<br/>(the Monster does not keep its cards).<br/><br/>Oddities: If one player is left, he automatically wins. If zero players are left, either because they all had to fold, or because the last player couldn&rsquo;t defeat his own discards, then play again with the same players who started the round.<br/><br/>Ties: <br/>If two Champions win with exactly the same hand, they split the pot. If two Champions have the same hand but lose to the Monster, they must each drop out and pay the 5 chip penalty, unless they are the only two players remaining, in which case they pay 5 chips but play another round.<br/><br/>Strategy: In the first few rounds, you may want to &ldquo;duck,&rdquo; playing low hands and trying not to become the Champion. As players leave the game, it becomes easier to defeat the Monster, because it is getting fewer cards.<br/><br/>",

Any player then takes the arrows and throws them in the air or places them in a circle radius of about six feet , disregarding where the colors may fall. The spinner is then placed in the center of the circle.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>Each player stands on the outside pattern of the arrows . The first player then spins the dial . The dial stops on a blue arrow , the players quickly place any foot on any convenient blue arrow , with toes pointing in the direction of the arrow. When the spinner shows geeen players place the other foot on any green arrow . As the game continues , players may place either foot on the arrow that is most convenient to them . When the spinner stops on a Heart, the player calls out &ldquo;HAVE A HEART&rdquo; and each player tries to get each other&rsquo;s heart with his sword. The hearts may be removed by either knocking them off or by placing the curved part of the sword thru the hole in the heart and pulling it off. If a player loses balance and falls or his heart is removed , he is eliminated from the game. The last player remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

So get out there and paint!<br/><br/>In Art-ish you&rsquo;ll be mixing colors to paint splatters on your canvas with the goal of fulfilling commissions. Be the first player to earn 8 Exposure points to win.<br/><br/>On their turn, players create Splatters using different combinations of Paint Tubes from their hand with the goal of reproducing the model on one of the Commission Cards.<br/><br/>When a player has fulfilled a Commission card by matching its Splatters in the proper location, they gain that number of Exposure and a special ability to use during their subsequent turns.

        "description": "Launder is a solo money laundering game that requires the player to manage both the money they've laundered and the attention of the FBI, which is represented by Heat.<br/><br/>The player begins the game with a Boss Asset card (representing their illicit employer) and a small amount of Dirty Money, which they use to purchase Building or Person Asset cards.  Each Turn, a player advances the current Month, draws an Event card, and resolves the FBI track, which generally tends to hinder the player by adding additional Heat to their most high-profile Assets.<br/><br/>In the Activation Phase, the player can activate their Assets. Most Assets allow the player to roll a variable number of Income Dice, though others allow the player to Refresh Activated Assets, move Heat between different Assets, or take more unique actions. Depending upon the result of the Income Dice, the Asset might generate Clean or Dirty Money, gain Heat, or some combination of the above. If an Asset gains 5+ Heat, it is discarded from play and advances the FBI Track by one space. The exception to this is the Boss Asset, which is not discarded from play (but still advances the FBI Track).<br/><br/>The player can then use their money (Clean or Dirty) to purchase additional Assets, weighing carefully just how much money should be invested and how much should be saved away.<br/><br/>If the player has accumulated enough Clean Money at the end of a Turn, they meet their quota and win the game. If they have not met their quota at the end of 12 Turns, however, their boss rewards them for their failure with a pair of cement shoes and a long walk off a short pier.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "JATAK! - commonly translated as YESSIR! - is a highly competitive dice game for two or more players. Originally invented in the pubs, bars, and taverns of Copenhagen where dice roll free, it was designed as a contemporary alternative to the timeless - yet sometimes also timeworn - classics such as Liar's Dice, Mia, and Four Twenty-One. Whereas many traditional dice games only play well with multiple players, JATAK! is equally strong with two, three, or four players.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a dice mat, a dice cup with two dice, and a separate luck die. A common pool of three dice is kept on the table between the players. Players take turns spending points on their luck die to manipulate the private dice in their cup and the public dice in the pool. However, they can also choose to say JATAK! and pass on the turn. If all players say JATAK! one after the other, the round ends and the cups are removed. The player who has the strongest combination of dice between their cup and the pool wins the round. The first time a player wins a round they flip over their dice mat. The second time they remove it, and the third time they win the game.<br/><br/>The beating heart of JATAK! is the luck die which begins at 6, but quickly falls dangerously low as players spend points to manipulate the dice to their own advantage. Points on the luck die can only be regained if a player loses a round (+1 point) or pushes their luck by rerolling their cup and withdrawing from the round without looking at the result (+1 point). The latter is obviously a desperate move, but one that can pay great dividends if used with skill and care.<br/><br/>Print-and-play dice mat designs and a complete description of the rules in both Danish and English can be found in the files section on this page.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You will feel at home on the game board, going from Norrliden to Varvsholmen. Cards with pictures and instructions take you from familiar and unfamiliar situations and locations in the historical, contemporary and future Kalmar.<br/><br/>Players assume the role of landlords, purchasing and trading streets, squares and properties. Players landing on the streets and squares of other players must pay rent depending on if the plot is empty or if properties have been built on the plot. The unique plots for the squares Larmtorget, Stortorget, Lilla Torget and Skvallertorget, and for the local newspapers &Ouml;stran and Barometern, are unbuildable, meaning that the rent is fixed; buying more of the same set garners you more money when players land on those plots.<br/><br/>Players play the game by rolling two dice, adding the sum together and moving on the game board equal to the sum of the dice. Players may only buy properties that are unowned, and it takes owning all streets of an individual color set to be able to build properties on the streets. For example, to be able to build properties on Norrliden, Funkabo must also be owned by you, as it belongs to and completes the orange set. While moving along the board, players may also land on tile which force you to draw cards, whose effects may be both beneficial and disadvantageous.<br/><br/>The goal of this game is, by the roll of the dice and mercantile shrewdness, to be the last player left with money, having forced your competitors into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Typically, a separate player acts as a Reader by reading out loud from a separate deck. Players then deduce from what is read which card on display is the target, and move swiftly.<br/><br/>In this game of Shingon Karuta, the designer aimed to improve the education of Buddhist iconography. There is a deck of Bodhisattva cards and a deck of Shingon cards.  A Bodhiattva is a person on the path to Buddhahood, and such people are widely depicted in temple artwork, in sculpture and painting. Shingon Buddhism is one of the main schools in Japan, and the Shingon deck has sections of mantras that relate to specific Bodhisattva images.<br/><br/>As the Shingon card is read out, each player tries to identify the matching Bodhisattva card and snatch it or keep it.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 2017, but revised in 2019 to unify the artwork to one style. The designer realised that players could simply learn the deck by the different style of artworks, and not by learning the actual Bodhisattvas. By making all the art unified, the game becomes much harder.<br/><br/>In 2018, the designer published an explansion set of 10 more Bodhisattva cards and 10 matching Shingon cards. Players could just play with this expansion set alone. This deck was integrated into the 2019 edition too.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Frank Buck was a well-known big game trapper who wrote a 1930 book, Bring 'Em Back Alive. In this game there are twelve books of three cards. Each book represents an animal that Fran Buck has brought back alive from the jungles or a scene illustrating adventures on his expeditions. The books are made by fitting the three cards together in the proper way to form a complete picture. The  center card of each book has the name of the book at the top and a red number. The other two cards of each book have some descriptive or leading phrase that gives a clue to its proper book without revealing the name.<br/><br/>Players draw a card to determine the dealer. The higher number deals. Players are dealt three cards face up. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center. The dealer plays first. He looks over all the cards to determine whether or not a book may be made up from the cards showing. If  the dealed can make up a book, he selects the proper cards and places them in front of him. His turn is complete and play passes to the player on his left. If the dealer can not make up a book, he draws one card from the top of the center pile and tries to make up a book. If successful, he places the book in front of him. If unsuccessful in making up a book, the card drawn is discarded face up.  In either case his turn ends and play passes to the left. The player to the left then has the same option as the dealer plus he may use the card which has been discarded. The following general rules apply. A player may get only one book in a turn. After the three original cards a player does not replace any cards which may be drawn from his hand. If a player discards the third card of any book (not realizing that it made a book), any other player may call the name of the animal and pick up the book with out interfering with his turn. When the cards in the pack have all been drawn the discard pile is turned over and used again.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The game includes a game board like a checker board with a red borderline around one-half and a blue borderline around the other half. There are 24 special chips resembling poker chips that are red on one side and blue on the other. Each player places 12 chips in two rows of six on the first and second row of his side of the board leaving a vacant square to the left and to the right. The player on the red side places chips red side up. The player on the blue side places chips blue side up.<br/><br/>The players' objective is to move their chips across the board to occupy the same positions as the opponent's starting chips. Each turn a player may move one chip one space to an empty square in any direction. A player may also jump an opponent's chip that is adjacent provided there is an empty square behind the chip. Similar to a king in checkers, multiple jumps may be made in a single turn in any direction including diagonally. A player may never jump his own chip. Whenever a diagonal jump is made, the player flips the opponent's chip over to his color and this becomes his chip. Reducing the opponent's number of chips to less than 12 prevents the opponent from winning until he acquires 12 chips again.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each section has 5 identical lanes lead from START to a finish on a GREEN Square. Each player chooses one section and places five chips on the squares marked &quot;START&quot;. Each player rolls the pair of dice. High number starts and play continues clockwise.<br/><br/>The game is divided into matches. A match is won by the first player to fill a GREEN square. The chips are moved from START to the GREEN area in their lane according to the roll of the dice. One chip can be moved the total of the dice or each die can be used separately to move two chips. A seven must be split except when chips are in the PURPLE area (see next paragraph). On a roll of doubles the player may move or take the POT if there are any chips in the POT (See RED in next paragraph). To &quot;Ricochet&quot; means to reverse direction while moving one chip. In order to land in the GREEN the count must be exact. If the roll would take the chip beyond the double line, the chip can be reversed at the double line. The winner of a match takes all the chips in play from all players except those chips on START or GREEN. The game is over when one player has filled all five of his GREEN squares. The game winner takes all the chips in play except those on START. The ultimate winner is the player with the most chips.<br/><br/>Each section contains areas of colored squares. A chip cannot remain in the RED area. It must be put in the POT. The WHITE area is safe. Chips may remain in WHITE and be moved when the player wishes. A chip in the BLUE area is safe until another player places a chip in the BLUE. The first player must then surrender his chip to that player. A chip in the PURPLE area must move before a chip in the WHITE, BLUE or START. If there is more than one chip in the PURPLE, the one nearest the GREEN must move first. Chips in PURPLE must use the total on the dice to move one chip. A chip in the ORANGE area is lost and remains frozen until the match is over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SLAMORAMA! is a crazy and I mean crazy wrestling card game that will engage your full mental capacity as much as it will tickle your funny bone. Two to four players can brawl in this mental slap-stick game as they pit their moves against each other. You start out by picking one of four wacky wrestlers; &quot;Glittersaurus Wrecks&quot;, &quot;Mountain Man Rick&quot;, &quot;El Alacran&quot;, or &quot;The She-E-O&quot; with their arsenal of insane moves to take out their opponents. Whoever wins the most cards wins the game and you do that by collecting the most tricks. (Publisher Description)<br/><br/>Slamorama is a 2-4 player wrestling card game from Binary Cocoa! Players all play their best moves against each other to win rounds, and whoever wins the most rounds by the time the cards are gone wins the game!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>1. Each player is given a deck of 13 cards that consists of wrestling moves like punches or slaps or suplexes. 1 is the strongest &quot;move&quot; card, while 7 is the weakest.<br/><br/>2. Players then count to three and throw down what they think will be the strongest move, and whoever that is wins the round! On a tie players throw down an additional card until someone finally wins. No one wins the round if the tie occurs on the last round.<br/><br/>3. Rounds go until all players decks are empty, and whoever wins the most rounds wins!<br/><br/>Special Features:<br/>1. Each wrestler has a signature move that fits their persona. For example. Mountain Man Rick's Special move is the Salmon Slam. He literally picks people up and swings them around like a bear on the Snake River. Glittersaurus Wrecks special move is the rise and shine. She will lift you up just to bring you down. Very down.<br/><br/>2. The game allows for future expansions that will provide more wrestlers! We are planning on calling this first edition the &quot;Red Deck&quot;, and (pending successful funding) we will be coming out with a &quot;Green Deck&quot;. The Green Deck will have all new wrestlers so that you can combine decks and have up to 8 players in a game.<br/><br/>Alternate Game Modes:<br/>In a standard game of Slamorama each player gets a deck of 13 cards and can have 4 in their hand that they can look at. Each full deck of Slamorama comes with two additional gameplay modes that include the following:<br/><br/>Full Deck Mode - Where you have all 13 cards in your hand and can look at them. Saves time from having to draw cards. Gives more &quot;tactical advantage&quot;.<br/><br/>Tag Team Mode - Players choose a partner and play their cards together against opponents to win rounds! They cannot look at or tell each other what they are going to throw down however. Fun with bigger groups!<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>52 cards (13 for each wrestler)<br/><br/>3 rule cards (each with a unique way of playing the game)<br/><br/>1 tuck box to hold the cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shodo is the name given to Japanese calligraphy, considered by many people a true art, quite difficult to be perfected. Shodo art learners must have discipline and observe the techniques in each lesson taught by their master. Therefore, in this game, each player is an apprentice of this art, and therefore must execute the lessons passed by his master, joining the pieces that contain traces of traces, forming the calligraphic drawings required by one of the lessons.<br/><br/>Each player, on his turn, must manage his amount of paint, produced in his Suzuri, which will serve to acquire new pieces of strokes that complete his calligraphic designs or start new ones. The available pieces are renewed on the table as the players use them. Calligraphic drawing lesson cards are arranged randomly with each game, and players must observe the strategy of the other players to try to complete the lessons before the others, which will give them more points.<br/><br/>Completing a calligraphic drawing may not be as simple as doing so requires completing all the strokes already started. Once a drawing is completed and is also compatible with one of the available lessons (requirements may consist of the number of strokes, the shape of the drawing, or even the level of detail), the player may place one of his markers in that lesson. The first to place, in addition to receiving more points, make it impossible for the latter to place markers in the lessons.<br/><br/>Once all the lessons have been completed by at least one person, the game will be over, and it will be the winner who made the most points, obtained through the complexity of their calligraphic designs and the accomplishment of the lessons.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The timer is set and play begins.<br/><br/>Players write down words that apply to the category and whose last or major name begins with each of the selected letters. When time runs out each discloses the name he has written under each of the five letters. If only one player used a particular name, he scores 3 points. If two players use the same name, they score 2 points. If three or more players use the same name, they score 1 point. If a player did not write down a name for a letter, they do not score a point.

Players move playing pieces counter-clockwise around the numbered board to record their score. The scoring dice are: a 5 equals 50 points, a 1 equals 100 points, any 3 of a kind equals 100 times the 3-of-a-kind number. A roll of six consecutively numbered dice (a straight) on one roll equals 1500 points. A minimum of 500 points in a turn is required to get on the board. A minimum of 300 points in a turn is required to advance on the board. As long as a player rolls at least one scoring die, the player may choose to roll again to try to increase their score for that turn. The scoring dice are set aside and the non-scoring dice are picked up and rolled again. Any roll with no scoring dice ends the player's turn and no points are scored. A player may end their turn after any scoring roll and keep the points accumulated for that turn with one exception. If all six dice are scoring dice either in one roll or in a combination of rolls, the player must roll again. After the first player has scored 5000 points the other players have one last chance to outscore that player. The highest score over 5000 wins.<br/><br/>A player may NIWI an opponent by rolling a score which lands them on the same space as an opponent in front of them. That opponent must then retreat their piece to the previous NIWI corner of the board and their point count is reduced to that of the first scoring space preceding that NIWI corner. Also, the opponent must roll a minimum of 500 points to proceed on the board their next turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each turn more enemies will spawn, but that's ok because in between waves you can go salvaging to upgrade your turrets to make defending easier. At some point The Maker will send one elite monster, or maybe he will even show up to try to finish the job. If you can stop them then you win and have successfully driven him from his castle!<br/><br/>A turn is comprised of multiple phases. The first phase will have all players adding weapons or support cards to their own personal pillbox. The second phase will have monsters advance, followed by having new monsters arrive. The third phase is fending off all monsters visible. Players, in no particular order, will take turns targeting a monster they wish to shoot. If their roll is successful, they damage the monster according to their weapon. If they miss, nothing happens and another player may shoot. Instead of shooting, a player may support a teammate with one of their shots adding extra accuracy. These steps repeat until the elite monster is defeated causing the players to win, or until a single monster has re-entered the citadel causing the players to lose and have to try again another day.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A two-player abstract strategy game, reputedly originating from Chiangmai, Thailand, where it is said to be called Mhark Nheeb.<br/><br/>Players take turns to move one of their 8 marbles, which initially start on the back row of an 8&times;8 grid, any number of spaces in a horizontal or vertical direction.<br/><br/>Opposing marbles can be captures in one of two ways - enclosing or balancing.<br/><br/>Enclosing captures are made by moving a marble so as to trap one or more opposing marbles between the marble just moved and a pre-existing friendly marble, in an unbroken straight line, horizontally or vertically.  The trapped marbles are removed from the board.<br/><br/>Balancing captures occur when a player moves a marble directly in between two opponents, one on either side in a vertical or horizontal direction, upon which the two opposing marbles are removed from the board.<br/><br/>(The rules in my possession do not state that captures are compulsory, nor do they suggest that any number other than 2 opposing marbles can be captured by balancing.  Examples of enclosing captures of 1 or 2 opposing marbles are shown, from which I infer that any number (up to 6) opposing marbles may be captured in this way).<br/><br/>When a player is reduced to a single marble, he or she loses the game, unless he/she can WIN it with the very next move.<br/><br/>(The rules in my possession do not state what happens if a player is reduced from 2 or more down to zero moves in a single capture, but the implication is that this player immediately loses the game).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1565 and on a tiny island in the Mediterranean, a small garrison of Knights of St John and Maltese within Fort St Elmo face off against a massive invading force of Ottomans under their supreme naval commander, Piyale Pasha. With control of the Mediterranean as the ultimate prize, will the Knights hold out long enough for relief to arrive from Sicily or will the Pasha succeed in a stunning show of military strength?<br/>The stage is set for the greatest siege in European history.<br/><br/>The Great Siege of Malta is a wargame in two parts. Part 1: the Battle for St Elmo -  where players can re-explore the strategies and events of the famous battle; and Part 2: the Siege of Senglea (scheduled for a 2021 release) which can uniquely be combined with part 1 (the boards will fit together) for a tabletop siege of truly epic proportions.<br/><br/>Both games use tokens and/or miniatures to represent the different military units available, on a gameboard presenting a detailed tactical map of the famous locations. The game offers tactical versatility within a simple ruleset that guarantees quick play. A combination of dice and card driven gameplay with a special Command Dice mechanism forces the players to think carefully which military units they will trigger for the round based on the limited available commanders. Combat dice then resolve the outcome of each attack while giving players opportunities to influence the outcomes through card play.<br/><br/>Game rounds represent single days of the siege with the two commanders having opportunities to manipulate their troops and play additional thematically rich special cards. The game can be played as a 'recreation of history' with known events occurring in certain rounds or as a more freeform 'what if' style of game that allows players on both sides to experiment with different strategies. Winning the game is not about destroying the enemy but instead focuses more on the balance of morale between the two  opposing forces. Use superior tactics and brave challenges to improve your own morale or undermine the enemy and grab the victory!<br/><br/>The game is as historically accurate as we can make it. BadCatGames has worked closely with academic experts to ensure the game gives players an exciting opportunity to relive this most famous moment in european history in all its detail. Siege of Malta also presents the facts of history as they stand. The game does not take sides in any way and does not glorify either of the forces involved to the detriment of the other. The wargame is simply a gripping and thematic educational opportunity to experience this greatest of sieges.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player then has a chance to perform a certain number of actions within a turn which includes movement, placement of new tiles and picking up/using objects found in the mine. Every so often rockfall may happen, forcing players to need to dig out of these before continuing. Players also have to manage their energy and weight levels to stay alive and move at a sufficient pace.<br/><br/>The game is one when all players are able to make their way successfully to the elevator shaft out of the mine. Along the way, crystals can also be mined and the surviving player with the most crystals, wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

The landscape will come with a preset effect which alters each players abilities  as well as default dice rolls. A set of dice is then rolled by each of the players and combined to form combinations which enable a player to make different moves against their opponent. Every round a new landscape is drawn, so players will need to adjust their tactics per landscape.<br/><br/>The first player to have thief life points reduced to 0 ultimately loses the game. The game can be played with either one or multiple plan walkers per player, depending on length of game that is desired.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players must pay the owners of properties they land on.

All players can speculate in the stocks. The stocks, in contrast to the properties on the board, are named like real companies and some are just misspelled versions of those (e.g. Kelloogue Breakfast Foods Inc.).<br/><br/>The game features a variety of additional rules, some eccentric. Players who own kingdom properties must be addressed by title, from &quot;Lady&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot; for owning one kingdom to &quot;Maharina&quot; or &quot;Maharaja&quot; for owning all eight. A player landing on a Cupid space must seek out a player of a different gender (the rules say &quot;opposite charm&quot;) and travel with them.

In this game, you will design and build the famous bridges and buildings that earned Budapest the soubriquet &quot;The Pearl of the Danube&quot;<br/><br/>On your turn you either: a) place or advance workers on 2 (out of 7) Action Tracks, pushing previously placed workers down into more advantageous spaces; or b) retrieve 1 worker from an Action Track and pay for the resources offered at the space the worker is on. To build a structure, you need to collect a matching blueprint (for a bridge, monument, church, etc.) plus various resources (wood, stone, iron, and/or gold) as specified for the structure being built. Finally, you must claim the building site with the blueprint and deliver the resources needed to that site. On completion, you earn victory points (VPs) and receive a crest from the District where the site is located that will score additional VPs at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player who contributes most to the construction of Budapest will earn the greatest number of Victory Points and hence win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

For clever merchants it is a time of great potential. Attempt to accumulate, trade, bribe, trick and manipulate your way to becoming the richest and most influential Merchant Prince in Byzantium.<br/><br/>Game Summary: Players assume the role of an inspired merchant in ancient Byzantium, determined to develop a trading empire across the region of Anatolia during the upheavals of the time. Each player has a different character and special power taken from a range of different neighbouring cultures. Players buy trade goods in far off markets to sell in the bazaars of Byzantium, while doing their utmost to undermine and obstruct their rivals and avoid the various historical hazards of the time. Players use Trader markers to purchase and move goods appearing across the board, avoiding dangerous local events and rival player skulduggery. Later in the game players can attempt to secure influential government roles worth bonus victory points but require each role to be voted upon by all players so bribery and deal making is a must! The player with the largest and most influential merchant empire at game end is given the title of Merchant Prince of Byzantium.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "- Introduction -<br/><br/>Everwar is a fast, fun and accessible wargame, with a diesel punk aesthetic and a pixel art graphic design, very characteristic of mid'90s video games (hello Advance Wars!). The universe of Everwar is based on a fun and solid game system (easy to learn but hard to master) which develops an interesting plot that, in addition to providing a rich background, regularly introduces new mechanics and playable elements that add depth and freshness to the gaming experience through regular updates.<br/><br/>- Background -<br/><br/>The story of Everwar is set in an alternative universe that shares certain similarities with our own world. The events take place in Domum, a planet where the technological advance of humanity has evolved exclusively around internal combustion engines and fossil fuel.<br/><br/>In Domum, wars between nations have occurred on a global scale on numerous occasions throughout recent history. This has molded belligerent societies accustomed to enduring the sacrifices of long confrontations.<br/><br/>The base game of Everwar brings us to Erisland Kingdom, a nation that is mired in a bloody civil war for the succession to the throne. But something is about to change the course of history in a terrible way, and neither Erisland, nor any other nation of Domum, is prepared for it.<br/><br/>- Gameplay overview -<br/><br/>During a game of Everwar, the player's objective is to fulfill one of the scenarios victory requirements. This may include collecting a certain amount of victory points, capturing an enemies HQ or taking control of strategic objectives.<br/><br/>To do so, players will take non-consecutive turns in which the initiative is based on the orders issued to their armies.<br/><br/>Every turn, players will simultaneously choose orders that will allow them to move and engage in combat with a different number of units. Initiative is determined by the number of units activated by an order, the player activating the least number of units will gain the initiative during the turn.<br/><br/>Everwar has a dice-based combat that uses a rock(tanks)-paper(artillery)-scissor(infantry) system to determine the number of dice each player gets. This, together with terrain bonuses and flank bonuses, brings a fast and simple yet highly tactical combat experience.<br/><br/>",

Separately shuffle the ATE deck (cards with words that end in -ate) and the MANDATE deck (cards that dictate how the cluegiver must act while giving clues).<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The Mandator draws an ATE card and one MANDATE card. When they are ready to begin, the opposing team starts a 60-second timer.<br/><br/>The Mandator tries to get their team to guess as many ATE cards as possible while performing the MANDATE card.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn, the playing team has one chance to guess the current MANDATE card. If an ATE card remains unguessed when time is up, the opposing team has one chance to steal the card with a correct guess.<br/><br/>Correctly guessed ATE and MANDATE cards are one point each. A stolen ATE card is two points. A skipped ATE card (The Mandator is only allowed to skip one ATE card per turn) is minus two points.<br/><br/>The game ends when each player on a team has performed as the Mandator twice.

The deck shows visitors to a theme park, with the low cards also doubling as the costumed characters trying to get the visitors to ride on the attractions.<br/><br/>The game is played in alternating rounds of trick-taking and blind auctions. During the trick-taking, players follow normal trick-taking rules (follow the lead if possible, play a trump otherwise).<br/><br/>The winner of the round then leads a blind bidding, placing costumed cards face-down plus chips. Players that don't want to or cannot play a costumed mascot play a visitor instead, face-up as a discard. The winner of the auction collects visitors fom the other players, and sets the next trump colour.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the players get points for the visitors they have earned, and a bonus for colour majorities.<br/><br/>The deck consists of cards 1-15 in 4 colors. Ranks 1-8 are &quot;Visitor&quot; cards, and ranks 9-15 may either be a &quot;Visitor&quot; card of rank 9-15 or rotated 180 degrees to be a &quot;Costumed&quot; card of rank 1-3. The game also comes with bidding chips which are distributed to the players.<br/><br/>The lead player has the option of starting a &quot;Visitor&quot; trick or a &quot;Costumed&quot; bid. A &quot;Visitor&quot; trick proceeds as a standard trick-taking game with players each playing a card from their hand (following suit if possible), and the winner being the player that played the highest ranked trump card, and if none were played, the highest ranked card in the lead suit.<br/><br/>In a &quot;Costumed&quot; bid, any player, including the lead player, that plays a &quot;Costumed&quot; card, plays it face down. Such players can also add up to 3 of their bidding chips to their card. Any player who does not want to or cannot play a &quot;Costumed&quot; card instead plays a &quot;Visitor&quot; card face up. At the end of the trick, the highest combined value of chips and &quot;Costumed&quot; card takes the trick, with the latter played breaking ties. The trump suit for &quot;Visitor&quot; rounds is determined by the last &quot;Costumed&quot; card color to win a &quot;Costumed&quot; trick.<br/><br/>The winner of the &quot;Costumed&quot; trick chooses between scoring all &quot;Visitor&quot; cards played to the trick that match the color of the winning costume or acquiring cards of this color from in front of the other players.<br/><br/>Players play a predetermined number of rounds, with the rules suggesting 3. Points are earned based upon the visitors scored during &quot;Costumed&quot; tricks and the number of colors of visitors obtained during &quot;Visitor&quot; tricks.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The game will come with several full-fledged campaigns and can be played from 1 to 10 players (or more). The campaign is built in such a way that the players can play different stages at the same table or individually at home, and update the state of the game/world based on their progress. It's possible to drop out or jump into any game at any time, as each player controls their own army/faction. The game can adapt to any situation on the fly, without the need to restart or wait for each other. The game will come with an app, so you will be able to engage in a campaign with anyone around the world.<br/><br/>The theme of the game is based on a never before used (in boardgames) high-fantasy IP that will be revealed later next year.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If a player manages to trap an opponents piece the trapped piece is removed from the board. The player eliminating all pieces of the opponent wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The chess pieces are designed with local characteristics, and players can use them to travel through different districts in Hong Kong. Victoria Harbour On Board can bring players closer together and enhance their understanding of the different districts in Hong Kong. It is a very special souvenir with Hong Kong characteristics. (from game box)<br/><br/>Players start their custom, Hong Kong-themed pieces at square on on the heavy paper playmat. They then roll a die to progress to square 81 encountering various Hong Kong landmarks on the way. Similar to Snakes and Ladders, these landmarks can move you ahead or send you back on your path. For example, landing on square 23 lets you take the tram to square 29. While essentially a reskinning of Snakes and Ladders, the Hong Kong theme and nice metal tokens makes this a fun souvenir that can spark memories of a visit through playing the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Adlerangriff is the German word meaning Attack of the Eagles, the assault on south-east England by The Luftwaffe which was to be undertaken prior to the invasion of the British Isles and this term was used by the Germans to define what the British referred to as The Battle of Britain.<br/><br/>Whilst Fighter Command R.A.F was spread over airfields in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Island, only those squadrons in the south-east would be able to interfere with an invasion which, it was expected, would take place along the south coast between Dover and Weymouth. The battle will, therefore, be fought over the area covered by No 11 Group. If the Luftwaffe can permanently destroy the Sector Stations and Airfields of No 11 Group, thus immobilizing the fighters that use them, the invasion can be undertaken.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Shayd can be engaged at any time, but players need some great equipment to stand a chance.  And the pieces of the Dragon Armor can be found in the Treasure players loot from Monsters.<br/><br/>Players take turns and on each player's turn, they can Equip new treasure and Recharge their Action cards.  They then can move to a new area or remain where they are, and finally they will attack a Monster.  If the Monster is still alive, it will retaliate against the player.<br/><br/>Combat is decided with simple dice rolls with Attack and Defense augmented by equipment or actions.  When a Monster is defeated, players who are in combat with the Monster roll dice (augmented with the Loot stat) to see how much Treasure they receive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, we sages of the Great Temple can move an object through the fabric of the world, breaking the teachings of time and being.The Great Masters use their power to help the people, and seek enlightenment.<br/><br/>But I fear others will use it to oppress, and kill.&rdquo;<br/><br/>- Sage Yamasakura of the Great Temple.<br/><br/>A Skirmish miniatures game for 2 to 4 players, Taiyō Dynasties takes place in an alternate history Feudal Japan where humans never existed and beastmen took their place. As a third great war looms over the nation of Hanani, Taiyō, the magical life force that flows through all things, has been harnessed by the clans and warriors of the land. As tensions grow between the Wafuto Imperial Army and the oppressed Atsuda clans, warlords and vagrant ronin alike seek to unlock the mysterious powers of Taiyō, and turn the tides of battle in their favour.<br/><br/>This box includes everything you need to play a two person game; Taiyō Dynasties is a skirmish-scale wargame, and uses very few models - keeping everything quick and easy, from the painting to the playing.<br/><br/>Rules and resources for the game are presented on cards, all included in the box, and decisive actions are decided through simple six-sided dice rolls. Coins are used to add resource management mechanics to the game, and lend the game a degree of tactical depth that can keep even the most competitive wargamers coming back for more.<br/><br/>Players can choose their warbands from the unique clans and factions of Hanani, and with their forces they will wage war for land, riches and honour. With the clash of katanas, the whistling of arrows and the incantations of ancient magic, ancestral enemies settle age-old grudges and new rivalries are born among new recruits in glorious moments.<br/><br/>The land of Hanani is torn apart by the War of the Falling Petal, and all must choose a side; Ally yourself with the  Wafuto Imperial Army and crush your enemy with superior steel, or take up arms with the Atusda Vanguard and defend the holy sites of your ancestors with guerrilla tactics. Take the vows of the Akira yakuza, and cut deals and establish yourself within the crime syndicates operating right under the shogunate's nose. Meanwhile, the Reputan Trade Federation is open to those of a mercenary leaning, who would seek riches and treasures on the high seas, indifferent to the ideologies driving the War.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After initial setup, there is the deployment phase; During this phase, each team will pick up new army units and place them into areas of the map they already control.<br/><br/>Next is the Movement/fortification phase; during this phase, Caesar mobilizes his orbital weapons, moving them around on the map to create his opening for an attack. Also, each team will fortify their defensive positions on the map.<br/><br/>The last phase is the attack phase; During this phase each team will make their attacks on the map, either moving into an unoccupied zone with or without opposition from the opposing team, or invade enemy territory in an attempt to take it over.<br/><br/>At the end of each of the attack phases, both leaders will check to see if they have been discovered. If they have, then they are placed on the map and can now be attacked during the attack phase.<br/><br/>The team that captures the country where the enemy leader is located on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "エンペリズム (Emperism)    is a Japanese card game for two fast players.<br/><br/>Two empires have been fighting for a long time. You will be the one who is involved in the struggle. Move the soldiers to defeat the emperor of the enemy country, while protecting the emperor of your country from attack.<br/><br/>Once you have decided on the player's country (blue or red), set up your initial hand with the emperor of the country + 3 soldier cards of the same color. The player chooses one of four actions alternately and repeats this until one of the emperor cards is discarded. If you discard the emperor card from the opponent's hand, you win!<br/><br/>The emperor involved in the victory condition is strong in defense, and usually can not be defeated in the middle. But the emperor will be weakened if the number of cards in the hand is less than three. So in this game it is important to keep replenishing your hand moderately, by drawing from a common deck where enemy and ally cards are mixed.<br/><br/>A player cannot take an enemy's card into their hand, so it must be discarded if drawn. Otherwise, you can freely add your own country or affiliation card to your hand or put it into play. Also, cards placed on the battlefield can be drawn like a deck, and if it is not the enemy's country, it is added to the hand.<br/><br/>A player will play tactically and try to bluff their opponent, and reduce the enemy's hand, forcing their emperor into defeat.<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the &lsquo;War to end all wars&rsquo;, there came another war. And it was not as static as the first. Before and during World War 2 many nations and individuals invented or exploited new tactics and ideas, that even culminated in a range of specialist forces within the specialist forces. Marines and airborne infantry were known concepts, and often from within these groups of soldiers new tactical formations emerged to perform what we now call Special Operations.<br/>HBG is proud to present the Special Operations Forces &copy; Expansion. Special Operations Forces were small sized units not suitable for capturing land zones. Instead their small size and unique training made them specialists in raiding operations and sabotage. They were versatile in ways of damaging enemy supply lines, facilities, fighting partisans and even occasional assassinations of high profile enemy personalities as well as spearheading large scale amphibious attacks. This type of warfare often meant certain death if caught.<br/>This expansion enables you to take control of your nation&rsquo;s special forces, often entering at the historical date of formation, and maneuver them behind enemy lines to wreak havoc or pave the way for your troops on the front. But remember, the risky nature of the operations can have them eliminated before they can fullfill their mission.

Each army intent on conquering the unnamed island. In the distance a new shadow rises over the horizon, the dreaded Frost Jotunn Bergelmir stalks forth intent on claiming the island for his own.<br/><br/>Return to the unnamed island with this exciting 4 player expansion, complete with new land types, new land boards that further expand the borders of the unnamed island.

Each team is rated for Hit ability and Run percentage. You sum up the Hit For (HF) of the attacking team and Hit Against of the defending team, divide the result by two (rounding down) and convert the result to a letter. Roll two six sided die on the Hits Table and cross the result of the roll with the letter you have found before. The number obtained is the number of hits scored by the attacking team during the game. Now check the conversion percentage of the team to see how many hits become runs: roll a percentage die (two ten sided dice of different colors, one of them for the  tens digits, the other for the single digits) for each hit and if the roll is equal or below the percentage factor, it become a run, otherwise not.<br/><br/>Repeat the procedure for the opposing team and you'll have the final result for the game.

        "description": "Noalon is a hand management game for two players in which there are only two types of cards.<br/><br/>The game contains an equal number of red and black cards. Each player has a hand of twelve cards and tries to work towards a winning hand. Hands are formed based on the sequence of red and black cards in your hand, so you can't freely rearrange the order of your cards. The other catch is that you draw cards two at a time, insert them next to each other, and always discard two adjacent cards.<br/><br/>Scoring follows this rule: a set is a sequence of N cards starting from one edge of your held cards, followed by the same number N cards of the other color. You may only use one set to calculate your score. If the leftover cards not in the set would form a set on their own then the point value of your hand is half the number of leftovers; otherwise it's the full number of leftover cards.<br/><br/>Points are to be avoided. You can go out if you have four or fewer points in your hand. When someone goes out, players compare hands and the player with more points is the loser, and takes points equal to the difference in points with a bonus for a perfect hand (0 points) or undercut (where the person who went out had the worse hand). The first player to collect nine points loses the game.<br/><br/>-- user summary<br/><br/>",

Or will they ultimately rage and cancel their plans? Can friendship be stronger than rage?<br/><br/>Rage-o-Meter Description:<br/>Rage-o-Meter is a 3 to 6 players cooperative card game about anger management and the strength of friendship where the players win or lose together.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>Players are offered to choose from the six GinGee Gang Gang friends, each with their own quirks and ticks. The main objective is to make it to the bottom of the Event deck with everyone mostly intact. (The GinGee Gang Gang friends are here to have a good time at this concert after all)<br/><br/>Gameplay (In Brief):<br/>After determining who amongst the players is the &quot;Angry Friend&quot;, it is their responsibility to keep track of time/rounds and the number of explosions. Once Meeting Time is decided amongst the group, and the Travel Time is set to be an hour prior (Travel Time is flexible depending on play group). Players are then assigned one of six GinGee Gang Gang friends to play as and collects the necessary items for their hand (ex: Character Board, Character ID card and stand, 3 Snack Tokens unless the player plays as Brie, they get 4 Snack tokens, and 3 Disruption Cards).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to reach the bottom of the Event Deck without Travel Time catching to Meeting Time, and/or hitting 10 cumulative explosions.<br/><br/>Players have 3 actions where they:<br/><br/>     Draw an event then react accordingly (ex: Lose/Gain # of Rage, Gain a Snack Token, Add 5 minutes to Travel Time, etc.)<br/>     Draw a Chat card, roll a dice, then apply effects to the group or individuals specified (ex: Lose/Gain # of Rage)<br/>     A choice between eating 1 Snack (which helps diminish Rage) or Do Nothing<br/><br/><br/>Teamwork, planning, looking out for one another, and a little bit of luck will help reaching the bottom of the Event deck with everyone mostly intact.

        "description": "1,000,000,000 years ago&hellip;<br/>Mars was a flourishing planet teaming with life and vast seas. As the magnetic field over Mars was weakened, radiation began to dry up the seas and solar winds caused the atmosphere to deplete. As the atmosphere depleted, the planet&rsquo;s ability to maintain heat decreased as well. As the millennia passed and the natural resources began to run low, the dwindling civilizations of Mars were forced to follow the rapidly shrinking seas. <br/>There is just one natural water source left, and not enough of it for everyone. In an increasingly harsh environment, the few remaining races of Mars struggle for survival.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Players will each represent a leader of one of the six remaining races of ancient Mars. Their goal is to claim the only remaining fertile land as their own and preserve it for as long as possible. At the start of the game players can take one action in each of three categories (political, civil, and military). As the game progresses, players will expand their influence, allowing additional actions of each type. Players will use their actions to gather resources, build atmosphere factories to slow the depletion of oxygen, and train armies to fend off the other races. Each race is equipped with unique abilities allowing for various approaches to victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Manipulate fashion trends in Trend Color to come out on top!<br/><br/>In the game, you secretly start with two colors (out of eight), and you want those colors to end up trending or (alternatively) be rare and hard to find so that you can score the most points with them. At the start of the game, you'll set up a trend board with 1-8 different color tokens, with spaces for those colors being paired in lines. If you end up with five tokens on the board, for example, two of those colors will be paired, while the other three will be next to blank spaces; those three colors might be paired with something over the five rounds of the game.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, you fill up the shop card display so that it contains five cards; each card has room for 2-5 color tokens. On a turn, you draw a color token from the bag, then place it on one of the available shop cards. If you fill the final space, you claim the card, place 1-3 of these tokens on the trend board (placing an unrepresented color in a new row and matching other tokens that already have their color present), keeping the remaining tokens as your earnings, then exiting the round. If you're the first player out in a round, you score bonus points.<br/><br/>If you place the fifth token of a color on the trend board, you decide whether to remove all tokens of that color or keep them where they are. If you remove them, a player can add that color to the trend board again in the future, possibly in a different row.<br/><br/>Once all players have a shop card, the round ends, then you refill the shop card area (leaving the lone card there in place with any tokens on it) and begin a new round. After the fifth round, the game ends and players score points: Tokens of the two colors that appear in the longest line on the trend board are worth 3 points each; tokens of the two colors in the second-longest line are worth 2 points each, in the third-longest line 1 point each, and in the shortest line 0 points each. If a color isn't present on the trend board, those tokens are worth 2 points each. Tokens of the same color as your two secret color cards are worth twice as many points as they would be otherwise. Add points for your token earnings to any bonus points you received. Whoever has the highest score has dominated the trends and wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The fate of Ancient China is at stake as several dynasties struggle for supremacy. As a leader of a dynasty, you must position your forces at the right time at the right state to claim it for yourself.<br/><br/>The Ancient China consists of 12 states, each of them surrounded by six grid points where armies may be placed. Some grid points border several states, hence making their armies more powerful. You claim a state if you have the most armies at the end of a round. You win if you claim 3/4/5 states (5/4/3 players).<br/><br/>Each round you compete for a state You do so by playing cards representing either two tactics (light) or one tactics (dark). Each card also represents one strategy. One light card may be played each turn together with none or one dark card. Each card played must match either a tactics or a strategy of your previously played light card.<br/><br/>When you pass you take the battle field of all tactics and strategies where you have a majority. Tactical battle field cards let you place new armies while strategic cards let you manipulate already placed armies. Also, an early pass gives you an early pick of new cards from a drawing row. However, it makes the remaining battle field cards easier to get for the other players.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>When the round ends, you claim the state if you have the most armies around it. Also, all previous states are reassessed to see if the majority has changed. (Remember that an army may reach more states.) One of the battle field cards allows you to decide the next state to battle for to take advantage of well positioned armies.<br/><br/>The mechanism of playing the right cards and placing the armies right creates a double majority game where you must manage both cards and board to get the upper hand. Also, the fact that armies may reach more states may turn tactical losses at one state to a strategic victory as other states are claimed instead.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The research objective is to explore how weapons capabilities shape player behavior and the resulting impacts on strategic stability and the potential for escalation in a crisis. The board game serves as both a source of experimental data and a testing ground for the ruleset and game dynamics that were subsequently built into the SIGNAL online platform.<br/><br/>In SIGNAL, players choose courses of action that a hypothetical nation might follow, using economic, military, and diplomatic means. Players may choose to cooperate with or compete against the other players in the virtual world to grow their infrastructure and gain resources while avoiding loss of home territory to conventional militarized invasions or nuclear war. The game proceeds in rounds, with players maneuvering their forces within a map-based environment.<br/><br/>Players work simultaneously, often negotiating agreements such as trade deals or military alliances, and &ldquo;signal&rdquo; to others by placing tokens on hexes (units of land or water). The signaling token is accompanied by the staging of cards (face down) that reflect actions like building cities, sending troops to neutral territories, or engaging in military operations, including the use of conventional or nuclear arms. There is a price associated with signaling; players pay for each card placed, regardless of whether the capability is exercised to reflect the &ldquo;costly signaling&rdquo; or &ldquo;credible commitments&rdquo; in the existing theoretical literature on deterrence. Players may then exercise their staged actions, but only at locations where signaling tokens were previously placed.<br/><br/>During this action phase, players take a series of turns, starting with a randomly chosen player to ensure that any given player does not have a constant first-mover advantage. After five rounds, players are ranked on a relative scale based on their infrastructure, resources, and territorial integrity to determine the winner&mdash;with a player&rsquo;s cumulative performance captured on a leaderboard.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Australian World War 2 roll and move game where the object is to be the first player to get 2 counters around a game board and return home to Australia via New Zealand. Players follow a path of both land and sea set through various Naval and European battle scenes which provide either advantages or penalties upon landing on them. The center of the board is a picture of King George VI. A players first counter must reach the King before his second counter can enter the game.<br/>The graphics are interesting for their depictions of Mussolini and Hitler. There are also images of early Allied aircraft and warships such as the HMS Repulse. The game is dated 1940 (Italy entered the War in June that year and the HMS Repulse was sunk by December 1941).

        "description": "Stock Market&ndash; stock exchange board game<br/><br/>- a business world strategy game<br/><br/>- large, rollable gaming mat, easy to care<br/>- new way to play: no dice needed (option)<br/>If they believe, they&rsquo;ve see everything in the field of financial strategy games, here comes absolutely revolutionary way to play. Realistic, easy to play, but not too simple. Stock Exchange business is not that easy in real life also. No need for paper or other memo materials. Playing could be just as intensive and stress loaded as real life stock broker life, while waiting for the profits to come and still everything could collapse in a moment.<br/>The game suits best for the advanced players over 10 years old. It&rsquo;s a demanding product for those, who likes to dive into parallel universe of game<br/><br/>The Idea&hellip;<br/>Stock Market is a reality game following the rules of stock exchange world, where assets increase is mostimportant. In this game the Players are both: brokers and investors. The Bank sells tokens used forinvesting. As in real stock market, the idea is to buy low and sell high. The rates change every turn, eachPlayers can make one or multiplied exchanges on own turn. Dice can be used to play, but usually StockMarket is played with finger marks, that determine the rate vectors. The duration of one game can bedefined by players, e.g. 40 or 60 min. The person to make most of their capital within the agreed timebrackets is the winner.ATTENTION: Dramatic turns in the body of the game can cause stress symptoms when taken too seriously.It was our goal to make this game as real as possible following stock exchange ups and lows dramas.Anyway, this is a virtual reality only. Relax and enjoy!<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>To begin:Roll open Lite Lion Games rollable Stock market gaming mat. Place violet rate detectors to the mid-space, marked &ldquo;0&rdquo;. At least two players are recommended to be on the opposite side of eachother/other side of the table to make the finger marks drawing easier. The Players choose own colourfrom the four colours available. Each Player gets 5 pcs tokens of the corresponding colour, each ofnominal value of LL$400 of investment, and LL$2320 cash. The cash money is issued as following: 1 pcsLL$1000, 6 pcs LL$100, 9 pcs LL$50, 9 pcs LL$20 and 9 pcs LL$10. The investment tokens can beexchanged to cash in the Bank as equal to LL$400 each.The beginner can be chosen in any suitable way, as coin draw and etc. In according to the sequence ofturns, each Player has equal amount of turns per game.<br/><br/>The Turn<br/><br/>The Rate:For each turn two Players draw the number. The number is counted together on fingers of two Playersat once: The Player, whose turn in on and any other Player as agreed. The hand is hidden behind theback or under the table and when released, the amount 0-5 can be shown on fingers (as pictured). Thegross number on both Players&rsquo; hands valued 1-10 is the number of the share to move. It can go up or<br/><br/>down. The violet indicator is moved one step up to down to show the quote of the particular share.The position of the palm is important: if both Players&rsquo; palm is facing down, the rate decreases, otherwisethe rate increases. If both Players shows zero, the rate of each share 1-10 decreases one level. If bothPlayers show same even number, the vector of each even number share (2,4,6,8,10) is moved one step.If both Players show same odd number, the vector of each odd number share (1,3,5,7,9) is moved onestep.ATTENTION: Step and Level enjoy different relevancy. Step is one space on the rate indicator vector,when Level is a grade on the vertical vector.<br/><br/>Changing the Rates with Dice:The Player of the upcoming turn throws one of dice first. Numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 increase the Rate by onestep. Numbers 1 and 2 decrease the Rate by one step. Then the Players throw two dice. The grossnumber is the number of the Share, which goes up or down. The violet Rate Indicator is moved one stepforward or back. If dice return gross number 12, all the Shares 2-11 decrease one level. If both dicereturn with same even number, the vector of each even number Share (2,4,6,8,10) is moved one step. .If both dice return with same odd number, the vector of each odd number Share (1,3,5,7,9) is movedone step.ATTENTION: Step and Level enjoy different relevancy. Step is one space on the rate indicator vector,when Level is a grade on the vertical vector. When played with dice,Shares are marked with numbers 2-11, so Share #1 equals with number11 on dice. Dice gross number 12 is equal to zero on fingers. Otherwisethe instructions are same.<br/><br/>Quotation changes:Quotation changes after each Trade (buy/sell) event except the firstinvestment round. As the Asset is invested, the Quotation Indicator ismoved a step forward. As the Asset is released (the Shares are sold out),the quotation indicator moves a step back. The changes take place afterthe trade event is completed. The quotation always moves one stepdespite the value of the trade event. The Quotation Indicator moves asillustrated considering steps 1-7. The horizontal step does not changethe rate. When moving downwards, the Indicator moves same, but inthe opposite direction. When Rate Level changes, the Indicator goes over green or red line.<br/><br/>Exchange:As Exchange Rate changes, the Player completes the Trade. Each Turn allows to make multiple Trades(Buy/Sell Events). The Player invests one or more Units into the chosen Enterprise. One non-recurringinvestment nominal value is $400.<br/>Investment Purchase Rate:<br/>If the Rate Indicator is in zero space (&ldquo;0&rdquo;), the Investment is in its nominal value of $400. <br/>If the RateIndicator is e.g. +20, the Investor has to pay $400+$20=$420&hellip;..<br/>If the Rate is e.g. -60, the Investment is $60 below the nominal value, so they can get a $60 refund from the Bank or buy the shares for $400-$60=$340.<br/><br/>The Investment token is placed to the same space with the Rate Indicator.Investment Sales Rate ProfitIf the Investment Token is in e.g. in space &ldquo;0&rdquo; (zero) and Rate Indicator is in space &ldquo;+40&rdquo;, the Investmentis evaluated $400+$40. So, the Investor gets $40 profit. NOTE: When selling shares out, the investedsum is not refunded to the Bank but stays in the possession of the Investor (the Player). The Investorgets interest from the Bank $40 for each invested unit. (?) Lost<br/>If the Investment token is in space &ldquo;-20&rdquo; and the Rate is &ldquo;-60&rdquo;, the Player&rsquo;s Investment is $40 below purchase price, so when selling, the Investor has to pay $40 to the Bank for each Invested Unit. So, the Player gains a loss of $40. The Investment token returns to its nominal value of $400 after this action.Exchange commissionThe Exchange charges a commission for each assignment. Each Investment Unit placed into Shares isdue to the brokerage of $10.<br/><br/>Rate Development<br/>Top Rate<br/>Reaching its top value, the Rate development stops. Getting a raise claim, while enjoying the top rateposition, the Rate collapse three levels down, e.g. from level +120 to level +60.<br/>Bottom Rate<br/>Reaching its bottom value, the Rate development gets out of control. Getting a reduce claim, whileenjoying the bottom rate position, the Share turns valueless and all the Investment have to be returnedto the Bank without reimbursement. This action forces the Rate back to zero level.<br/><br/>Trades Between Investors<br/>The Players are allowed to trade Shares/Investments between each other. The trades occur accordingthe Rate levels. Reciprocal trading is not due to commissions, neither it influences the Rate. The buyerplaces their Investment token instead of the Seller&acute;s ones, and the Seller&rsquo;s tokens are returned to theBank. The Bank does not pay for the tokens as they are paid by the Buyer. The price can be also agreedin-between the parties, as in some cases singular Investor for particular Share is an advantage.<br/><br/>The Winner<br/>The game is over when the agreed time period is full. As the Investments are liquidated, the Player who gains the biggest capital is the winner. The game is also over, if every Share&rsquo;s Rate is in its top value. Thiscondition also enforces Investments&rsquo; liquidation.DurationDuration of one game round is subject to the number of Players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast-paced, strategic tile-laying game of interstellar discovery and settlement.<br/><br/>As a newly commissioned interstellar merchant captain you are competing to scout out new worlds and markets, navigate the best travel lines, wisely gather resources, shrewdly hire crew members with unique abilities, and strategically establish bases. Race your small spacefaring trade vessel across the galaxy cleverly plan your course of the choices routes to reach the most valuable worlds while earning travel fees along vital navigation routes. Once a player has built all their bases the game ends and winner will be the one outmaneuver their rivals with more bases on sets of planets and in the longest interconnected route.<br/><br/>Overview of Play:<br/>Moving through or ending a turn on a planet provides one resource cube of the matching color. Each base built on a planet is worth victory points totaled at the end of the game. Different planet colors have different values and some permit special actions. Bonus points are earned for having bases on matching planet colors as well as on sets of all three colors. Additionally, special crew members granting players unique actions can be purchased by spending resource cubes at the starting home-world tile.<br/><br/>When the final planet tile has been placed and that player has taken their final turn actions, the game immediately ends and scoring takes place. The winner will be the player who accumulated the most points from building sets of planetary bases. The longest connected route along interstellar navigation lines also scores a bonus and bases on rarer planet colors are worth more than common ones. The player who triggers the end of the game by placing their final base also earns 1 additional bonus point for doing so. When a player is down to just a single base, as a courtesy they should announce it to the other players.<br/><br/>Players move their trade vessels between stars and planets along navigation routes carefully collecting resources along the way to spend on building planetary bases.<br/>Both ending a turn with your ship on a planet, or just passing through the planet on your travels, provides one resource cube of the matching color &mdash;either grey, red, or blue.<br/>Each base built on a planet is worth commerce points totaled at the end of the game. But beware, building where other players already have a base costs extra and just passing through a planet with another player&rsquo;s base provides them travel fees!<br/><br/>Points are earned immediately when a base is built on a planet. Each additional base the player might later build one the planet also scores points. But a player cannot build two of their bases directly on top of one another. They can only build another base at the same planet when it will go on top of another player&rsquo;s base.<br/>Special planets &mdash;purple, yellow, orange&mdash; offer unique actions such as exchanging resources or earning extra resource cubes. On certain planets crew members can also be hired that offer special actions to improve movement, exploration, trade, or builds.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Space Tiles - 1 start tile, 15 stellar tiles, 3 blue planets, 3 red planets, 3 gray planets, 2 yellow planets, 1 purple planet, 1 orange planet, 1 green planet, 1 nebula, 1 supernova, 1 wormhole.<br/>5 player trade ships in five colors - blue, red, green, purple, yellow.<br/>25 Resources Cubes in three colors - grey, red, blue.<br/>Base Markers - 8 base markers in the five player colors.<br/>5 scoring markers - (identical to the player base markers) <br/>1 Score Board<br/>20 Crew Member cards<br/>1 Rulebook<br/><br/>",

You bring your heart for this corner of history.<br/><br/>BRL 1192 Operation Torch and Beyond is the 7th expansion to BRL 1192: Tobruk Deprogrammed and includes new layouts, art and proper counters for the overhead infantry.<br/><br/>Game description of BRL 1192 from the publisher:<br/><br/>In the early 1970's an innovator and ordnance expert named Harold &quot;Hal&quot; Hock got his hands on a document unseen outside of military circles: BRL 1192 (Ballistics Research Lab, Document No. 1192). The data within became the core of the ground-breaking design, Tobruk: Tank Battles in North Africa 1942.<br/><br/>Years later, an MIT-grad and devotee saw the potential of reverse-engineering the 'programmed instruction' rules; the result is something that brings back the approach to tank vs. tank warfare, and keeps the approach true, creating a truly unique system of recreating the war in North Africa and beyond.<br/><br/>BRL 1192: Tobruk Deprogrammed is an enhanced edition of the original Tobruk; the heart of the game remains the same, but now it can be enjoyed with a deprogrammed 24-page rulebook, revised play aids, a comprehensive selection of counters representing the men, weapons and machinery of WWII North Africa, plus a collection of geomorphic maps and new terrain overlays.<br/><br/>",

The start player is the last to have seen a fox or a racoon.

The publisher chooses not to identify the game designers or artists, listing them only as Bodlanca.<br/><br/>Animals living on Mt. Mayakashi use magic and are masters of disguise. Late at night, they transform their appearance and begin outfoxing each other. The winner of this game is highly acclaimed as the best magician on the mountain.<br/><br/>Each player has an index card and a health card with their health shown in coloured bars from 10 to 1. As the game progresses, players lose or gain Health Points (HP) and when a player's HP falls to zero or lower, the game ends. The player with the highest HP is the winner.<br/><br/>The deck has a mix of attack cards, defence cards, ability cards, and cards with no effect. The deck is shuffled and players are dealt a hand of five (hand limit is seven).<br/><br/>The active player plays a card face-down and declares the card's name. The player may choose to lie or be truthful. If no player calls out &quot;Doubt&quot;, the card's effect takes place (presumably it is shown).<br/><br/>If however a player did call out &quot;Doubt&quot;, the card is shown now. If the player was truthful, the caller recieves 1 point of damage. If the player was false, they recieve a point of damage instead. The card effect is resolved, and then player draws a card to their hand.<br/><br/>If they now have more than seven cards, they discard down, and the turn moves clockwise.<br/><br/>The card effects are simple and evident, attack does damage, defence blocks or defers it, and the abilities are to draw two cards, or heal one point, or view another player's hand, or no effect at all.<br/><br/>",

Years later, sparked by the death of an asheim jarl in a sudden windstorm, the coast dwelling warriors of Asheim make their revenging assaults over the frozen hills of Wintergrim, east through Stormshade on the spirits of Vanheim, a realm of strangely lush forests in an otherwise wintry mountain area. The time has come to seek control over the mountain dwelling creatures that seem to warm and cool the winds to the will of the spirits.<br/><br/>Find new areas and paths, build structures, hire workers, warriors and leaders, and use tactics and weather to your advantage.

Your units can move in/out of structures, between your own areas, or to/from enemy areas by first moving to a Path.

        "description": "名刺じゃんけん&minus;出会いにカンシャ! (Meishi Janken-deai ni kansha) means 'Business Card Janken - thanks for meeting!'. Deai ni kansha! is a shady phrase, which would translate to &quot;Let's be thankful for us getting to know each other!&quot;, suggesting the satirical nature of the game. Janken is the Japanese name for Rock Scissors Paper, and is quite popular in Japan as a way of deciding things. For example, a group of several players will use it quickly to choose the start player. In this game, it means more like a way of proving your claim.<br/><br/>In Japan, business culture is very strict, and each salaryman has their own business card. It becomes more than a contact, it becomes a symbol, the soul of the businessman. There is a polite way to give and receive a business card. It's claimed a person might get fired for bending a card they've been handed. So the designers intentionally mock the sacred nature of business cards with this frivolous game.<br/><br/>The game is played with a deck of fake but highly realistic business cards (two are real). (So realistic, I walked off with one by mistake at the Tokyo Game Market, thinking it was the publisher's card). With company logos styled like Yapoo!, NYSO, Fugitsu, Noodle, the cards have names, addresses, QR codes, the lot.<br/><br/>Meishi Janken - Deai ni Kansha! is a game to group together more people (by their business cards) by announcing what they have in common. The game takes place at an inter-industry exchange meeting. The players each start with a hand of 4 to 6 business cards, depending on the number of players, and try to group them with other cards as potential business partners according to what the owners of the business cards might have in common. In playing the game, cards are placed face-up, and players identify common features between cards. The colours, the logos, the names of people, the addresses, any information that matches can count.<br/><br/>Each time you add a card to a group, state what feature the new card (that is, the person) shares with the group in addition to the features already shared among the group (so as to &quot;deepen the ties&quot;), and that group will belong to you. Otherwise, replace a card in your hand by discarding it in the party area and drawing a card from the deck. You can also choose to add the cards in the party area to any group. The game ends when the deck runs out and the players have    used up their cards. At the end of the game, the player who has grouped the most cards wins as the &quot;networking master&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is intended for humour and satire, but the publishers remind you to be respectful of people's private information, since you can use real business cards too.<br/><br/>",

Tough their survival, the Werewolf leaves bloodied bandages, scared residents and frightened creatures as they search structures and landmarks in the hope of finding food or potions to help them in their quest for survival.<br/><br/>From there, the townsfolk take on one of seven different roles all with different abilities and weapons. Their job is to track down and kill the Werewolf through their abilities that include traps, sabotage, setting fire to areas and many more. Each Villager has their own set of abilities and no-two are alike.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This sets out (1) how long each pitch should be, (2) the order of the cards that needs to be introduced, (3) if you are pitching on your own or as a team, and (4) the game mode - Study mode means you're allowed to look at your cards and Blind mode means that you aren't allowed looking at your cards until you start pitching.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 3 Key Phrase cards and 1 Physical Product card. You then combine these cards according to the FundIt card's pitching criteria to create a new business idea.<br/><br/>After everyone pitches, each player votes for their favourite pitch/product idea by giving their Physical Product card to that player. The player with the most Physical Product cards ends the round and takes the FundIt card.<br/><br/>PitchEasy has 3 available versions:<br/><br/>    Filtered (SFW) - May contain adult humour.<br/>    Unfiltered (NSFW) - Contains sexual innuendos and adult humour. <br/>    Filthy (Definitely NSFW) - Contains a lot  of sexual innuendos, adult humour and political incorrectness.<br/><br/><br/>Find your 1 in a million idea today.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maybe the most recognizable walker on the planet today, the Mickey has given birth to a huge range of machines build on its rugged chassis. In the Pacific or the Middle-East, the Allies use a tropical version of the same chassis, whose main feature is an open top turret. The deadliest arsenal of the Mickey stays the same.<br/>Filling a gap in the Allied armored arsenal between the Mickey (Light) and the Pounder, the Barking Dog (Light) is an excellent anti-tank walker and can serve as a close support vehicle. Its six recoilless guns fire in sequence, aimed at the same point thanks to a very advanced targeting system. The Marines&rsquo; Light Barking Dog is similar to the prototype tested by the Army, but has an open-topped turret for better vision and cross-country performance. It is probably the most popular walker in the Marine Corps&rsquo; arsenal.<br/>This reference allows you to field one of these two walkers.<br/><br/>This reference comes with two Dust 1947 unit cards. Like all regular Dust 1947 miniatures, it comes already assembled and primed. It's ready for the battlefield, or for painting, as you wish! You can directly paint over on it, since the priming serves as an undercoat and is compatible with any type of paint.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Smugglers is a humorous retro-style board game set in the late 1980's, where players smuggle goods in old cars between Norway and Sweden. During the game players choose missions with low, medium or high risk/reward, and move on a network of roads using dice. Players can buy helpful items such as a punch card for access to a safer and shorter route, nitro for additional speed, and a trailer for moving more cargo pr. run. Speed is key to outrun the police, and to reclaim stolen cargo/money from hijackers. There's also items for bribing both police and customs personnel, a possibility otherwise determined by dice. The more beaten up a car is the more it increases the chance of getting noticed at the border, so outer damage should be fixed when possible at a repair shop. Damage to the vehicle or cargo, finding extra money, and many other good or bad situations are determined by dice, as well as cards with thematic and often comical descriptions. After 4 rounds consisting of 30 turns each, the smuggler with the largest fortune on a secret bank account is the winner!<br/><br/>The game's retro-style isn't only due to its late 80's setting, but also because both game-play and components (one-colored cards and tokens) are in line with a release from a simpler era in board games. Such homages are often seen in electronic games, so instead - here's one in board games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This system was designed to provide a fast yet satisfying game play, not necessarily a &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; simulation of battle recreation. Bases or &lsquo;Units&rsquo; in the game do not represent a certain number of men or artillery pieces but are abstract representations of force.<br/><br/>Rifles, Railroads and Rebellions uses<br/><br/>- a simple command structure to manage battlefield movement without dealing with morale or having the players issue orders,<br/><br/>- a troop grading system so that better trained more effective troops can have an advantage over poorly trained less effective troops, and<br/><br/>- a method to account for casualties and losses without an overly complicated accounting system.<br/><br/>Rifles, Railroads and Rebellions is an abstraction. A Unit in the game does not necessarily equal a particular organizational unit, formation in the field, or a specific number of soldiers. Each base is a representation of force, and as such issues such as the size of one battalion, regiment, brigade, or squadron should be set aside. The player should concern himself with tactics such as troop placement, command access, gun placement and terrain features. The goal is to recreate the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the period, not necessarily every detail of it.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Lower the values of your opponent's cargo while keeping what is on your own train high, upgrade your locomotive to pull longer trains, steal and sabotage, and choose a route to send your train along to score bonus points.<br/><br/>Trains &amp; Cargo is a strategic, casual board game for 2-4 or 6 players, individually or in teams. There are two types of locomotives, eight types of cargo (coal, timber, corn, cars, steel, food, cattle and passengers) and three Route Boards that you can claim to score bonus points.<br/><br/>Each turn you may choose to either play cards from your hand, upgrade your locomotive, or to send off your train to score points for the cargo it holds. There are three types of cards and you may play up to one of each type on any given turn: Cargo Cards to collect cargo from a central bank, Market Cards to increase or decrease the values of specified cargo, and Effect Cards with various text-based abilities.<br/><br/>Things to consider when playing Trains &amp; Cargo include what cards to combine for maximum effect, how long to wait until you send off your train, if you should wait for a specific route to become available or choose a different path, and more. The game is entirely free of play money which means that getting a head start early on does not mean a certain win - you are limited by the cards in your hand, not the money in your bank.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Here the railways came late (in 1900) so that explains the name of the game. You can call it 18Born if you don't like the pun.<br/><br/>Two, three, or four players represent investors in railroad companies, spending their initial capital to purchase shares in railway companies. The companies, each controlled by the largest shareholder, build track and run trains to earn revenue. These can be paid out as dividends to shareholders to retained to fund further track and trains. A key feature of 1899+1, as with all other games in the series, is that the interest of the President and the interest of the shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful with their investments. Being a President is not without its difficulties, either; bailing out an insolvent company is the sole responsibility of its President.<br/><br/>1899+1, while short by standards of other members of the series, is a fairly long game. Experienced players can expect to take up to three hours to complete a game.<br/><br/>",

Producers and Consumers is an educational game designed to teach the basic economic concepts of production, consumption, bartering and specialization to students in grades 1-3.<br/><br/>Each player draws a card depicting a profession and gets several resource tokens related to their job.  On the back of their card is their goal--the resources they must collect to win.  Players must then trade to try to collect all the resources they need.  The first player to collect all the necessary resources wins.<br/><br/>The game can be played at three levels.  At level one, resources are plentiful and all players should be able to complete their cards with simple one-to-one trades.  At level two, some resources are scarcer and some players have a smaller supply, so one-to-one trades may not be sufficient to complete cards.  At level three, there are not enough resources for all players to complete their cards, so competition for some resources may be fierce!<br/><br/>",

Look for all the stuff in the Files section.<br/><br/>As a minor leader of the revolutionary movement (in a rather remote theatre of that war) you conduct all sorts of tactical and strategical operations &ndash; all with the aim to steer your troops in the best possible way through the excited and exciting (though perilous) times. <br/>Each round a player chooses one of the six basic Offices: Go, spread the word of the Reformation as a &raquo;Prediger&laquo; (Preacher) to make the countless &raquo;Thorps&laquo; (villages) more valuable for the revolution's cause (and to score Victory Points on top of that). As a &raquo;Rottmeister&laquo; (~ corporal) win over those Thorps &ndash; they are your (and your fellow player's) supply bases in food and units. As a &raquo;Trossweibel&laquo; (Whore's Sergeant) increase the storage volume of your wagon trek to store and transport your Food Barrels and various goods. Gather food as a &raquo;Proviantmeister&laquo; (Furir) and store the barrels in your wagons. Deploy new units (of various military and diplomatic uses and worth in Victory Points) as a &raquo;Werber&laquo; (Recruiter). And as a &raquo;Beutemeister&laquo; (~ purser) you might also want to visit one of the various markets where you can trade your booty into all sorts of useful equipment. These six basic Offices are closely linked together. More variability and depth (historical and tactical) are added by the &raquo;Eysenhudt Cards&laquo;, which can be chosen instead of an Office. Those cards represent tactical or strategical orders from your captain: Anthonius Eysenhudt. <br/>After each three rounds you have to perform certain actions during an &raquo;Encampment Phase&laquo; in which you try to conquer one of the very important fortified towns. For this combat action each player chooses the more defensive &raquo;Threatening Attack&laquo; or the more aggressive and physical &raquo;Storm Attack&laquo;. And the decision is crucial, because not only may it decide over the success or failure of the attack, you may also be attracted to act more aggressively in trying to storm the fortified towns (or strongholds) to make all the more booty (and even to increase your gain in Victory Points) but you'll on the other hand receive all the more Aggression Points, which increases the probability of a more severe punishment at the game's end.<br/>Cause in the end your fate lies in the hands of the &raquo;Principals' Justice&laquo; and you may yet lose much of what you've gained. And the punishment you'll receive reflects on your actions during game play. The decisions are as hard to make as the paths to win Eysenhudt are manifold. Overall the game is more cooperative than competitive. Nonetheless each player has to find his or her own strategy to score as much Victory Points as possible.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All the stories are connected, and the cases progress as the mysteries are being solved. Then eventually, a grandiose final mystery emerges!<br/>One player becomes the questioner. They read the mystery aloud, then draws a card with a picture on it, and shows it to the other players. The card contains clues related to the cases. The clues can be instant hints, or have an importance later on. If you give a wrong answer, you might get an unexpected reply from the questioner. The questioner&rsquo;s turn goes clockwise.<br/>The main component of the game is a book, which attempts to evoke an atmosphere similar to that of mystery TPRG&rsquo;s and escape games. The book counts 52 pages, with 8 mysteries to solve. Playtime is about 60~90 minutes. Difficulty is easy, and basically anyone can play it (all the kanji learnt above elementary 6th grade has furigana attached). However, the stories gradually get harder and harder towards the end.<br/>A free demo is available for download on the official homepage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player is dealt an equal number of hands of four cards each (quantity depending upon the number of players). An additional hand of four are placed face-up in the center of the play area. Turns happen in real-time and simultaneously with players exchanging only one card from one hand with a card from the pool in the center of the table. Players may only have one hand active at a time in their hand and must lay any others down on the table face-down. When discarding a card to the center to trade, players must call out the name of the animal they are laying down. If it is a pig, instead of yelling &quot;Pig&quot;, they say &quot;Waffles&quot;, the pig's name.<br/><br/>If a player has both a chicken and Waffles in their hand, they may discard them both to pick up two cards instead of the normal one, exclaiming &quot;Chicken -n- Waffles!&quot;<br/><br/>The goal is to get all your hands to have matching four-of-a-kind sets with the exception of the chicken and Waffles cards - these must be paired up  with matching features (color of clothes) and combined with any other pair of animals. The round winner chooses another animal to add to the deck and plays the next round with an additional hand of cards. When playing with four hands (having won one), you may not use the wilds. When you win a second round, you may use wilds again, but must play the rest of the game one-handed. The first player to win three rounds is the overall winner.<br/><br/>In a 6 player game, you play until you win two rounds, with the previous middle round (not being able to use wilds) ignored.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On top of this you discover that there are actually multiple different races of Aliens, that have contacted our planet, waiting for our response to see which side we will join in the galactic, but the only way to contact them must be through discovering the secret behind these strange sites.<br/><br/>Strange sites is a two player game where players are racing to discover the sites of alien contact, and place their meeples onto them, in an attempt to be the first human to successfully make first contact. Each player is given an opportunity to choose a faction, and change it later, then both players investigate locations, and trigger their unique effects to help them speed towards victory. Using a 4x3 grid of randomized locations, players must search for powerful locations, without giving away information, using clever strategies and efficient choices to be the fastest one to victory!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For example, if a player throws a total of 7 spots on the dice, he may remove the 5&amp;2, or the 4, 2, &amp; 1, or he may remove the tee in Hole 7. Player must use the entire number found on the dice throw. When a number is thrown, and the player can't remove tees on the front, leave what is left. Go to back 9, throw the dice, and start again. See how you rate. Scores are for the front &amp; back holes combined. <br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/><br/>     0 to 2 tees left - SUPER PRO! <br/>     3 tees -- Pro. <br/>     4 to 5 tees left -- So, So. <br/>     6 or more -- Duffer!&quot;<br/><br/><br/>TRY AGAIN.&quot;<br/>&mdash;description from the packaging<br/><br/>",

In this game you are a cookie connoisseur, trying to eat as many different types of cookies as possible to maximize your tasting experience. In addition, every cookie you eat has to be sweeter than the one you just ate.<br/><br/>However, all of your friends are thinking exactly the same way as you do and there are only a limited number of cookies. So think strategically and act fast before all of the tastiest cookies are gone.  Sounds interesting? Now it&rsquo;s Cookie Time!<br/><br/>In this game, the cookie cards can be placed on the plate to be scored as happiness points later. The cards can also be rotated 180 degrees to become money in the Wallet. On your turn, buy a pair of cards from the market to your hand and discard the money from your Wallet to the discard pile according to the market price card next to it. Then you must play 2 cards from your hand to your playing area, either to Plate or Wallet.<br/><br/>Play continues until there are not enough cards to replenish the market. Add all happiness together and the player with the most happiness is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It refers to the winch that is used in the mines to lift heavy objects, minerals and water.<br/><br/>The two players must advance at least one of their miners to one of the mines. The other miners will be responsible for selecting the actions, that is, on the board there will be several actions to be carried out, and these actions must be taken by miners, if they are to be carried out. The goal is to extract the tuff or the silver and take them to the center of the board, where the players must build an obelisk which can be made of silver or tuff. But they must be careful not to disturb a sparrow, because by doing so, a mine will be disabled. The goal of the game is to collect as many points and build the obelisk, or make the sparrows settle in the opposite mines.<br/><br/>",

The base game consists of two teams from the Swiss first football league, Grasshopper Club Z&uuml;rich and FC Luzern, which can be pitched against each other on a tiny game board (a ball is not included, but any coin or other small item can be used). <br/>Each player shuffles the stack of cards from their teams, which consists of three cards each of 15 players from that team. Then both players flip open the top card from their stack and compare the stats. The winning player (higher number) moves the ball one slot closer to the opponent's goal (or into the goal if the ball is in the box already). Depending on the ball's position, attack or defense values are used. If a player draws the coach, they can choose the stats from one of the three previous cards. After the stack of 45 cards is played through twice (two halves), the player with most goals is the winner.<br/><br/>At least one additional set of cards was released for BSC Young Boys in 1992.<br/>The box credits a G. Meister as well, but whether as artist or co-designer remains unclear.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

It's a treasure hunt, the poison ball from Croquet, and a classic fairy tale all in one!<br/><br/>Backstory<br/>The Great Famine darkens the souls of Germany's forest inhabitants.  Parents once faithful and generous have allowed self-preservation and greed to permeate their lives.  Trusting and resourceful, Hansel and Gretel find themselves abandoned in the forest and lured into an evil trap.<br/><br/>With faith, greed, trust, and evil on full display, who will learn the lessons and consequences told through this classic Grimm Brother's tale?<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/>In Hansel and Gretel, you seek the forest for magical treasures, gain special powers, and guide the story's characters to complete startling events from the story line.  The game begins with you hiding treats that provide special powers and treasures used to complete events. It progresses as you cooperatively reenact scenes from the story. You'll guide story character's actions and movements. On every turn you'll have meaningful decisions to make, decisions that impact how other's must react to an evolving plot. You earn points for accomplishing any of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Influencing a Character,<br/>     Gaining a Special Ability, and<br/>     Completing an Event from the story.<br/><br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal is to have the most points at the end of the game.  You accumulate points during the game by finding treats and treasures that give characters special abilities and allow them to complete events from the story.  You also earn points during end-game scoring for influencing the tale's four main characters - Hansel, Gretel, Father, and Witch.<br/><br/>To win, you'll enable the characters essential nature for reenacting a tale filled with conflict and consequence. Understanding the story's plot and devising clever strategies that exploit the character's true nature are key to winning.<br/><br/><br/>     Will you allow Father to abandon Hansel and Gretel in the Far Forest?<br/>     Perhaps you'll embrace the role of the Witch and lock Hansel in a cage?<br/>     Or, you might decide to help Gretel escape the Witch and bring her Gems to Father.<br/><br/><br/>The unique hide and seek mechanic ensures endless variations and possibilities giving Hansel and Gretel an extremely high replay value. Regardless of the choices made, you'll explore the inner ego of each character while learning anew this classic tale's twists, turns, and consequences. The story of Hansel and Gretel comes to life in fun, suspenseful, and teachable ways.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the deisgner<br/><br/>",

Players count to five while looking at what their opponent has rolled and then secretly order their own dice in a line behind their hand. This determines which card each die will be allocated to. The first die in the line will be allocated to the firest card and so on. The first player to finish allocating dice will break ties during the round. <br/>After both players have finished ordering their dice, they are revealed and then placed on the card they were allocated to. Each card is then resolved in order (1 to 5), paying attention to the rules that are written on the card. When  one  player  has  a  higher  end  total  for  a  card  than  the  other player, they are said to DISCOVER the card and receive a number of Discovery Points equal to the number on the card.<br/>Players play six rounds in the way described above, totalling  their Discovery Points across all six rounds.<br/><br/>",

It is dated as a 1940 release in the book American Games (Alex Malloy, 2000) and was featured in a series of advertisements in four consecutive December 1940 issues of Life Magazine.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for players to move around the solar system collecting the rare element, Coronium, and then return it to Earth without it being stolen by other players. Bags of Coronium are represented by yellow or green discs.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a small coloured wooden token (their Miner). Players move through the orbits of different planets based on the roll of two dice. A player collects Coronium by landing on a planet and then throwing a particular number associated with that planet.<br/><br/>When a Miner with five or more bags (discs) of Coronium lands on Mars, it becomes a Martian Raider. The small Miner token is exchanged for a large wooden token of the same colour. The Martian Raider can then capture Coronium from another player by landing directly on the player's Miner.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player must arrive back on Earth, by exact count, with 15 or more bags of Coronium.<br/><br/>",

Grab the gold and get out!<br/>Goblins and Gold is a game about several dwarves who stumble into a goblin gold mine. The greedy dwarves must grab as much gold as they can carry and make it out of the mine alive. Players compete to steal as much gold from the goblins (and other players) as they can. Goblins and Gold is a dice rolling game with a subtle strategy behind every move you make. Players take turns laying down mine cards to build the mine. This means that players have control over where they want to place gold and goblins. It also means that the board is different every time you play the game! Each player controls their own dwarf, but all the players control the goblin horde and the powerful ogre. Players can play defensively, keeping the goblins away from themselves, or aggressively, pushing the horde towards their opponents. There's only one ogre, but if it hits your dwarf with an attack, instant game over! Use action cards to gain an edge on your opponents. Knock goblins off the board, steal gold from other players, and freeze the ogre in place until your next turn. Plan ahead and make sure you're the dwarf to survive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To advance a rocket, one adds the numbered square the rocket is on with the result from a roulette wheel spin. E.g If a rockets sits on square 6 and the roulette spin is a 2 they may advance to square 8. Problem is there is only 25 squares on the board so a player could remain on a spot if the number spun on the roulette wheel adds up to a number not found on the board. In addition, the numbered squares are either black or red, with red holding unpleasant surprises.<br/><br/>The winner is the player to return their rockets to earth and to have accumulated the highest number of points.<br/><br/>",

The score of a word results from the number of letters. Example: The word &quot;GAME&quot; consists of four letters and thus results in four points. The words &quot;TURN&quot; and &quot;CARD&quot; result in four plus four points, i.e. a total of eight points. The player with the most points on his hand wins.<br/><br/>Pun Rules<br/><br/>The starting order can be determined by lots. The player who draws the highest card in the alphabet begins. First, each player is dealt six cards face down. The remaining cards are dealt face down in the center as the deck. Three cards from the deck are dealt face up in the center. There must always be three cards in the center throughout the game.<br/><br/>Phase 1<br/>The active player may swap an unlimited number of cards with the other players in the first phase. You may also exchange several cards for one.<br/><br/>Phase 2<br/>The active player can then choose between these three options:<br/>1. The player can swap one or more cards from the center with those in his hand and then end his turn.<br/>2. The player can draw a card from the deck and end his turn. This option cannot be selected if there is no more card in the deck.<br/>3. The player can end the round. This ends his turn. The round continues until  all other players have completed their turn Now the points of each player are counted.<br/><br/>All words in the dictionary are allowed. Abbreviations and names are not allowed. Players can also agree to allow words in other languages or limit themselves to terms from a specific subject area (e.g. animals). The &bdquo;Pun- card&ldquo; is the wild card and can represent any one of the 26 letters.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>Pun Spielanleitung<br/><br/>Karten: 54 (2 &times; Alphabet/2 &times; Pun)<br/><br/>Anleitung: Deutsch und Englisch<br/><br/>Anzahl Spieler: 2&ndash;8<br/><br/>Altersgruppe: ab 6 Jahren<br/><br/>Autor: Bastian Ruhl<br/><br/>Ziel des Spiels<br/><br/>Ziel des Spiels ist es, ein Wort oder mehrere W&ouml;rter auf der eigenen Hand zu bilden. Die Punktzahl eines Wortes ergibt sich aus der Anzahl der Buchstaben (also jeder Buchstabe ist grunds&auml;tzlich gleich viel Wert). Beispiel: Das Wort &bdquo;SPIEL&ldquo; besteht aus f&uuml;nf Buchstaben und ergibt somit f&uuml;nf Punkte. Die W&ouml;rter &bdquo;ZUG&ldquo; und &bdquo;KARTE&ldquo; ergeben drei und f&uuml;nf Punkte, also insgesamt acht Punkte. Derjenige Spieler, der am Ende die meisten Punkte auf der Hand hat, gewinnt.<br/><br/>Finaler Sieger: Man kann danach Spielen wer nach einer bestimmten Anzahl an Runden die meisten Punkte hat oder wer der Sieger der meisten Runden ist.<br/><br/>Pun-Spielregeln<br/><br/>Wer anf&auml;ngt, kann ausgelost werden. Der Mitspieler, der die h&ouml;chste Karte im Alphabet zieht, beginnt. Zuerst bekommt jeder Spieler sechs Karten verdeckt ausgeteilt. Die restlichen Karten werden, als Stapel verdeckt, in die Mitte gelegt. Drei Karten vom Stapel werden offen in die Mitte gelegt. W&auml;hrend des gesamten Spiels m&uuml;ssen immer drei Karten in der Mitte liegen. Der Spielzug eines Spielers besteht aus zwei Phasen.<br/><br/>Phase 1<br/><br/>Der aktive Spieler darf in der ersten Phase mit den anderen Spielern unbegrenzt viele Karten tauschen (verbal und darf verdeckt oder offen stattfinden). Es d&uuml;rfen auch mehrere Karten gegen eine getauscht werden (bis man selbst nicht mehr tauschen m&ouml;chte oder die anderen Spieler nicht mehr tauschen m&ouml;chten). Das Tauschen von Karten ist ein wichtiges strategisches Element und sollte nicht vernachl&auml;ssigt werden.<br/><br/>Phase 2<br/><br/>Anschlie&szlig;end muss sich der aktive Spieler zwischen drei M&ouml;glichkeiten entscheiden:<br/><br/>1. Er kann eine oder mehrere Karten aus der Mitte mit denen auf seiner Hand tauschen und den Zug beenden.<br/><br/>2. Oder der Spieler kann eine Karte vom Stapel ziehen und den Zug beenden. Diese Option ist nicht w&auml;hlbar, wenn keine Karte mehr im Stapel ist.<br/><br/>3. Der Spieler kann das Spiel beenden. Dadurch ist der Zug beendet. Das Spiel l&auml;uft noch eine Runde weiter und endet, sobald der Spieler, der es beendet hat, wieder am Zug w&auml;re. Nun werden die Punkte gez&auml;hlt.<br/><br/>Die Umlaute &Auml;, &Ouml;, &Uuml; werden durch AE, OE, UE gebildet und das ẞ durch SS. Alle im Duden stehenden W&ouml;rter sind erlaubt. Abk&uuml;rzungen und Namen sind hingegen nicht gestattet. Die Spieler k&ouml;nnen sich aber auch darauf einigen, W&ouml;rter anderer Sprachen zu erlauben oder sich nur auf Begriffe aus einem bestimmten Themenfeld zu beschr&auml;nken (z. B. Tiere) (siehe Spielmodus &ldquo;Stadt, Land, Pun). Die Pun-Karte ist der Joker und kann einen der 26 Buchstaben vertreten.<br/><br/>Es k&ouml;nnen auch Karten aus dem Deck genommen werden (empfiehlt sich Q, X, Y rauszunehmen, wenn man nur einsprachig deutsch spielt).<br/><br/>",

There are three races and three strict bets. The most money wins.<br/><br/>Unlike similar table-top games, in Big Time the luck element is minimized. Sure, you&rsquo;ll have a &ldquo;stable&rdquo; of horses, but you won&rsquo;t roll dice and check your horse card to see how far your steed goes. And you won&rsquo;t spend your time making multiple bets on which horse will win the race, either. What you will do is focus on the race itself, and your share of the purse<br/><br/>Big Time Horse Racing is a thinking person&rsquo;s game. The types of horses in a race, the length of the race, post position and how the race will be run are the important factors. On each turn, players will carefully choose a card to play from their hands &ndash; but only one card will determine the results which will apply to all the horses on the racetrack. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll want your card to be chosen, and sometimes you won&rsquo;t. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll try to hinder other players instead of helping yourself. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll benefit all horses of your type, and sometimes you&rsquo;ll selfishly give yourself a bonus at the expense of those horses.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll also have to decide when to hold your horse back, when to &ldquo;make your move,&rdquo; what to do in the turns, and even if you&rsquo;ll hand the race to an opponent if you can&rsquo;t finish in the money. There is betting, but it&rsquo;s limited, and thought will be required here, too &ndash; if you want to win the day!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player portrays a grunt from a squad of colonial space marines that find themselves in repeated close encounters with classic sci-fi/horror xenomorphs. Missions range from simple get-out-alive or search-and-rescue, to elaborate multi-scenario campaigns.<br/><br/>Each player has a pool of colored dice based on his grunt's skills and attributes. He gains access to more dice and more colors as he levels-up. Players choose and roll dice from their pool, then take actions as allowed by those rolls. The xenomorphs move and attack automatically, triggered by those same dice. Play is simultaneous and in real-time, so the pace of the action can be intense and proceeds as quickly as players can roll and apply results!<br/><br/>Cards to buff each grunt add a dizzying variety of perks, special abilities, and hi-tech gear. But the hidden beauty of Colonial Marines: Bug Hunt is its innovative dice combat system that brings true wargame tactics to a genre dominated by entries that are rich in theme but light on strategy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deliverance From Beyond the Stars! is a strategic game in Galaxy-Foundation Games' strategic Battle for Andromeda: Conflict for a Trillion Suns! series. It uses the series rulebook, Andromeda Foundation Official Battle Manual.<br/><br/>This game pits the Alliance System of Federated Worlds aka the United Systems of the Alliance Federation, along with their allies the Confederation of Thetan Republics, against the invading N'Dridd, which apparently are some kind of hive race. The rulebook claims that rules are provided to allow the former side to be split between an Alliance player and a Thetan player, but such rules do not actually appear.<br/><br/>The game-specific rulebook has lots of background material on the civilzations involved and their ships, plus rules for special units. It also devotes a lot of space to the special feature of this game in the series, which is that the N'Dridd player starts the game by randomly drawing numbered chits which determine their force composition and deployment. The players get points for accomplishing things and partway through the game is halted to assess points scored and current forces vis-a-vis the N'Dridd's starting chits; this determines what additional forces the N'Dridd gets for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):<br/><br/><br/>        The game posits 6 Variable Options selected by the N'DRIDD player drawing &quot;chits&quot; (counters with numerical designations on them), the Federation &ldquo;0B&quot; is the same for all but each Chit dictates a specific quantity of N'Dridd &quot;At Start Forces&quot; and a potential follow-up of indeterminate size. The Alliance Player does not know whether to mass his ships in a broad &quot;spread&quot; to stop any small N'Dridd Scout Group and DESTROY IT before it can escape with Data that might &quot;trigger&quot; a huge Task Force or even a Horde. Then again, spreading them out may leave them dangerously exposed if the attack group is NOT a Scout Force but a Task Force that will devastate the Culture.<br/><br/><br/>",

A group of seven ravaging men are regarded as thieves, from seven to thirty-five is called a band and any any group larger than this is regarded as an army. Usually, an invading army arrived in just two or three ships, and even kings could be seen commanding armies no larger than three football teams.<br/><br/>Although the Dark Ages were an extremely violent era with a great number of battles and raids, but only a few were detailed in the chronicles, such as decisive pitch battles or those in which an important person died. Brytenwalda is focused on these kinds of battles which the modern wargamer would call a &ldquo;skirmish&rdquo;. While you wont be able to re-enact the Battle of Hastings in Brytenwalda, you'll have plenty of fun leading a band of Scot-Irish pirates, a group of raiding Saxons or a unit of Romano-British pedites patrolling the frontier.<br/><br/>Grab your lucky dice, gather your men, and get ready for battle!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

These must be clearly visible to the opponentat all times (6-sided cube or by enclosed shield markers).<br/><br/>The maximum hand limit is 7. If a player has more than 7 cards in his hand at the end of their turn, they must place cards on their discard piles until the card limit is reached.<br/><br/>The card text always takes precedence over the rules in the rule book. This does not apply if the card text is incorrect.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of 5 phases, which are always traversed in this order of each move:<br/><br/>Start-phase:<br/><br/>In the initial phase, all effects that are activated by cards already in play at the beginning of the turn are resolved. The order in which the effects become active is determined by the active player. After all effects have been resolved with at the beginning, this phase ends and an action-event follows.<br/><br/>Draw-phase:<br/><br/>In this phase, the active player draws 1 card.<br/><br/>Recovering-phase:<br/><br/>All active player cards that are currently exausted (&lsquo;inactive&rsquo; on the side), with the exception of Nexus resources, are again recoverd (turned &lsquo;active&rsquo; / upright).<br/><br/>Main-phase:<br/><br/>This phase represents the main part of a turn. In its main phase, a player may play cards from his hand, declare attacks, activate unit card effects on the field, or use his operator.<br/><br/>End-phase:<br/><br/>At the beginning of this phase, all effects are dealt with which explicitly occur at the end of the turn. This includes the removal of played command cards with the wording until the end of the turn. As in the initial phase, the active player, if relevant, determines the order of these steps. After that, the other player starts with his initial phase.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Borodino<br/>7 September 1812 was the single bloodiest day of the Napoleonic Wars.<br/><br/>The Russian forces which, since June, had retreated eastwards in front of Napoleon&rsquo;s advancing Grande Armee at last made their stand at the village of Borodino on the road to Moscow. Their newly appointed commander, Mikhail Kutuzov, had chosen his ground wisely. The marshy and wooded terrain around the village favoured the defender and Kutuzov strengthened his position still further by fortifying many of the natural obstacles. Here the Russians waited.<br/><br/>Far from friendly territory, short of supplies, and with Winter approaching, Napoleon had little choice but to attack in order to open the way to the relative safety of Moscow. A series of frontal attacks by both sides resulted in an orgy of slaughter. The fighting involved around 250,000 troops and nearly 70,000 were left on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Both armies suffered terribly; but, it was the Russians who left the field and the way open for the Grande Armee to march on to Moscow. Too exhausted to follow their beaten foe, nearly week was to pass before the leading units entered the city. The victory proved to be pyrrhic. The Russian Tsar Alexander had no intention of suing for peace; but, instead waited for Winter to come to his aid. With supplies running out and the weather worsening, the Grande Armee evacuated the city in October. So began the famous retreat from Moscow.<br/><br/>The Battle of Borodino is a tactical level two player game covering this bloodiest of battles. One player takes the role of Napoleon, commanding the Grande Armee, and the other of Kutusov leading the Russians. The battle is a source of great debate amongst historians, and players have the opportunity to try some of the options available to both commanders. For example, had Napoleon committed his Imperial Guard, the only significant unit on the battlefield that remained in reserve, or had he heeded the advice of Marshal Davout to try to out-flank the Russian position, might he have succeeded in destroying the Russian army and winning not only the battle, but the entire war?<br/><br/>The First Battle of Polotsk<br/><br/>This relatively little-known battle, which took place on 17 August 1812, was one of the most significant of Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion of Russia. Leading the majority of his Grande Armee ever eastwards, Napoleon had reached Smolensk. He had assigned Marshal Oudinot, commander of the II Corps, to protect his northern flank and to test the strength of the Russian forces defending the road to St Petersburg, the Russian capital. It transpired that these comprised only a single Corps, perhaps 25,000 men, commanded by General Wittgenstein. Impatient with Oudinot for failing to attack Wittgenstein, Napoleon dispatched St. Cyr's VI Corps to reinforce II Corps, bringing its strength up to about 32,000 men. The   aim was to defeat the Russians and, if possible, threaten St Petersburg.<br/><br/>Faulty intelligence lead Oudinot to believe that Wittgenstein was too weak to mount an attack and so split his forces to making it easier for them to forage. He deployed II Corps on the southern bank and VI Corps on the northern bank of the River Dvna. Wittgenstein recognised that this left VI Corps, the weaker of the two, particularly vulnerable. The Russians attacked and heavy fighting ensued; but, the VI Corps fought bravely and held their position. Towards the end of the first day&rsquo;s fighting Marshal Oudinot was seriously wounded and command of both Corps passed to St. Cyr. The second day saw St. Cyr take the initiative. By feigning a retreat he was able to mislead Wittgenstein and suddenly launch a furious attack against the Russian centre and left flank. Just as defeat seemed inevitable, Wittgenstein ordered his cavalry to counterattack. They cut through the advancing enemy units only to be thrown back in confusion by French Cuirassiers.<br/><br/>At this point, both sides were exhausted and had suffered heavy casualties. Each withdrew to a defensible position where they remained, watching each other, for the next two months until Napoleon&rsquo;s retreat from Moscow saw his northern flank again become the scene of desperate fighting.<br/><br/>Although tactically it was a French victory, in strategic terms the First battle of Polotsk was a draw. Nonetheless, the strategic significance of the battle was immense. With his northern flank no longer threatened Napoleon was able to continue his advance upon Moscow. A grateful Emperor rewarded St-Cyr with a marshal&rsquo;s baton. The Russian Tsar Alexander was similarly grateful to Wittgenstein. The threat to St Petersburg had been nullified. He awarded Wittgenstein the Order of St George and conferred upon him the title of &quot;Saviour of St Petersburg&quot;.<br/><br/>The First Battle of Polotsk is a tactical level two player game covering this strategically significant engagement. One player takes the role of Oudinot, commanding two Corps of the Grande Armee, and the other of Wittgenstein leading the Russians. There is a range of  options open to both players to see if they can achieve the decisive and strategically decisive  victory which eluded their historical counterparts.<br/><br/>SHS Games<br/><br/>The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.  The SHS incorporates several unique features intended to replicate in a simple and intuitive way the options available to a commander (the wargamer) of a large army.  So whilst the commander has complete freedom to devise a plan, and a good deal when positioning units which have yet to encounter the enemy, once battle is joined the options become increasingly limited and unforeseen events can play a part in determining the outcome.  Nonetheless, even at a tactical level a commander's decisions are crucial in shaping events. The key to success is a sound plan with a margin for error which allows for ill-fortune, the shrewd deployment of units so as to be able to implement that plan, and the timely commitment of reserves.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kliszow<br/>The Battle of Kliszow is a tactical level two player game covering this important engagement during the Great Northern War. One player takes the role of King Charles XII leading his Swedish troops, and the other of Augustus the Strong commanding a Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian army. This is a classic example of a small well-trained and highly motivated army taking on a larger force in a strong defensive position. Victory will go to the player who is best able to exploit the advantages available to him.<br/><br/>Earlier in War, the Swedes had repulsed attacks on their empire by the Danes, Russians and Poles and had now taken the offensive by invading the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After occupying Warsaw, Charles marched west with the aim of defeating Augustus decisively. On 19 July 1702 the two armies were camped only five miles apart. However, they were separated by a large wood and a swamp. The latter shielded Augustus&rsquo; camp to the north whilst his left flank was protected by the River Nida. Undeterred by this, and by the fact that his army of 12,000 was outnumbered, maybe by as much as two-to-one, by the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanians, Charles advanced through the woods abandoning most of his guns during the march.<br/><br/>In an effort to secure a decisive victory, Charles&rsquo; strategy was envelope the enemy army. However, this plan was disrupted when the commander of the assault on the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian right flank was killed and the advance halted. The Poles then counter-attacked, but were beaten back by the Swedish infantry, as was an attack by the Saxons across the marsh which separated the centre of the two armies. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the Poles then abandoned Augustus leaving the field and exposing his right flank. Even though Augustus still had the larger army, it was now badly unbalanced and the Swedes immediately began to roll up his right flank. In the chaos that followed, Charles was able to capture most of the enemy&rsquo;s artillery and to turn these guns upon the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanians. However, fierce resistance by Saxon units in the centre and on the left flank allowed most Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian units to withdraw.<br/><br/>It was certainly a victory, but not the decisive victory for which Charles had been hoping.<br/><br/>Fraustadt<br/><br/>This battle between a Swedish army commanded by General Rehnsk&ouml;ld and a Saxon-Polish-Russian force lead by General Schulenburg took place on 13 February 1706.  It has been described as the &ldquo;Swedish Cannae&rdquo; because the Swedish cavalry carried out a double envelopment, encircling the enemy and bringing about a decisive victory reminiscent of Hannibal&rsquo;s success nearly 2,000 years previously. For the loss of only 400 men, the Swedes inflicted 7,000 casualties upon the Saxon-Polish-Russians and captured a similar number.<br/><br/>Prior to the battle, King Charles XII was contemplating recalling his over-stretched forces from Poland. Indeed, in the lead up to the battle Rehnskold deliberately gave the impression that the Swedes were withdrawing by retreating his 10,000 men towards Fraustadt. This ploy was successful in luring Schlenburg, at the head of 20,000 men, away from a very strong defensive position to pursue the Swedes. With the two armies now facing each other the Swedish cavalry launched repeated attacks on both flanks, eventually routing the enemy cavalry stationed on each.  They then wheeled to attack the rear of the Saxon-Polish-Russian infantry, with devastating results. At the same time the Swedish infantry began moving forward to assault Schulenburg&rsquo;s forces from the front, thereby completing the encirclement. Although the Saxon-Polish-Russian right flank held for a while, under this intense pressure the army soon broke and those who were unable to flee surrendered en mass.<br/><br/>In terms of Sweden&rsquo;s campaign in Poland, the Battle of Fraustadt had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Rather than abandoning their campaign, the Swedes had become the dominant military power in the region. Before the year was over Saxony would sue for peace.<br/><br/>Rehnskold had little option but to risk battle with Schlenburg&rsquo;s superior forces for fear that the odds would be tipped even further against him should Augustus the Strong, commanding 8,000 Saxons, join with Schlenburg. Augustus was only a few days&rsquo; march away from Fraustadt. In addition to the standard game, there is a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenario which envisages his arrival on 13 February 1706.   <br/><br/><br/>SHS Games<br/><br/>The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.  The SHS incorporates several unique features intended to replicate in a simple and intuitive way the options available to a commander (the wargamer) of a large army.

The ones that remain have called on you and your fellow Monster Knights to rid the countryside of the monsters. Will you survive the night, save their village, and become the 2-bit monster hunter of legend?<br/><br/>In Monster Knights: A 2-Bit Monster Hunting Card Game, players take on the roles of monster hunters who have been tasked by the locals of Vonsterwald to save their village from the nightly attacks by legendary monsters the Swamp Monster, the Wolf Monster, the Vampire Monster, and Frankenmonster. To do that, players must work together to heal the Monster Hunters when they take wounds, to move the Monster Hunters around the village, and to use the Monster Hunters to attack the monsters they encounter with crossbows, silver bullet guns, holy relics, and torches. Each monster has a weakness to a certain weapon, which causes more damage to that particular monster. If a location is destroyed, the players lose. If a Monster Hunter dies, the players lose. Only by getting rid of all the monsters will the players win.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

To do that, players must enter the Kooky Mansion either through the Basement OR through the Roof, move up and down the various floors to collect the loot, and then get out of the mansion with the loot to score points. Sounds easy, right? Be warned, the mansion is guarded by a highly intelligent mad scientist, a highly indestructible robot, and a highly insecure sentient alien tentacle all of which can also be moved up and down floors to capture any intruders they encounter! If the players are caught, they are escorted from the mansion and any loot they had collected is lost (scored loot can never be lost). The mansion is full of secret passages that the players can use to avoid the guards and move more quickly up and down floors. Can you avoid capture, snag the loot, and escape the mansion to become the first player to score 30 points?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nature&rsquo;s Card Game: The magic of nature&rsquo;s patterns can be written in the language of numbers. The Phinacci game has taken that numbering pattern and made a card game out of it.<br/><br/>How to Play: You have two teams, four players, 53 cards, and 144 points needed to win the game. The object is to be the first team to reach 144 points. Each card taken in a pile counts as one point. Teams capture cards in a pile by matching the pile value with the card they throw down onto the pile. There are two groups of cards; colored cards with black numbers and black cards with white numbers. The colored cards are used only in subtracting the number that is on the card from the value of the pile, and the black cards can be used to either add or subtract the number on the card from the pile. If a player does not match the value on the pile then players continue going clockwise to lay down a card until the value is matched. The pile value changes each time a card is placed on the pile. The team (lead team) who lays down the first card of the hand has the advantage of either matching or exceeding the number value on the pile to take it, where as the other team must match the pile value exactly. If neither team has the cards to match or go over (lead team) the value on the pile then the cards go to the (non-lead team), and they become the lead team on the next round. There will be times when a player is unable to place a card and they are skipped to the next player. There will also be times when a player will run out of cards before the other players do.<br/><br/>An example of play: The deck is shuffled and dealt to all four players with one extra card going into the middle face up.Let&rsquo;s say the extra card is a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo;. Team A (lead team) easily takes it by throwing a &lsquo;colored 1&rsquo; card on top of it. Any card they throw down will take it because all they have to do is match or exceed the pile value. Because there were two cards in the pile they receive two points for their team. The player that takes the pile gets to lead out. Now let&rsquo;s say the player who took the pile leads out with an &lsquo;8&rsquo; card. The player on the left, Team B (non-lead team) member can place an 8 down if they have one and take the pile of two cards to collect two points, or let&rsquo;s say they choose to throw down a &lsquo;colored 1&rsquo; card which subtracts from the existing &lsquo;8&rsquo; making the pile value 7. The next person on the left is a member of Team A cannot match that pile number, because there are no &lsquo;7&rsquo; in the deck, but because they are the Lead Team they can use an &lsquo;8&rsquo; or larger card to take the pile, but it would only be three cards. Let&rsquo;s say instead they decide to throw down a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo; card. Now the pile value is 6 with four cards in the pile. Now let&rsquo;s say Team B throws down a colored &lsquo;2&rsquo; to bring it down to a value of 4. Again there are no &lsquo;4&rsquo; cards and the lead team has to either use a &lsquo;5&rsquo; card or larger to take it. Let&rsquo;s say Team A throws down a black &lsquo;5&rsquo; and chooses to use that &lsquo;5&rsquo; to add to the pile instead of subtracting. Now the pile value is 9 and again there are no &lsquo;9&rsquo; cards in the deck, so Team B will be unable to take the pile at this point. Let&rsquo;s say they throw down an &lsquo;8&rsquo; card bringing the pile value to 1. Team A decides to take the pile with a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo;, thus gaining 7 more point from this pile.. The hand will continued to be played until either all the cards are used up, or nobody is able to play a card. At that point the cards are reshuffled and dealt out with the team taking the last pile leading off. Team B&rsquo;s strategy is to keep the pile value so high that the other team will not be able to match or exceed its value, thus giving them the pile and becoming the lead team for the next round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wars Cans is a multidimensional strategy game where your pieces move based on their composition. Whoever is at the top of a stack controls the entire stack. The game is over when only one player is able to move. Each game is unique as the board layout is randomized and evolves as the game goes on.<br/><br/>Objective: To keep your opponent from moving.<br/><br/>Setup: Each player starts with 8 pieces placed on the board as shown below.<br/><br/>Board: The board is made up of 40 black squares overlaid with 40 green tile squares as shown above. Pieces can move across black squares, but can never land on them. Green tiles are removed from the board when a piece or stack of pieces moves off the green tile. A black square is exposed when a green tile is removed. Each black square counts as a move when passing over the square. Below are two examples of green tiles that have been removed in some opening moves.<br/><br/>Pieces: A single piece can move one space in any direction,as long as it doesn&rsquo;t land on a black square. Pieces can land on other pieces, both their own and their opponent&rsquo;s. When one piece combines with another piece, whether it be their own, or an opponent&rsquo;s piece it gains the ability to move another space in any direction. Every piece in a stack enables the stack to move that number of spaces. For instance, if a stack has 3 pieces it can move 3 spaces as shown in the figure below. Pieces must always move in a straight line.<br/><br/>Capturing and Releasing: When a piece is placed on top of an opponent&rsquo;s piece or stack that piece, or stack belongs to the one with their piece on top of the stack. If a the top piece of a stack is moved from the stack and the piece on the top of the remaining stack is the opponent&rsquo;s then the stack goes to the opponent.  Below are two showing a before and after example of a player capturing another player&rsquo;s pieces.<br/><br/>Winning: When a player is unable to move the game is over and the one who made the last move wins. Below is an example of a game played out with black winning.<br/><br/>",

Each cube starts out with the ability to move in three different directions; horizontally, vertically or diagonally. All 12 cubes will remain on the board throughout the game whether they are able to move or not. Cubes must always move in a straight line and cannot pass another cube diagonally if that cube&rsquo;s side comes in contact. A cube may not jump over another cube, or land on top of another cube. A cube loses a direction of movement as indicated by colored triangle when a cube from the other player is pushed into it. It is possible to engage more than one cube at a time. Cubes without colored triangles are considered dead and are unable to move on their own, though it can be pushed by other cubes. Cubes can push other cubes, both their own or their opponent, but for this to happen there must be more triangles pointing in the direction of the push than there are triangles opposed to the push. If two cubes have opposing triangles that point into each other, they cancel each other out and there is no push either way. Cubes may not pull another cube. Cubes can only move forward in the direction of the 90 degree triangles. Triangles can turn a round when they reach the three gray squares at each end, and can move back and forth from those gray squares. When a player runs out of moves the game is over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Object of the game:<br/>The object is to capture your opponent&rsquo;s four kings. What might feel like an advanced form of checkers will surprise you in its complexity of moves and strategy. It requires a nimble mind and the forward thinking of a chess player. Be alert because the balance of power can shift very quickly in this game.<br/><br/>Game basics:<br/>Each player starts out with 4 kings and 13 squires. Kings must always stay on white squares and squires must always stay on brown squares. Only squires can capture kings and only kings can capture squires. Capture happens when a king or squire moves into an adjacent space that shares the same sides. Both kings and squires can jump forward if they have a piece to jump over. They can jump over their own pieces or their opponent&rsquo;s pieces, or a combination of both. When a player&rsquo;s king or squire reaches the opponent&rsquo;s side of the board their king changes into an emperor or their squire changes into a knight. These changes give the pieces enhanced abilities to move. It is possible to reach the opposite side of the board in one jump, or a combination of multiple jumps in a single turn.<br/><br/>Examples of moves:<br/><br/>     A silver squire moves into an adjacent space to capture an emperor. Squires must always move a forward motion and cannot move sideways.<br/>     A silver squire jumps over an opponent&rsquo;s squire and king to capture the king. Bridges can be formed from both a players pieces and an opponent&rsquo;s pieces.<br/>     A silver king makes multiple jumps to reach the opponent&rsquo;s side and change into an emperor and capture two silver squires. Capture only happens at the final resting point and not at each junction where a piece launches from one jumping point to the next.<br/>     A silver king traverses across two spaces to capture four gold squires. Kings, emperors and knights can traverse (go sideways) as long as there is not another piece blocking its path. A piece cannot jump over or go around pieces when traversing.<br/>     A gold squire makes two jumps to become a knight and capture two silver kings.<br/>     A silver knight traverses three spaces to capture two gold kings. When a squires changes into a knight it gains the ability to traverse and move forward or backwards. When a king changes into an emperor it can also move forward or backwards, but it also has the ability to jump to the next row of white spaces without needing a bridge.<br/><br/><br/>",

Players take turns describing a movie or TV show on a drawn card to their partners without using the words or phrases on the card. Players must first draw a white challenge card to set the rules for the round. The opposing partners watch a timer to stop the game and switch players. Cards are disqualified if a player uses the words on the drawn black card. The describing team gets a point for each card they guess successfully and the opposing team gets a point for each card they pass on.

        "description": "Storm Over Europe is a grand strategic game, that recreates the entire European conflict during the Second World War. Designed with wooden pieces are used to depict resources, that depending on placement, represent air, land, and sea units.<br/><br/>Play the entire war, starting from January 1939 to the bitter end of Spring 1945 or later, can be played in 4-6 hours for a scenario and 10-15 hours for a the full campaign. No hexes, no counters, and low luck.<br/><br/>The map board employs area movement over land regions but the low unit density allows players to realize the full impact of mobile warfare and appreciate the daunting size of Mother Russia without slowing gameplay unnecessarily. A unique front-reserve combat system allows for operational level details like blitzes, assaults, encirclements, feints, static defense, and defense in depth which are normally lost in grand-strategic simulations.<br/><br/>Units are rated by movement, but attrition, assault, and blitz strength. Elite units are created by combat experience, events, and tech research - introducing an extra dimension as units are upgraded and downgraded throughout the war, reflecting varying levels of experience, training, leadership, and technology.<br/><br/>Production: Storm Over Europe goes beyond the standard model of linking military production to a GDP estimate. Nations must mobilize to achieve full wartime production but it takes much more to wage war than just massive production lines. Manpower, oil, steel, and even trained pilots are all tracked without ANY bookkeeping through an innovative system of collecting resources as strategy cards are played. Resources are consumed by prolonged offensives so logistics plays just as much a factor as unit strength.<br/><br/>Strategy Cards: Storm Over Europe is a card driven game (i.e. Paths of Glory). Events introduce historical and political events in a realistic fashion while eliminating scripting and &quot;look up&quot; rules. There is a tangible cause-effect relationship to every event and nothing occurs in a seemingly random or ahistorical manner. Players play the cards - the cards don't play the players. Most importantly, the core mechanic of tough gut wrenching decisions which make CDGs so fun is still preserved.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players will send workers to various islands, where they will claim dominance or return with treasures. Careful management of worker placement and treasure gathering, as well as tile placement to build archipelago itself, will lead to victory!<br/><br/>Players take turns placing tiles and doing a disciple action, including place, move and plunder. Disciples can be left to occupy islands, bringing occupation points. Alternatively, they may plunder riches on the island, returning with these to the dragons for set collection points. But this will allow other players to dominate the islands. Then there are the all important shipping lanes. With a tight worker-management mechanism, players must contemplate the value of their limited actions with care.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Mankind has mastered technology and is finally about to cross the final frontier, leaving Earth and colonizing space.<br/><br/>Since the recent discovery of vast resource deposits below the Moon's surface, four of the most wealthy and prominent nations have taken aim at establishing lunar outposts.<br/><br/>In Lunar Outpost, the players take on the roles as the supreme and beloved leaders of the four nations. Lead your nation to glory and you will be forever remembered in the history books. Lead your nation to defeat and your entire nation will be forgotten as a parenthesis in history.<br/><br/>Welcome to the space age.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIn Lunar Outpost, 2-4 players compete over a precious but limited resource. They do so through drawing and placing hexagonal terrain tiles depicting the barren surface of the moon.<br/><br/>Most tiles feature a location suitable for constructing a building and a few tiles feature resource deposits. Each tile may connect to some, none or all of its neighbors through its edges. Tiles only connect when the terrain of the shared edge is passable.<br/><br/>Each player starts out with a single building next to a small resource deposit and is only allowed to expand their outpost to connected tiles that are unclaimed by other players. This must be done as the total number of resources that may be extracted from the resource deposit is limited.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, new resource deposits will be discovered. In order to obtain the valuable resources, players must construct buildings capable of harvesting the resource in the direct proximity of the resource deposit.<br/><br/>The game features several different building types that may be constructed, each with their own perks and granting a certain number of victory points. Resources are consumed when buildings are constructed so players will have to form a strategy and adapt depending on how the game develops.<br/><br/>Agressive players may construct buildings capable of recruiting troops and attack other players' buildings and/or troops. Defensive players may construct defensive structures to prevent agressive players from reaching their resource producing buildings. Terrain can also be used as an advantage.<br/><br/>A player may be heavily decimated from the attack of another player. It is even possible for players to coordinate their attacks against a stronger opponent and prevent them from dominating the game. Although rare, players can even be completely eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>The game ends in the turn where the last tile is placed. Players compute the total number of victory points awarded from each of their buildings left standing and the player with the most points wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

After the use of these technologies in the military field and a devastating war, civilization finds itself on the margins of survival. In this climate of tension between the population of the lower social class and the political ruling class, the DeathRace CyberGlobe sport is consolidated. A violent race of BOTs driven by humans  for the conquest of fame and economic power. The DeathRace CyberGlobe has become the dream of turning life but also an outlet for the population that is being overwhelmed by this &quot;format&quot; as a dogma and only pastime. The teams take part in the races putting their lives at risk, even knowing that they have very few chances to win, since the Tracks are full of traps and in the race BOT automata are introduced to make the competitions even more lethal and spectacular.<br/><br/>The game:<br/>The game is recommended for players over 10 years old, not because of the complexity, but because of some violent terms in it (although I believe that on TV there are certainly worse contents in the protected area). and some small component. Structured to play it from 1 to 4 players with a small and simple AI that controls the BOT automata. There are three categories that vary the difficulty and time of a game (between 30-90 minutes).<br/>The BasicLine: the simplest category that helps the player to understand the mechanics of the game.<br/>TeamRacer: The category dedicated to teams, where each player can compete with a team of 4 maximum BOTs.<br/>DeathRace: The most destructive category thanks to the additional weapons that BOTs can equip.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In all of the games playable with these decks, a duplicate letter can be used as a wild card standing for any letter, e.g. in &quot;FFGHT&quot;, since there are two 'F's one can be considered an 'I', spelling &quot;FIGHT&quot;.<br/><br/>Rules are included for seven games: <br/><br/>    1: A fishing game like Logomachy (which is like Scopa), where a card played either combines with cards on the table to make a word, or is left on the table.<br/>    2: Poker using words, either 5-card stud, 7-card stud or 5-card draw. <br/>    3: Bingo, each player having a 3x3 array of cards, turning cards one at a time in any order (except the middle card last), with the first 3-letter word formed winning. <br/>    4: Rummy, where players draw but never discard, laying down words from their hand or adding to words on the table, and the first player to play all their hand wins. <br/>    5: Rummy, like #4 except a card is discarded at the end of each turn. <br/>    6: Rummy, like #5 except that adding letters to a word lets you steal the word. <br/>    7: Players start with 13-card hands, all players simultaneously pass a card to the left until one player announces having a word worth 15+ points and claims the pot. Then the player with the word gives one-word clues to their word until another player guesses their word, and the two split the second pot. <br/><br/><br/>Each game uses chips, with players adding chips to the pot during play, and the winner claiming the pot.

It has two decks, each of which 4 of each vowel (1 of the 4 having a star), 2 of each common consonant, and 1 each for the six rarer consonants.  There are rules for three games:<br/><br/>In Word-Opsy, in each turn a player lays down a word from the hand, or adds cards to one of their existing words (in either case refilling the hand back up to 6 cards), or draws a card and passes. After the last card is drawn and everyone gets an extra turn, each word scores the square of its length, with every star in it adding the word's value again.<br/><br/>Word-Rummy plays like Word-Opsy except that players discard a card at the end of their turn, and do not draw if they pass. The games ends when one player plays all the cards from their hand. Scoring is as in Word-Opsy with the player going out getting a 25-point bonus.<br/><br/>Word-Cassino plays like Casino, where a turn is taking a card from the hand and either: making a word with it and cards on the table to claim those cards; adding it to cards on the table and announcing a word to be finished later in the round; or adding it to the table cards. After the deck is played out, the player with the most cards gets 3 points, the most vowels gets 1 point, and 1 point for each Q, Z, or star card. Hands are played until a player has 21 points or more.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Calling is a Social Deduction game where players are Investigators in the FBI, following up with reports of insanity and murders by the local docks. Soon after, the same symptoms begin to rise within the Precinct causing the Investigators to suspect the work of a Cultist of the whispered Cthulhu, acting as an Investigator by day, and doing the Profane work of the Deep one by night.<br/>The Calling plays similarly to most Social Deduction games with a day phase and a night phase, but the distinctive difference is that it is moderatorless, and part of completing a night action, players wake up the next person. The Calling also uses a &quot;Murder Party&quot; mechanic, where during the day any three players can band together to instantly kill a player, Dead players can also instigate or contribute to murder parties, allowing them a lot of power as the balance of alive and dead players tips towards final day. Finally All dead players become evil once dead, as the Cultist assembles an ever growing army of the dead, to help defeat the astute investigators.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Different operations include Land Campaign, Naval Campaign, Combined Operations,  Mobilization, Fortification and more.<br/><br/>WEIGHT: 5/10<br/><br/>SOLITAIRE: 9/10<br/><br/>Each turn is approximately 1 year and players can either play through the whole war, or the individual phases.

A pesky squirrel is making this harder than it should be. The ornaments fall as the squirrel knocks them off the tree. If any ornament falls completely off the tree, the owner awakes and the game is over, and the players lose. During the game, the players will place ornaments on the tree, and with enough help, they can place the garland around each level on the tree. If the players get all the garland on the tree at each level, plus the shiny yellow star, they win.<br/><br/>In Trim the Tree players cooperatively play cards to add elves to the tree in order to add garland/tinsel around it. Each level of the tree requires support of like-minded elves, indicated by the color of the card. Finish the garland at all levels before the card deck runs out, or you took too long and the family wakes up and you lose.<br/><br/>",

Build 12 Offices, a Legendary Building and the Airport), Events are the cards that you will draw at the end of each round, Challenges, finally, will be cards drawn every 4 rounds after the creation of the second District, a sort of Event Cards but more cruel (E.g. Some criminals stormed up a cargo ship. Remove a ship if you don't have a Task Force card to cancel this Challenge)!<br/>The single-player version it&rsquo;s a pleasant pastime, moreover, you can become familiar with the game mechanics, road construction (curves, intersections, straights) and with the placement of buildings in the most strategic and useful way (where will we put the Police Station? And the Hospital? And if their range doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the whole districts?). <br/>In fact, you could find yourself in some unpleasant situations, where, a faulty District might preclude you some possibilities! Or, even worse, making lose you the goals!<br/>In multi player mode, imagine a situation where 3 mayors join forces against one, literally making it out to the sound of Challenge cards, or excluding him from trade routes or even blow a Legendary Building out of his nose during the auction, (perhaps useful for completing a goal)! <br/>It will also be possible to play in teams, 2vs2, and see which of the two teams manages to make 1 of their mayors stand out before the opponents. And... What if someone betrays his coalition? You decide how to play, the rules leaves you carte blanche!<br/>There&rsquo;s another way called Fair Play Mode, where players decides to play without &quot;throw a monkey wrench in the works&quot;. Who, first, completes the goal revealed by the card drawn at the start of the game, eliminating the auction for Legendary Buildings, will win the game.<br/>Building Cities has very high replayability, where every game will be different from the previous one!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monkey King Chess by Peter Gelman is a chess variant with a main board representing Earth and two small boards representing clouds, 44 squares total. In it, the Monkey King fights the Goblin King in a theme with oriental influences.<br/><br/>The Earth board includes a river which influences play. Forces are asymmetrical, representing mythological forces including sea dragons, celestials and mountains.<br/><br/>The object of the game for the Monkey King player is to move his Pilgrim off the opposite side of the board; a winning move would be any Pilgrim move from row 8 off the board. The object of the game for the Goblin King player is to checkmate the Pilgrim. As with Sittuyin (Burmese Chess), a move that causes stalemate is illegal.<br/><br/>A piece requires the ability to fly to move to or from the Clouds. A few types of disk-faces have this ability. The ability to fly does not imply any additional movement ability or limitations. The fliers are: the six Monkey Kings, the two Goblin Generals, the two Lancers of each side, and the one Celestial of each side. Only a flier can fly to or from or across the Cloud squares. No piece may make a capture when they fly to or from a cloud. Furthermore, a disk may only fly to a cloud square from the magic river square associated with it. The disk may land on either of the two squares of that cloud, so long as that square is empty. No piece may make a capture when they fly to or from a cloud, including flight from one cloud to the other. A disk starting movement on a Cloud square must note the color of the square first; it may fly to any empty square on the Earth board of the same color, or the other Clouds square of the same color if it is empty.<br/><br/>Except for the disks that represent the Pilgrim and the Goblin King, all of the disks are two-sided, with a different chess piece showing on either side. If you start a turn with a disk standing on any magic river square, you may flip the disk and simultaneously move it according to that new game piece's abilities. To put it another way, a disk standing on a magic river square has the ability to move as the disk on either side of its two faces. A disk may not flip if it is not on magic river square.<br/><br/>The Goblin King player cannot flip a disk if the Goblin King disk is not on Earth board (thus before initial placement, or after its capture, means the Goblin King player cannot flip disks). The Monkey King player cannot flip disks unless he/she has initially placed the Pilgrim disk on the board.<br/><br/>The two sides' pieces start the game roughly, but not exactly symmetrical. For the most part, even when identical on the front side, Red and Blue disks flip for different transformations.<br/><br/>There are twelve types of disks in the game: Pawn, Sea Serpent, Monkey King, Knight, Lancers, Goblin General, Whirling Monkey Fists, Celestial (a different type on each side), Goblin King, and Buddhist Pilgrim.<br/><br/>The game starts with the boards empty. Starting with the Goblin King player, each player takes turn either introducing a disk on their half of the Earth board, or moving a disk they previously had placed. Players may not introduce disks in this manner on any Cloud square.<br/><br/>The disks have a front and a back. Players may only place disks with the front side showing. The back side of the disks cannot appear unless the piece stands on a magic river square and flips it.<br/><br/>All pieces that can capture move as they capture except the Sea Serpent. The Pilgrim and the Red Celestial cannot capture. Brave Whirling Monkey Fists is an off-board counter, not a normal type of chess piece.

        "description": "This book brings together several related exercises in game design. The game of Tetrad itself is the product of an effort to devise a simple game of abstract strategy for four players . . . .<br/><br/>The Tetrad board was designed with several considerations in mind: to provide a layout well suited to a four-way game, to accommodate a wide variety of traditional games, and to be compact enough to fit on the cover of the book. . . .<br/><br/>The TETRAD playing field consists of 120 octagonal spaces arranged in an octagonal pattern. This pattern is printed on both covers. The game is played on one side of the closed book. The playing pieces and dice are stored inside of the book.<br/><br/>The game of TETRAD is designed to be played by exactly four people.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the book<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with six pieces of the same color. These are arranged in a row along one side of the board.<br/><br/>At the center of the board is a group of four spaces. These are each marked with a symbol. The objective of the game is to group four of one's playing pieces at the center. The first player whose color occupies all four of these spaces at the same time, wins the game.<br/><br/>The players take turns casting the dice and moving their pieces. A player begins a turn by casting the two dice. The score of the dice is the total number of steps that the player's pieces may be moved in that turn. One step is the movement of one piece from one space into the next. The pieces can be moved vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. Moving your piece onto a space that is already occupied replaces your opponents color with your own.<br/><br/>The TETRAD board can be used to play many other games; instructions for various and adapted games are included in the book.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You lose body parts when other players attack you, though you can use defence cards and wildcards to stop other player's attacks.<br/><br/>Wildcards include the Magician card, where a player leaves the room and a card is hidden. They then have to find it and if they can't they lose 3 body parts.<br/><br/>The game takes roughly 20 minutes to play but gets quicker as it progresses as the number of body parts in the deck dwindles.<br/><br/>Each player can play as many cards as they want during their turn and ends their go when they pick up a card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If so, Zoundz&bull;Like will be an exciting and challenging game for you.<br/><br/>Players must solve the word of phrase disguised in the playword in less than 30 seconds.(Zoundz&bull;Like is a lot more fun and easier to solve if you voice the playword out loud.) The first player or team to land exactly on the start/win space wins the game.<br/><br/>A die roll determines the play card number to be solved and the number of board game moves allowed. When a star appears behind a playword, the player must also give the correct spelling. Drive-By is a bonus turn with a 5 second time limit. Twisters are playwords which require mental and/or visual gymnastics to solve the word puzzle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook (summarized)<br/><br/>",

Follow any instructions on the training card. Put the used training cards in the training discard pile.  Players must discard their remaining training card.  At the beginning of the next training round players may draw three training cards again, but still play only two.  If there are not enough cards in the training card draw pile, shuffle the training card discard pile.  There is a training card called Diversify Your Portfolio, this card allows players to gain two of any attribute, but it may also be split between to attributes.<br/><br/>Battle Round <br/>Once the heroes are trained let the battle begin. <br/>Flip over the rouge for round 1.  Place the energy marker on the rogue board.<br/>In additional rounds flip over round two&rsquo;s rogue at the beginning of the battle round for round two, and round three&rsquo;s rogue at the beginning of battle round three.<br/>Note any special abilities that this rogue may have.  If a rogue is immune to solo attacks of level X, a player may play a solo attack if their skill exceeds the immunity.  For example if a rogue is immune to solo attacks of three or greater of mysticism, but the player has a level four or greater of mysticism, they may still attack at this level.  <br/>The most experienced player should go first.<br/>For the first round each player gets dealt seven cards, but has a hand size of three.  They players draw three cards in their hand, and draw up to three at the beginning of each turn.  If the player discards all their Battle Cards during a round, they are out of the round, but live to fight another day. <br/>For round two each player gets dealt eight cards with a hand size of four.<br/>For round three each player gets dealt ten cards with a hand size of five.<br/>At the end of each round place all unused cards in the discard pile.

Players go through phases of examining the safe, declaring a robbery, then dividing up the spoils. And one player is secretly a detective, trying to spoil the thieves attempts.<br/><br/>The $Billions is stored in a safe, but only one of four locations actually has the money. Players start by examing the decks to find it (players can lie about what they find). When a player feels sure, they declare the job is on and players play bid cards face-down. If the total bid beats the target, the safe is cracked. Then the players bid again in an auction to divide up the loot (matching bids are cancelling). At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>If the detective can make the robberies fail, or recover the loot, the thieves fail.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

It is a two player game which combines strategy with chance.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get all four of your playing pieces on the center dot (and off the board) before your opponent does.<br/><br/>Players start their men on opposite ends of the board. During the game, each player tries to get past the network of walls which his opponent is building against him. As he removes walls that are blocking him, he repositions them where he feels they will most hinder his opponent. Each tries to reach the center red dot (which is the only way off the board).<br/><br/>With both players heading for the center red exit dot they will often find themselves facing each other with no walls between them. These head to head encounters create exciting situations in which one or more pieces can be sent back to their respective &quot;jail&quot; corners to start over again.<br/><br/>The game is quite simple and lots of fun. The advantage can swing from one player to the other and back again many times throughout the entire game.<br/><br/>MAZE is [a wooden product] produced on home-made machines, silk-screened and assembled by hand.

The challenge is to out-smart them and win the established advantage.<br/><br/>OVER 1000 LEVELS OF PLAY!<br/><br/>     Within the same basic playing style<br/>     A new challenge every time you play<br/>     No other game (video or otherwise) offers more diversity<br/>     The ultimate in replay value (2 dimensional)<br/>     Play 4 fun or play 4 skill<br/>     Easy to learn (only requires the ability to count)<br/>     Entertainment for the entire family<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

Each region has upper limits on the capacity of characters, livestock and crops.<br/><br/>The game has economic and military features. Each player starts with a single clan region and tries to gain control over additional clans by conquering more regions. The goal is to be the first to occupy a certain number of clans depending on the number of players. Conquests are made by troop movements.<br/><br/>To spread, players can move their pawns to neighbouring regions. Empty regions can be occupied. In occupied regions peaceful coexistence or conflicts can occur, which are then solved by figure majorities.<br/><br/>Conquered areas are farmed and generate income in the form of money and agricultural resource yields.<br/> Each clan has a knight. By participating in tournaments, which are driven by dice rolling, knights can gain weapons and shields that increase their fighting power and are thus useful in conquering, protecting and managing areas.<br/><br/>Gameplay is divided in 3 phases (build-up, protection and endgame) with 4 seasons each.<br/><br/>",

There are both competitive and co-operative variants that plays in about 20 minutes per player.<br/><br/>Complete with other players to build the most and the best roller race, lever linkage, water wash, and gear contraptions in the caves.  The cave is laid out in a 5x5 grid and has build cards (systems such as gears) laid out in it.  The build cards come in 4 system types, four connection types, and have systems on either side.  There are four types of schematics for things to build: Doohickeys, Whatsits, Thingamajigs, and Combobulations.  Use teams of gnomes to shove, flip, replan, and swap build cards to create systems that will meet the requirements of the schematics.  Earn victory points and build your support to get more gnomes to help you in future turns.  Keep building until one schematic deck runs out and the then the highest point total at the end of the round is the winner.<br/><br/>For a co-operative challenge, play the Gremlin Invasion variant.  The gremlins are invading the Caves of Neverwhere and getting in the way of your building plans.  Every turn, a new gremlin is added to the caves and the ones already there stir up more mischief.  Contend with over a dozen different gremlins like Masher Trasher, Fiendish Fil, Jammin' Sammy, and Head Dread.  All with unique and mischievous powers.  If you don't do anything about them they will overrun the caves.  Recruit gremlin hunters to chase the gremlins out of the cave, but be careful, chasing gremlins eats up valuable time and resources.<br/><br/>Plays essentially the same as the competitive game, but the goal is for the team to get to 100 points before time runs out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the Age of the Goremageddon and GRAXX is in a new wave of absolute carnage, brutality and ultra-violence. Along the highways, in hidden territories and throughout the wastelands, abandoned outposts sit, just waiting to be pillaged for everything that sits within. Thrashers engage these outposts, unsure of what awaits them inside: resources, weaponry, relics or even hordes of endless mutants, just lurking in every corner, waiting to feast on the flesh of those who wander within...<br/><br/>Mutant Outpost Massacre is a solitaire game of outpost-raiding in the post apocalyptic universe of Goremageddon (CPOP's flagship tabletop miniatures game; the third edition debuts soon). Players take the roles of 'thrashers' who raid outposts throughout the planet of GRAXX in the hopes of coming across rare items, resources, weapons and engage enemies in a non-stop massacre.<br/><br/>The game can be played in a single session, however, thrashers can continue their exploits in an ongoing career; the game only truly ends when your thrasher perishes. After a successful raid, thrashers gain experience, which is used to purchase new weapons, items and add skills, making them more powerful as they head into raid after raid after raid. Upon the final encounter of their raid, thrashers will face bosses, who will attempt to thwart their efforts to escape. Future expansions (coming soon) will add new encounters, new outposts, new enemies, new traps, bosses and so much more, making the game something players will want to come back to, time and time again.<br/><br/>We welcome you to the Mutant Outpost Massacre. May you live, die and thrash.<br/><br/>Goremageddon is heavily inspired by over-the-top violence, exploitation, gore, horror, humor and post apocalyptic films on the 1980s, as well as RetroWave and Thrash Metal music. Goremageddon is also CPOP's flagship project, made popular by a cult following and already headed into a third edition, due to release soon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players on the dark (criminal) side must defeat the infiltrating investigators. Players on the security (public) side must defeat two dark members or one dark boss.

Players have open roles and secret roles and maybe a third face too.<br/><br/>Players have roles which give them special powers (not secret, open play):<br/>Private detectives: You can see someone's main position, but you cannot make a call.<br/>Sniper: You can eliminate an enemy by pointing out their ID number. (Player is removed from the game).<br/>Youtuber: Information can be diffused. It can be a lie or a real one.<br/>Cafe staff: You can disclose one level of a player's ID number.<br/>Public Security Police: You can defeat an opponent if you can get their ID number.<br/>Kaito (phantom thief): You can select two cards by looking at them.<br/><br/>The game turns on the use of special ID numbers which are produced during the gameplay. The ID numbers are LED displays, with some light and dark sections. The player's card lies on top of their number. During the game, players get to move other players' cards slightly, revealing small sections of the LED display. Gradually they can deduce the secret ID number of the agent and use it against them.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MacGuffin is a cooperative story improvisation game for 3 to 6 players. It provides a framework to guide you in creating a story with a real plot and character development. It is hysterical at times, tragic at others.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>One person, the Game Master, takes on the role of a busybody, or &ldquo;Quidnunc&rdquo;. The Quidnunc craves all the latest news and gossip about a previous escapade involving the protagonists of the story, known as the &ldquo;Hounds&rdquo;. The players other than the Quidnunc assume the roles of the Hounds. In this adventure, the Hounds doggedly chase down an object of vital interest, known as the &ldquo;MacGuffin&rdquo;. The Quidnunc drives the storytelling process by asking questions, making observations, prodding, and generally creating a nuisance of himself to extract every last detail of the Hounds' quest.<br/><br/>The great director Alfred Hitchcock coined the term &ldquo;MacGuffin&rdquo;. A MacGuffin is something that the major characters of a story, both protagonists and antagonists, are chasing. Seemingly, the MacGuffin is what the story is about. However, it is actually irrelevant to the story, which is really all about character interaction and development. The MacGuffin&rsquo;s only real purpose is to bring the characters together and push them into action and competition with each other.<br/><br/>The movies are replete with MacGuffins. The One Ring is the coveted MacGuffin in Tolkein's &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo;. Ahab relentlessly pursues his White Whale to everyone's detriment in Melville's &ldquo;Moby Dick&rdquo;. In &ldquo;Raiders of the Lost Ark&rdquo;, the Nazis hunt the magical Ark of the Covenant as a weapon of ultimate power while Indiana Jones seeks it as an artifact of tremendous historical merit.<br/><br/>In this game, as in the movies, MacGuffins take on many forms. Whatever its nature, the MacGuffin primarily serves as a means to link the major characters, the Hounds and their enemies, in some way. Since the characters all run toward the MacGuffin, they will invariably interact, and plots involving them can be woven into a single coherent tale whose sum is greater than their individual contributions.<br/><br/>Each player has final say over a single major character in the story and shares control of the other characters with his or her fellow players. When conflicts arise between participants, they bid on the right to narrate the result. So, this game only provides a framework for collaborative storytelling; the actual story is created by the players. Even though MacGuffin is a &ldquo;game&rdquo;, it is the process of telling a collaborative story that matters. So, unlike most games, the point of a MacGuffin session is not really the declaration of who won or lost, but the creation of an entirely new story.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the introduction<br/><br/>The print-and-play version is available as a free download, comprised of three PDF documents (totaling 88 pages) and one large ZIP archive of numerous print-and-play game components in PNG format.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Kreuz und quer (Criss-cross)<br/>The players have to get their 8 numbered pawns from their starting spaces to their destination spaces of the same numbers at the opposite side of the game board.<br/>Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Each die has two large different colored dots and 4 numbered sides<br/>(1-4), each in one of the four colors. Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results.<br/>The pawns move forward according to the rolled numbers. The roll of a dot allows for a side-wards move. Instead of moving straight ahead, the pawns have to jump <br/>diagonaly over oppenent pawns to a free space, whenever it is possible. If a pawn lands on a spot, already occupied by an opponent pawn, the later is eliminated from <br/>the game.<br/><br/>2. Im Kreise hin und der (In circles back and forth)<br/>The players use 4 pawns, which the have to move to space 50 of their color. Movement is determined by 4 special dice.<br/>Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results. The roll of a number moves a pawn accordingly forward. The roll of a dot moves a pawn <br/>sideways between the red and green tracks or between the blue and yellow tracks. If a pawn reaches space 44 on the neighboring track, it continues at space 1 of it's own <br/>track for another round.<br/><br/>3. Wer ist der Erste? (Who ist the first?)<br/>Each player uses 1 pawn, which he has to move from space 1 to space 36 of it's own color. Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Results of one's own color allows <br/>the pawn to move forward accordingly. Results of another color are deducted from the results of one's own color. The difference determines how much coins the player <br/>gets from the cash box or has to pay into the cash box. The first player to reach space 36 wins the contents of the cash box. On spaces 12, 17, 24 and 34 positive <br/>or negative points are multiplied.<br/><br/>4. Wer ist der Letzte? (Who is the last?)<br/>Each player uses 4 numbered pawns. Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results. First each player <br/>has to get his pawns onto the spaces 1-4 of his color according to the number of each pawn, so when a green 4 is rolled, the green pawn 4 is put on the green space 4. <br/>Only when all four pawns are on the board, they are allowed to move. A pawn occupying the center space may be thrown out by an opponent's pawn. If a player may move more <br/>than one pawn the numbers must be used in ascending order. For each rolled number has to be uses by another pawn, so when 3 red numbers are rolled, three red pawns have <br/>to be moved, if this is not possible the move is forfeit. If two dots of one are rolled, the player may return one of his pawns to its starting position (spaces 1-4), <br/>as long as non of his pawns has reached space 12.

Usually, the first run of the game takes about double the estimated time, for the players to go through the rules and understand the basics of the game. The suggested age span for players is 13-100 years old.<br/><br/>The player characters make their living in the game by undertaking quests, each of which offer rewards and opportunities, but under a constant threat of injury, depression and loss of incentive. Throughout their quests they gather resources and wealth, improve in Skills and Items, increase their reputation, gain Companions. On the other hand, each of their failures brings enemies and perils they will need to face before the end. Between quests the characters rest, recover and use their resources to better prepare for the following, bigger challenges. Alas, all they do bring them closer to facing the final challenge, also known as The Battle of Fate. The Battle of Fate is made against an unknown enemy, named the Enemy of Fate. Characters who succeed in the Battle of Fate, are named Champions of Fate. All others are forgotten, as bitter failures of history.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The players set out from the village of Raventown blazing a path into the Great Forest, each searching for 2 items. The first player to successfully bring their 2 items back to Raventown wins. While this might seem a bit boring, there are many things lurking about in the forest that might put some excitement in your travels and thwart your progress.<br/><br/>The game is designed as a family game, with no significant strategic advantages for anyone. As a matter of fact, trying to play strategically might just prove futile. Just when you think you are in a position to win, events may well mess things up. The game is designed for competition, but can also have some cooperative elements if the players should so choose. For videos and more information, please see links below. Thank you for your interest!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The process is intended to teach resilience, innovation, and the benefits of trial and error.<br/><br/>During the game, the players operate a business and aim for success. The game has a deck of cards, each providing different events, some progress their goals, some set them back, some provide new opportunities. Players try to develop their enterprise and turn setbacks into innovations, with a take that element in gameplay.<br/><br/>Players draw to their hand and then play from their hand. Some cards have special enhancing effects to already played cards. Most of the cards are split diagonally, with a positive side, and a black negative side. When a player puts the card into their tableau, they can turn it to show the positive benefits, or turn it to show the negative failures. Players must build on their failures before they can win.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MatriO is a card and board game based on matrix multiplication. The game is played with standard (usually miniature-sized) playing cards and a special board, using specially designed markers to maintain player scores.<br/><br/>The board is laid out with three grids, a 3x4 grid and a 4x3 grid of card-sized trays and a 3x3 grid where players' &quot;dot markers&quot; are placed during the game. One of the card-tray grids is positioned to the left of the 3x3 grid, and the other card-tray grid is positioned above the 3x3 grid. The trays are labeled by card suit, a total of six trays for each suit.<br/><br/>Players are each dealt 13 cards (jokers are left in the deck, and the 4 of clubs and 10 of diamonds are discarded in advance of dealing). Players take turns placing a card in one of the trays on the board. If there are empty trays labeled with a given suit, then cards of that suit may only be played in one of those empty trays, and suited cards may not be played in an empty tray labeled with a different suit. Jokers may be played anywhere at any time.<br/><br/>When a player completes a row-column combination by filling the last empty tray of a row or column, the player places one of their &quot;dot makers&quot; in the cell of the 3x3 grid corresponding to the row and column combination they have just completed. The sum of the products of the correspondingly positioned cards in the row and column become that makers &quot;dot score&quot;. This score can change throughout the game as other cards are laid in trays in that row and column.<br/><br/>When all 9 cells in the 3x3 grid are filled by players' dot markers, any player with no dot markers on the board is out of the game and their cards are discarded.<br/><br/>Remaining players continue to place their cards. When those players have plaid all their cards, the winner of the game is the player whose dot scores total is highest.<br/><br/>Numerical scores of cards are as follows: Queen of Spades: 13, all other black face cards 10, all black number cards their own numerical value. All red face cards are -10, and all red number cards are negative their own value. Jokers are 0.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Not wanting to stick around and get caught up in an unprofitable war, they take a 100-year loop out into deep space and back in stasis. They awake to find no new wormgate, fractured civilizations, and broken cities. The Captain's first order of business is to find some real food to eat. And to figure out what the frak is going on.<br/><br/>Dark Metal: Mercenaries in the Deep is a solo or co-op, open miniatures science fiction tabletop adventure RPG. Players can create their own squad leader and allies, or select from one of the pre-made character sets to get started a little quicker. Movement is either distance or hex based and the board is created by the player based on the scenario's instructions. The gamer provides their own minis, terrain, and dice from their existing collection to create the experience.<br/><br/>Players go through a series of missions and scenarios linked together with progressive narrative elements on their journey to investigate what has happened within the star system since they left. They will grow in abilities, knowledge, and equipment as they are sent out on mission after mission. Player builds range from heavily armored warriors bristling with weaponry, to lithe bio engineered splicers dashing across the terrain to engage in close combat, to half metal cybernetic beings aiming high caliber weapons downrange to plink off enemies at a distance.<br/><br/>Dark Metal will be initially available as a print and play game with optional accessories.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are many smaller details which are the same, e.g. having only armor units exert a zone of control.<br/><br/>Five scenarios are provided. Four differ only in length - they cover from Summer 1939 to Spring 1945, Winter 1945-6, Winter 1940-1, and Winter 1941-2 - and can be played by from two to six players. The fifth scenario covers the same period as the first one but players are free to make any alliances they wish; this requires six players.<br/><br/>A few optional rules are provided, such as having Turkey and Spain enter as minor allies, building new production sources, partisans, etc.<br/><br/>",

Construct buildings in your name and convince your friends to visit them. Convene surprise committees and focus all the attention on you because it&rsquo;s a race for whomever will have the biggest measurable impact on campus before the end of the school year! Lead a department and assign your student workers to gather resources. Use these resources to complete your department&rsquo;s strategic plans and graduate students to have the biggest measurable impact on-campus. The goal of the game is to earn the most Contribution Points (CP)<br/><br/>Assets<br/>These four sets of tokens complete Strategic Plans, earn additional student pawns, and graduate alumni. There is a hard limit on how many assets tokens there are (23) and once they are taken no more can be taken from the Public Supply until players return them. These are the four assets: Blue Labor, Red Satisfaction, White Prestige, and Yellow Approval.<br/><br/>Money<br/>Use Money to construct buildings and enact Strategic Plans. There is no limit to how much money can be in the game. If players must use more than what is provided, keep track in any other way.<br/>Special Regulations<br/><br/>Strategic Plans<br/>These cards can be held face down or face-up at the discretion of each player. Keeping them confidential ensures other players don&rsquo;t strategically monopolize resources you need. To complete a Strategic Plan, return the asset and money cost from your personal supply to the Public Supply or bank and retrieve the listed reward. Draw from the four face up cards unless instructed otherwise. Always replace a drawn Strategic Plan card with a new Strategic Plan. Put completed Strategic Plan cards under your Department Identity card and these remain secret until the end of the game.<br/>If instructed to reset the Strategic Plans, shuffle the face-up four plans back into the deck and draw four new ones.<br/><br/>Committees<br/>These will give you benefits or hinder other player&rsquo;s progress. Go to the Alumni Center to play these and discard them after use. Players have a hand limit of 4 Committee cards and must discard down to 4 immediately whenever they exceed this limit. When the draw deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile to create a new one.<br/><br/>Constructing Buildings<br/>Player 1 chooses a building to discuss. Starting with Player 1 and going clockwise, each player commits any amount of money towards the construction of a new building. Continue to go around until all players are satisfied with their contributions. If the total money committed meets or exceeds the building&rsquo;s listed cost, move all contributed money to the Bank and build the building. Otherwise, return all player&rsquo;s money and discard the building in question.<br/>Continue this until all three buildings have been discussed.<br/>When the draw deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile to create a new one.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Compete for knowledge, favor and glory as one of the greatest artists the world has ever known! Renaissance Rivals is a 2-4 player card-driven game that can be played in about an hour, combining streamlined tableau and deck building with an innovative system of tactical movement. Players take on the role of artists of the Italian Renaissance as they move around a &quot;map&quot; of Italy (represented by a 4 x 4 grid of cards), using the cards drawn from their decks to obtain Commissions and complete eight unique Masterpieces. On a typical turn, you will draw four cards from your deck to generate Influence points (which allow you to acquire Commission cards) and Advancement points (required to complete your artist&rsquo;s Masterpieces). Every time you acquire a Commission, you must decide whether to add the card to your deck to generate more resources in future turns, or add it to your Palette to unlock the Skills that will enable you to obtain more valuable Commissions and complete more prestigious Masterpieces. Different kinds of Commissions trigger movement in different directions, so you need to be strategic about the order in which you acquire them. Furthermore, each Masterpiece can only be executed in its designated city (or &quot;map&quot; row), so completing all eight will require strategy and foresight!<br/><br/>The game ends when any player completes all her Masterpieces, or as soon as a player obtains the most highly prized commission, the rebuilding of the Basilica of St. Peter&rsquo;s.  Victory Points are scored for Commissions remaining in each player's deck and for each completed Masterpiece, and the player with the highest total is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The government responds by building a series of defence robots to protect the people. But Japan is too small to store the robots intact, so they must be kept in pieces and re-combined as needed.<br/><br/>The players work to build a robot out of a variety of components in order to meet the oncoming threat. The main robots form a series of specialities: land, space, ground, air, underwater, female, force, flame, and almighty. But in the game, these parts are inter-changeable into infinite combos. So players try to build the robot with different characteristics by combining parts from all types.<br/><br/>The game has 12 story cards (the players work to resolve five of the stories), and 48 robot parts. A complete robot has a head, torso, arms and legs. Players are dealt five robot cards at random and then draw and discard cards to try and get a whole robot in their hand that will resolve the story.<br/><br/>When everyone has a robot prepared, they are shown. the one that scores highest against the target wins the round and takes the story card. The robot parts are shuffled and redealt and the game continues. the winner is the player who gets the most story cards.<br/><br/>The robot deck includes a computer virus card. If theis is included in the game, it disrupts play by making random changes to a player's hand. Their neighbour discards a card at random from their hand, disrupting their plans.<br/><br/>The designer intended players to enjoy the experience of building robots like the anime of their childhood. The game can be played by young children by just experimenting with robot combos.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

This incredible set unleashes the uncontrolled fury of the Blood God, Khorne, and the seductive temptation of the Prince of Pleasure, Slaanesh. Not only do you get a host of daemonic minions that serve these rival Chaos Gods, but there are no less than three booklets that introduce new background and rules for both Warhammer Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40,000! Here&rsquo;s what you'll find in the set:<br/><br/>- 38 Citadel Miniatures, including the following:<br/><br/>Daemons of Khorne<br/> 1x Karanak, the Hound of Khorne<br/> 10x Bloodletters<br/> 3x Bloodcrushers<br/> 5x Flesh Hounds<br/><br/>Daemons of Slaanesh<br/> 1x Infernal Enrapturess<br/> 10x Daemonettes<br/> 3x Fiends of Slaanesh<br/> 5x Seekers of Slaanesh<br/><br/>- A 24-page Wrath and Rapture booklet, describing the endless and ever-shifting dimension utterly devoid of reason and logic that is the Realm of Chaos (if such a thing is even possible). The concept of the Great Game played (and fought) between the Dark Gods is introduced, in which Khorne and Slaanesh are two of the fiercest rivals. There is an entire section of the nature of daemonic names, and there are also three tables of such names for you to generate for your Daemons.<br/><br/>- A 24-page Denizens of the Warp booklet, which introduces tales of murderous conflicts fought between the daemonic legions of Khorne and Slaanesh in the 41st Millennium. Also included are three Echoes of War missions and a campaign to help you refight these battles, as well as Stratagems and a full set of datasheets for the models included in the box.<br/><br/>- A 24-page Bane of the Mortal Realms booklet, describing an exciting storyline that led to bitter war between the rival Chaos powers and providing a trio of battleplans to refight them. It also includes full sets of warscrolls for all of the Khornate and Slaaneshi miniatures in the box, as well as their allegiance abilities and warscrolls, and two warscroll battalions.<br/><br/>- A double-sided token sheet containing two 9&quot; range rulers, a Prey of the Blood God marker (used to identify Karanak's prey), Khornate and Slaaneshi wound markers, and six numbered objective markers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Yet, their years of backstabbing and bitterness have lead to yet another war.  Since the Kings can no longer fight, they have fortified themselves inside their Castles to defend themselves.  In Castle Board Game, the kings do not move from their positions in the center of the back row of the board.  Each king directs his armies to achieve victory by capturing the opposing king.<br/><br/>In order to counterbalance the huge disadvantage of an immobile King, walls have been erected to provide defensive advantages for each Castle.  Additionally, a new character, HouseCarl, has been added to protect the fixed position of the King.  As you embark on this new journey, beware of spies that can sneak through Castle walls unnoticed.

        "description": "The Sound Cypher is a game that was developed out of a love for good music. In its infancy, the game started off as a light hearted rivalry between two people to see who had deeper music knowledge and better taste. Over time the rivalry evolved into a living room game shared amongst friends &amp; family.  Now, it&rsquo;s coming out as a card game that people of all ages can enjoy.<br/><br/>There are three editions ready for release including the Open format edition, R&amp;B/Soul edition, and the Hip-Hop edition. No matter the age or music preference of the players, The Sound Cypher is easy to play and fun for everyone in the room!<br/><br/>To start the game, the first player picks a card from the deck then reads it out loud. They then have 90 seconds to play their first song. The second player has up to 2 minutes or until the end of the second verse to play their song, and so on.<br/><br/>Voting is done in one of two ways. Players can vote for their favorite song by placing a card in the designated area at the end of each round; the player with the most votes wins. Live voting can also be employed via the audience as the game is in progress. At the end of any voting option, the best song wins. <br/>The Sound Cypher has rules that must the adhered to be eligible to win each round. Some of the rules include:<br/><br/>     No use of search engines or online sources<br/>     Song played after time limit not eligible to win <br/>     All songs get to play for at least 1 minute<br/>     Players can only vote for themselves once<br/>     Ties are settled by the greatest number of YouTube views<br/>     Artists can only be used once per round<br/>     Songs can only be used once per game<br/>     The card dictates the type of music for each round <br/><br/><br/>So, whether you&rsquo;re 7 or 70, a casual music listener or a die hard music fan, a group of complete strangers or old friends The Sound Cypher is a great way for everyone to enjoy music in a way they never imagined. After playing The Sound Cypher you&rsquo;ll never listen to music the same way again!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On the way they must overcome intricate traps and battle a dangerous dragon by gaining and playing crown chips - on the reverse these have chess pieces of varying value by type and they are stored on the player's shield panel. Players progress around and up the board, traversing the traps using the chips which serve to stop the marble held underneath their wooden knight from falling. Battles between Knights and the dragon compare the relative values of the white and black chess figures on the Knight and the Dragon, the latter represented by dragon chips. To win the battle the player must knock down the black figure with their white figure or figures of the same or a higher value. The game ends when no more dragon chips are left in the bank and the winner is the player with the most points value left on their shield panel.<br/><br/>The game box also includes a colourful standard chess board and cardboard stand-up chess pieces.<br/><br/>The game was developed by Alexandra Kosteniuk, the 12th Women's World Chess Champion, and includes a book of Chess Rules written by her that includes puzzles to work through and a glossary of chess terms. &quot;Let me welcome you to the exciting world of the Chess Kingdom!

They roll these to get one number (called the Target Number) that must be matched exactly by rolling five D6 and using any mathematical operation among them. Players score points based on being able to do this with few throws of the D6, if the target is prime, or if some of the five D6 are not needed.<br/><br/>The game works fine solo, and competitively can be played where everyone uses the same dice to come up with best and fastest answer or where each player rolls individually for the best total score.<br/><br/>Game comes in small plastic bag.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Players have only 2 actions per turn, so play goes fast. Players will move cards around in a field of nine, discover potential targets, position cards in their own hand, draw new cards, collect coins, and attempt to whack rival Clients to earn victory points.<br/><br/>There are only 2 kinds of cards in Hit City Hustle: Clients and Hitmen. Clients are recruited and used to earn coins. Higher value Clients can earn more coins, but are also worth more victory points to rivals. Hitmen are recruited and then paid to eliminate rival Clients. Higher value Hitmen are stronger, but more expensive to activate.<br/><br/>Cards remain facedown for most of the game. This allows plenty of opportunities to bluff about the value of a Client or a Hitman. Bluffing allows bold players to get a leg up on the competition. However, rivals can call anyone&rsquo;s bluff by paying a coin. Get caught bluffing and your action is forfeited. Special rules on unique cards also affect play!<br/><br/>Once a player reaches 15 or more victory points, finish the round so all players have had the same number of turns. Finally, count all players' victory points and whacked clients to determine the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Every ten years each planet sends its strongest candidate to win votes through skill in battle and the determination of the government's leading senators. Only after the blood and death that such an election as this can bring will a candidate be named Galactic President.<br/><br/>Galactic Presidency is a complex strategy game that uses both cards and dice. In each round candidates (players) utilize an Alien Power and have up to three senators, each using a unique weapon, battle for supremacy in the GALACTIC ARENA. All senators start with the same amount of health for their &quot;head, body, and legs.&quot; A senator is killed when they no longer have health in one of these areas. Besides the use of Combat Cards there are also random events that can help or hurt all senators and will in some cases kill them. Candidates can win &quot;Electoral Votes&quot; but the vote value is kept hidden and is only revealed and counted if there is no clear victor at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game can be played with 2 to 5 players, 12 years or older. The playing time is between 1.5 and 2.5 hours depending on your modifications to the rules - its easy enough to lengthen or shorten your game time. Our game is designed to promote &quot;enjoyment through creativity&quot; as well as keeping the potential to win the game even if the player had all of his senators killed.<br/><br/>To win the game a candidate must win two of three rounds, which is when one candidate is left standing, or have the greatest number of Electoral Votes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to be find the missing persons during your round, or the rescue mission, and save one of per round. There are a total of five rounds, each round you have the opportunity to save one missing person.<br/><br/>Shuffle the 18 cards to form a face-down draw deck. Remove the top card of the deck from the game without looking at it. Each player draws one card from the deck. This is the player&rsquo;s hand, and is kept secret from the others. On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. Then choose one of the two cards in your hand and discard it face up in front of you. You must apply any effect on the card you discarded. All discarded cards will remain in front of the player who discarded them, keeping them visible to all playing. Since this is a game of deduction and reasoning, this will help players try to count which cards are remaining. After applying the card&rsquo;s effect, the turn passes to the next player, this game is played clockwise. A round ends when the deck is empty at the end of the final turn, the player with the highest rank hand saves the hostage. If there is a tie, the player who discarded the highest total of cards is the winner, even if that player was previously eliminated. The winner of the round oversees the next investigation and will shuffle the cards and begin another round.<br/><br/>Missing Persons is a Search and Rescue game that is similar in play style to other deceptive based games.

This is a headquarters defense/money management game where each decision you make has a consequence. Anything goes in this game.<br/><br/><br/>        HOW TO PLAY<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>A turn consists of players using money they've earned to play 2 cards from their hand of 5 cards. Once the 2 cards are played and replaced from the deck, their turn is over.<br/><br/>Depending on what two cards were played a variety of things could have  happened. If someone played a criminal activity or trade card, they got money from either the black market or another player. If a defense card was played then it was used to defend the headquarters or a business. If an offense card was played then another player was attacked. If a business card was played then the player gained a new way to generate money each turn. All this while negotiating deals with other players and trading cards and money. And any deals made, can be broken. This is the criminal underworld after all.<br/><br/><br/>        HOW TO WIN<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The aim of the game is to be the last player standing. Do this by eliminating all other criminal organizations. You eliminate a criminal organization by bringing their power down to zero. Once all other players are eliminated you win.<br/><br/><br/>        GAME STORY<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The criminal underworld of Palm City has been operating without interruption since the city was first founded. The criminal way of life is sewn into the fabric of these people&rsquo;s culture. Due to this, both the city and the criminal underworld within it have thrived. Leaving plenty of room for each sector of crime to have its own fully operational organization with its own established leader. All cyber crimes are initiated by the Shadow Crew. Weapons coming into the city go through Hell&rsquo;s Angels. Drugs are manufactured and distributed by Los Zetas. Protection is given to businesses from the Buscetta Family. The art of assassinations are strictly Yamiguchi-Gumi. And lastly prostitution is an option in this city. The girls are protected and managed by The Richardson Gang. That was before, this is now. Business can only get so good without expansion, and with the city&rsquo;s potential capped out, there is only one option for bringing in more money. Start dipping into the other sectors of crime. With the Buscetta Family selling drugs and Shadow Crew dealing weapons it is only a matter of time until someone feels like they&rsquo;ve been wronged. A matter of time until they feel their piece of the pie is getting smaller. That&rsquo;s when war begins. And when the dust settles, only one organization will be left standing. Times are changing.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Criminal Underworld.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As you combine a limited supply of 14 cards (valued 2-7 with a variable Ace) against these targets, you will only have the opportunity to retrieve these cards when meeting targets precisely. Therefore, the challenge is to complete all of Simon's missions with a dwindling supply of Combiner cards, and not let the Combiner cards run out too soon.<br/><br/>While its roots are traditional, the game features character artwork designed to bring players into this world of spies in the 1940's.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>The other night, when many characters were out of their books enjoying a sojourn in the night air, a crime was committed, grim and grave, right in our own library. As a result, his Majesty Henry VIII &mdash; that famous monarch from the English history books &mdash; has disappeared. Gathered are the characters that were present at the time of the nasty deed. The perpetrator of this heinous crime will no doubt be revealed as the party proceeds.<br/><br/>HOW IT WORKS:<br/><br/>This is &quot;mystery&quot; not a &quot;murder mystery&quot;. It is suitable for anyone aged 9 years and upwards and is good, clean fun. This deck is for 8 to 30 guests. There are 3 different endings, each with a different person who did it. Most of the cards support Version A, but there are additions to the report and Who Did It cards for Versions B and C.<br/><br/>8 SUSPECTS:<br/><br/>Alice (from Alice&rsquo;s Adventures In Wonderland), Huck Finn, Cinderella, Pinocchio, Little Red Riding Hood, Peter Pan, Goldilocks and Aladdin.<br/><br/>INCLUDED:<br/><br/>5 Host Guide Cards: Invitations, D&eacute;cor suggestions, Preparing props (optional), Menu suggestions, Preparing prizes (optional), Running the party, &ldquo;The Rules&rdquo; (4 sides).<br/>30 Nametags / Descriptions and Dress Suggestions<br/> 96 Clue Cards: A1, A2, and A3<br/>3 Special Investigator&rsquo;s Report Cards<br/> 7 Who Did It Cards: Don&rsquo;t let anyone read these before the end of the party.<br/><br/>RUNNING THE PARTY:<br/><br/>1 Decide if you are using Version A, B or C. <br/>2 Invite your guests and let them know which character you want them to play. Refer them to a special webpage where they can see their character's description and dress suggestions. Tell your guests to read the suspect descriptions before the party as sometimes clues are hidden in them. <br/>3 Put each nametag card (with description on the back) in a lanyard badge holder and give it to each person as they arrive. <br/>4 Read out the Rules Cards (then leave them on the table for late arrivals).<br/>5 Have the 8 suspects read out their descriptions to the group (but not dress suggestions). <br/>6 Hand out the clue cards. Note who it is to be said by (i.e., either a character or &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; except the suspects it mentions).<br/>7 Most clues are statements. They can say their clue in their own words as long as they don&rsquo;t change the meaning. If someone has a question for a suspect, they will have a response on one of their cards. <br/>8 For small parties of 16 or less guests, there are 3 acts and everyone goes around the group and says a clue and repeats that until all the clues have been said for each act. Anyone can go first as long as it isn't a response card. For larger parties, you ignore the &quot;act numbers&quot; and everyone just mingles and talks about their clue cards.<br/>9 Later a report is read out to the whole group. <br/>10 Everyone should write down who they think did it and how and why they did it. <br/>11 The suspects read out the Who Did It? cards.<br/><br/>",

This the last place between the realms offering fertile land and ancient treasures. Yet unexplored and dangerous, the future of your people lies there. Gather your bravest Champions and become the ruler of Aer. But beware as you are not the only one who follows the call.<br/><br/>Champions of Aer is a semi-competitive strategy game for 2 players about might, exploration and resource management set in the fantastic world of Aer.<br/><br/>The players controll Champions which explore a randomized map every playthrough and have to overcome risky challenges. They can choose between five factions with unique play styles, troops, magic spells and quests. Additionally the seasons highly impact their advance as many challenges and the strength of their troops are altered by them.<br/><br/>In order to become the Champion of Aer players have to complete quests, which will reward exploring the map, gaining control over territories and developing their city.<br/><br/>Gaining control over territories is simple but dangerous. The Champions, accompanied by their loyal troops,have to defeat unknown challenges on every map tile. The composition of the troops, spells and the ability to call reinforcements mid-fight are key to overcome the dangers awaiting them. Luckily, by expanding their empire the players can gather better troops, learn ancient spells and even hire more champions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

He has kicked the ass behind so many wolves that his reputation is no more to do. If John squats a Sheepfold, he cancels two Wolves. The Sheep Beast: this traitor has sold his soul to the Wolves. If you have it in a Sheepfold, its deceit is such that it cancels two Sheriffs Colley<br/>     The Fairy Sheep: Moumoute is a particularly vain Sheep who spends a lot of time to maintain its fleece. Certainly it costs a fortune in shampoo and other cosmetics,<br/><br/><br/>but the player who owns it marks a Wool Tile bonus of 3 points.<br/><br/>     The Pink Sheep: This quartet is composed of Sheep fashions victims. Indeed they have the particularity of being endowed with 2 Attributes instead of one. On the other hand, their atypical Colour is not among the Objectives.<br/>     MultiColoured Sheep: These wild Sheep in the desert plains of the Fildar region have very Colourful wool. Each of these Sheep displays 3 Colours of wool! Practical to easily complete the Objectives. However, they do not have any Attribute.<br/>     The Coyote: it&rsquo;s the Wolf version more sly. This deceitful animal hides on the back of the MultiColoured Sheep. Its villainy allows it to play with poor Sheriff Colley so much that this one does not frighten it.

        "description": "THE STORY<br/>On an island far from humanity lies a secret facility run by a mad scientist. She is the most evil person&mdash;the most cunning, the most horrific (and did I mention evil?) person known to woman. Her facility consists of a laboratory, a torture chamber, holding cells, and a labyrinth.<br/><br/>The laboratory is where the doctor performs her illicit experiments. She has kidnapped people around the world to be her test subjects. She not only has figured out how to clone her subjects but has figured out how to crossbreed animals with humans and vice-versa. One of her successful experiments was of a human and a rat. These hideous creatures are known as BREEDERS. They are half the size of an average human. They are fast, hard to detect, and only come out at night to feed on unexpected prey.<br/><br/>The loud sounds you hear could only be the screams and moans of agony coming from the torture chamber. The torture chamber is where the doctor analyses each subject's tolerance to pain and suffering. She will push their limits until they break or die. Out of the hundreds of corpses that did not pass the test, only six have made it thus far.<br/><br/>These six subjects are known as REAPERS. They are creatures that take on the form of a human and an animal that have been genetically modified and mutated. They are in their holding cells where they await to be released into the labyrinth and unleash their terrifying acts of evil. They are trained to prey on human flesh and they will stop at nothing until they do.<br/><br/>While these are some of the ghastly things to come out of the doctor's laboratory, it does not end there. Some of her experiments consist of chemical solutions that alter one's abilities. Thus, giving them supernatural powers. This supernatural ability can range from running five times faster than a cheetah to being undetectable like a Chameleon. This chemical solution is called GEN-13. GEN-13 derives from 12 separate chemical solutions plus one unknown. When the unknown is used on a creature, it becomes the ELEMENTAL. The ELEMENTAL has the power to claim all 12 chemical solutions if present.<br/><br/>The doctor is now looking to abduct new test subjects around the world to continue with her GEN-13 experiments. This evil doctor is known as Dr. Culebra.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/>In The Island of Dr. Culebra, you play the role of one of Dr. Culebra's test subjects. You and the other test subjects will need to plan, strategize and work together to escape the labyrinth. You and others will be injected with a serum that has a chemical solution that alters your abilities. You and others will use your new ability to overcome obstacles, traps, and creatures in hope of finding a way out of the labyrinth. Will you and others be able to meet the challenge and escape the Island of Dr. Culebra?<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>The object of the game is to escape from the labyrinth of Dr. Culebra's Island. The labyrinth consists of obstacles, traps, and creatures. You will need to find the exit before the time runs out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It was made in Greece from Stam Toys toy company, probably in the early 80's.<br/><br/>It can be played from 2-4 players. The winner is the first player who reaches endpoint by the exact number. There are some spaces on the board, with different symbols upon them. When you reach a space with a symbol of a dice you can play again. The blue circle symbol means that you have to go 6 spaces backwards, the yellow circle means that you lose your turn. Moreover, when you reach a space with a blue star upon it, you move 4 spaces forward and you can play one more time. When you reach a space with a red star upon it, you must go back in the beginning.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Update: Because of file size limits for uploading files, here is link to the newly published game tutorial in PDF. Available both in English and Polish: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://spinningdice.pl/game-tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://spinningdice.pl/game-tutorial/</a><br/><br/>The Descendants of Volos is a competitive roleplaying adventure board game set in a fantasy realm inspired by Slavic mythology. Players will play the role of one of many characters called Velevits or &quot;The Descendants of Volos&quot;. They are born with mysterious abilities. Their common special ability is the presence of 3 souls (lives).<br/><br/>The main goal of the game is to become the most powerful and authoritative character within a limited amount of time. You can do it by gaining victory points throughout collecting the achievements and influence tokens (those you get by completing randomly generated quest sequences and solving cases for your organization). There is no &quot;best way&quot; of winning this game. You'll have to improvise, adapt and overcome! This is a competitive game, so not only you should collect victory points, but also try interrupting the other players.<br/><br/>When traveling around the peninsula, your character will fight various monsters, face various situations, grow in strength, collect unique gear, fulfill the quests, and become an influential and respected member of their organizations.<br/><br/>The game is focused on adventures, PvP (Player vs Player) and plenty of PvE (Player vs Enemy) combats. Large and modular map gives incredible replay value. 800+ adventure cards stuffed with unique elements like trinkets, weapons, armors, enemies, side quests and situations. The character evolution is full of choices. Spending skill points on any attribute like strength, agility, intellect, or vitality will shape your combat abilities.<br/><br/>The game can be played by 1 to 4 players and the number of players only slightly affects the playing time, as unique game rules allow half of actions in each turn to be performed simultaneously. It means that you're playing almost all the time, and the waiting time per turn is minimal. There are also special mechanics designed for players who end the game prematurely, so even though they lose, they can still play by becoming a &quot;minion master.&quot; The powerful monsters that were quietly sitting in the dungeons, have been now unleashed and are crawling out and chasing the remaining players. The intensity of the gameplay grows, and the player that lost prematurely can now take revenge, or simply troll the remaining players. This and much much more unique solutions will be revealed before the kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You play as a lone barbarian in a land of trees, sand, and mountains.  You are on a mission to reclaim your throne from a conniving usurper, but you must travel through the unforgiving lands of danger and peril.  Use and carefully upgrade your skills as you travel.  By the time this month passes, when the moon has gone through its phases, it will be too late.<br/><br/>Players hold all the cards needed to play in their hand.  Taking into account the player's skill value in addition to the values on the cards, each event on the cards will have a level of difficulty.  Beat that difficulty, and the player succeeds!  Fail and the repercussions could be loss of health, water, gold or be forced to retreat.  Hex by hex, the player makes their way back to the city where the throne awaits!<br/><br/>Deeply inspired by the 1981 game Barbarian Prince, I've made this game in an attempt to capture the fun and excitement of exploration, adventure, and wilderness-living; while avoiding a dense book of tables and the somewhat arbitrary nature of the classic 1981 game.  All the wonder of exploration, condensed into a mint tin, with only cards, paperclips, and the player's sense of adventure!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Revenge of the Mortals is played over the course of eight rounds.

Players can work together as a squad to overcome these threats or turn on each other in order to score more points. Players will negotiate, and then play a card from their hand face-down in front of them. Once everyone has chosen or The Sands of Time has run out (in which case a card must be selected randomly), each player reveals their chosen card simultaneously.

Each Mainstream Media player must use their own Subject and Motive cards to tell the General Public what actually happened during an Event drawn from the event deck.<br/><br/>This game is not simply a fill in the blank game.  We encourage players to craft their own insane truth to explain what happened and answer the question which the General Public has posed.<br/><br/>The General Public player will choose the winners for the rounds by picking the story they choose to believe.  They may choose the winner by whatever criteria they like.<br/><br/>The winning player will keep the Event card for scorekeeping. A Mainstream News Player is considered to have won the game by having a set amount of News Stories accepted into the mainstream -  that amount may be 3, 5, 10, or as many as players like.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you will either place a terrain card or maneuver a cow. The cows will each take up a different amount of space. Terrain also varies in usable space. Terrain that allows more maneuverability is worth more victory points at the end of the game. Cows are movable as long as they aren&rsquo;t farting. Once they are farting, they are won&rsquo;t be movable for the remainder of the game. Cows can also take up more of the usable terrain space by farting, so time those gaseous releases appropriately.

Each player has 4 word cards, each with 4 words on it and each word 5 letters long. However, each word is an English word spelled out phonetically. On a player's turn they play one of their words out to the board using the letter tiles, similar to Scrabble except players have access to all letters at all times. Once a word is played all other players can make 3 guesses among them what they think the words actually is. If they fail to say the word correctly, the current player earns an additional 10 points. Regardless, players earn points when placing words based on the squares on the board they lay their words. After four rounds, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>This is game #5 of a series from Things Unlimited.<br/><br/>",

Players choose 2 cards during their turn. Then flip over the cards to see the monster head or limbs. Monsters heads need 2 to 4 limbs to be completed.

Your mission is to find and sink all five of your opponent's ships before he does the same to you.<br/><br/>Preparation:  Each player scratches the center of the battleship on their own side of the card to reveal their color code of ships in the game.  One player has red ships, the other player had blue ships.  Each player has one Battleship (four sections long). two Cruisers (three sections long), and two Destroyers (two sections long).<br/><br/>How to Play:  Beginning with the red player, take turns scratching any one square.  By doing so, a player both removes the &quot;fog&quot; and takes a &quot;shot&quot; at that square.  Because of the fog, a player may accidentally hit part of his own ship, as sometimes happens in real life.  Be careful!<br/><br/>When all the sections of a ship are hit, the ship is sunk.<br/><br/>The Mine:  When either player hits a mine, it explodes, and that player immediately scratches all eight surrounding squares if they haven't already been scratched.

        "description": "5 Different Count Dracula Games<br/><br/>Free! Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!<br/><br/>disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away<br/><br/>Objective:  You are in the dare dungeon of the infamous Count Dracula, searching for the famous treasure of jewels know the be hidden in his caskets.  The player who gets away with the most jewels of his own color by the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Preparation: Each player scratches one of the two skull eyes at the bottom of the game card to &quot;see&quot; which color jewels they are seeking.  The &quot;blue&quot; player is player number 1 and is searching for blue numbers representing sapphires.<br/><br/>The &quot;red&quot; player is player number 2 and is searching for red numbers representing rubies.<br/><br/>How to Play:  Player number 1 starts the game by scratching one of the six circles (hiding places) in the bottom of any of the caskets.  The following things may be discovered:<br/><br/>BLUE NUMBERS - You have discovered that many sapphires.<br/>RED NUMBERS - You have discovered that many rubies.<br/>BAT - You immediately lose your turn<br/>CRUCIFIX - The value of all jewels in the casket doubles.<br/>DRACULA - You awaken Dracula!  You must close the casket without taking out any of the jewels.  Immediately scratch off the three boxes in the lid and subtract one point from your score for each sapphire or ruby found in that casket so far.<br/><br/>A player may continue his turn as long as he wishes.   But, when the player uncovers a bat or a Dracula, it then becomes the opponent's turn.<br/><br/>To collect the jewels discovered in the casket, you must be the player who successfully &quot;closes&quot; the casket's lid.  When the casket is closed, the other player's jewels and any remaining uncovered treasure are lost forever.  Remember, no points are scored until the lid is closed.<br/><br/>You may attempt to close a casket at any time as long as at least one hiding place has been scratched.  To close a casket, search for the word &quot;close&quot; in one of the three boxes in the casket's lid.  Uncovering a &quot;squeak&quot; in the lid caused the player to lose his turn and the casket remains open.<br/><br/>When you close a casket, chisel the score on your tombstone scoring area.  When all caskets are closed, the game is over.  The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "5 Different Bermuda Triangles Games<br/><br/>Free! Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!<br/><br/>disposable games to scratch, play &amp; throw away<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:  An invasion of UFOs is hovering over the Bermuda Triangle.  You operate a series of Coast Guard Rescue Stations located just outside the area.<br/><br/>YOUR MISSION: pilot rescue choppers into the dangerous Triangle in search of human survivors.  But don't let the UFOs zap you out of the Solar System.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY (solo version):  You have enough choppers for six rescue flights.  Start each mission by scratching the triangle in front of any rescue station, indicated by a black dot along the sides of the large triangle.  From there, fly in any direction by scratching any triangle that is next to the space you currently occupy.<br/>  <br/>Continue flying through the triangles in search of human ships.  You can move one space at a time, in any direction you desire.  Some spaces will be empty, but others will reveal the following:<br/> DINGY - 1 person aboard<br/><br/>ROWBOAT - 3 people aboard<br/><br/>YACHT - 7 people aboard<br/><br/>CLIPPER - 10 people aboard<br/><br/>UFO - Zap! A UFO abducts you and all your passengers back to Andromeda to work as slaves in a pyramid factory.  This ends that mission and you score no points.  There are about half a dozen UFOs hiding in the triangles, mostly near the outside edge.<br/><br/>RADAR - Radar indicates that a ship larger than a dingy lies in the direction shown within four spaces.<br/>MISSION - Uncovering an &quot;M&quot; give you fuel for an extra mission, if you can return safely from your present one.  If your are capture by a UFO before returning, you lose the extra mission and all the survivors on this trip.<br/><br/>To rescue survivors, you must get them out by flying off any side of the Triangle without running into a UFO. This ends the mission and allows you to score 1 point for each survivor you picked up.  You can fly out of the Triangle right away, or take a chance searching for more survivors before heading out.  Each mission must start from a new rescue station and, since you don't want to waste fuel searching an area twice, a new mission path cannot cross over an old one.<br/><br/>Rescue 50 or more humans to win the game.<br/><br/>TWO PLAYER VERSION - The game plays the same except that players take turns for 3 missions each.  The player rescuing the most humans wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",
