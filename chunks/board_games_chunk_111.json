        "description": "A group of mice must navigate a giant pyramid of cheese, racing each other to see who can collect the most before reaching the top. Mice can wiggle through the holes in the cheese to collect even more, but watch out for the cat!<br/><br/>Having found a lot of holes  in the cheese, the pussy howls: &ldquo;Mice must feel too much at ease, eating up the master&rsquo;s cheese. I will guard it night and day,  shooing naughty mice away!&rdquo; Careful, mice - the cat is sly,  it will hit you &ndash; you will fly. Go running to the top! Keep  the cheese and do not stop! Traps are no threat with cheese, win, do not be scared of these!<br/><br/>GAME COMPONENTS: <br/>Cheese pyramid &ndash; 1,  <br/>&lsquo;cheese lumps&rsquo; <br/>with holes &ndash; 4, <br/> numbered tokens &ndash; 25, <br/> chips:  wooden mouse &mdash; 4,  <br/>wooden cat &mdash; 1;  <br/>glass balls &ndash; 4, <br/>dice &ndash; 1, <br/> rules &mdash;  1.<br/><br/>THE PURPOSE OF THE GAME:<br/>To be first to reach the cheese pyramid, and gain as many points as possible!<br/><br/>THE PROGRESS OF THE GAME<br/> &bull;  The game participants take turns to throw the dice and move the mice game pieces towards the top of the cheese pyramid along the tiers (levels). &bull; The game pieces may only be moved anti-clockwise.    &bull; The movement to each subsequent tier (level) is via four staircases. &bull; Only one game piece may be located in the field. Game pieces may &ldquo;step over&rdquo; each other. If the relevant field is  occupied by another game piece, the player should go to  the free field ahead of it.  &bull; On the fields with symbols the players must comply with their conditions (see the playing field symbols). &bull; When moving or &ldquo;stepping&rdquo; with a game piece over other game pieces the players must hold the marble with a finger of only one hand.<br/><br/>PLAYING FIELD SYMBOLS <br/>1.  The mouse game piece stopped in the field with this symbol: &bull; If the player does not have the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; of his/her piece of cheese closed, he/she will take one token from the bank, and cover the holes with it blindfold, i. e., without turning the token with the number upwards. &bull; If all the holes are already covered with tokens, the player will make an additional move. <br/>2.  The cat game piece has stopped on this field, so the move is to be made to the player who is next in turn. &bull; If the player&rsquo;s game piece gets onto the field with the cat&rsquo;s symbol, the player will throw the dice and move the cat&rsquo;s game piece by the number of points shown on the dice.  See special cases that may occur during the cat&rsquo;s movement  in VI and VII. <br/>3. If the game piece gets into this field, the marble will fall into the hole and roll down to the other tier (level).  The player will move the mouse game piece to a new field, cover the marble with it again, and take two tokens from the bank and cover the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; on the cheese piece with them.  See special cases in IV and V. NOTE. The trap field will be inactive if all five holes on the cheese piece are closed with tokens. In this case the player will put the mouse game piece near the hole, so as prevent the marble from falling. <br/>4. On the upper tier the Players&rsquo; game pieces will be moving in a circle until one of them (or the cat game piece) stands precisely on the field with a red flag &mdash; the finish field. NOTE. For the smallest kids the game may be finished when the first player reaches or crosses the field with the flag. &bull; Then the players turn their cheese pieces upside down and count the points on the tokens. The one who gains most points will be the winner.  &bull; In the event of two players with equal number of points the one who has reached the finish or is closer to the same will win.<br/><br/>Developing game &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot; in the form of a dimensional pyramid develops fine motor skills, memory and attention. Gives an idea of ​​numbers and scoring. Trains accurate eye. Unique 3D form of the pyramid allows you to play not only in one-dimensional plane but in three-dimensional space.<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first to get your mouse to the top of the pyramid while avoiding the cat.<br/><br/>Each player controls a wooden mouse covering a marble. Players take turns rolling the die and moving their mouse. Some spots allow the marble to drop, requiring the player to move their mouse to that lower location. Other spots trigger the cat to move.<br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "勇士の楔 (Yuushi no Kusabi, &quot;Bonds of the Brave&quot;) is about heroes deciding which army to join. You want to be the strongest member of the winning army, but you'll have to find out what the other players are planning while hiding your own intentions.<br/><br/>At the start players are dealt three cards, and four cards are dealt to the middle, two face up and two face down. Each turn you take cards from the middle, put some from your hand back, and then add more cards to the middle from the deck. Once someone has ten points in one color they can announce victory for that team; everyone else gets one chance to announce victory for another color if they also have ten points, and then you move on to scoring. Declaring victory in a color is advantageous but might not be enough to overcome a sneaky player; whoever has the most points total over all victorious colors wins the round. This means that besides winning on the strength of your own hand, you can win by investing in multiple suits other people are stronger in.<br/><br/>The most subtle part of the game is the different kinds of cards. While some cards give a simple color bonus, those are the rarest. The next most common type can count for either of two colors during scoring, but don't count towards the 10 for declaring victory. Most cards are worth few points on their own, but worth more in pairs with specific cards - in particular, the purple color has no invidually strong cards, but is worth the most with the right pair. Each color has its own distribution, and keeping that in mind is key to victory.<br/><br/>Can you read the other players to figure out which color you should throw your lot in with?<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Harness Racing Game&quot; is quite literally that. The basic game has a lot in common with TOTO-ravi and Solvalla: for example, while the number of players is limited to 8 - with everyone driving 2 or 3 horses - any number of outside players can also participate in the totalisator betting. Just as in the other two games, the rules suggest a separate 'banker' player to handle the money and bets, presumably making the game feel more thematic.<br/><br/>In the actual gameplay Ravipeli is quite a bit more involved, though. The most striking difference is the innovative movement technique, where instead of simply rolling and moving players must first promise a certain number of movement points, then roll 2 or 3 dice; the more they promise the faster and farther they move, but the risk of galloping also grows ever greater. Gallops bring negative points and at certain moments in the race or if happening repeatedly, may even result in disqualification. There is also a multitude of small rules on how to drive a galloping horse, how to change  lanes voluntarily or involuntarily, how to drive in between and in front of other horses, etc., which imitate the real rules of harness racing (even including things like &quot;Shouting at the horse, getting heated up&quot;) and lead either to disqualification or a fine that is taken from the offending driver's monetary prize, if they manage to reach the finish line.<br/><br/>The rules are a bit vague in who actually wins and how so in that sense this game aims to be more of a harness racing simulator than a competitive game.<br/><br/>",

The following year, the set was made available in retail, with the playtest cards replaced with 121 foil reprints. The year after that, a new printing of the Convention Edition was distributed to affiliated local game stores to celebrate the return of in-store play after the lifting of pandemic restrictions.<br/><br/>Unlike most Magic expansions, Mystery Booster was only printed in English.

Players secretly select one of their card corners and the cards are held back to back with numbers showing through the holes.  The value of each card is determined by the lowest number showing through one of its holes; the highest-valued wins.  Ties use the next lowest number, etc.  This is the 'quick play' game.<br/><br/>The more complex game involves each player selecting five different cards (the two players could each use the same card, but no player may play with duplicates).  Players select cards secretly and compare them as in the quick play game.  The losing card is withdrawn (to be replaced by a new card in the next round) and the winner scores the value difference.  Quick plays continue until one player runs out of card or concedes and the winner is determined according to accumulated score.<br/><br/>Additional rules exist for using the cards as a convention-wide game in which players attempt to accumulate cards originally belonging to as many players as possible through trading and quick play victories.  (See the web site if you want to run this at a convention.)<br/><br/>The initial set of 20 Punch Cards uses artwork from Dave Dorman's Wasted Lands series.<br/><br/>",

Upon reading the inscription, a horned man in a tailcoat appeared. &quot;I will grant any wish you ask, but will take the soul of the bearer of the silver ring in compensation&quot;<br/><br/>You cleverly place the silver ring on a stone statue that has a soul that eternally replenishes itself. With this, you can have any wish granted without losing anything! Or so you thought...<br/><br/>Your goal as a player is to be just a bit greedy, to be happier than everyone else by getting the Devil to fulfill more of your wishes. He will grant any wish you have, and the statue will provide the soul in payment. But sometimes mischievous stuffed animals will steal the soul and the price will not have be paid.<br/><br/>Initially, the Devil will forgive you with just a warning, but if payments are late too often, horrible things will happen to the last player to make a wish. Sometimes you will need to be bold and other times you will need to be more modest, in order to have the most wishes granted, but not have made the last wish when the Devil's patience runs out.<br/><br/>Diletto: Secret of Eden is a card game for two to five players, in which you will take turns having a wish granted. The larger the wish, the more of your soul that must be given in compensation. Draw an appropriate number of cards from the ring deck, and if you draw an 'oops', place it in play. Once three 'oops' are accumulated, the wish fails and the players receive a warning. Players accumulate 'sense' during the course of the game, which can be used to reduce the risk of a wish by reducing how many ring cards to draw.<br/><br/>When the final warning appears, the Devil will take the soul of the next player to fail a wish, causing them to instantly lose and the game ends. The winner is the remaining player with the most wishes granted.<br/><br/>Diletto shares characters and story with Domina Games' previous game Eresia.<br/><br/>",

Players look at the grid and try and spot &quot;pairs&quot;.<br/><br/>Each card consists of a pattern of rectangles of different sizes laid on top of each other giving the effect of an outer, middle and inner rectangle. Each rectangle can be one of three colors red, blue or yellow.<br/><br/>In a &quot;pair&quot; ALL the rectangles on one card must beat the equivalent rectangles on its &quot;pair&quot;. There is a combat rule to show what beats what: RED beats YELLOW; YELLOW beats BLUE: and BLUE beats RED. This sounds confusing but there is a combat help card as a reference, very soon this will not be required.<br/><br/>Whenever someone spots a &quot;pair&quot; he shouts &quot;Gawp&quot; and takes the pair from the grid.

        "description": "The first product from M.E.K.Games, ARMORY is a non-collectible, medieval fantasy card game for 2-4 players. Each player needs a 60 card deck (identical to Opponent's) The objective is to arm your 3 Combatants with their weapons and thus be first to ATTACK card your Opponent to win. Cards are the 3 Combatants, Weapons and Mystics (spells and damage), Guardians and Attack cards.<br/><br/>After each player lays out his Combatants, a Player, during his turn, will have 1-3 cards to play from his hand of 7: lay out required weapons or trade-in's to seek cards he needs from his deck. He then announces he is open to attack and the Opponent will then try to strip off weapons or damage the player. When the attack is done, the next play is the Turn-Player and has 3 cards to play, etc. Defense from Opponent's attack is played from cards left in hand after the 1-3 turn-cards are played.<br/><br/>COMBATANT REQUIREMENTS: 2 Warriors each get a Shield, Helmet, Sword and Spear. 1 Archer gets a Helmet, Bow and Quiver.<br/><br/>The game is configured and sold for 2 Player action (optimal play). With 3-4 players, each Player, on his turn, will tactically decide who his Opponent will be for that turn. Other players, with special cards can occasionally butt in. 3 Player action can get pretty hot because of this. 4 Player action, does get a bit slow and though able for play, is not the optimal number of players. 2-3 Players is what turns this game on!<br/><br/>Streamlined to 11 Rules and 11 Card Tips makes this quick to learn.<br/><br/>Rules, FAQ, and the cards may all be seen at the game website <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mekgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.mekgames.com</a><br/><br/>",

On their turn, players decide if they want to engage in a face-off competition using their top card, or instead place that card into the Kids Next Door's tree house headquarters. Cards placed in the tree house help boost the power of cards that are played in future face-offs.<br/><br/>When cards are played in a face-off, the player with the higher number (which may get boosted by a card banked in the tree house) wins the round. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game, ensuring an entire game can be played in five minutes or less.<br/><br/>And what happens when each player plays a same-colored card? Both players race to be the first to slap a giant panic button placed on the playing mat to determine the round's winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game for ages 10 and up. The box contains a board, a wooden champagne bottle, 48 cards, 6 party characters and 20 chips.<br/><br/>The board shows 6 persons who are more or less undressed. In the middle of the board there is a tract on which the champaign bottle is moving. The tract contains 4 kinds of fields.<br/><br/>The cards are showing a number value of a special symbol. The party characters are the ones also showed on the board. But now they are dressed and each character is split in 4 parts.<br/><br/>Each player takes place in front of one of the characters on the board and gets the 4 pieces of his character. These pieces have to be put on the picture on the board.<br/><br/>Aim of the game is to stay dressed as long as possible.<br/><br/>Each players gets 3 cards from the shuffled stack, the rest of the cards are put aside the board.<br/><br/>On your turn you play one of your cards and you draw one new card from the stack. If a numbered card is played , the champaign bottle is moved accordingly on the tract. You get a chip when the bottle lands on a dark green field, you have to give a chip if the bottle lands on a red field. Landing on a light green field results in nothing.<br/><br/>On passing the start field with the bottle, a piece of clothing has to be removed from your character. This can only be prevented by playing one of the 4 special cards instead of a numbered card. When playing the R-card, you can leave the bottle where it is and the player on your right is on turn. If you play the card with a rectangle on it, the next player has to remove a piece of clothing from his character. Playing the card with a star on it brings you right to the start field and playing the card with a question mark on it causes your left neighbor to draw a card and play that card immediately.<br/><br/>The chips have a special meaning. Each player can only have max. 3 of those chips. When playing a card the use of a chip allows you to lower the number of fields you have to move by one.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of the characters is completely in his underwear. The winner is the character which is still most dressed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After centuries of fighting, man finally accomplished what he had attempted for centuries: the destruction of the world he lived on.  After the last and greatest war, some people survived underground.  But radiation had penetrated even there and they were forced from their new homes.  They rebuilt their great cities as floating platforms to carry them above the radiation belts that now encircled their planet.  Some launched themselves to safety before it was too late, but others were slow or miscalculated.  Their sky born heirs were mutated, some horribly beyond belief, others invisibly.  The centuries passed and the radioactivity began to fade away.  The sky cities began to look for ways downward to the planet.  But they found each other first, humans and non-humans, as allies or competitors.  Then started what man had left off: WAR.<br/><br/>You are the ruler of a sky-city.  Your objective is to capture or destroy your enemies, and find an opening in the radiation belts.  The action occurs in the upper atmosphere, about 55 to 75 miles off the surface of the Earth.<br/><br/>WAR OF THE SKY CITIES is an exciting two-player science fiction table top game, where players become rulers of complete cities in the sky.  Each side has small scout/research centers, medium battle cities, and/or large battle cities.  There are two objectives: capture or destroy your enemies and find an opening in the deadly radiation belts surrounding a future Earth.  In addition, optional rules introduce the use of small fighter craft and airborne landing parties.  WAR OF THE SKY CITIES is a game of tactical &quot;air&quot; combat, but instead of aircraft you command large floating cities with their own engines, armour and weapons.<br/><br/>The components include two pages of cardstock counters and a cardstock reference sheet (printed on one side).<br/><br/>Game Scale: Each inch represents 200 miles.<br/><br/>",

Crown points are earned by successfully attacking other knights and holding certain territories.<br/><br/>While described as a family game, there are some more serious aspects of the play that make this questionable. Knights must be trained before they can be brought into your army, and having access to on oasis is necessary to make this happen. This requires planning and a strategic eye toward how others are building their resources. There are different rules for attacks based on the relative location to the palace. Attacks are made using cards, and this is true when attacking other knights or trying to conquer the tower.<br/><br/>",

Accruing suppression points makes it harder for units to actually follow orders. The army size is bounded by a total points value that players agree on before the game starts.<br/><br/>",

If they land on a battle square, they draw a battle card and follow the instructions--most, if not all, cards call for one or more power tokens to be discarded.  Once a player has a set of all five tokens they may attempt to enter the central track to fight the Green Goblin.  This is accomplished by using a special piece of apparatus: the Battle Wall.  This consists of a 3-D office building with a spinner attached to the base.  The spinner is spun and a button in the center is pressed whenever the player wishes.  The button causes either Spider-Man or the Green Goblin to pop out of one side or the other of the building.  If Spider-Man comes out, the game is over and that player wins.  If the Green Goblin comes out, the player must make one more circuit of the board before they may try again.  Youngest player moves first, according to the rules, so perhaps there's a very slight German influence here?<br/><br/>",

Players (2-6) assume the role of carefree Hitchikers and set out on the road to make their fortune while trying to avoid trouble along the way.  Hitchikers don't have jobs so you'll have to find some more creative ways to make your money.<br/><br/>Each player begins with a HOMETOWN, $25,000 and a Bank envelope.  The object of the game is to be the first player to save $250,000 in your Bank or accumulate $50 million in traveling cash.  You can only deposit money in your bank by passing through or landing on your own HOMETOWN.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game (play method) will be familiar to anyone who has played a traditional board game like Monopoly except unlike most other games, you're never really out of it until someone actually wins.<br/><br/>Hitchikers travel by rolling two dice and following the highway clockwise around the board.  Each city or location along the road counts as one space.  Upon arrival at your new location, you will either be presented with an opportunity to earn huge sums of money or face a potential disaster like a Bad Ride or worse.<br/><br/>Although random luck (dice) will play a role during the game, there is also a need for strategic planning.  With two ways to win the game delivers an opportunity for everyone to have a chance.  If you tend to be cautious by nature, you can win by being conservative and saving money in your Bank.  On the other hand, if you like to gamble you will love the pursuit of monster payouts as you stack up your traveling cash.<br/><br/>Fast paced, high stakes action.<br/><br/>",

There is also a Power Scorecard sheet printed within this rules sheet, that needs to be enlarged and copied prior to gameplay. The Characters are also divided into HERO and VILLAIN Cards for simplicity's sake. Basically, you have 25-points for each Character, or object, and once these are exhausted, then that particular card is K.O.'d!<br/><br/>There was a means of obtaining a supplemental Power Scorecard, plus six Power Stones of various colors, as well as a checklist of the entire initial release-300 cards. These have a decidedly comic book look and feel in the components and gameplay, while being geared towards a generic approach for this so as not to impinge upon anyone's IP rights.<br/><br/>The game was really released twice with very different rules and many changes to the formatting of the cards.  The second release was based on input from Martin A. Stever.<br/><br/>",

Each player has an empty pole and six wooden beads in the colors red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple. On their turn the player throws a color die, and if they do not already have a bead of the color thrown then they place one on their pole. The winner is the first player to have collected a set of beads of all six colors. In a variant game, the beads are all placed in groups on the board, which shows a multi-colored worm. The beads must be placed on a player's pole in the same order in which they appear on the worm.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Rainbow Towers<br/><br/><br/>",

Features double sided board, double sided cards and auto-corrective tiles.<br/><br/>This edition of Scrabble Junior has a two-sided board, one for English words and one for Spanish words. The rules play similarly to other editions of Scrabble Junior. The goal is to lay down letter tiles one at a time to complete words pre-printed on the board. Letter tiles are played twice per turn, and must be used from the beginning of each word and sequentially toward the end. All tiles are face up once held by a player. Kids learn the strategy of maximizing point values for themselves while preventing points for other players. They also learn its okay if other players do earn points because of the rules that a letter must be played if a space is available to play it on. Players use all the tiles available to cover all of the spaces on the board.<br/><br/>",

To set up, fill the riverbed with water, place a sailboat on one end, and give each player their tikis, a straw, and a random card which shows either 6 or 8 gems. Place all gems in the bag and draw a random group of 6. The tikis have symbols on their bottoms meaning either take a gem from the display, take a gem from another player, or give a gem away. Players place one of their tikis on each of the islands.<br/><br/>On your turn, roll the die until you roll a symbol for an island on which you have a tiki (or water; pick an island). Then, sail the boat to that island by blowing through the straw into the sail. You are trying to stop exactly at the pier. Meanwhile, the other players are taking turns rolling the die; if they roll the same island, your turn ends immediately! If you reach your destination, take your tiki and follow its instructions. If you took a gem from the display, replace it randomly from the bag. If you collected all the gems on your card, reveal it and place the gems there; they may no longer be stolen from you! Then, draw a second card. If that was your 5th tiki, replace all the tiki onto the islands at the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>The first player to collect all gems on 2 cards wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What is LangGuini?<br/><br/>LangGuini is a multi player card game for 3 or more players. The game was designed during the 2010 Global Game Jam in Philadelphia, PA. last year's theme was &quot;Extinction&quot; so we decided that the English language has been deteriorating rapidly so we needed some new words. Being big fans of party games we wanted to make a social game, hence the three player minimum. After almost a year of play-testing and messing around with the mechanics we really want to print this game and get it out there.<br/><br/>What comes in the initial deck?<br/><br/>The deck comes with a box with instructions printed on the back. 108 cards in the deck. 12 cards are the decision cards (hopefully to be replaced by DICE) 94 cards that each have two word parts listed on either the yellow or orange side. The final 2 cards are our special thanks and stuff like that cards.<br/><br/>How do you play?<br/><br/>LangGuini is played by one player being selected as the first to deal/judge. The player selects from one of the 12 decision or &quot;dice cards&quot; (hopefully to be replaced by DICE if we get enough pledges) to find out how many word parts and what color(s) will be used. After selecting from that portion of the deck the dealer selects the word part cards and uses the parts to spell out a word of their own design. After laying out the cards the dealer pronounces the new word for the other players to hear. Then in clockwise fashion the players explain what they think is the definition of the word. After all players define the new word the dealer becomes judge and decides who wins that round. The winner keeps the cards that were used and then takes the role of dealer/judge until they pick a winner and so on. The player who wins XX (number of cards, we play to 15 usually, take a break and start again) WINS the game.<br/><br/>",

The centre spinner adds fun and excitement - you&rsquo;ll want to be the muddiest in class to win the game.<br/><br/>The game is for 2 to 4 players. There are some words on the game board &ndash; Start, Fiinsh and jump! -, but players do not have to be able to read to play. The game uses different coloured &lsquo;squares&rsquo; to move around the board, and the spinner uses images to indicate where the players move to next, so this game can be enjoyed by your young Peppa Pig fan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Emoji are not new to this earth...<br/><br/>They have lived in an unseen parallel dimension for thousands of years engaged in fierce battles to find their one, true ruler. Now you can join the fight.<br/><br/>In Emoji Wars, players choose a commander, form an army of allies and use magic and weapons to battle their opponents for dominance over the Emoji empire.<br/><br/>When a player's commander has been killed, that player is out of the game. The player with the last commander standing wins Emoji Wars and rules the Emoji Empire... until the next battle!<br/><br/>The general idea is easy - Players pick a Commander, choose 3 Allies and then battle their opponents with magic spells and weapons. The numbers on the cards line up so you can see if a character has the ability to wield a particular spell or weapon. You can also see how many &quot;Life Points&quot; a character has or how much damage he has taken from a weapon or spell.<br/><br/>1. Card Types<br/>Gold: Commander<br/>Green: Ally<br/>Blue: Spell<br/>Red: Weapon<br/>Yellow: Energy<br/><br/>2. Reading the Cards<br/>Each card has information about the character, spell or weapon in the numbers below the image. A character card shows life points, magic or strength ability and the energy needed to launch an attack. Weapons and spells cards show how much ability is needed to use them and how much damage they will do to a character by reducing his life points.<br/><br/>3. What a Hand Looks Like<br/>After a player has their &quot;Army&quot; assembled, they draw weapons and spells cards from the blue and red decks. Energy cards are included in these decks and get chosen randomly. A player's hand is visible to the rest of the table. Note that there are also &quot;Shield&quot; cards that add to a character's life points.<br/><br/>4. Attacks<br/>On each turn a player can attack his opponents if they have the weapons and engergy needed to do so. As an example attack, Orin is using the Deep Freeze against Garlon. The spell card is placed under Orin to show that his life points have reduced by 30. On a later turn, the player draws a Shield, which he adds to Garlon to increase his life points to 30. This is how much damage it will now take to remove him from the game.<br/><br/>5. Win<br/>When a player's Allies have been killed off, he fights with his Commander. If his Commander is killed he is out of the game. The last player with a standing Commander wins Emoji Wars.<br/><br/>",

It is possible to grow wheat, potatoes, sugar beets and strawberries. Players buy seeds, sow and harvest them and sell the crop paying also taxes. The most successful farmer in terms of capital wins.<br/><br/>A round of the square game board represents one year, each side roughly representing one season: in winter players decide which seeds to buy and to what extent, in spring the seeds are sown, in summer (and partly autumn) it is the harvest time.<br/><br/>Advancing on the board happens by rolling a die. Each square represents one week and has special instructions on it: paying random expenses, drawing a surprise card, getting income out of the forest etc.<br/><br/>The harvest times of different plants are sequential and differ in length. The die roll the player lands on one of the harvest squares of certain plant also determines the hectare price of that crop (lookup table used). It is possible to miss the harvest season of any plant resulting in a crop failure for which the state pays a small compensation.<br/><br/>Harvesting machinery may be bought to increase the crop price and a tractor decreases the sowing expenses. More land can be rented or bought as well. At the end of the year the taxes are paid, the accounts balanced and a new year may begin.<br/><br/>The game includes two sets of rules: in the simplified set e.g. everyone grows one hectare of each plant, there is no machinery or, obviously, no option to rent or buy more land.<br/><br/>",

The card you draw will tell you to place the card on another player somewhere on their body and it may tell you to touch them with a head, hand, or foot. If you're given a card you must keep it in place and not let it fall even while you're placing cards on other people.

        "description": "A fun and simple family board game. Each player gets two secret missions to transport goods. These missions correspond to two specific spaceships on the board. The goals are achieved by wisely using the set of actions available.<br/><br/>In his turn, a player plays one of his Action card and does the action described on the card. These actions consist of moving one or more spaces on the board, closer to planet (Card+), further from planet (cards-) or by switching two spaces(Switch cards).<br/><br/>A round can end either when a spaceship reaches the planet or when all players have played all their Action cards.<br/><br/>Each player then reveals his two Mission cards and scores the number of points corresponding to the spaceships on each of his Mission cards.<br/><br/>This reimplemtation of J'ai mon voyage introduces two variants to the game: family and advanced. Family variant does not use more complicated &ldquo;Swap&rdquo;, &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reverse&rdquo; cards. Advanced variant allows players to use special abilities of the planets and limits their hands at the beginning of the mission, to make game more challenging.<br/><br/>",

Beginners will have instant fun; accomplished players will be endlessly challenged.<br/><br/>The game's collapsible board consists of five layers connected in a flexible stack, which requires nothing to set up or put together.  The result is a unique three-dimensional gaming experience that can begin the instant the game's box is opened.<br/><br/>Pentagonal can be played individually or in teams.  Marbles can be added and rules can be customized to add challenge to the game.<br/><br/>Essentially a Tic Tac Toe game in 5 x 5 x 5<br/><br/>",

Each of four ropes has its own matching colored section from which it must not leave. The fifth rope may move forward and backward all around the board.<br/><br/>In turn, each player will activate the spinner and move any number of ropes any combination of whatever number was spun. A player&rsquo;s explorer (pawn) can only move via rope. An explorer can jump on a rope that is on its space. One of the spaces on the spinner activates the Mad Monkey pawn. Mad Monkey can knock explorers off if they share the same rope.<br/><br/>The first player to lap the game board, therefore reaching Jungle Girl, wins the game.<br/><br/>Based on the famous arcade game from Taito.<br/><br/>",

The batsman releases a trigger to strike at the ball. Scoring depends on how far the ball ends up from the nearest fielder.

Cards are drawn from a stack featuring images of Wacky Races cars. Players must collect four car cards and land exactly on the finish line to win (which means that you usually complete several circuits of the track). Car cards can be lost if players draw the Mean Machine card.

Players seek to keep the tower stable after adding a piece while creating ever more difficult challenges for the next player to do the same.<br/><br/>The basic set contains 1 base (starting) piece, 24 additional wooden pieces and a rules sheet in a convenient carrying case.<br/><br/>Stacket! shares a number of mechanics with other block-stacking games such as Bausack, Animal Upon Animal, Blockhead! and Jenga.  It is distinct from these other games insofar as each piece placement much touch the previous piece and there is no piece duplication in the common pool.  As a result, Stacket! forces players to interact directly on the structure itself and it allows players to use position as well as orientation and weight as a constrain on their opponent's future choices.  The dynamics of gameplay which arise from these unique features make it likely that Stacket! will appeal to an audience that is slightly more aggressive and directly competitive. But like each of the other games in the genre, it appeals to any audience that enjoys creative challenges balancing blocks with a degree of strategy.<br/><br/>Optional rules for Stacket! allow players to score points based upon how many existing pieces a new pieces touches when it is placed.  Stacket! also has a rules variant for multi-set competition.<br/><br/>",

If you have more swords than your foe has shields, you win and cause wounds.

At the beginning of the round, each player antes 1 pepper marker.<br/><br/>The start player will place a token face down and claim it is higher than X. Players can challenge or the next player may place one of their tokens face down saying it is higher than X (what the previous person claimed).<br/><br/>Instead of placing a token, you may challenge someone and place 2 of your pepper markers in the pot or you may challenge out of turn by placing 3 peppers. Reveal the card, if the player was lying the challenger receives all the peppers. if they were telling the truth, that player received the peppers. Players then redraw back to 4 tokens.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player is out of peppers and whoever has the most peppers at that time wins.<br/><br/>",

Includes 57 play cards, 1 die, 2 basic rules &amp; sample sheets and instructions for 4 games - Progressive TooT!, TooT! Pursuit, Fluke TooT! &amp; Speed TooT! From Missing Piece Press.<br/><br/>In the introductory Progressive TooT! game, players are first dealt 4 cards.  Cards are arranged to play a SINGLE TooT! that uses the most cards.  Any remaining cards are pointed AGAINST the player.<br/><br/>The rounds PROGRESS with 5 cards, then 6, then 7 etc., up to 10.  The player with the lowest score wins!<br/><br/>In TooT! Pursuit, players take ONE card for their turn and see if they can use it and any other cards that they have accumulated, to make and leave ONE TooT! that all players must add to.  If they are able to make a leave a TooT!, regardless of how many cards they used - they earn a point.  Most points when cards are gone- WINS!<br/><br/>In Fluke TooT! players roll the die, take THAT number of cards and try to play cards into a SINGLE TooT! that all players add to.  The player with the fewest remaining cards when all cards have been played - wins!<br/><br/>IN Speed TooT!, players draw 7 cards.  Get set - GO!  First to use ALL cards in a single TooT! wins.

Players simultaneously try to get their teammates to correctly guess more correct phrases than their opponents, but the electronic interrupter unit's hand randomly determines when it's your turn to speak out and when it's not! One player from each team sits in front of the unit and tries to say different phrases while wearing a speech-inhibiting mouthpiece that keeps their lips open. Their teammates try to guess what they&rsquo;ve said when the hand is flipped down in front of them, indicating that it&rsquo;s their turn to talk. The phrases on the cards utilize specific letter combinations that are hard to say without the ability to close their mouth. Cards are collected for correctly guessed phrases. The two players switch so that their partner gets turns saying phrases. After two rounds, the team at the end with the most cards, wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Start in the ER and stand in the queue for hours to finally get an appointment with a gastrologist to treat your pinworms or psychologist to help with your egocentrism. Go to work, get more money and let your health deteriorate or get a prescription and heal yourself to win!<br/><br/>The game starts with pawn racing to the ER. Players draw cards and count the number of plaster icons on all of them to move forward and avoid losing points at the end of the game. To visit a doctor, bids are secretly made by choosing cards with the earliest appointment times and modifying them with time tokens. Then, patients in individual queues fight with each other to get to the doctor's by dexterity tests. Manage to be the first one in the queue and visit all the doctors you need to before you lose all your health points and win the game as the only one standing!<br/><br/>",

You might move ahead on the big cheese scoreboard or you might move back if the trap goes swack.<br/><br/>On a player's turn he or she can take up to 3 pieces of cheese from the pan. The player must take at least 1 piece of cheese from the pan. A player gains 3 points for each large piece of cheese and 1 point for each small piece of cheese taken. If the trap springs, the player springing the trap loses 10 points.<br/>Players take turns removing cheese until someone springs the trap- then all of the cheese taken is replaced and the trap is reset.<br/>When a player reaches the end of the scoring track- the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, roll the die and move the playing piece that number of spaces in either direction. Your goal is to reach the picture of the fish that matches one of the cards you have turned up in front of you. When you do this, put the card you&rsquo;ve matched in the middle of the game board and then turn up another card from you pile. If you roll the rainbow fish on your turn, you get to move to one of the pictures on the game board that matches one of your cards, and you get to choose another player to do the same. Look out for the shark, because if he turns up on the die, you lose your turn. The first player to get rid of all of their cards wins!<br/><br/>Ages 5 and up<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An interactive children's memory game.  Taking turns each player tries to find a matching 'Crazy Creature' which matches the Hide and Seek card.  If a player successfully finds a match they can move 'IT' one space closer to their opponents Gotcha circle.  When 'IT' reaches either players Gotcha circle the other player is the winner.<br/><br/>This game simulates a game of hide and seek and allows the players to interact with each other using phrases like 'You're it' and 'Gotcha'.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Find the hidden creatures to win this easy to play memory game.<br/>For 2 players aged 4 years upwards<br/><br/>A game for 2 players aged 4 onwards.<br/>OBJECT:<br/>To keep out of the CAUGHT YOU space by selecting the correct hiding Crazy Creature.<br/><br/>PREPARATION:<br/>1. Place the playing strip on the table with the yellow CAUGHT YOU space in front of one player sitting one side of the table and the blue CAUGHT YOU space in front of the other, sitting opposite.<br/>2. Attach MR. IT to his stand and place him on the start facing the yellow end of the playing strip.<br/>3. The player at the yellow and of the playing strip takes the eight HIDING PLACE cards with the yellow sky and places them lace (CRAZY CREATURE SIDE) down spread out in a straight line in front of him. The player at the blue and does the same with the blue cards.<br/>4. The Crazy Creature cards are shuffled and stacked face down on the table between the two rows of HIDING PLACE cards.<br/>5. The top Crazy Creature card is turned over, showing the players which creature they are looking for, and the game i.e. ready to begin.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>The player on the yellow side of the playing strip starts by reaching over and turning one of his opponent's HIDING PLACE cards over to find the Crazy Creature of the same colour as on the card in the centre. If the creature on the HIDING PLACE card does not match he turns the &quot;HIDING PLACE&quot; card back over and his turn ends. The player on the blue side now turns one of his opponent&rsquo;: HIDING PLACE cards to find the same Crazy Creature.<br/>When a player turns a HIDING PLACE card and finds the matching Crazy Creature, he yells YOU'RE IT and turns MR. IT to face his opponent and moves MR. lT one step towards his opponent's CAUGHT YOU space. The hiding place card is left face up. He then turns over a new Crazy Creature card in the centre and goes again, looking for the next Crazy Creature.<br/>If all 8 Crazy Creature cards in the centre have been turned over before MR. IT gets to a CAUGHT YOU space, the Crazy Creature cards are re-shuffled and placed face down between the players. The players then turn all hiding place cards Crazy Creature side down and rearrange them. The last player to find the hiding Crazy Creature continues the play and turns over the top Crazy Creature card in the centre.<br/><br/>When a player moves MR. IT into his opponent's CAUGHT YOU space, he wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your challenge in the Jolly Octopus mitbringspiel is the same as in the larger board game (namely Jolly Octopus): Don't tickle Jolly O, or else you're looking at a world of hurt. But while the board game uses a motorized octopus with sensitive anti-touch gizmos, the travel game uses only the eyes of the other players, who must watch for octopus movement in order to detect your crime.<br/><br/>Your goal in the game is to move your two crabs clockwise around Jolly O in order to reach the starfish at the goal line. Why not go counter-clockwise and travel only one space instead of seven? Because you have the brain of a crab and cannot reason that well.<br/><br/>To set up the game, you assemble the octopus, which has alternating high and low legs, place all the crabs to the right of the bandaged leg (when looking from above), place the starfish to the left of this leg, and place the shark opposite the crabs.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the two dice. If both dice show numbers, you can move one of your crabs ahead the sum of the two numbers or you can move each crab forward equal to the number on one die. To move, you must push the crabs gently under the arms of the octopus, not disturbing Jolly O in any way. If the other players do spot movement, then you return the crab to its starting location and lose the movement points for that action. If one of the dice shows a shark fin, you move one crab forward equal to the number on the other die, then move the shark clockwise that same number of spaces. If the shark lands in a space with a lone crab, that crab is moved backwards two spaces.<br/><br/>The first player to move both of her crabs to the starfish wins!<br/><br/>Reimplements Jolly Octopus<br/><br/>",

Only 1000 copies were printed.<br/><br/>It is a small strategic boardgame for two players that can be best described as a combination of Chess and Memory with a 16th century feudal Japan theme added to the mix.<br/>The story is that two Daimyos are discussing a battle they once fought, during a tea ceremony (the discussion, not the battle). The problem is that both Daimyos don't have very good memories. They try to remember how the battle developed and who won eventually.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the basic mechanics of the game are a combination of Chess and Memory. Finding combinations of identical cards on the board results in new units, which act as chess pieces. Hence, good memory and some tactical insight may be of good use in playing this game.<br/><br/>",

Box art shows a Pan-Am jet flying across Sydney Harbour with the landmark Sydney Opera House conspicuously absent (it was yet to be constructed).<br/><br/>The game consists of a map of the world with selected major destinations connected by plane (presumably Pan-Am) routes.  Players are dealt a series of destination cards at the start of the game; all destinations must be visited before returning to the start (Sydney).<br/><br/>Game components are of low grade but acceptable quality - 4 generic pawns for movers, a thin cardboard gameboard that folds in three and thin cardboard destination cards.<br/><br/>The destination cards are mildly educational (each have stats about population, currency, languages spoken etc.) although now very dated.<br/><br/>",

After a number of studies, it was revealed that corruption in government and the lack of unity among the government leaders caused the crash. As a result, a group of world leaders are now pushing for a single, worldwide government. Monolith Global Inc, an expert in cybernetics, has suggested that the government be run by robots, claiming that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible for a robot to become corrupt, and as a result, they will always make the best decisions for the fate of mankind.&rdquo;<br/><br/>However, a small number of people see this for what it really is &ndash; an attempt to enslave mankind. Known as the Hackers Guild, these ragtag freedom fighters are branded as criminals and are living as fugitives from the law. All reasonable attempts to convince the powers that be that they are making a huge mistake have failed. The only option remaining appears to be the destruction of the program from the inside out. There is only one problem: hacking the company&rsquo;s network is said to be impossible. Despite this, more and more of the common people are joining in the cause.<br/><br/>Time is running out for the guild as they strive to perform the impossible: hacking Monolith Global Inc and saving humanity from slavery.<br/><br/>The Hackers Guild is a cooperative game for 2-4 players ages 14 and up that plays in about 90 minutes. In the game, players take on the role of members of The Hackers Guild and are trying to work together to complete the final hack against Monolith Global`s data center.<br/><br/>Along the way, players will be able to add additional dice to their dice pool, acquire hacking tools, and other powerups that will make completing their objective a lot easier.<br/><br/>Opposing the hackers is the Network Administrator AI whose sole objective is to delay the hackers long enough for the machines to take power and enslave humankind.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Treasures of Ali  Baba<br/><br/>extrapolated from a review done by Kevin Whitmore<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player starts with a pawn in the bottom corner of the board. At the opposite corner of the board is the entrance to the cave. Every turn each player rolls a D6 to move. Players must move their pawns in a clockwise direction along the edge of the board upon a narrow track. At the left-hand corner is a space marked &ldquo;W&uuml;ste&rdquo; (Desert). Each pawn must stop there. To leave the desert a player must roll an odd number. Upon reaching the far corner players must pause on the corner before opening the mountain.<br/><br/>The heart of the game happens within the cave. The cave is large, dominating the game mat. Up to 40 square cards can be placed face down, one per space, within the cave. This number will be reduced if the optional obstacles and tea light are used. The cards show the same back, depicting a vase. When a pawn ends its move on a vase the active player may inspect it, and claim the treasure shown. In addition, the player rolls a die to see if they break the vase. If not, they replace the treasure card with a blank card showing the same vase on the back. In this way the game board becomes depleted of treasures and filled up with worthless empty vases, or voids where vases were broken.<br/><br/>Complicating the player&rsquo;s lives is the band of 40 thieves. Really it is just the black pawn, but he travels the board seeking to prevent the players from absconding with the treasures. Combat slightly favors the black pawn, encouraging all the players to give him a wide berth.<br/><br/>As players collect more treasures, they become encumbered, and forfeit movement points as their load increases. This allows the black pawn to possibly catch a player&rsquo;s pawn. However, some of the treasure cards are empty backpacks and sacks, allowing a pawn to carry more treasure before becoming encumbered. Further, the black pawn is slow, rolling a special die with a top value of four.<br/><br/>Once a pawn has escaped from the cave, he must continue clockwise upon the track along the edge of the board. At the right-hand corner is a space marked BAGHDAD. Each pawn must stop in Baghdad, and may only leave on the roll of an even number. Should the pawn fail to leave, one of its hard-earned treasures will be lost. Staying in Baghdad is expensive! Eventually the pawn will escape Baghdad, and travel back to the starting corner.<br/><br/>To win the game the player must have more treasures than any other player, and they must also have more treasures than what remains within the cave.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Warner Bros. website:<br/>&quot;Dicers is a collectible dice game with two levels of play. Knock your opponents dice out of play in the basic game, or develop unique combinations to expel dicers to the dungeon in the advanced game. For ages 5 years and over.&quot;<br/><br/>The dicers game is played with collectible dice. These have 5 clear sides, with a figure representing the character inside of the dice. The sixth side is solid, and shows the name of the die, its &quot;casting number&quot;, its special ability, and its affiliations. The clear sides are numbered from 1 to 5, while the solid face is the '6'. Each die represents a character or item from the Harry Potter stories.<br/><br/>The starter set includes 6 dice; Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Hagrid, and the Sorting Hat. It also includes a sheet of rules.<br/>The rules actually have 3 levels of play described in them. The basic game only uses the casting numbers on the dice. The Intermediate game adds in the abilities of the dice, and different areas of play, and the advanced game adds in the affiliations of the dice, and reserve abilities.<br/><br/>In the basic game, players set out the six dice and each take turns picking one to determine which dice they will use. Players then roll to see who goes first (the &quot;Challenger&quot;).<br/>The challenger picks one die, and then the defender picks on of their dice.<br/>The challenger may roll the die a number of times up to its Casting number, looking for as high a roll as possible. Only the last roll made counts, even if it is lower than a previous roll.<br/>The defender does the same with his or her die.<br/>The lower roll is expelled (removed from play) and the winner becomes the new challenger. This is repeated until only one player has dice left.<br/><br/>In the Intermediate game, there are three areas of play. All dice begin in the Field. A losing die is placed in the dungeon, where it cannot be used. A winning die is placed in the Keep. Dice in the keep cannot be used until a player has no dice left in the field, at which point all of the dice in that player's Keep are moved into the Field. The winning die can choose to either expel the losing die to the dungeon, or to just place it in the Keep and activate the special ability of the winning die. One side of the rules lists the different special abilities. A few examples include:<br/>Capture, which lets you take the enemy die and use its special powers as well as your own.<br/>Summon, which lets you retrieve a die that has been placed in the dungeon.<br/>Swap, which lets you trade the locations of two of a player's dice.<br/>The game ends when one player's dice are all in the dungeon or captured.<br/><br/>In the Advanced game, you can use the affiliations on the dice. The affiliations include the four houses, creatures, and wizards. For every die with the same affiliation as your chosen die in your Field, your die gains +1 to its casting number. This level of the game also adds reserve abilities. These are special powers that, when activated, have no immediate effect but allow the die to be set aside in 'Reserve' and activated later.<br/><br/>Extra dice are sold as single dice. The die you are buying is clearly displayed on the outside of the packaging.<br/><br/>The packaging stated that there were &quot;54 characters to collect&quot; but only 36 were released.<br/><br/>There were two 'Starter Packs' with 6 dice each and 24 individual dicers.<br/><br/>",

The trees have holes in them, through which you can see through the board. Below the board, a rotating disk shows goblins with different items so their faces appear in some of the trees. Players move toward the trees; if they reach one with a goblin, they say a short verse and claim the treasure item. Afterward, the disk is rotated so the goblins appear in different trees.

Each card shows a color illustration or detail from paintings by VanGogh, Gaugin, Cezanne, Seurat, and Toulouse-Lautrec. The cards come with rules for &quot;Go Fish for Art&quot; and &quot;Masterpiece Memory.&quot; In &quot;Go Fish for Art,&quot; each player tries to collect sets of six cards by the same artist. In &quot;Masterpiece Memory&quot; the cards are spread out face down. Each player flips three cards. If the three cards are by the same artist, then the player collects the cards. The cards are also color coded by artist to aid in set collection.<br/><br/>The game also comes with an art book that describes the period, a time line, biographies, and some information about each painting in the deck.<br/><br/>Renaissance Art Game and Impressionist Art Game have the same mechanics as this game, but with different art work on the cards.<br/><br/>",

On their turn, the players roll the die and move their monkey along the riverside. If the monkey ends up on an empty stone, the player may start building a bridge from that stone towards the other side of the river by placing a bridge tile. If there is a bridge already, the player may extend that bridge by adding a bridge tile. A third tile completes the bridge, and monkeys may now cross the river to the other side. Each bridge tile equals one step, so you need at least a four on the die to cross on one single turn. If a monkey ends up on the same bridge tile as another monkey, the latter is moved off the bridge. When a monkey reaches the other side of the river the owning player collects one banana, and the bridge that was used to cross the river is destroyed. The first player to cross the river three times, thereby collecting three bananas, is the winner.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>1 board<br/>4 plastic monkeys<br/>14 bridge tiles<br/>1 die<br/>9 banana tokens<br/><br/>Rules are in Swedish but components are language independent.

        "description": "An exciting game of Travel &amp; Trivia using a factual world map as your playing board.  Players start with airline itineraries &amp; travelers checks and need to be the first player to visit all the cities on their itinerary, collecting the appropriate visa, and return to their country of origin all the while managing their money, navigating detours &amp; diversions.  The first player to collect 10 visas and return to their country of origin is declared the winner.  PLAY:  Players must announce their intended destination before the role of the die which will determine the amount of the fare.   The die role will determine the destination and the cost by displaying full/half or free fares.  If a player rolls divert, transit, geography or general knowledge then they must take the appropriate card from the board and their travel is suspended or diverted depending on the instructions of the card.  Many times players may answer trivia questions about their particular region to allow their flight to continue to their previously stated destination, however, a wrong answer usually keeps the player grounded or relocates them to an undesirable location.   Money is collected by opting not to fly and answering trivia questions or a combination of both.  The Australian game designer recommends this game for ages 12+.<br/><br/>",

It is part of the first wave of cooperative games that hit europe(an kids) in the late seventies and arguably among the most intense experiences, because it features real experiences most kids have.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to finish a sandcastle before it is destroyed by the rising tide. As with most of these games directed at players around the age of 5, decisions do not change the outcome of the game too much, it comes down to the luck of the dice.<br/>Depending on the colours you roll on the 2 dice, you either add waves, parts of the sandcastle or help other players out. The feeling of being 'in this together' is very present.<br/><br/>Distribution in the Benelux was done by Jumbo, the game appeared there under the same name.<br/><br/>",

The questions are of three different difficulty levels and in the beginning you're answering easy questions and in the end the really hard ones. During the game you can once skip answering a question, once delete a wrong answer choice and once ask for a clue. The board has two sides: On one side the winner is the player who has given most correct answers, on the other side the winner is decided by points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gotcha is a board game created in the 1980's by a division of a jewelery company (Roset by Reid) based in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to create rows of 5 chips in your color across a board divided up into rows of colored and numbered squares.  On his turn, the player will play one of 5 cards from his hand of cards, each of which have a number and a color on them.  The information on this card indicates a limited set of squares on the board matching the color and number on which a chip can be placed.  There are also 2 special kinds of cards: Wild cards which allow a chip to be placed anywhere, and Gotcha cards which can be used to remove an opponent's chip from the board.<br/><br/>A round is over once a player has created 2 rows of 5 chips.  Each row of 5 garners 50 points.  Several rounds are played until one player reaches 500 points and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>This game can also be played in 2 or 3 teams of 2 players each.<br/><br/>",

Each player disc has an offence and a defence rating. There are two rounds called shifts. The player mat has spots for 14 NHL player discs. The mat is broken in two by a centerline and each side of this line has 3 forward 2 defence a goalie and shootout spot where your discs are to be placed face down. Gamers take turns deciding whether they will be on offence or defence.  They then pick a face down disc and the game becomes a game of war where players simultaneously flip over a player discs and compare offence and defence ratings. The higher of the two ratings scores a goal. You go through 6 turns in 2 shifts keeping track of goals (a tie in ratings equals no goal) if after two rounds the score is still tied you go to the shoot-out player and the game is decided by a tie breaker...<br/> Every NHL team is represented and special foil game cards featuring hockey&rsquo;s top stars will are included. A starter box includes random game cards and play-mat, and enough cards for one player to ice a team. Additional booster packs of 6 cards can be purchased to add different players to your bench&hellip;<br/><br/>",

But really, inside the pack, the cards are battling it out to see who will be the Ruler of<br/>Decktonia! Will it be the Blacks or the Reds? Each night the wars rage on, and the kingdoms change from one to the other. Who will it be this time?&quot;<br/><br/>A simple card game where players use a regular deck of playing cards to see who can have the largest standing army by the end of the game. Each turn the player can lay a card to build his or her army, and use a royalty card that has various effects such as taking away an opponent's army, drawing cards, or protecting one of their own armies from the enemy.<br/><br/>Perfect as a filler between larger games, or fun on its own - this game is easy to learn, and since it uses just a regular pack of playing cards, can be played anywhere.<br/><br/>",

Each card holder is then placed window-side up on the game board, in the matching-color rectangle. Each player selects a token, places it on the 'Start' space on the game board, and rolls the dice to determine who plays first (highest roller, play continues clockwise).<br/><br/>Ona player's turn, that player rolls the dice and moves his token that number of spaces in any direction (backtracking in the same turn is not allowed). If the player lands on a colored, lettered space, the player must open the corresponding window (by letter) on the corresponding card holder (by color). If a player lands on one of the four outside corner spaces, <b>all</b> the windows on the corresponding card holder (by color) may be opened. When a player lands on a pink &quot;Face ID&quot; space, the player selects <b>any</b> card holder and opens all unopened windows. When landing on a pink space marked FAID, the player selects any holder and opens the F, A, I, and D windows.<br/><br/>During his turn, after opening any windows allowed, a player may try to identify the person on the card in the card holder that corresponds (by color) to the space his token is on. To identify the person, the player must state the name of the person on the card--<b>not</b> the name of any character the person has played. (Example: &quot;Bob Keeshan&quot; would be correct, but not &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.)<br/><br/>All players determine whether the player is correct. If there is a dispute, the Master List is consulted by revealing the identification number at the bottom of the card. The player making the identification consults the list in secret. If he is correct, the card is removed from the holder and rewarded to the player, who closes the windows and places another card in the holder. That player rolls the dice and moves again.<br/><br/>If the player is incorrect, he places the card holder back on the board (leaving the windows open or closed, as they were). He does not reveal the correct identity of the person on the card, but he may not (of course) make another guess on the same card.<br/><br/>An incorrect guess, or no guess, ends a player's turn.<br/><br/>After a player has collected two cards of each color, he must land on a FACE ID space to attempt a Final Face Identification. When he lands on a FACE ID space, the player must attempt to identify the face in the corresponding (by color) card holder. The player consults the back of his collected face cards, which contain assorted letters. Those letters determine which if any of the unopened windows on the card holder he may open before attempting to identify the person.<br/><br/>If the player is incorrect on the Final Face Identification, his turn is over and play resumes as normal. On that player's turn, he must attempt again to land on another FACE ID space to make another Final Face Identification.<br/><br/>If the player is correct on the Final Face Identification, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to tie down the sleeping Gulliver while gaining as few points as possible. Players take turns taking one of the Lilliputian figures, each of which has either a number from 0 to 5 or a rope symbol on its base (not visible when players choose which figure to take). The active player announces the figure's value and decides if they want to put it on their own family card or return it. If a rope symbol is drawn, the player must exchange two of their family members (they may choose to exchange for a member of a different family clan), announce the new values and tie Gulliver down on one arm or leg. A Lilliputian with a rope symbol is worth ten points.<br/>The game ends when Gulliver has been tied down in all four places. The player whose family clan has the lowest total value (all family members added together) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The result of the mixture of technology and magic is the Cataclysm, an event that tore holes in the fabric of time and space. Five heroes have been pulled together on Laris, where they embark on a journey to mend both worlds.<br/><br/>Consequential is a co-operative board game that lets players live the tale of this adventure.  Over the course of four acts, the story will be told.  The base game box contains the board, and all the cards for Act I.  Acts II, III, and IV are packaged and sold separately. They contain additional cards, new locations, and new mechanics!<br/><br/>The unique aspect of this game is that it is not solely a tabletop experience.  A free companion app for your iOS/Android device or laptop is required for play. It will display voice-acted events that are triggered by actions in the physical game, and tell more of the story.  The app also is responsible for keeping the timer for the real-time portion of each episode.  One episode of Consequential contains a turn-based phase (about 45 minutes) and a real-time phase (about 10 minutes) to conclude the session.  The real-time phase can be played without a timer, if players prefer.<br/><br/>",

Point values are printed directly on the cards for easy scoring.<br/><br/>To score the most points by creating Melds, Canastas  and earning bonuses.

Players only get 1 Action card to figure out hidden information but they may ask as many questions as they like; it's up to the other players to be truthful or to outright lie. Players must vote to decide and majority rules!

        "description": "Boardgame for 2 &ndash; 4 children (Ages 6 to 10) in which they have to manage their pocket money. Thematically based on a fun-fair visit during the holidays the players have to spend their money on various items. But with their limited amount of money they can't afford everything they want - they have to earn some money. Only if they are able to manage their pocket money successfully will they win the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The players start with a given amount of pocket money and move across the board rolling one dice (d6). Movement is allowed in any direction and players may move less spaces than their dice roll. On special card fields they are able to fulfill six actions (spending money on several items and earning money to afford them) which are needed to win the game. The placement of the action cards is strictly ruled - making following-up cards harder to buy things (prices will rise) and harder to earn money (earnings will decrease). After each players' turn the turn marker is moved one day further. When the 7th turn ends (= one week) all players receive a new amount of pocket money.<br/><br/>The first player who has fulfilled all his actions, wins. If there is a tie, the player with most of the cash wins.<br/><br/>",

Each card shows an illustration of a Shakespearean death (illustrated by Chris Riddell) and a number of categories: Speed of Death, Gore &amp; Brutality, Fairness, Piteousness, Dramatic Quality and Last Words. Each category is accompanied by a value from one to ten.<br/><br/>Two to five players are dealt all the cards and hold their hand with only one card visible on top of their deck. The game is played in rounds. The current first player chooses a category. The round winner is the holder of the card that shows the highest value for the chosen category on all the currently visible cards. The round winner adds all the visible cards to their hand and everyone turns over a new card. The winner of the round then chooses the next category. The winner of the game is the first player to hold all of the cards.<br/><br/>",

The experimental shroom collectors evaluate useful shrooms by tasting them. However, tasting the wrong shrooms could lead you to hospital at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game play is mostly memory driven but very challenging. During the game, players exchange the location of known shrooms with other players for their info on known shrooms while trying to memorize the current locations of the shrooms they are tracking. As soon as a player thinks he knows where to find a good set of shrooms, he starts to collect and taste them. Successful tasting makes the collector feel better (positive points), but tasting unknown shroom causes damage (negative points). If the player has less than zero points at the end of the game, he is considered to be sick.<br/><br/>",

An &quot;indicator&quot; (spinner?) is used to generate numbers from one to six for movement purposes. The goal is to be the first player to move to the North Pole spot and back to start.

Cards are played face-up during your turn in an area called your caucus.  Here all candidates can see your vote tallies.  It is possible to split votes or use special cards to effect the number of votes in your opponents caucus.<br/><br/>The endgame begins when a candidate plays the &quot;Polls Open&quot; card.  Now the game will end when ANY player plays the &quot;Polls Closed.&quot;<br/><br/>It should be noted that Election Day is a parody game.  And the humor concerning the special interest groups can be very sharp.  Jabs are taken at Big Business and the Tobacco Industry.  The recount card comes with a tourism logo for the state of Florida.<br/><br/>Election Day was designed by Ed Evans for Alien Menace Games for 2-4 players Ages 13 and up.<br/><br/>",

You do this by trading your Ford up to a Rolls, Mercedes or Cadillac, by dining at the &quot;right&quot; places and, of course, by spending extravagantly.

When you reach the Gold Streets, you get to patronize various establishments, where you spend money and spin the Status Wheel (which directs you to instruction booklets).<br/><br/>The box is lined with a fake velvet which leaves tiny short hairs everywhere.

The wooden Willi figure is stacked on 13 wood tiles and placed on one of the letter chips at random.<br/><br/>In a round, players start by revealing the category under the chip lying to the right of Willi. Then one player rolls a die and everyone must count left from Willi to find the chip lying this many spaces away, after which the players must race to yell out something starting with that letter that matches the revealed category. The first player to do so receives one of the wood tiles on Willi if her answer is correct; otherwise she must return one tile to Willi.<br/><br/>To continue play, move Willi to the chosen letter tile, then start a new round. The first player to collect four wood tiles wins!<br/><br/>",

Evil spreads everywhere, twisting and mixing the tales in sinister stories where the ending is never good. Horrific villains have come back for their revenge on the heroes of the tales, this time more dangerous than ever. The source of this magic is unknown, yet whispers of an ancient evil spread through the lands. The once green fields and lush forests are now dark and dead as nothing grows anymore and all the beauty of the realms is gone. With more tales being affected by the dark magic every day the heroes of the tales combine their powers to save the 12 realms and banish this evil once and for all.<br/><br/>In the game, the players take on the roles of famous folklore characters like Little Riding Hood and Prince Charming, each with a unique ability, then attempt to travel across the tales to stop the great villains that have returned by dark magic to change their endings to bad ones and cast the realms into eternal darkness. In their quest to fight this great evil, the heroes face great challenges, but they will have at their disposal powerful weapons, skills, and ancient magic. They will travel across many tales gathering clues about the source of this mysterious evil, while fighting for their lives using a unique combat system that features a set of completely custom dice. Through their adventures, the heroes will gather experience, hone their skills or acquire new ones using an innovative skill-tree system offering tons of customization and options, collect gold, and find powerful artifacts to aid them against the foul magic that has spread through the lands.<br/><br/>The heroes will face strong villains and their minions with a new A.I. system that allows the bosses to react to certain circumstances while utilizing amazing abilities that will challenge the heroes' might and resourcefulness. The battle for the 12 realms has just begun, yet time grows short as more and more tales are being corrupted by this foul magic. Will the heroes be able to find and stop the source behind it before it's too late, or will the tales be lost forever into twisted evil versions of themselves?<br/><br/>",

The game also uses event cards including love, unity, work, plain-speaking and bad feeling cards, which players accumulate.<br/><br/>Depending on which variants are used, the players can lose, unlike some co-operative games. This can happen if the players don't have any resources to pay for a harmful event, or if all the players are immobilized.<br/><br/>Players: &quot;4 are ideal, but more or less can certainly play and sometimes a very exciting game can be played with ten.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It adds two new symbols to traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, ability cards, and a soup&ccedil;on of strategy to keep things interesting.<br/><br/>The Jack Labrador deck consists of 110 cards, comprising three games:<br/><br/>MOTOR CITY SHOWDOWN<br/>The flagship game, for 2-4 players. 30-60 minutes.<br/>Players attempt to out-strategize or out-guess their opponents, playing and anteing cards and throwing Rock-Paper-Scissors(-Jack-Labrador). Action cards can affect who wins ties, steal an opponent&rsquo;s anted cards, or if the stars align, cause a Motor City Showdown, where the entire deck of points is on the line! Cards are points, and the first player to reach a predetermined total (usually 500 or 1000), wins.<br/><br/>SPELL MY NAME<br/>A quicker, heads-up game, 2-4 players. 30 minutes.<br/>Players attempt to win five cards spelling J-A-C-K-Labrador via a series of one-on-one Rock-Paper-Scissors(-Jack-Labrador). Play a single hand or play for points.<br/><br/>PINK SLIP<br/>Per the creator, &ldquo;The ultimate card game for delivering the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.&rdquo; Each copy of Jack Labrador comes with a single Pink Slip, meant to be signed and dated by the owner. This can be anted against another owner&rsquo;s Pink Slip&mdash;winner keeps both Pink Slips and earns bragging rights for life.<br/><br/>",

Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot; and all players then try to collect as many pairs as possible. I think of it as &quot;Galaxy Trucker&quot; for non-gamers. :)<br/><br/>The House: Another variant of matching pairs, with only half of the tiles spread out on the table, and the other tiles piled on top of each other. First, a player draws a tile from the pile, then he/she tries to find the matching tile on the table.<br/><br/>Trio: Basically a variation of &quot;The House&quot; (see above), where you draw three tiles instead of one.<br/><br/>Four in a row: Basically a variation of &quot;The House&quot; (see above), where you draw four tiles instead of one.<br/><br/>",

Cards are jam-packed with Star Wars characters and scenes including the wise and powerful Master Yoda and the supremely evil Darth Sidious.<br/><br/>With the fate of the galaxy at stake, the time has come for you to decide if you will take up arms with the Jedi and fight for the Republic, or succumb to the power of the Dark Side and join the Sith and their Separatist allies?<br/><br/>Cards are distributed in packets with 5 random cards. Cards are divided into three allegiances (Republic, Separatist and Mercenary), and 12 character types (Jedi Knight, Navy, Mandalorian, Bounty Hunter, Droid, Senate, Sith, Crime Lord, Clone Trooper, Vehicle, Viceroy, Pirate). Each card has two values - defense rating and attack rating.<br/><br/>The game is designed for two players. Each player must have 12 cards in their unit (deck), with the following deck building rules - at least 4 different character types, only 1 star foil, only 1 force master.<br/><br/>Players lay their cards (all 12) faced down, and flip a coin to see who goes first. First player pick the card to play with and the type of action (defense or attack). Second player responds with his own card of choice. Player with higher number wins the turn. There are 12 turns in the game. Played cards are discarded and the game continues with remaining cards, until all 12 are played (12 turns). Winner of the game is the player with the higher number of winning turns.<br/><br/>",

Delays or detours are printed on the board and must be taken if landed on.<br/><br/>At the factory the player draws cards in order to unload peas of the matching color.<br/><br/>The standout feature of the game are the two sets of playing pieces (Harvesters and Lorries) which were nicely detailed with the Birds Eye logo on the side and had a small piece of metal in the top for the magnetic peas to stick to.<br/><br/>",

On close examination, however, there are differences which will be discussed underneath.<br/>First of all it should be noted that the (c) from this game is 1973: two years before Tennis was released! Further, on the box it says (literal translation) &quot;The first and only cardgame on the world based on tennis&quot;. The box furthermore states that  the game was issued on occasion of the 75th year of the Dutch Tennis Association. However, a publisher cannot be found on box, or on rule sheets. Based on these data I do believe that this was the predecessor of Tennis.<br/>Differences with Tennis: a) In this game there is no 'ball' nor a pawn (you just move the stack of played cards to the correct position). b) Cards are strictly for either backhand or forehand strokes (indicated with either B or F). c) There are more rules of which card may be played on what card (eg. smash may only following a lob).<br/><br/>",

Next all of the Smurf figures are placed in contact with their designated base. The object of the game is to be the first to tag your opponent's base. Each turn, a player may move his entire team of Smurfs. To do so, he may move the length of one standard playing card (such as the the enclosed rule card) an any direction indicated by the arrows on the smurf figure's base.

        "description": "In &Aring;keri (&quot;hauler firm&quot;), players assume the roles of lorry drivers transporting goods, mostly fragile or hazardous ones, across a city. Four warehouses contain goods waiting to be evenly redistributed, and deliveries can be made along the bypass that connects the warehouses or through the unpredictable streets of the city centre. Hazards are found in the form of event cards and the blocking vehicles of other players. When a car crashes into a wall or hits another car, a die is rolled to determine whether there's damage to vehicles and goods, which can be costly or even disastrous. Players have the option to purchase insurance policies to mitigate the effect of such misfortunes, or to join into cooperatives with shared assets and some added benefits (the promotion of cooperative ideology being an explicit goal of the producer). The goal is to end up with the most money having made successful deliveries of valuable goods and avoided expenses caused by the destruction of goods or vehicles.<br/><br/>Although the game is nominally for 4-8 players, it would no doubt be possible to play with 2 or 3, optionally with adjustments like having more than one car per player.<br/><br/>The box sides show titles and short captions in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish, but the Swedish edition at least (assuming there are others) has a rules sheet in Swedish only.<br/><br/>",

These are in 4 colored suits: black (social turmoil), blue (peace efforts), red (socialists), and white (conservatives).<br/><br/>Players each have a secret victory condition representing a goal of either the Reds or the Whites. They take turns placing cards in increasing sequential order onto 4 central piles (one for each suit) and try to achieve their victory condition without the state collapsing (completing the black pile) or reaching peace through compromise (completing the blue pile). Special event cards can also cause the top card of a pile to be discarded, temporarily stalling progress.<br/><br/>",

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>On their turn, the active player roll the dice and move its Beer token. When you land on a space with something to sell you can buy it with cash. Give the money to the Bogan Boss and leave one of your beer bottle cap marker tokens on the space to mark that it now belongs to you.<br/>Each time another player lands on your space they will need to give you cash to lend the space. Liekwise, if you land on something another player own, you will have to give them cash.<br/><br/>There is two ways to win:<br/>- Quick Game: As soon as someone loses all of their cash the game is over. Everyone else adds up how much they have in cash and stuff (space own on the board) and the player with the most is the winner.<br/>- Long Game: Keep playing until all players but one have lost their cash. The remaining player is the winner.<br/><br/>Release your inner bogan!<br/><br/>Reckon youse got what it takes to sweet talk you way to some extra Centrelink payments?

        "description": "A Finnish boardgame that is in many ways similar to Afrikan tähti, but is set in the 1849 goldrush in Alaska, and expands on the basic idea of that game. The game board has spaces for 25 face-down chits but there are actually two sets of chits placed on top of each other, green and black; and black chits may only be searched (turned face-up) after ALL the green chits have been discovered. Instead of looking for one special chit that allows a player to win the game, the aim is to dig gold worth of $2000 and then head for the nearest starting point, which are located corners of the gameboard. At this point, other players however still have a chance to compete for victory, for if one of them manages to find the 'Letter from Home' chit among the black chits, that triggers an end-of-game race in which the first player to reach any corner is the winner. As an added bonus, the finder of the letter gets to double their movement afterwards, while other players (excluding the one who triggered the end of the game) have the added handicap that they have to visit Klondyke first.<br/><br/>The starting points are named after six well known gold diggers from this period: Big Hawk Haida, Annie &quot;Get Your Gun&quot; Oakley, James W. Marshall, Kit Carson, C. G. Larsson and Jim Bridger. There is a very short biography of each in the rules, and a short history of the Alaska goldrush.<br/><br/>The game is dedicated to the designer's daughter Inka.<br/><br/>",

You must out-campaign your opponents to win the favor of your constituents. And most importantly, don't let those voters find out about your dirty little secrets!<br/><br/>Campaign Secrets is a fun educational game. Each card has tidbits about real presidential elections. In addition, the campaign strategies and secrets in the game, are all taken from real-life strategies and scandals. Playing the game can give many children and adults alike an insight into how a real election comes together.<br/><br/>In the game, you play a series of campaign strategies trying to get more percentage of the vote than the other players in the game. Eventually, through game play, you'll either choose or stumble into your running mate. Together the two of you must do your best to wrangle as many votes as possible away from the other players, and to hold on to your secrets so you can pick up a few extra votes at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game was designed for families and classrooms, so while it can be fun and educational for hard-core gamers, it's still simple enough for everybody to play. If you're looking for a fun way to learn about the election process, or just a fun game to play with your family, then this is the game for you. If you're looking a hard-core strategy game then you might want to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>NOTE: You may have played the First Edition of this game, but the Second Edition plays considerably different. The first edition was a quick and dirty version put out as a free give away for trade shows, the second edition is the real game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple game on a 3x3 grid, where each side has 3 chess pawns. The objective is to get a pawn to the other side of the board, or leave the opponent unable to move. Normal chess rules apply except that the pawns are not allowed a double move from their starting position.<br/><br/>Not really intended as a two-player game, it was designed to demonstrate an artificial intelligence learning technique by using beads in matchboxes. (Old enough to remember matchboxes?) Twenty-four matchboxes were used to represent the possible moves. Essentially, there were two phases. The first phase was to &quot;teach&quot; the matchbox computer to play the game, then a second phase allowed the matchbox computer to play other opponents. The learning speed depended on the skill of the opponent in the teaching phase.<br/><br/>There are variants in which taking the opponent's piece is mandatory (&quot;Dawson's chess&quot;) and ones that use larger boards.<br/><br/>Martin Gardner first published this in his Mathematical Games column in March 1962, and subsequently in his book, &quot;The Unexpected Hanging&quot;.<br/><br/>",

One player is the submarine commander and controls a mothership-submarine and nine mini-subs; the other is the surface commander and controls a fleet of sixteen destroyers. The board has an asymmetric (roughly 10 by 16) grid on which the vessels move; initial setup is printed on the board and is always the same.<br/><br/>There are several exit points at the edges of the grid. The goal of the submarine commander is to take the mothership off the board through an exit point; the surface commander tries to prevent this and capture the mothership. (For the purpose of the victory condition, the mini-subs and destroyers are expendable.) Both sides can capture the other's vessels by sandwiching an enemy vessel between two of their own. Captured vessels are removed from the game.<br/><br/>The board also has several &quot;military secrets&quot;; by placing any of his vessels on such a space the sub commander forces the surface commander to remove one destroyer (her choice).<br/><br/>The game includes one rules variant.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>     Hnefatafl<br/><br/><br/>",

You need to travel around the world and visit the casinos of Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Monte Carlo, and Macau. On the way you must answer questions: Correct answers wins you money, but it costs if you can't answer.<br/><br/>You also have the oppertunity to gamble. You can challenge your opponents in Black Jack to win their money - or loose. You can put money on the dice, the one-armed bandit, or try a fortune cookie, which can bring fortune but most certain also the opposite.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to visit the four casinos, reach the board's center and correctly answer a crucial question. BUT only if you also have the most money in your pocket.<br/><br/>In Farrago there are plenty of opportunities to both gloat with your knowledge and tease your opponents, when winning their money from them. You must dare to gamble, challenge your opponents and have the fate on your page. Or you can go completely bust when the playing fever runs away with you.<br/><br/>",

Do all the things real parasites do -- bore into vital organs, hide inside a blood cell, hitch a ride inside a mosquito, even take over your host's brain. However, opponents can add stages to your life cycle, and zap you with medicine.<br/><br/>Parasites Unleashed! is a simple and fast-paced non-collectible card game for 2-4 players ages 8 and up. Gameplay is simple enough for younger players, but more sophisticated gamers can discover subtle strategies.

        "description": "Recently revised into a deluxe box, Imps Vs. Puppies is a trick-taking game about players competing to smash open the top card of the Crate Deck.  The game offers 15 different Imps with various abilities that will trigger at different points of the round.  Each of these Imps come in 6 different colors to support the different teams and there is often a pregame draft to pick which Imps are included in the game.  The crate deck is also customized with a mixture of points and traps.<br/><br/>Each round has 5 phases which will determine when Imp abilities will trigger and how the round is resolved.<br/>Phase 1- Send Imps: Each player sends an Imp of their choice from their hand to the battle.  If the card is sent face it, this means their ability will trigger.  Sent face down, their identity is unknown so their strength can be bluffed.<br/>Phase 2- Reveal Imps:  Imps that were sent facedown are revealed and any Imps that are matching in strength are sent home immediately.<br/>Phase 3- Ability Phase:  Several Imps have abilities that will trigger right before the center crate is smashed.<br/>Phase 4- Smash Crate:  The top crate card is revealed and resolved.  If the card is a puppy, players put this card in their score pile.  If the card is a bomb, the Imp who smashed the crate is killed.  There are a number of other traps that could trigger as well, including Ninja Kittens and Mega Bombs.<br/>Phase 5- Cleanup Phase: Players pull any Imps in the Infirmary into their hands and the Imps used that round enter the infirmary.<br/><br/>This continues until the Last Round Puppy is revealed and players count the number of points in their score piles.  Ties are broken by the person who smashed the most puppies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One player (or team) creates a murder case, by selecting a suspect, place, motive and method. The other player (or team) then has to find out this information by making guesses, also consisting of a suspect, location, motive and method. After each guess, they are told how many items they got correct, but not which.<br/><br/>If the guessing player (or team) solves the case within seven attempts, they score points.<br/><br/>After each round, the roles are reversed. The first player to reach a pre-determined amount of points wins the game.<br/><br/>This is the travel edition of Murder Mystery Mansion. It uses magnetic tokens instead of cards. Other than that, the main difference is the size: this travel version has four suspects, three locations, three motives and three methods. The regular version has six of each, and the guessing team gets twelve rounds to solve the crime.<br/><br/>",

When it is your turn you show the top card of the function cards. It shows two or three things that Princess Lillifee would like to take along on her journey and which have to be packed into her bag. You have to try to reveal these items by showing the correct item cards. The order is up to you. If you make a mistakeand show the wrong item card with an item that is not on the function card, you turn only this item card face down again and it is the next players turn to try and find the correct items on the function card.  As soon as one player has revealed all items on a function card, he can keep the card and as soon as all item cards are turned face down again, he can continue with a new function card.<br/><br/>End of the game:<br/>The game is over as soon as all function cards are given out or if one player got 6 function cards. Now you count your points on the cards. Each item on a function card counts 1 point, so you have as many points as items on your function card. The one with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It is designed to meet Washington's K-12 educational standards for teaching about native history, economics, culture, and government. The game was developed as a community effort with local elders and language experts. The game is written in both English and Lushootseed, the indigenous language of the Salish Pacific Northwest. Game mechanics are based on sharing resources to meet other players&rsquo; needs for food, materials, technology, and knowledge.<br/><br/>This is a collaborative game where there is not one winner. Success is determined by whether or not all houses have their resource needs met by the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game is named for the Potlatch, which is a ceremonial distribution and re-distribution of resources, property, food, knowledge, and wealth with the purpose of affirming social status via the historic economic systems of subsistence, prestige, and sharing. Potlatching is practiced by indigenous peoples of the Pacific NW coast of the U.S. and Canada. Historically it supported a large socio-economic system to maintain a high level of food production and to equalize food accessibility. Individuals, families, or communities host potlatches and planning takes a year or more. Skagit elder and historian, Vi Hilbert, wrote &ldquo;Public acts of distributing valuables to guests were the ultimate confirmation of a host&rsquo;s achievements and personal high-status in their family and community.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Can you make Cavity Sam better before time is up? In the Botched Operation board game, you get to be the doctor and use the tweezers to remove the silly ailments from Cavity Sam, but you've got to do it while performing the stunt shown on the Challenge card. The card you pick might say to remove parts without using your thumbs, or while getting tickled. If the tweezers touch the sides of the openings, the buzzer goes off and you have to move on to the next ailment. Try to get as many parts as you can before the timer runs out, without getting buzzed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card-flicking card game in which a target card depicting some tasty fish is placed on the table and players attempt to flick (actually, according to the rules, this is a wrist-toss rather than a finger-flick) cards depicting dolphins as close to the target as possible - the twisting motion of the flicked cards is supposed to represent the playful antics of the dolphins. A crosshair appears in the corner of each card, and distance is measured by the closest crosshair on the flicked card in relation to the closest crosshair on the target card. The number of cards to be scored is determined by the number on the closest card to the target (i.e. if a &quot;4&quot; card is closest to the target, the four closest cards all will score). Each card scores a number of points equal to the face value of the card multiplied by the number of crosshair symbols on the card that remain uncovered. If all four crosshairs on the target are covered, the player covering the last takes a penalty, as does any player causing the target card to fall off the table. Suggested game duration is as many rounds as the number of players; highest point total wins.<br/><br/>",

The board has an outer track, very Monopoly like, but a map occupies the space inside.  It is divided into 16 countries, forming colour groups known as Cartels.  As you go around, you buy up &quot;countries&quot; to charge other players &quot;port fees&quot;; the countries can have their industry developed by buying Factories (e.g. houses/hotels).  The Community Chest/Chance cards have been replaced by Spot Market and Commodity Exchange decks, which are used to simulate a player's speculating on the spot market.  A key difference from Monopoly is that you can build up your military and use it as an alternate means of conquest.<br/><br/>",

It's up to you to track them down and solve the case.<br/><br/>Object of the game:<br/><br/>Be the first player to nab three suspects.<br/><br/>To play:<br/><br/>File tiles are arranged face-down in a 4x5 grid. Each player takes a Case Lead Tile and places it on their Detective Desk Mat. Suspects are lined up nearby. Each suspect has three evidence symbols on its base. On a turn, players may look under one tile to find evidence symbols without showing their opponent.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a turn, if a player thinks she knows where two Evidence file tiles are, which, along with her Case Lead Tile match a suspect, she may nab the suspect instead of searching under a tile. To nab a suspect, declare which suspect you are accusing. Then, flip the corresponding Evidence file tiles over. If correct, the suspect is placed on the Detective Desk Mat on a numbered space. If the player is mistaken and the Evidence file tiles do not match, they are flipped back over and play continues, but the opponent has now seen where two tiles are. The first player to nab three suspects is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Learningames offers a new and exciting way to have fun while learning about the American Presidency.  Through these innovative and easy-to-play games players master important information about all presidents and their administrations.<br/><br/>Two to six players sit around the playing board.  The playing board includes the portrait of each chief executive.  In place of the names of the presidents are the numbers 1 to 43.  To begin the game a player draws a card from the deck.  Each card has the name of a president on one side and a number with important information about the head of state on the other side.<br/><br/>In the basic game players win cards by locating and naming the president on the numbered playing board or by correctly challenging incorrect answers.  When playing advanced games, players master important information about the presidents identified in the basic game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "a 1962 Golf game with 25 individually rated golfers of the time by Nemadji Game Company of Duquette Minnesota. There are several charts (Tee-off, Fairway, Off-Green) that you (representing the golfer) use to move your golf ball (marked by a Tee) down the 9-hole course. The individual player cards are only used once you are on the green. There is a spinner in the bottom of the box where you get a result of 1 to 25 and look up a result on a chart or on the player card. <br/>Some of the golfers included: 1942 Byron Nelson, 1937 Byron Nelson, 49 Sam Snead, 54 Snead, 53 Ben Hogan, 51 Hogan, 35 Gene Sarazen. I think this was a set of All-stars and might have been an extra option. There is also a set of 1962 golfers: Weiskopf, Crampton, Dent, Wadkins, Watson, Player, Floyd, Nicklaus, Trevino and others.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You guessed it. Farting on command is a rare act to be nurtured. At its best, the act blossoms into a rich symphony of sound along with the expulsion of powerful gases ripe with pungent odors.<br/><br/>Roll the die to move. When a you land on a square that says drink, drink. When you land on a square that says eat beans, you may of course substitute an obnoxious substitute that causes gas. When landing on a square that directs you to fart, you will have two minutes to summon up your best effort. The other players decide how you score on the fart meter on the game board. You will then be awarded the appropriate number of gas coupons. Winning the game is done in one of two ways. 1) First person to score 25 gas coupons or 2) Let rip with such a powerful fart that you clear the whole room!<br/><br/>",

The LAST player to do that gets an electrical shock.

Obviously this only makes a difference with 3 or 4 players. With 2, it plays identical to the original.<br/><br/>&quot;Revenge&quot; mode : in this mode each player chooses who they would like to shock if they were to win. Press the button on the handle until the red light on your base control is targeting your chosen victim. The 3 lights correspond as follows : centre is the player opposite, left is the player to your left and right is the player to your right. Start the game and the fastest finger gets to shock their chosen victim.<br/><br/>The game uses three AAA batteries, so the shock is not dangerous, but it certainly adds an element of tension to the otherwise rather simple test of reacting speed.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Lightning Reaction<br/>    Lightning Reaction Extreme<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;An abstract game of military strategy set in World War II&quot;<br/><br/>This card game is played in partnerships by two, four or six people.  Each team represents the combined resources of a bloc of nations at war with the other team.  Points are accumulated by conducting offensives, opening new fronts and successfully countering enemy offensives.  The game ends once all the cards have been drawn and played.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may shift a combat card between two of your fronts before drawing and playing or discarding a card.  Fronts are prepared face down, until the offensive is declared.  Fronts are laid out like in Caesar &amp; Cleopatra (or Hera &amp; Zeus --those kinds of games).  Cards come in two types, combat and &quot;special&quot;.  The combat cards represent units of infantry, armor, mine fields and so on.  Special cards include Strategic Bombing (which permanently reduces a player's hand size), New Front, Offensive/Supply (which launches or sustains an offensive, or can be used to shift Airborne combat cards between fronts).<br/><br/>Points are scored mostly during offensives; every turn an offensive goes on, the difference between the attacker's total offense and the defender's total defense is scored by the stronger side.  There is also a bonus point score when opening a new front.<br/><br/>The cards are very bland looking with a simple APP-6 or SPI-style symbol, a pair of offense/defense ratings and some explanatory text.  Most combat units lack character: Armour, Infantry and Combat Engineers work nearly the same way except for their different offense/defense ratings.  I'd have given the Combat Engineers a special power against Mine Fields, for example.<br/><br/>",

You can also earn income through dividend issued by companies you are holding and other investment opportunities available in the market. However, you should not over-invest because you may need urgent cash to support your expenses. Being the major shareholder also allows you to exploit the cash reserve of the company to benefit yourself.

Stock prices fluctuate according to the market position which is driven by a die roll.  Each company's stock behave very differently.

        "description": "The American Civil War was a bloody conflict that took place 150 years ago between 1861 and 1865. After the war ended many Confederates said that the South would rise again. Now with the help of Wallet Battles their dream can come true.<br/><br/>Wallet Battles essentially takes an old Civil War coin flipping game and combines it with the new micro board game concept to create a fun interactive game that can be enjoyed over and over wherever you go.<br/><br/>Game Overview: <br/>Wallet Battles is a micro board game for two that is played on a plastic card that has battle maps available on both sides of the card. Players flip coins to earn the right to perform actions that will help them battle for ownership of various locations on the map. The key objective is to have the most points by the end of the game. To achieve this objective you need to control as much of the map as possible and build stacks of coins to strengthen your defenses.<br/><br/>Setup: <br/>Place the map you wish to use face up between both players. Now divide equally between both players a handful of coins. We recommend 6 quarters, 6 nickels, 6 dimes and 6 pennies for optimal play, however, any amount of coins can be used to manipulate the length of play.<br/><br/>Decide who wants to represent the Confederates (Tails) and who wants to represent the Union (Heads).  If needed, a regular coin flip can be used to decide for you.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Each turn begins with both players flipping a coin onto a table. Each flip has three potential outcomes:<br/>Heads: Both coins show heads.<br/>Tails: Both coins show tails.<br/>Odd: One head and one tail is shown.<br/><br/>If the coins land on Heads the player representing the Union can place one of his coins on the map or if his opponent already has coins on the map he may capture one of his coins to place in his pile for later placement.<br/><br/>If the coins land on Tails the player representing the Confederacy can place one of his coins on the map or if his opponent already has coins on the map he may capture one of his coins to place in his pile for later placement.<br/><br/>If the coins land Odd the coin flip must be repeated. No other action is required, however, if Odd is flipped three times in a row all players must remove a coin from the map and return it back to their pile.<br/><br/>To strengthen your defenses you must build stacks of coins. Smaller coins must go on top of larger coins. Therefore, if your base coin is a dime you won&rsquo;t be able to build a stack. You can&rsquo;t build on your opponents stack, however, you can capture coins from him.<br/> Game End:<br/>The game ends when all coins have been captured, your opponent is out of coins  or when all possible locations on the map have been used. Players earn 2 points for every location they control and 1 point for every coin located on the map. Stacks of coins consisting of three or more coins will be doubled in value. Any coins not used will be counted as 1 point. The player with the most points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Boundaries Baseball helps children understand and respect boundaries.  Boundaries are essential for positive relationships with peers and adults; children who act out are often asking for the security of clear boundaries and the skills needed to respect them.<br/><br/>Boundaries Baseball utilizes a baseball diamond format as a visual reminder for not going out of bounds.  As part of the action of the play, students will also have opportunities to toss a &ldquo;ball&rdquo; so that it stays within the boundaries of a &ldquo;strike zone.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Game cards teach four kinds of boundaries: <br/>(1) Saying and accepting &ldquo;No,&rdquo;.<br/>(2) Managing strong emotions (called feelings in the game).<br/>(3) Respecting personal space and property.<br/>(4) Relationship/communication limits.<br/><br/>Players use a special spinner to see what happens for each pitch.  For example, they could get a strike, a ball, a single, or a pop fly out. Players move their pawns, counterclockwise around the diamond. Their pawns are baseball players (see photo). The players then advance according to the instructions on the spinner and pick and answer cards that match the color of the space landed on. For example, a strike results in going back one space, a ball advances the player three spaces, and a single brings the player to the next base.  The four decks of cards correspond to the four categories of boundaries mentioned above.  When players reach home plate, they add one to their score on the scoreboard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Llamanomics (a contraction of Llamas and Economics) is a supply and demand negotiation card game where you use Llamas to buy, transport, and sell goods.<br/><br/>Each turn a player takes a card from the deck. Throughout the deck there are 'Burgermeister' cards. When a 'Burgermeister' card is pulled players may choose to sell any of the commodities they have on their llamas for their current point value (determined by the 'Demand' cards). The values of the different commodities change throughout the game.<br/><br/>During the game, you can play action cards to upgrade your own llamas, or apply negative effects on other players.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck runs out of cards. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/><br/>Llamanomics is a card game about supply, demand, and llamas (and the occasional alpaca).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get the most valuable commodities and sell them for the most points. <br/> You play as a trader, taking his/her commodities to the market to sell.  And what will be carrying your commodities?  Why, your trusty llamas!  The more llamas you get, the more you can carry.  The more you can form corner the market on different commodities and squeeze out your competition.  Capitalism style!  Llama style!<br/><br/>So, the strategy comes in with 'ACTION CARDS', which allow you to upgrade your llamas, downgrade your competitors llamas, steal llamas, swap commodities, and all sorts of other shenanigans!<br/><br/>'DEMAND CARDS' add yet another element of gameplay as the value of the commodities changes throughout the game.<br/><br/>You have to be clever in placing llamas, commodities and action cards.  You have to be even more clever in choosing which other players you will trade with, or harass, make alliances with, and take the free-llama-market by storm!<br/><br/>",

Now dessert is served&mdash;the table is laden with Chocolate Mousse, Rice Pudding, Cherry Pie, Fruit Salad and so much more. The guests start to grin wickedly&hellip;<br/><br/>The object of Splat! is to furiously flinging food at other players while dodging food they are throwing back at you. The more food that hits you, the messier you get. At the end of the game, the cleanest players are allowed to think that they&rsquo;ve won.<br/><br/>The game uses three types of cards:<br/><br/>Food Cards : Each food card has a special power which takes effect when the food is either eaten, or is thrown at another player and hits.  Some of these powers are long lasting while others are instant (e.g. the banana split is vitamin fortified and so increases a players hand size, while the revolutionary cupcakes contain added additives which force you to throw all your food at other players). Food cards are either green (generally beneficial powers) and red (generally not beneficial).<br/><br/>And Then Cards : Event cards which can be played during the food throwing process to impact the course of the game.  These cards act as interrupts which provide much of the interactive story telling character of the game (e.g. Amy throws Birthday Cake at Clare but Bob catches it and throws it back at Amy on his next turn). These cards can also be played as dodges to avoid food that is thrown at you.<br/><br/>Object Cards : Throughout the game players may also stand in front of objects (e.g. The Children, The Gnu, Uncle Harry or The Mirror).  If a player standing in front of an object dodges then the food hits the object instead and the thrower gets yelled at by either the Host or the Hostess--forcing them to discard all their And Then cards and eat a food (if they have one).<br/><br/>Each player has a 'You' card with 5 hit locations--when food hits someone the thrower rolls to see where (Head, 2 x Arms, 2 x Legs, 1's miss).  Food which hits a location that is already messy replaces the previous food.<br/><br/>The Butler (Jeeves) also has a hit location card--players may choose to throw food at him through the game and in addition any food that is thrown which does not hit a player or an object may hit Jeeves instead.  Once Jeeves is completely covered with food he chases the players out of the house, ending the game.<br/><br/>Splat! is a reworking of Ed Carter's 1992 food-fight card game, Kersplatt!<br/><br/><br/>",

Everyone looks at their cards and places all matching cards face up. Players then take one of the remaining cards from the player on their left. If this new card makes a match, place the match face up on the table. If not, just add the card to your hand. Play continues until all cards are matched. The player left with the Joker/Gorilla card is the &quot;Monkey's Uncle&quot;.) <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Go-Go Gorilla!: &quot;A racing game where players scramble to put their playing cards from A to Z!&quot; (Separate the card deck by color, giving one color to each team/player.

        "description": "This is a simple game for two or more players, played with two dice and two counters (e.g. coins) per player.<br/><br/>Roll one die to see who goes first.  Then players take turns (clockwise) rolling two dice.  If either die displays a 1 (an &quot;ace&quot;), a counter is put in the pot (that is, in put in the middle of the table).  If two 1s are thrown, two counters are put in.  If either die displays a 6, both dice and one counter are passed to the player on the thrower's left.<br/><br/>A player without counters cannot roll the dice, and thus merely passes them on.  (He or she is not out of the game, however, since  he or she will receive a counter if the player on the right rolls a 6.)<br/><br/>Play continues until there is only 1 counter left outside the pot.  The player with this counter makes three consecutive rolls.  If he or she does NOT roll a 6, then he or she has won.  If, though, a 6 is rolled, the counter and the dice are passed to the player on the left, who in turns rolls three times.  And so on. The first player to roll three times without a 6 wins the game.<br/><br/>Despite being entirely luck-based, the game is fun on account of its dramatic twists and turns and come-from-behind wins.  The luck is an equalizing element that makes this game especially suitable to play with children<br/><br/>Source: R. C. Bell, Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations<br/><br/><br/>",

It is covered with a grid network that divides the mountain and some adjacent houses into fields. At the edges there are additional marks for the initial positions of the players. In addition the central mountain fields are provided with numbers between 1 and 3.<br/><br/>Each player has several small temple buildings and with the help of Oracle stones (small wood disks) they indicate how far they want to pull their own temples in a round.<br/>The goal is to place as much as possible own buildings on the temple mountain. With 2 players one must place 7 buildings in order to win (there are 13 spaces). With 3-4 players one must achieve at least 12 points to be the winner. Each round is divided into three phases.<br/><br/>In the first phase each player decides the number of steps that he wants to move one of his building. Accordingly it takes and puts as many Oracle stones into its right hand, while keeping the remaining Oracle stones covered in the left hand. Every player place a bet on the total amount of Oracle stones that will be played in the current round by all players (it's not permitted to call a number already called by a previous player). After each player called a value, everyone open their right hand, and if someone called the exact value, he will have benefits in the third phase.<br/><br/>In the second phase every player moves one of his buildings (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) according to number of Oracle stones played. During the movement one can jump over one or more buildings, but the target field must be however free. If one jumps over an opponent building with the next to last point of movement, he can strike this at the end of its movement, if he wants to. The building is then put again into the supply of the opponent.<br/><br/>In the third phase only the player that called exactly the value in the first phase can place one of its temple on a free starting position on the board. If all starting positions are occupied or if the player has already all temples on the board, the action is not taken.<br/><br/>",

In your turn you must draw a card and show it to the other players. If it's a bomb, you lose. If it is not, you can keep the card and play any action card from your hand. Action cards are useful for making the other players drawing extra cards (more possibilities of drawing a bomb), skipping your own turn (and avoid drawing), shielding against the bombs and more similar actions.<br/>Last player standing wins the game.<br/><br/>It's mostly about luck but still a very funny party game.<br/><br/>",

You can also add two cards together to make a number match, but both cards must be the same color (for example, if the top card of a discard pile is a red 7, you can add together a yellow 3 and a yellow 4 and play them together as a 7 on that pile).<br/><br/>Watch out for classic UNO action cards like Skip, Reverse, and Draw 2 as well as the all-new Wild Play 2 card, which forces the next player to play 2 cards on their turn or lose their turn and draw 2 cards as a penalty.<br/><br/>Note: DOS Second Edition is has completely different gameplay than the earlier DOS card game (2018).<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

ABACAN is a fun new strategy game that uses simple rules to provide a depth of strategy that grows with the experience of the players. ABACAN is a variation of the nearly 3000 year old Chinese mathematical game of Nim. To play, players alternate turns sliding 1,2, or 3 beads on the same bar from one side of the game to the other. The winner is the player who forces their opponent to move the last bead. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, not ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, ABACAN is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again. Great gift item!<br/><br/>",

Only Zithium and Beton Crystals from the Planet of Fire and the Ice Planet can destroy it.<br/>Your Mission. Bring back both Crystals and plant them in the War Ship Bridge. Look out for the Blurg, the Spider and the Klingons.  Also look Out For Refuge Squares, Avoid Capture, Closed Circuit TV, Alarms and the Baroom Card!!<br/><br/>This Star Trek Game is a board game for two to six players produced in 1975 by Palitoy for the UK game market. This game is TOS-based, and was advertised as &quot;Taken from the popular BBC TV Series Star Trek&quot;. Much of the game's artwork seems to have been done by &ndash; or at least, influenced by &ndash; the artists who worked on the Gold Key Star Trek comic. Players play crewmembers of the Enterprise assigned to obtain alien crystals from two planets that can be used to destroy a nearby Klingon warship, while avoiding capture by either the Klingons or the indigenous creatures on either planet.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The object of the game is to land on two planets &ndash; the &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Ice Planet&quot; &ndash; to retrieve a sample of &quot;Zithium&quot; and &quot;Beton&quot; (respectively) to use against the Klingons and destroy their ship.<br/>As crewmembers of the Enterprise, you have been assigned to obtain a crystal of each substance from their respective plantes, while avoiding a giant alien spider (which protects the crystals on the Planet of Fire) and an amorphous blob called a Blurg (who protects the crystals on the Ice Planet).<br/><br/>Each player starts in the Enterprise transporter room and tries to roll the number of the transporter pad to which they are assigned to &quot;beam down&quot; to one of the planets. (If they cannot do this within three rolls, they &quot;beam down&quot; automatically.) The player then traverses the game path on the planet to try and reach the cavern containing the crystals at the path's end. Players can obtain help from Kirk or Spock by landing on the space with their picture. They can also be captured if landed on by either creature or a Klingon (spaces on the path allow either the creatures to move or the Klingons to beam down to the planets), but by the player having Kirk and/or Spock with them, the player can have their &quot;senior officer&quot; &quot;stun&quot; their attacker and continue play.<br/><br/>Once a player obtains the crystal from one planet, they return to the Enterprise and go through &quot;decontamination&quot; (moving along the red and white path near the transporter room). They then return to the transporter (via the yellow and green path) and attempt to &quot;beam down&quot; to the other planet and get the second crystal. They then return to the Enterprise and undergo &quot;decontamination&quot; again before proceeding to the Enterprise's &quot;airlock&quot; and attempting to board the Klingon ship. From their, the player must enter the Klingon bridge, plant the crystals, and beam back to the Enterprise and undergo &quot;decontamination&quot; a third time before landing on the &quot;Detonator&quot; space and playing the &quot;Baroom&quot; card on the Klingon ship, thus destroying it and winning the game.<br/><br/>Source: Memory Alpha Wiki<br/><br/>",

Players choose characters and get special advantages based on their unique character abilities. Compete with other players as you race through the jungle. Your goal is to collect tokens to fill your character tracker. Battle the evil forces and encounter windfalls but remember to be careful! Everything could change at a moment&rsquo;s notice!<br/><br/>The first player to gain 6 tokens is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Each player has 3 lives until they are dead (this is from the movie).<br/><br/>There are three cards that are placed face up. On a players turn, they select one of the cards to use for the turn. Cards may give you an extra life, give you an extra die, allow you to steal a token (VP) from another player, or fight a bad guy. Fighting the bad guys are the main event battles you will perform.<br/><br/>Combat is very easy. Each card (bad guy) allows you to ask other players to join a fight. Then there is a number that collectively all the players must roll equal to or higher than. If they do so, they each get a token (VP). If not, the lead player loses a life (you only get 3!).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As the locations of the crystals are unknown at the outset, you'll first need to accumulate Clues.  For every six clues, you find a crystal --that is, you roll to deploy one; although you're the only one who knows where it is, you still need to get there and back...<br/><br/>There are three basic strategies: One At A Time, where you find and fetch each of the six crystals in sequence; All At Once, where you locate all six before attempting to retrieve them; and Piracy, where you lie in wait of those who have found crystals...<br/><br/>",

The object is to score points by collecting and then melding the cards, a la rummy.<br/>Players may meld numerical sequences of up to 11 cards, scoring 1 point for each card in the meld. These sequences must be along the top row dice face of the cards. Bonus points are scored for also forming certain combinations along the bottom row. For example, a sequence showing Red 1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/6 would score 16 points; 4 points for the 1,2,3,4 sequence along the top row, multiplied by 2 for all the cards being the same color, multiplied by 2 again for the 4,5,6 sequence along the bottom. There are several other bonuses which may be scored. <br/>The mechanics of the game are very simple. Several cards will be face up on the table at any one time. Each player may roll up to 3 of their 4 dice in an attempt to capture 1 or more of these cards.<br/>Cards are captured by rolling the two numbers corresponding to the two dice on a card. Thus, rolling a 1, 4, 5 will allow you to capture a 5/1, a 4/1 or a 5/4 card, provided they are available.<br/>If a player rolls just one of the numbers on a card that he/she wants, that player may &quot;reserve&quot; that card by placing the single dice on the card. If the player subsequently rolls the second number in a later turn, he/she can take the card. Reserved cards may still be captured by other players.<br/> ",

The board has the usual track of famous British companies (Tarmac, Racal, Tesco, Courts), decks of Fact Cards and Venture Cards, a die showing cash gains, a huge stack of plastic money chips for each player and a genuine Casio HL-811 calculator in its own box!<br/>You need the calculator because the game also has a book of actual weekly share prices for each company. On your turn, you buy into one firm or another by placing chips onto the board. Later you may sell your investment, making a profit or loss as the prices fluctuate. You draw a Fact Card, which gives info about the price of gold, the currency exchange rates, the FTSE index (the UK's Dow Jones) for a certain week. Based on that info, you decide if your shares will be up or down and whether to sell or hold. If you sell, the Banker checks the actual price in the Market booklet and debits or credits you accordingly.

Each player has a Syndicate board and puts tokens into each Market slot. You roll and move round the board, drawing the relevant market card which may show a profit or loss (eg opening of new airport increases premiums for Aviation syndicates, football team trashing hotel costs Non-marine claims damages). You can also gain Stop Loss markers and face a Solvency test. You win by your Syndicate getting 4 tokens in each Market and passing the Solvency test.<br/>A nicely made set with a quarter-board, but, being a British game, there is no more thought than roll &amp; move and draw hazard cards. As boring as it sounds.<br/><br/>",

Was murder part of his act?<br/><br/>Marcy Brannigan: A wife with an ulterior motive.  Greed and deception are her pride possessions.<br/><br/>Chet Granger: A charming Texan who loves his freedom.

Some squares are safe while others cause you to move back. The most common square on the board is &quot;throw fingers&quot; where two players randomly put out a number of fingers. If the total is odd, the active player moves back while if it is even, he/she stays on the square. There is also an element where you must guess in which hand a player is holding a token. During the game, a special &quot;moon card&quot; can be used on a player to move them back on the board to a specific square.<br/><br/>The first player to make it to the End space is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each hole has a dominant suit (hearts, clubs, diamonds or spades) and a stroke is made by playing a combination of cards to determine the distance and lie.  Thus playing a 2 + King (picture cards count as 0 or 10) + Ace, equates to a drive of 201 yards. Only certain distances are permitted, as shown on a distance table on each board, and certain cards may land you in a hazard (which, tactically, may still be worth playing).  Playing a card not of the dominant suit incurs a one stroke penalty.  A player may opt to draw from the stock, in the hope of improving his position, or play a stroke with the cards he has been dealt.<br/><br/>Golf Ace works best with 4 players, but can be played as a solitaire, trying to beat your own lowest score for a round of 9 or 18 holes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player has a team of three figures, two adventurers and one guide. The guide is used to collect &quot;Grub Stake&quot; cards which allow you to climb the mountain and get the treasure. Your adventurers are used to climb for the gold and to delay other players.<br/><br/>The game is interesting in that it has a molded plastic wall which must be climbed. The square 'Grub Stake' cards are placed into slots on the wall to allow a players figure to ascend the mountain.<br/><br/>Movement is by roll of two dice which may be split amongst any of your three figures. The pieces move in a straight line only... no turns are allowed during a move.<br/><br/>If a &quot;Bear&quot; card is discovered while exploring, it can be used to send an opponent back to start or delay him while he's climbing for treasure.<br/><br/>The game is entirely dependent on the roll of the dice and the cards gained through random draw. Nevertheless, it's a fun little race game with a 3D board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A unique mixture of checkers and wargame theming.  Single checkers are &quot;platoons&quot;; double checkers are &quot;battalions&quot;.  Platoons can only move counter-clockwise around the board and only on the outside track.  Battalions can move in either direction and can use the bridges to move to and from the inner track.  A platoon becomes a battalion by reaching enemy territory and surviving for a turn.<br/><br/>Movement is handled by rolling two dice that generate a number from 2 - 3.  Yes, that's right, one of the dice is nothing but 1's, and the other is 50/50 split between 1's and 2's.  No, I have no idea why they bothered with the first die.  Maybe they thought it would be less confusing than saying &quot;roll the die and add 1&quot;.  Yes, having a die that is 50/50 2's and 3's would have made the most sense, but maybe they bought these on clearance somewhere.<br/><br/>Capturing happens just like checkers, though you do not have to jump if you do not want to.  Captured pieces are kept in the POW camps (for theme).  Safety zones provide spots where pieces can not be captured.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to become the wealthiest prospector.<br/><br/>A dice roll moves your game pieces up the mountain until you reach one of the numbered mine entrances. Placing a numbered marble in the mine entrance enables player to actively mine that mine. To recover gold, a player rotates the mountain using mountain movement cards. Amount of payment for gold depends on marble landing in assayer's tray. Once paid, the player reuses the game piece, to start over climbing the mountain to mine for more gold.<br/><br/>More advanced players can challenge each other to gunfights or steal each other's mines by claim jumping. A dice roll determines who wins a gunfight or takes over a mine.<br/><br/>A third dimension to the game, Bushwhackers, is a game of capture. It uses the gunfight rules along with the location on the mountain to gain advantage against your opponent.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is included in the Lego set 7418 Scorpion Palace, part of the &quot;Orient Expedition - India&quot; series.  The various games can be combined to increase the number of players, and you can even add games from the &quot;Orient Expedition - Mount Everest&quot; and &quot;Orient Expedition - China&quot; games.<br/><br/>Components consist of a board of seven interlocking tiles, a deck of 18 cards and a die (a normal six-sider with the &quot;6&quot; replaced by the Hook).  The rules are in 19 languages!<br/><br/>The board is laid out around the constructed play set (in either the standard layout or a customized one) and the equipment pieces (shovel, pistol, binoculars, spear, satchel and map) are spread randomly on the cross spaces (of which there are 14 on the board); the remaining items start in the Scorpion Palace.  The Challenge (5) and Item (8) cards are spread face up to serve as reference cards.  There are two playable characters and three &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br/><br/>To move, the die is rolled and the hero's Speed factor added in.  Items collected add to the Speed, Luck or Strength factors.  A hero can only carry what the figure can actually carry --two hands, maybe a backpack with a loop on its side.  Once the Scorpion Palace (or the Elephant) is reached, challenges are faced.  You choose which factor to use, although some items mean you win the challenge automatically (most items just give a bonus).  A die is added (re-roll Hooks); if your total is less than the Challenge rating, you lose an item and must try again later.  Once a Challenge is defeated, it is cleared for all players.<br/><br/>Outside the Palace, when you roll a Hook then the bad guy Sam Sinister challenges you.  The hero picks a skill factor and both him and Sam Sinister add a die (re-roll Hooks and ties).  A defeat again means you lose an item.  A win means you take an item from Sam Sinister!  The other two bad guys are faced the same way, except that they don't move about.<br/><br/>The Elephant (or any other means of transportation, if playing combined game sets) increases movement considerably since you now move one tile per die pip instead of one square (the tiles measure 5 squares across).<br/><br/>The game ends when a hero reaches the final square with the Golden Shield.  Both heroes add their item values to see who wins.  Jewels are worth 4 each.<br/><br/>",

The quest is to align Charms, your playing pieces, 4 or 5 in a row by alternating dice and free moves. The intermix of plays allows you to thwart your opponents, build a stronghold, complete your path, and win the bout.<br/><br/>The game was created for boardgame enthusiasts who want a boardgame that is 'at the ready'. Dice, Charms, and Instructions are all kept neatly in a Velcro pocket.<br/><br/>Your shirt has a printed 'Plat' on the back with numbered 'Sites' which is the playing surface. The object of the game is to align 5 Charms in a row, in any direction or 4 when there are four or more players. The opening move is Norns--when the player rolls the dice and places a 'Charm' on the corresponding 'Site'. (for example, a player rolls a 2 and an 8. He or she now has the option of placing a charm on 28 or 82.)<br/><br/>&lsquo;Bumping&rsquo; can occur when an opponents charm already occupies the number rolled. The current player can bump the opponents charm out of play and replace it with their own.<br/><br/>Play continues to the left until all players have played their Norns.<br/><br/>The next round of turns is the 'Free Move'. On their turns, the players can choose any open site on the plat. Either building a path of 4 or 5 in a row or blocking an opponent.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Gazorping&rsquo; is a capture move where a player must complete a path with two opponents' charms in between. The opponents' charms are removed. The player has the option of &lsquo;Sliding&rsquo;-- moving one, and only one, of their charms into the vacated sites left during a Gazorp.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Going to Jerusalem is a Bible game that is based upon the New Testament. Like all fine games, it is both interesting and entertaining, and at the same time its play familiarizes both children and adults with the best-known verses in the New Testament. The Revised Standard Version of the Bible has been selected for use in this game because it has been approved for teaching in most church schools. Those who are familiar with other versions of the Bible will find it interesting to compare the verses in their own Bibles with those that are used in the play of this game.  Going to Jerusalem is designed primarily for home play but is adaptable for use in school and church classes.<br/><br/>",

To become a rustler you must acquire your guns and gear. There is an outer trail in which you are a small-time rustler and you steal cows and horses and put your gang together. There are 32 real outlaws with biographies in this game. Critters stolen in one state need to be driven to another for sale.  They can be stolen from you on this journey. Once you have at least two gang members you can move to the inner trail where the banks and trains are. These are the same ones robbed by the Wild Bunch.  Interspersed throughout the board are &quot;Outlaw Fate&quot; squares.  When you land on these you take an Outlaw Fate card.  This is real history.  There are 192 of these cards and each card tells a story and the resulting board move.  They can either be good, bad or neutral to you. Once you have stolen a predetermined amount of money you can take the &quot;Final Trail&quot; to win the game.  Tom Horn is waiting for you and may be you'll make it and maybe your won't.<br/><br/>",

Imagine yourself at Wimbledon. The first thing is to get your serve in bounds and that is not as easy as it sounds...nor is it terribly difficult. More often than not your opponent will reach your serve and that's where the fun begins.<br/><br/>Where will you place your players? Can you plan two, three or even 4 moves ahead? Your opponent may hit a short lob with one die or try a passing shot with two dice. Don't get too close to the net. On the other hand don't be too far away. And all the while you're watching your position, your opponent will be trying to force you out of position.<br/><br/>There are two dice for each player so it's super fast moving... You'll have to think quickly on your feet. control your two players and your opponents two players and you'll win!<br/><br/>",

Serious fun for seriously fun loving adults who don't know when enough is enough!<br/><br/><br/>     Pucker and Suck * Forbidden Fruit * Touch and Feel * Girls on Top * Hide and Streak * Sardines * Call my Bluff * Cheek to Cheek * Hot and Bothered * and many more...<br/><br/><br/>From the introductory card:<br/><br/>&quot;This pack contains rules to 21 different late night games.<br/><br/>These games are perfectly suited to late-night revellers who just don't want the party to end: a few drinks have been drunk and inhibitions are starting to slip yet some people still have some sort of control over their limbs. These are games which encourage everyone to get to know each other just a little bit better. No-one would dream of playing them in the clear light of day of course, but market traders and merchant bankers alike all need to let their hair down sometimes and this is the ideal opportunity. So loosen your clothing and let's get playing!&quot;<br/><br/>A note to those easily offended:<br/><br/>The game titles (for the most part) are much more suggestive than the actual games (thought there are a few exceptions). For example, &quot;Pucker and Suck&quot; is simply a variation on the old &quot;Pass the orange by the neck&quot; party game using a credit card and your lips instead.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a generic game in which the players take turns at rolling a die and moving the hero (in this case: Batman &amp; Robin together) around the 28-space square board. The spaces on the board feature attacks from either one of two villains from the movie (Poison Ivy and Mr.Freeze), both villains conspiring together, rescues from (in the case of this movie) Batgirl and Robin's redbird, miss-a-turns and power-token power-ups. The object is to fight villains, a task which a player can only perform if in possession of a power token, to gain batman tokens. Once a player accumulates 6 batman tokens they win. Battle victory is determined through the use of two cards making winning a 50/50 chance.<br/><br/>This game is EXACTLY the same as the Batman Forever board game by Parker Brothers... except each game uses images/themes/villains from its respective movie.<br/>Its a game format that can be adopted by any feature film or comic etc.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets the same number of cards that will be played on the two receiver piles set up at the beginning of the game. Take your cards and make four piles and place them face up in front of you. Now it&acute;s going to get fun! Everyone races to play their cards on the receiver piles at the same time. But it&acute;s not just speed you need - you have to match colors and perform actions before you can play your cards. So, snap, clap, &amp; slap your way to being the first one to get rid of all of your cards and you win the game. But don&acute;t get caught making a &quot;goof&quot;, or you&acute;ll have to add to your cards, which will put you behind. Wild cards and stop cards add to the excitement.<br/><br/>Ages 7 and up.<br/><br/>",

And just suppose the captain can't hold his liquor and has headed back to his cabin to sleep it off.

Carnage introduces certain elements of humor to keep the game light-hearted.  A good deal of this game's audience is the convention going crowd and the designers purposely implemented tongue-in-cheek silliness to keep the game in perspective.<br/><br/>At the heart of the carnage battlefield is a reality-altering &quot;orb&quot; drawn along in a cart by two flamingo-dodoes.  The cart skips around the battlefield during the game causing random effects that help, hinder, annoy and amuse both sides.  Effects range from rain showers to muddy the ground and slow opponents to random teleportations.  Everything is all in the spirit of fun.<br/><br/>Overall, Carnage is a good, non-serious wargame that still requires some strategy to win.<br/><br/>",

Players assume the roles of rich influential men who try to make profits by exploiting and buying out the East German industry.<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of 16 rounds, in which each player takes a turn of action.  After every 4 rounds, the effects of the players' actions are asserted on the industry and their profits and losses are tallied.  Depending on the space their token lands on, players can undertake four types of actions.  They can buy an East German operation, getting it for free by impersonating as a former owner (the result of a good dice roll) or outbidding the other players in the resulting auction.  Usually, the followup action is to lay off the workers of these operations (at the expense of the industry) to increase profits.  Players can also increase profits by taking the action to grab the grants for rescuing the ecology of the ravaged industrial lands.  The last action is to negotiate with each other to manipulate the market to their benefits through threats, bargains, and bribes.  During the course of the game, cards are drawn that allow their owners to influence the effects of their actions or to affect their opponents'.<br/><br/>The game ends with the conclusion of the final (16th) round.  At that point, the players tally up their final assets and the one with the highest wealth wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Beginning at &quot;Start&quot;, the players move their token along the Honeymoon Trail and around the board according to the throw of the dice. When a player lands on a space, he follows the instructions printed on that space. &quot;Draw Fate Card&quot; spaces give the person playing a draw from the top of the deck. On each Fate card are instructions to be followed leaving the player to receive whatever Fate has to offer. In traveling around the board, there are four Divorce Steps. They must be landed on in order of their number before they are valid. As a player lands upon each Divorce Step in order, he receives a plastic chip to signify that he now has that Divorce step. Once a player receives all four Divorce steps, he loses the game. Play will continue until only one player remains who does not have all four Divorce steps. Once a player has all four Divorce steps, he is considered divorced and can no longer play.<br/><br/>",

This game takes its participants back to a period of cold war, the distrust and the first disarmament negotiations.<br/><br/>As speaker of a military power, each of the players tries to decrease the worldwide arsenal of weapons and perhaps to be the first one to reduce their arsenal to zero. Army, Air Force and Navy are repeatedly decimated. Some countries may have nuclear weapons, but nobody knows for sure. Conferences allow the search for a partner for a disarming agreement. If the negotiations fail, a one-sided disarmament might avoid a crisis.<br/><br/>If no agreement is made, then the arms race continues, and new weapons are purchased. If a country has disarmed too far, it may be easy prey for a power-hungry despot who doesn't care for world peace.<br/><br/>",

The 250 cards contain 3,000 questions and answers (all reviewed by a rabbi) in the following categories:  Yiddish, proverbs &amp; more!; Customs and holidays; History, Geography &amp; politics; Israel; Ancient and Biblical history; and Arts, sciences, entertainment &amp; sports.<br/><br/>Two or more persons or teams, aged 13 through adult can play TRADITION.  A player rolls the die and moves in either direction around the board, trying to land on one of 40 squares with values of 5, 10, 15, or 25 points.  The players must then answer a question correctly to move again, each time claiming the square and value.  Once all the squares are claimed, the points are added and the player or team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Some sample questions: (1) What does the Yiddish word &quot;nosh&quot; mean?

Operating on principles of compression discovered by Rene Descartes during the 17th century, Sea Diver is a flexible plastic tube about the size and shape of a 1 liter soda bottle. You fill the bottle with water and add aquarium gravel, salvage items (anchor, cannon, pistol, sextant, and lantern), and the diving bell. When you squeeze the bottle, the diving bell (looking like something Jacques Cousteau would carry on board the Calypso) descends to the bottom of the bottle while the claws on its bottom open. Release the pressure, and the claws close while the bell ascends to the top. Two games may be played...<br/><br/>Salvage Hunt: Be the first player to pick up, one at a time and in the correct order, the anchor, cannon, pistol, sextant, and lantern. The Sea Diver is passed from player to player, each getting one attempt, until a winner is determined.<br/><br/>Drop Anchor: A player brings the anchor to the top of the bottle, releases it, and tries to catch it before it touches the bottom. The player earns 1 point for each successful catch. The winner is the player with the most points after 10 tries.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dr. Busby is the first game to sell so many copies, that it is considered as having started the game craze in the United States.<br/><br/>HISTORY:<br/>According to the March 7, 1843 Salem Gazette newspaper, The Improved and Illustrated Game Of Dr. Busby was first published by W. &amp; S. B. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts and went on sale that date. In the May 1843 Boys and Girls magazine, the components of the first edition were described: a gold embossed thumb-hole cloth (maroon) case with printed instructions card (yellow) and four sets of 5 cards, each set outlined in a different color: brown for the Busby family, red for the Doll (the dairymaid) family, yellow for the Ninny-come-twitch family, and blue for the Gardner's family.<br/><br/>S(tephen). B. Ives continued to hold the Ives' games copyrights after he and his brother William dissolved the business in April, 1854 (as mentioned in William's newspaer, The Salem Observer).<br/><br/>Stephen's son, Henry P. Ives partnered with A. Augustus Smith to take over the business until Henry bought Smith out in 1861 according to the 1861 Salem directory.<br/><br/>Stephen, his son Henry, and elder son David (with a dry goods business in Boston) continued to publish the game until 1887 when the last remaining Ives' family member, Henry, sold the copyrights to George S. Parker.<br/><br/>During the interimum, editions were printed by the Ives' family with Milton Bradley labels, Henry P. Ives and Selchow &amp; Righter labels, S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow labels, and S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow and E. I. Horseman labels.<br/><br/>According to a letter many publishers were associated with Dr. Busby until 1886 but they really were purchasing and reselling Ives' published games.<br/><br/>In the 1890's McLoughlin Brothers ignored the copyright and put out there own version as did many other major American game manufacturers. That is why you see so many publishers of Dr. Busby in the 1890s.<br/><br/>George S(winterton) Parker made grandiose claims about the games he published which lead to a number of mistakes by historians who failed to go back to the primary sources when describing the history of Dr. Busby.<br/><br/>Consequently,  sParker Brothers rulebook...<br/><br/>&quot;This game was the first ever published in America, being brought out of Salem in 1840.&quot;<br/><br/>Anne Wales Abbot may have first made a prototype of Dr. Busby in 1840 but there are no primary sources to prove this is the case. It may be because the first edition that was published by W. &amp; S. B. Ives is called The Improved and Illustrated Game Of Dr. Busby. Before that published edition with an 1843 copyright, no other earlier editions have been found with or without a copyright date.<br/><br/>George S. Parker, in his 1895 edition of the board game, The Mansion Of Hapiness, made another incorrect claim. The game box cover states that The Mansion Of Happiness was the first board game published in America. There are at least three copies of F. &amp; R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through The United States (copyright 1882) and one copy of F. &amp;. R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through Europe in private and museum collections. So Parker was wrong in this claim too.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/>The game consists of 20 cards, divided into 4 families: the Busby Family, the Dairymaid's Family, the Ninnycometwitch Family, and the Gardener's Family. Each family has 5 members, for example the Busby Family consists of Dr. Busby, his Wife, Son, Servant and Dairymaid's black-eyed Lover.<br/><br/>The starting player begins by asking the player on his right for any card not in his own hand. If that player has the card he calls for, he gives it to him and the starting player may call for another card and so on until he calls for a card which the player doesn't have. Then the next player takes his turn, but must first call for those cards which have been called for and obtained by the first player. Thus it becomes a game of memory since any incorrect call ends a turn. When a player has called every card from the player on the right (thus putting that player out of the game), he may continue to call from the next player on the right. At the end of the game, the winner will have successfully called all the cards into his own hand.<br/><br/>",

The player on the right choses a number from 1-6 that will correspond to a word or phrase that will be in one of the categories above.  The category is revealed but the first player on the left has to ask questions that result in a yes or no answer whilst the sixty second timer is running.  If he/she gets the right answer then they win the card, if not then the next player on the left (and so on) can attempt to get the right answer until someone wins the cards.  Play continues for a previously agreed number of cards, with the question-master role being rotated, and the winner is the one who has won the most cards at the end.  Many of the answers can be quite obscure, such as: blade of grass, a monocle, a cindy doll...so it can be quite hard to gain the card within the first sixty seconds<br/><br/>",

The black has large numbers, while the red has a much smaller fleet of faster ships.  Speed is very important, since faster ships can retreat from combat from slower ones unless attackers move in from all six adjacent hexes. The red force also has battlecruisers, which have the speed of a cruiser and nearly the combat strength of a battleship. There is a blue fleet for a third player, identical to the red fleet.<br/><br/>In addition to spaceships, there are several types of ground forces with which to contend for control of systems.<br/><br/>The map has star systems scattered across it, and many nebulae, which slow movement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the inside cover page of the books:<br/><br/>&quot;The ARMATAC II system is a component system which allows the player to purchase books and playing pieces as they are needed, to recreate the battles and campaigns of World War II. The players create armies of different sizes and nationalities and must use all of the skill and knowledge of strategy they possess to defeat their opponents. Rules are provided on how to play the games, but these can be looked upon as guidelines. It will constantly be stressed that this is your system and the rules can be altered to suit your particular style of play. The games can be played as simple or complicated as you prefer. Because of the endless variety of combat situations which can be constructed, we hope players will never tire of the system.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We offer 5 books within the system, each one covering 300 weapons. There are 2 aircraft books, 2 naval books and 1 armor book. This means a total of 1,500 weapons are covered. A total of over 1,000,000 of these weapons were produced and we provide production figures for all of them. Our playing pieces are larger than those offered by other gaming companies and are presented in a variety of shapes which look like the weapons they have been chosen to represent. Our playing pieces are available in four different 4 color camouflage patterns. A national insignia sheet is also available in full color and contains over 500 insignias from over a dozen countries. When applied to the playing pieces, these insignias combined with the size, shape and camouflage patterns provide an air of realism and excitement never before attainable at the price they are offered.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because of the larger size of our playing pieces, it stands to reason our hexes must be larger to accommodate them. In keeping with our policy of non-restriction, a stencil is available within our system which allows the player to trace this hex pattern across any playing surface they choose. A readily available and inexpensive playing surface is poster board (22&quot; x 28&quot;). Two of these boards butted together make a good beginner size and three boards make a good overall size for any type of gaming activity. These boards can be left plain, or full color scenarios can be drawn on them prior to tracing the hex pattern. Even those players with limited artistic ability can create personalized scenarios with a little time and patience. Maps can be purchased of oceans, continents and individual countries. These maps are relatively inexpensive, are good size for gaming and make for an extremely attractive playing surface. County survey maps can also be acquired, as well as city and county street indexes for those who wish to engage in street fighting. A hex pattern sheet is also provided with our stencil which can be inexpensively reprinted at your local quickie printer.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A map or scenario can also be applied to a window shade and our design traced across it. The shade can be stretched across the playing area and retained at the ends while in use. For those with a permanent playing table, shade brackets can be attached to one edge of the table and the shade snapped in. The pull tab can be retained at the opposite edge with the aid of a nail. In this way the shade will rest squarely on the table top and remain taut. A variety of shades can be prepared and used as they are needed. This should be especially appealing for clubs. Games can also be played on non-hex surfaces by simply substituting inches for hex speed, which is contained in the WARGAME CHARTS. Remember, we will recommend how the games should be played, but the final decision is up to you.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The A spinner requires you to spend a fuel unit to use (you can refuel by landing on a planet). The B spinner only lets you drift 0 or 1 space. It is used if you are out of, or trying to conserve fuel. You might also spin an Explosion which causes you to lose all your fuel. Go to Pluto and return to your home planet first to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a simple childrens memory/matching game based on the Disney cartoon characters. The board is a slotted raised platform that sits in the box. The 24 Fluppy Dog cards each depict 2 dogs (an upper and a lower) of various colors. These cards are inserted into the board slots to hide the lower dogs. On your first turn you draw a card and keep it to start your chain. From then on when you draw a card, if the color of the lower (hidden) dog matches a color at either end of your chain, you connect it (ala dominoes). If the color does not match, you place it back in a board slot. Thus you need to remember where hidden Fluppy Dogs are put back so you can find the ones you need to make a color-match. The first player to collect 5 cards in his or her chain is the winner.<br/><br/>",

MAIN STREET, however, brings attention to downtown buildings, structures which, in the hustle and bustle of commercial life, escape the notice of even frequent passers-by.  Our illustrations show each style with its original storefront, but because storefronts are periodically remodeled, one is lucky to find historic storefronts intact.  MAIN STREET players will find themselves looking at the upper levels of commercial buildings to recognize styles they have learned in the game.<br/><br/>The range of styles in MAIN STREET from Federal to Art Deco/Modern, isn't intended to encompass the breadth of American Architectural history, but to represent some basic styles often used in commercial buildings between the late eighteenth and mid-twentieth centuries.<br/><br/>The eight building puzzles (nine pieces per puzzle) are used in five different games for 1 to 8 players Ages 5 and up.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The third Meta-Galactic War ended with the realization by the belligerent empires that over 70% of their fleets had been destroyed. The decimation of their fleets also forced the contraction of their outer boundaries. Fearing that hostilities would be resumed before they could rebuild their fleets, the empires mutually agreed to bar all warships heavier than a cruiser from these liberated or abandoned (depending on your viewpoint) areas. Spontaneously the deserters, criminals, and other opportunists rose to fill this void. By preying on commercial ships and providing availability to now unobtainable or illegal items, they amassed great fortunes and others died in poverty or on the gallows.<br/><br/>War of the Star Slavers is a simulation of these violent times. As an empire player you must protect your commerce and prevent unrest among your populace so that you can rebuild your fleets. You must also protect yourself against the other empire as it is in his interest to see your economy fall apart as much as it is to defeat you on the field of battle.<br/><br/>The Slaver players must amass a fortune and retire before they are apprehended. The Slaver must pay for fuel, his crew, repairs on his ship, etc.<br/><br/>In other words every turn costs him money, but he can obtain large amounts of money by dealing in contraband or illegal acts. The greater the chance he takes the greater his return will be.<br/><br/>You can make any deals you like with whomever you choose. Anything you can get away with is valid. No act is too vile, no deal too dishonest.<br/><br/>",

With a roll of the dice each player is whisked away on a journey to discover his or her special personalized fortune.  Collect, win, lose or buy LOVE, MONEY, PEOPLE and Question cards in this fun and exciting game where all players win a real personalized fortune card reading of their own.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Each player rolls the die, moves his or her pawn, and then does what the landed on square tells them to.  This is almost always either gaining or losing fortune telling cards (from four different decks - love, money, people, and questions) or empowering stones (which can be traded in for fortune telling cards).  The rules state that the &quot;object is for each player to collect as many fortune telling cards as possible&quot;; but they also state that the winner &quot;is the player who draws the last card,&quot; which ends the game and allows that player to discard up to three of their cards.<br/><br/>The real purpose is for each player to use the cards collected during the game to have their personal fortune told on the tarot-style card layout board.<br/><br/>If you believe in this stuff, you'll be happy to know that &quot;all Jennifer Sands products are created with the assistance of professional psychics, fortune tellers and astrologers.  All Jennifer Sands products use safe fortune telling methodologies.&quot;<br/><br/>If you don't believe in this stuff, you'll note &quot;this product is for entertainment purposes only.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Points are collected as you collect ingredient tokens. The game ends when the first player has collected all 5 ingredients. Movement is determined by dice roll with each player taking turns to have one minute (a sand timer is provided) to move and accomplish as much as they can.<br/><br/>The spaces on the board dictate the activities to be undertaken on them. These include:<br/>- collecting an ingredient, <br/>- pausing for a cup of tea (rolling until you get a 2),<br/>- answering questions (cookery related - involving choosing your answer from a choice of four) or <br/>- performing an action - stir the pan, roll the pastry, chop the herbs or toss the pancake (the equipment for which is all included with the game)<br/><br/>",

He took the globe, which he named the Moonstone, back to his tower. Using the powers of the Moonstone, King Gambrel ruled long and wisely; however, four of his bravest knights became obsessed with the Moonstone and conspired to steal it.<br/>King Gambrel discovered the plot, and using the Moonstone's supernatural powers he transformed the four knights into Dark Riders whose eternal task is to protect the Moonstone.<br/>Recently, the Moonstone was rediscovered, still sealed away where King Gambrel had left it under the watchful eyes and powerful swords of the four Dark Riders. Only the most brave knights may challenge the Dark Riders for the possession of the Moonstone.&quot;<br/>Dark Riders is similar to Pachisi or Sorry!, with mechanics in the rules to create blockades, or to send opponents back to &quot;start&quot;. Your goal is to get to the tower in the center of the board, retrieve the Moonstone, and return it to your starting corner of the board while avoiding the Dark Riders and the other players.<br/><br/>",

Like other games in the series, it comes in a large matchbox-like container and has nice miniature scoring pads and pencils. The main equipment are eight six-sided dice with a single letter on each face (3 of the dice have one blank face).<br/><br/>From the instructions:<br/><br/>&quot;Words  (any number of players)<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of rounds and each round needs to be timed. Usually one minute per round is adequate but this can be shortened / extended if preferred.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to throw the eight dice. When the dice have stopped rolling, the round begins. The object is to make as many words, of three letters or more, as possible, from the other letters thrown.<br/><br/>Letters can only be used once per word. Blanks can be any letter from word to word. Pronouns and plurals are not allowed.<br/><br/>Players write the words constructed onto the score pad provided and at the end of each round, the score is calculated and added to each player's cumulative total. Points are scored as follows:<br/><br/>3 letter word - 1 point<br/>4 letter word - 2 points<br/>5 letter word - 3 points<br/>6 letter word - 5 points <br/>7 letter word - 7 points<br/>8 letter word - 10 points<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to score 100 points, or whatever other total is pre-agreed by the participating players.&quot;<br/><br/>",

So for example rolling a 1, 2 and 4, you could jump to 1, then 2, 3 (2+1), 4, 5 (4+1), 6 (4+2), and finally to 7 (1+2+4) all in one go.<br/><br/>The advanced game lets you subtract numbers as well as add them, but in fact this makes the game easier and quicker.<br/><br/>With even more advanced rules you add multiplication and division.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HITTING THE WALL is a simple roll and move boardgame with the theme of running the Marathon.<br/><br/>The board is divided into three parts <br/>- an outer training circuit<br/>- the Marathon course<br/>- The &quot;Wall&quot;<br/><br/>Players have one playing piece which is used on the training circuit and Marathon course, and a counter which is used when they &quot;Hit the Wall&quot;.  Each player is also provided with a training schedule on which their training progress is recorded.<br/><br/>Players start the game by undertaking training which is conducted on the training circuit.  They complete one lap of the training circuit, based on the results of dice rolls.  The type of square landed on (e.g. hill training, training injury, new shoes etc..) is recorded on the training record, so that by the time that training is completed players will have had differing experiences as a result of their training.<br/><br/>Once all players have completed their training the Marathon race itself commences.  Play progresses one throw at a time with penalties being dictated by the square on which the piece lands.  Some penalties apply to all players, others only if the penalty is applicable to one of the events experienced during training (e.g.  &quot;Into the wall for injury&quot; would only apply to a player who had been injured during training.)  Once the penalty is spent the training incident is canceled on the training record.<br/><br/>Many of the penalties involve &quot;hitting the wall&quot; -  that part of the Marathon where running becomes particularly difficult and you wonder whether it is all worthwhile.  In the game this represented by having to complete a circuit of the 20 space &quot;wall&quot;.  The main playing pieces remains where it is on the Marathon circuit and the other counter is used to mark progress around the wall.  Once the wall has been overcome the player may continue moving the runner on the Marathon track.  The wall can be beaten by doing a complete circuit of the 20 spaces or by sacrificing any combination of two benefits (20 milers, hill training, drinks station) earned during the training session.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to reach the finish of the Marathon.<br/><br/>",

The pieces are reversible and therefor give you 212 total pieces. The board is shaped like a hexagon and has reversible game pieces in nine different shapes. The game also comes with stylus with different ends to use as a placement and removal tool, a rulebook and Finally, you get an easel and a picture hanger to display your masterpiece after you have finished playing the game.<br/><br/>The game basis itself on the saying of &quot;Is Magnetic Dimensions a game or is it art?&quot;  The answer in the manual to both of these questions is an unequivocal yes.  Although in the rule book there are lots of options on how to play the game, it leaves it as an open form.  You basically first take a piece and place it on the game board, and subsequently add another piece, then another and so on, until you have created your own design, or one of the shapes/designs shown in the Game manual.  A Magnetic dimensions game takes as long as you need to create your picture through the use of all or some of the pieces.<br/><br/>Primarily the game is designed for one player, however there are several options/ideas for a 2 player game.  For a two player version of the game you can allocate a certain number of pieces to each player, and then give a time limit on building something using opposite sides of the gaming board.  Or you can have one design built, and then the other player tries to build it in the same amount of time or less.<br/><br/>The game has limitless options, and is a fun and relaxing game, as you create and challenge yourself within the game.  You will see that there are many unique and very complicated ways you can create.  This game has thousands of options that make players get deeply involved consumed by it.<br/><br/>In the end you will have to ask yourself... &quot;Is it a game or is it Art?&quot;  In the end it really is both!<br/><br/>",

Players' planes move along tracks that can be tailwinds or headwinds (increasing or decreasing speed), keeping track on a 'log book' sheet.  Occasionally, a mission card may be a Wild Card, with special instructions.  The board is a map of Australia divided into 'sections'.  The objective of the game is to complete one mission in each section and return to the player's Home Base.<br/><br/>The Royal Flying Doctor Service began in Queensland in 1928, and was developed on a national basis during the 1930's.  The service provides people of the Inland medical aid in emergencies, as well as comprehensive health care and community service.  The Service today covers more than five million square kms, an area as large as Western Europe.  The box states: &quot;The Royal Flying Doctor Service is a beneficiary of this game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sigma Omega is two games in one: a tactical space combat system and an associated campaign system.<br/><br/>The tactical game uses three-dimensional Newtonian mechanics - every turn, each ship gets an acceleration on each axis which is added to the previous velocity. There are acceleration and maneuvering limits. Fighters are given the ability to alter facing somewhat independently of velocity, which affects combat - there is a section of invented maneuver combinations such as the &quot;Cauchy Spiral.&quot;<br/><br/>The campaign game can be facilitated by a moderator, who creates a map and adjudicates the moves. There are rules for production, planetary invasion, and fairly complex rules for ship design if players do not like the twenty or so provided.<br/><br/>According to the rules, the game was originally &quot;a set of guidelines for a computer simulation,&quot; which is apparent from the amount of arithmetic involved. In addition to the rulebook, counters, base ships (which must be cut out), and fighter sighting templates (ditto), the game includes an order sheet of programs for Texas Instruments calculators which would implement various game calculations.<br/><br/>",

There is no penalty for getting the answer wrong.<br/><br/>The question categories are:<br/><br/>Orange - History &amp; This And That<br/>Yellow - People<br/>White - Places<br/>Green - Showbiz<br/>Blue - Best of British luck<br/>Red - Sport<br/>Brown - Up The Creek<br/><br/>The questions for Sport, History &amp; This &amp; That, People, Places and Showbiz all require straight answers to a straight forward question.<br/><br/>The questions for the Best of British luck are in a different format with 6 different types available - Multiple Choice, Odd Man Out, Missing Letters, Anagrams, Whereabouts, and Draw - with the last four of these categories being conducted against a 30 second timer.<br/><br/>'Up The Creek' is a special category that asks the player to perform an activity rather than answer a question. If the player fails to carry out the activity to the satisfaction of the other players, or refuses to even try, he or she has to move backwards three spaces.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to complete a circuit of the track around the board.<br/><br/>",

An information card for each area provides details of the kind of assistance required and the types of trained personnel required to provide it - this varies from region to region.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to move their &quot;Community Leader&quot; around the outer circuit of the board the number of spaces determined by the roll of either one or two dice. In so doing the players collect (and on occasion lose) a variety of Community workers, Medics, Technicians, Teachers and Social workers. The directions in the spaces also initiate good or bad events in the region.<br/><br/>At various points on the board these helpers can be used to develop part of their village. The player developing the Sahel Belt, for example, will need to construct a safe water supply, Milk Processing Plant, Health Care Center, School etc... Construction requires then right compliment of experts and may also cost points which are earned through completing circuits of the board.<br/><br/>The construction undertaken and equipment purchased is represented on the board by a series of jig-saw pieces which are placed within a frame that is positioned over the game board. The pieces can be added into the frame in any order, but successful redevelopment of a village will require a total of 11 pieces.<br/><br/>The winner is the player that is first to have successfully reconstructed his or her village by covering the developing area with 11 reconstruction pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We are partners in the TK&amp;RL Transport Business, with our own lines of trains and trucks for collecting and delivering various goods to Mr. Big's coastal warehouses. Mr. Big pays us well for everything we bring in plus bonuses for filling each warehouse. The risks are great, what with the roads and rails getting wiped out by snow storms and rock slides, not to mention government cutbacks leaving the infrastructure in dangerous shape. Only partners with nerves of steel and alert brains need apply for the job. If you have what it takes, join us in a railway and trucking adventure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of a deck of cards with letters on them. There are black letters, red letters and 2 special joker cards (which can be used as any letter).<br/><br/>Each player in turns flips over the top card of the deck and puts it in the play ares (visible for all players). The first player who is able to form a word (minimum length : 4 letters) with the revealed cards, gains points. The longer the word, the more points are scored. There's a bonus if the word is entirely made of letters of the same color.<br/><br/>You play until you reach a number of points agreed upon before play starts.<br/><br/>",
