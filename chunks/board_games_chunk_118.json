        "description": "Switzerland must be Swallowed! was re-released in 2007 as Switzerland must be Conquered!, a downloadable PnP game. The rules were expanded (12 pages rather than the original 8), the combat resolution system changed (and slightly simplified), and the counter sheet re-organised &amp; expanded (strength markers used by the old combat system were eliminated, while Fortification and additional unit counters were added).<br/><br/>Switzerland must be Conquered! is a hypothetical simulation of the planned assault on Switzerland by Nazi Germany during World War 2. Players represent the military high commands directing their forces during what was sure to be a trying fortnight for all concerned. Fortunately for the German player, Adolf Hitler is busy elsewhere and will not interfere with your battle plans.<br/><br/>",

In order to save him and to gain a never ending grant from him, you will travel through the Theben Necropolis to the Karnak Temple Complex and, in the end, you will enter the Royal Palace to defeat the conspirators! The setting, philological correct, reproduce the real story told in the Judicial Papyrus of Turin, held in the Egyptian Museum of Turin.<br/><br/>To cross the Nile and get to the next area you need to get enough power, fame and wealth to gain a level and the pertaining title; you can increase those stats by com pleating a specific quest or by chance, slot by slot, by facing the card(s) you will draw: only if you have the right title you can enter the Temple or the Royal Palace!<br/><br/>During the game you can trade with other characters simply being in the same spot, but beware of the hired assassin hiding among you. At the beginning of the game, each player draw one of the eight tiles from a sack and hide it to others: the bloody tile changes your goal from save to slay the Pharaoh. When the hired assassin meets another character, he/she can choose to kill the other character or to pretend to be like anyone else.<br/><br/>",

On their turn, they roll a die, move their marker by the result, and can ask another player for one letter of their word. Players get points for guessing another player's secret word.

The cards have pictures of die rolls, but the frequency of the numbers does not quite match the statistical likelihood of rolling those numbers on 2D6. For example, there are equal numbers of sixes, sevens, and eights.<br/><br/>To play, players turn over cards and hope to get certain numbers and avoid others, just as in Craps. Once a card is turned over, it remains face up for the remainder the player's turn, which slightly affects the statistical probability of finding another card with the same number.<br/><br/>",

Players bid for control of one of six different ships on the board using a hidden bidding system that simultaneously determines how far that boat may move on that turn. The object is to pick up 'patients' in specific cities and deliver them to your own designated areas - but you have to be careful what you choose to carry because you may not be able to retain control of that boat on the next turn. Safely delivered patients reward players with varying amounts of dubloons and the player with the most dubloons at the end of the game (after there are no patients left in need of transport) is the winner.<br/><br/>There is also a small deck of 'Arkel' cards which players can acquire during the game and use for different one-off effects such as movement bonuses or cash bonuses. The Arkel cards also include facts and anecdotes about the history of the Reinier van Arkel Group.<br/><br/>",

The red die is for moving the Maik-and-Maik token, from the white dice the active player selects one result for him/herself and moves his/her token accordingly, then the other players chose the remaining dice results.<br/>The racing track contains shortcuts and spaces on which an effect card has to be drawn. Most of these have negative effects (having to move back, changing place with the last player etc.). Other spaces get you a heart token and allow all other players to look at one of the movie cards. Remembering which movie card is where allows players to take shortcuts.<br/>Heart tokens can be used to allow players to move fewer spaces than the die roll dictates, to turn over an additional movie card when trying to take a shortcut, or to ask other players for help with finding the right movie card.<br/><br/>",

The taxi fee is determined by counting the spaces between the destination and the current location of the taxi car. Now, all the players must reach their destinations on the map by throwing two 6-sided dice and moving according to them on the board. When a customer reaches his destination, the player must pick up a red destination card: Will the customer be able to pay after all? Or will he even tip you some extra? Or maybe rob you of half of your money?<br/><br/>After successfully completing a trip, the players return to a taxi station to pick up a new customer.

This fog destroys everything in its path, leaving behind it a world plunged into chaos. Nobody knows the exact extent of the damage. The Fog concentrates as it settles over the areas it hits, making them dangerous, almost impassable, and infested with threatening mutants.<br/><br/>Indeed, the vast majority of the population seems to have been infected by the Fog. Those who were not killed have been contaminated to the point of transforming into violent and ruthless creatures with superhuman abilities. Their only motivation appears to be the constant hunt of the survivors.<br/><br/>Will you survive the Fog, unpredictable and ever changing, throughout the 12 scenarios of the game? Getting out of this tainted and contaminated Boston will not be an easy task.<br/><br/>Embody one of the brave survivors of the cataclysm: John (&ldquo;The Eye&rdquo;), the criminal with unerring accuracy; B-Mama, the paranoid, baseball-bat-wielding couch potato in need of anger management; Smokey, the specialist in maintaining the more dangerous parts of the city&rsquo;s underbelly; or Mia, the prodigy chemistry student.<br/><br/>Together, you will progress across the modular gameboard, searching for equipment, swapping objects with one another, looting chemical storage facilities in order to mix up concoctions for various uses, and most of all, fight the Fog and the mutants it created.<br/><br/>Be careful where you step: The Fog is thicker in some more contaminated areas, rife with mutants &mdash; stronger mutants. In order to avoid contamination, or a worse fate, you will also need to anticipate what surprises the Fog holds for you next, as you search or fumble through the map tiles darkened by its presence.<br/><br/>By making use of clandestine Bio-Hacker labs, you will be able to create cocktails of chemical reagents to suit any purpose: decontaminating areas; healing or decontaminating yourselves; attacking, freezing, confusing, or even controlling mutants! Best of all, though, is to kill them before they can fight back through nasty dice combos and special abilities, such as accelerated mutation, teleportation, regeneration, or contamination.<br/><br/>Enjoy an even more immersive experience by using the ZNA App, which provides game help, interactive scenarios, a map editor, storytelling, and more! Hack BioCorp&rsquo;s Drones, and scan map tiles using augmented reality through your smartphone or tablet.<br/><br/>Discover the different game modes: Adventure, Siege, Escape, and all their original mechanisms.<br/><br/>Survive an epic story in a devastated urban environment.<br/><br/>Welcome to ZNA!<br/><br/>",

Well the fight back starts here! Some will fall in the upcoming battle, but if you bring together the ultimate Geek Army, you will take over the world (game night). Come the GEEK REVOLUTION!<br/><br/>This game has been designed to be played at a game night or convention. Your job is to build the best geek army you can. Each player starts with a hand of cards. On your turn you must do the following actions in order. Draw or Pick Back, then Place and finally Discard. Do each action only once then play passes to player to your left. This continues until a player &ldquo;Goes Out&rdquo; by having no cards in there hand.<br/><br/>At the end of the game calculate your score by adding the value of each set in your army together (the cards face up in front of you).<br/>Then minus the value of any sets you have left in your hand. Each of the 10 sets of Geek Cards, have a value based on the number of them you have collected.<br/><br/>The large number indicates how many points in total a set of this type of Geek is worth. The twist is that each set does not necessarily become worth more with the more of that type you have.<br/><br/>The player who wins the game gets to use their new geek powers (meta game effects like picking who makes drinks, or what game the group plays next.) You might want to play again just so you don't have to make the drinks for the rest of the event.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A drinking-style game that parodies the Pokemon CCG.  Each player starts with one monster in play and 4 more in hand.  On your turn, you take 2 actions -- attack or play a new monster.  The attacks have humorous flavor text but mechanically just do a fixed amount of damage.  Better attacks can only be used after you have 'powered up' a certain number of times -- you power up once each turn by doing some out-of-game task agreed upon ahead of time (e.g. drinking or smoking).  The last player with creatures still in play wins.<br/><br/>Description from the designer:<br/><br/>The trading card game that's a little bit hazy.<br/><br/>Smoke 'em Mon is a multiplayer battle game where the objective is to kill all your friends smokies (monsters) and become the Grand Champion Master Sensei. To &quot;Power Up&quot; each player is subjected to smoking, drinking or whatever other tempting tortures your friends can dream up.<br/><br/>Smoke 'em Mon the trading card game features the first 101 smokies known to man and can be played with 2 to 99 players. Thanks to the special &quot;Anything Goes&quot; game rule battles can go in any direction at any time!<br/><br/>",

Sorry.<br/><br/>The object is pretty straightforward. Be the last survivor...and ensure your (so-called) 'friends' are ridden down first. How? You do this by throwing innocents under the hooves of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in order to slow them down.<br/><br/>Decks of cards contain the Horsemen: Death, Famine, War and Pestilence, and their Horses. They have arrived on Earth at the End of Days hell-bent on bringing doom and gloom to the world. Everything else in the game is designed to help you survive. For a time, at least.<br/><br/>Delay Cards are many and varied. They comprise the bulk of the game and include such things as hippies, a school bus, a beached whale, your grandmother, nurses, farmers, a basket of puppies...basically anything you can throw in front of the Horsemen to stop them from reaching you.<br/><br/>There are also Effect Cards, which include actions such as Swap, Shield, Force, and more. These cards allow a player to steal another player's defenders, or to turn a Horseman back against the previous player, or to force a player to put down any Horseman/Horse card in their hand.<br/><br/>According to the game's designer, Mark Lawrence, &quot;the game is all about recklessly laying down innocent lives to eke out your own miserable survival, but to win you have to do it effectively. Each Horseman of the Apocalypse is unique. It&rsquo;s going to take something very different to slow down Pestilence than to slow down Famine. If Death and War are both riding your way, throw the Diplomat under War&rsquo;s hooves and the Doctor under Death&rsquo;s, not the other way around.&quot;<br/><br/>",

You start the game by &quot;building the game&quot; with the wooden jig-saw pieces. You roll the die and take that many pieces, then you place them on the table, creating one long path. That is the path you then will play the game on. <br/>Then the game actually starts. You roll the die and move your game pawn that many spaces. The character you land on (5 different ones) decides which of the (5 different) piles you get to take a card from. The cards have different Disney characters on them, and there are three different ones to collect in each family. To make it a little harder every character is cut in two pieces. When you've collected all three characters (which is a total of 6 cards) of the same family (there are 5 different families, hence the 5 different card piles) you've won the game. <br/>The different families are Donald (Donald, Daisy, Scrooge), Mickey (Mickey, Goofy, Pluto), Snow White (Snow White, The Queen, Dopey),, Bambi (Bambi, Thumper, Flower) and The Jungle Book (Mowgli, Baloo, Bagheera).<br/><br/>",

A Fun Game To Test Your Knowledge Of Scotland And The Scots.&quot;<br/><br/>We're the Scots! can be played either by individuals competing against one another, or teams of players competing against one another. ... Play commences with the first questioner (the player on the immediate right of the starting player) drawing the first card from the end of the pack which displays the photo-image. The starting player is then asked the 6 questions on that card in sequence. The questions are graded by degree of perceived difficulty from 1 to 6. The points awarded for correct answers correspond to the number of the question, i.e. question one scores 1 point, question two scores 2 points, question three scores 3 points, etc. ...<br/>On all cards Question 4 (highlighted in yellow) relates to the illustration on the facing side. When it comes to this question, the questioner should read from the card, then hold up the illustration to provide the answering player with a clear view. ... Players should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to answer each question in their own time. Nevertheless, when an answer does not appear to be forthcoming, the questioner may introduce a time-limit using the one-minute timer provided in the game. A player who is unable to supply an answer within the period forfeits the points for that question....<br/>The winning player is the one achieving the highest score.

        "description": "Trick'in the grid is a trick-taking abstract strategy game that involves capturing cards on a board to play in tricks.  It is played with a regular deck of playing cards, and two jokers, and a 4 by 4 grid that has each space holding a card face up.<br/><br/>The cards are dealt out face up and in the basic game, the players simultaneously look over the board and the first player who places their piece on the board determines the Trump suit by where they place their piece.  That player then needs to score more points than their opponent to win the round, or their opponent wins the round.  Game can play a set number of rounds or to a set number of points.  In the advanced variant of the game (recommended using after players played the game a few times), players would bid points in order to be able to determine Trump, to place their piece first, and also move first.<br/><br/>The basic play mechanics consist of players moving like a chess rook, not through an enemy piece, and landing on a card to play it. The card the player lands on is removed from the grid and played like it would out of a hand in a regular trick-taking game.  After the first player moved, their opponent must move to a card with the same suit as moved to if they can.  After this initial move and following by the two players, who won the trick is determined.  The player who won the trick then would then move before their opponent, making it possible for a player to get two moves in a row.  Player who wins the trick keeps all cards played for trick, and scores them at the end of the round/hand.<br/><br/>Scoring for a round (cards dealt onto the 4x4 grid), consists of 1 point per trick won.  In addition, if a player happened to win more cards in a suit than any other suit they won, the player scores one point for each of the cards in the suit they won of the most cards in.  In the case of where a player has had at least two suits tie for the most cards they won in it, then the player doesn't score any bonus points.  This score for the round is only used to determine if the player won the round.<br/><br/>",

Whatever the case, it falls to you to restore order. Work with a team of zoo keepers to return the animals to their habitats.<br/><br/>Zoo Keeper is a cooperative card drafting and set collection game for 3-7 zoo keepers. The goal is simple: work through the entire deck, collecting sets of animals so that no zoo keeper exceeds his hand limit (usually six cards).<br/><br/>Play starts with the player who most recently visited a zoo and works clockwise. It will likely be advantageous to shuffle the cards thoroughly before play begins. Each round, or &ldquo;card drafting phase&rdquo;, one zoo keeper draws cards equal to the number of zoo keepers in your team.<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of the available cards and passes the cards clockwise. The last card goes to the last zoo keeper. Players place their chosen cards face up on the table in front of them. These cards are considered your &ldquo;hand&rdquo;. Zoo keepers look to create sets of two to five cards. Each card features two numbers.  The upper left number is the number needed to complete a set. The upper right number is how many of the card are in the deck. (The number 3/2 means that players must first collect a set of 3 before a set of 2.) Collect sets to free up your hand. Most cards also describe an action that is taken when a set is collected. Zoo keepers may win by collecting a specific set of cards (which varies based on the number of players in the game) or by working through the deck without any zoo keeper exceeding his hand limit (usually 6 cards). If any zoo keeper exceeds his hand limit before the deck runs out, zoo keepers are defeated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Sixties race game from Whitman has a very unusual mechanism for determining how far a player can move. This is an 8&quot; long blue plastic paddle, shaped like a rounded diamond with handle. A small red ball is attached to the end of the paddle by a 4&quot; string. There are six holes in the paddle, five in an arc at the 4&quot; limit of the string, and one in the center near the nose.<br/><br/>Each player swings the paddle in an effort to get the ball through one of the holes. The easiest, in the center, is a move of 1. Values increase toward the edges, with 2 and 3 partway and 4 and 5 on the edges. The hole near the nose is worth two free turns.<br/><br/>While the board box shows a map of the United States, the board itself is an abstract grid allowing orthogonal and diagonal moves. Black dots are obstacles that force a player to stop and then go around. Landing on a dot of your own color allows a free move in any direction. Landing on another player's color allows that player to move you one in a direction of his choice. First to cross the board wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This party game is similar to other UPL drawing games like Beetle and Gooffy, but is slightly more creative. Each player receives a sheet with 12 head-and-shoulder outlines in numbered squares. The game is intended to be played by partners at a table of four or six.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling a die. When either partner rolls a six, both are allowed to draw a nose on the first face on their cards. Thereafter, each player rolls only his own result, adding a hat on a 5, mouth on a 4, neckwear or an eyebrows on a 3, and an eye on a 2. The cards include 10 suggestions for hats, and say neckwear can be ties or bows for men and necklets or brooches for ladies.<br/><br/>As soon as one player completes a picture, he calls &quot;Beauties&quot; and players record a score for that round. Each feature is worth the same number of points as the die number required to draw it. When playing with multiple tables, the two highest scoring players move to the next table, and the lowest-scoring player rolls first in the next round. The game ends after a maximum of 12 rounds (when each card is filled up), and the winner is the player with the most total points.<br/><br/>The rules note that winners are most likely at tables where the players cooperate in throwing the die as quickly as possible, which &quot;we may add causes riotous laughter and excitement&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Player picking the most key cards at end of game wins the round. Each player can check off the score pad the capital they claim. In event of tie player with their home capital wins. Ties are very rare in the 252 test games from our 2 working prototypes. Only a few. The game is very exciting and has 6 special effects that can turn the game even more exciting. Ages 7-seniors even a 4 yr old can play. Very popular with children that when they got the first prototype they play 30 times in a few week period and most rounds last 45-60 minutes average. Special effects occur 20-30 times a round when the two effects match on the dice. 2 regular dice, 2 special effect dice, 6 prop planes on stands, 50 key cards, score pad of 50 states check list. Great thing about the game is not needing to answer the questions but a memorization of the key card(s) of each state capital. It is a fun race game to collect most capitals. Object is to stay away from the long routes needed to get to the capitals. It is normal to have more than one card in your hand due to the extra key and steal a key effect.<br/><br/>",

Cards will be one of three types - list in alphabetical order starting with a specific letter, pick a partner and try to name as many as the card requests, or list as many as you can by yourself in a limited amount of time.<br/><br/>There is no winning or losing in the cooperative game. In the competitive game, if someone fails to answer correctly or think of a response, the last player who did answer correctly keeps the card.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most cards at the end of the game wins, however, the rules don't actually say when the game ends so players should decide that among themselves.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game, each player independently selects whether they will play at the easy (tourist), medium (pathfinder), or hard (native) difficulty level.    The goal is to correctly answer questions and be the first player to reach the &quot;Global Animal Congress&quot; (located off the east coast of Australia) with five collected trivia cards.<br/><br/>Traveling by dice-roll, players move their tokens along paths defined by real-world animal migration routes; side routs and branching paths allow for strategic movement.  Upon landing on a question space, players get to answer a question from either an Animal or World card.<br/><br/>The 75 Animal cards each have a custom piece of artwork on the front depicting the animal in question and one trivia question for each of the three difficulty levels (usually in the form of true/false, multiple choice, and direct answer, respectively).  A correct answer awards the card to the player; some spaces on the board can later cause cards to be lost or stolen.  The 15 World cards work similarly, although they all share identical artwork.<br/><br/>Special spaces on the travel paths allow players to jump around the board, steal cards, lose cards, and gain/lose a turn.  The rule book contains variant instructions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mini Hexchess is an adaptation of the larger 91-cell &quot;Hexagonal Chess&quot; game by the same designer. (The designer notes that, although developed independently, the rules to his larger game are very similar to Glinski's Hexagonal Chess.) The mini game was created in response to a challenge posted on ChessVariants.com.<br/><br/>The game plays like orthodox chess, except the usual moves are interpreted as follows: Orthogonal moves cross hex edges. Diagonal moves follow hex corners, &quot;jumping&quot; over the connecting edges -- moving through spaces of the same color.<br/><br/>Unlike orthodox chess, this game has no castling, no pawn double-move, nor a corresponding en passant capture. This mini game has no queen, so a pawn is not allowed to promote to one.<br/><br/>Each player begins with 5 pawns, a king, a knight, a bishop, and a rook.<br/><br/>",

This 19th Century gambling game uses Black Peter as a theme for a roll-and-move race with particularly nasty penalty spaces.<br/><br/>The board has a 70-space track, with 28 square spaces around the edge of the board, and then two concentric rings of spaces (large and illustrated 33-44, small colored spaces 45-68) with 69 and 70 along with Black Peter in the center.<br/><br/>The game can be played by any number and uses two dice. Anyone who rolls double 1 or 2 gets to roll again. There is an initial ante, and various spaces call for fines to be paid or bonuses received, either to/from the pot or other players. Spaces 12, 21, 25 and 28 make players go back to 5.<br/><br/>Anyone who lands on 35 must take the Black Peter token and is out of the game, while other spaces give players a black token - and three black tokens also eliminate the player. Any player that runs out of money along the way is eliminated too. First player to 70 collects the pot.<br/><br/>",

And, unlike any other game in the series, this came in two editions that are distinctly different - a World Wildlife Fund promotional edition, and an edition celebrating Finland's 75th anniversary of independence in 1992. The box front of the latter is in portrait orientation, which is also unique in the series.<br/><br/>Kaupunkipelit is a series of games, each of which is basically a light version of Monopoly localized to a city/region of Finland. The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.<br/><br/>The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:<br/><br/>-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.<br/>-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.<br/>-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.<br/>-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.<br/><br/>",

Players randomly draw these one by one (optionally rejecting or exchanging tiles), aiming to form them into words, which are scored by length. A few special tiles result in extra draws or a lost tile. When all tiles have been drawn or no player wishes to draw any more, the game ends and unplayed tiles result in a penalty.<br/><br/>As an advanced variant, the game suggests only allowing words that fit a certain theme, such as &quot;sports and games&quot;, &quot;culture and entertainment&quot;, &quot;animals and nature&quot;, &quot;geography&quot; or &quot;names&quot;.<br/><br/>",

You have now also become new colonists who want to tame the landscape and make it your new home.<br/><br/>Each colonizer works to create their settlement town and grow its prestige by adding to it.  Colonists build new parts of their small town and expand it into a large city, to build their reputation as being the greatest pioneer of the land.<br/><br/>You must build your town into a glorious city before others colonize the new land first and become its new king.  Be wary of other pioneers though, for they want to become the new king of Runikend too.<br/><br/>The colonizers will attack other pioneer villages before they are built into big cities, and raze their new buildings to the ground.  The pioneer king-to-be must conquer their enemies before they are attacked and defeated by them.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:<br/>Grow the reputation of your settlement to attract more inhabitants and grow a village into a large city to become the new King of Runikend.  Reputation is earned by adding prominent structures and other notable parts to your settlement that have prestige value.  You win the game and become the King of Runikend if you have built a large city (earning 30 prestige points or more) at any point during the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The player will become a polar bear, who will have to overcome virus and disease, escape from pursuit of Inuit, and arrive to Greenland as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>The difference between 1st and 2nd editions of &quot;Take Care of Polar Bears&quot; are the following:<br/><br/>1. All artwork is changed<br/>2. Adding new 4 characters<br/>3. Adding unique roles for new characters and modifying rules<br/>4. Change of winning goal<br/>5. Adding a new story of the game<br/>6. Change of the design of all components<br/><br/>The overall difference with the first edition is that the new characters appear and new rules are added, the change of the existing character's abillity/rules, and also adding a story.<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the remaining deck and set it face-down between all players. A discard pile exists beside it. The player to the dealer's left has first turn.<br/><br/>For each turn, players draw up to 4 cards (the hand limit) from the deck (or discard pile, or both), and play any number of Weapon cards into the spaces below the 3 Emoji cards that (and only if they) list them. When all Weapons listed on an Emoji have been played, flip it over, as it is dead, and place the weapons used to kill it under the discard pile, to be reused later. If a player is unable to play a Weapon on an Emoji during a turn, one must be played on an opponent's Emoji of his or her choice. If neither are possible, the player must show his or her hand to all. To end a turn, 1 card is discarded (if possible). If the deck exhausts, reuse the discard pile.<br/><br/>Use Special Action cards by playing them onto the discard pile (from where they may not be drawn).<br/><br/>The first to kill all of his or her Emojis wins!<br/><br/>",

In the wake of his demise the kingdom's most powerful denizens have risen up and taken arms against each other in an all-out battle for the throne. As one of Candy Kingdom's greatest warriors, it's up to you to bring peace to the land by crushing the competition and claiming the Candy King's throne.<br/><br/>The Goal:<br/>Be the last surviving player on the board.<br/><br/>The Basics:<br/>Each turn you get to both move around the candy-battle-themed board to strategically position yourself and you get to cast spells to affect gameplay. You cast spells by spending color square cards you draw each turn. Different colored spells have different effects.<br/><br/>Red and yellow spell are for attacking.<br/><br/>Green spells are for healing.<br/><br/>Orange and Purple spells deal out advantages and disadvantages.<br/><br/>Blue spells give greater freedom of movement.<br/><br/>You can also combine different color square cards to cast unique spells, like an interrupt spell to block an attack.<br/><br/>The game gets more interesting as candy monsters are summoned to the board, creating roadblocks that force the players into closer quarters.<br/><br/>Accessibility:<br/>This game is 100% color blind friendly.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The question asks &quot;What colour?&quot; and children have to say the colour of each of the objects they have just seen.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trials &amp; Triumph was designed by a criminal defense attorney to guide teens in their interactions with law enforcement. The game uses a simple roll-and-move format to chart the course of a player navigating between the World of Possibilities and the World of Trouble. The object of the game is to get out of the World of Trouble with a Clean Slate by being the first player to arrive at the Triumph space.<br/><br/>Some spaces on the board require a player to draw a Flashing Lights card and read it aloud. The cards present over 50 different scenarios involving encounters with law enforcement. The scenarios are based on the designer's 19 years of experience as a criminal defense attorney. The cards do not permit the player to make any choices, they merely spell out the scenario and provide a result. The result of a Flashing Lights card can be positive (e.g. advance your pawn two spaces) or negative (e.g. move your pawn to the World of Trouble, a circular track representing the criminal justice system).<br/><br/>There are various ways a player may leave the World of Trouble track: If a player is convicted of a misdemeanor, the player returns all the way to the Start space in the World of Possibilities; being acquitted allows a player to return to the World of Possibilities on the Clean Slate space; however, if a player is convicted of a felony in the World of Trouble, the player may be eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>The game designer's key lessons are captured in a list of the &quot;7 R's of police encounters,&quot; a summary list of do's and don'ts that are echoed throughout the game: Don't run, reach, resist, or run your mouth (i.e. make a statement to the police); do refuse all DUI tests, refuse consent to search, and request a lawyer.<br/><br/>A supplemental Game Guide ebook is available for separate purchase. The Game Guide aligns with the scenarios on the Flashing Lights cards to provide background information about the criminal offenses and legal concepts involved in the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reinventing the classic Australian sheep-farming game 'Squatter', 'Extractor' is a dystopian board game that maps the possible dynamics of global data-driven businesses or 'platforms' as they compete for world domination. The vast accumulation of data needed for this goal is set against a backdrop of aggressively 'extractive' business practices and the impact they have on the planet. Extraction is a fundamental mechanism of most industries, with a small few accumulating great wealth by extracting value from the earth and the majority of its population. In the universe of Extractor, these global platforms--and aspiring monopolies--automate extraction processes and dominate industry, exhausting resources and polarising society in its wake.<br/><br/>This is a playable artwork by Simon Denny, produced in a limited edition of 1000 copies to accompany the exhibition MINE, by Simon Denny, at the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), Hobart (Tas.), June 2019 - April 2020.<br/><br/>&quot;Instead of making an exhibition catalogue for Simon Denny's exhibition Mine, we chose to make a board game, thus giving you the opportunity to experience the dynamics of the data mining world, in addition to reading about it. [...] Making reference to the classic Australian sheep farming board game 'Squatter', Simon's game 'Extractor' allows you to read and theorise on the topic through a great selection of essays, but also to play against your friends in a highly competitive scramble to achieve world data domination.&quot; - Rule book foreword.<br/><br/>",

One of the remaining house colors is placed in the center of the 5x5 grid of the game board.<br/><br/>Each player has six windows. Five of them show the corresponding five house colors and one of them shows a compass rose. In their turn the player places their die on one of the windows to perform that action. They cannot use the action, which they performed in their previous turn.<br/><br/>When a player picks a colored window, they place a house in the corresponding color to the board.

They secretly write down a secret message to the player who has with the large mobile phone in the corresponding color. The message should consist of exactly 10 words.<br/><br/>The 40 keys are turned to the black side, shuffled and randomly distributed to the 40 fields of the game board. Starting with their pawn at the positions marked with an arrow, the players play alternately in clockwise order. At first, they roll a dice and move their pawn according to the rolled number in any direction (horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal). The direction can be changed once during the turn. If the pawn ends his turn on a key, it is turned over. If it shows the player&rsquo;s color, they place it on the corresponding key of their large cardboard mobile phone and the player who wrote the message to that player tells the nth word corresponding to the number on the key. If the front of the key has a different color, the player puts the key next to their own mobile phone and no word is revealed. If the player rolled a 6, they get an additional turn.<br/><br/>To receive the missing keys which are collected by the other players, they have to capture the pawns of this player. When a pawn is captured, is returns to the start position and the capturing player steals a key of their choice from that player.<br/><br/>When player believes to know their sentence they yell &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;. After the turn of the current player, they have to guess the sentence and if it is correct, win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with five tank cards on stands that move over this landscape. The tanks are differentiated by range and damage ability, but not firepower - all tanks roll a six-sided die when shooting and if the number rolled exceeds the target's damage value, it is destroyed. If any tank moves onto the opposing HQ space, the game is over and that side wins the game immediately.<br/><br/>The game has some unique interpretations of &quot;realism&quot; in its rules. For example, each tank MUST move one space each turn, regardless of the situation on the board. Also, damage in a given turn is cumulative, so two (or three, or four) tanks can combine their damage to destroy a single vehicle.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The planet Arrakis, commonly known as Dune, is a barren wasteland. It's also the only place where spice can be found. This precious resource is essential for space travel and so every house in the known universe vies for control of Dune. The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has recently granted stewardship of Dune to house Atreides, angering the previous stewards: the corrupt house Harkonnen. But this stewardship is not intended as a reward for the noble Atreides. The Emperor secretly fears the popularity of Duke Leto Atreides in the Landsraad and the Harkonnen's unbridled ambition and hopes that his scheme will spark a war between these two powerful houses that will weaken them to the point that they no longer pose a threat to his position as Padishah Emperor...<br/><br/>In this free Print &amp; Play game, the players have been recruited by either house Atreides or house Harkonnen to fight for control of Dune. They each start with a base and a small personal deck of cards representing the units that make up their forces. These units can be sent to sectors to claim a spice income that allows a player to purchase or build more and better units for their deck.<br/><br/>When a sector becomes too crowded, a battle will be fought there. The winner of this battle will permanently claim the sector. A claimed sector does not give income anymore, but it is worth a number of victory points. After claiming a set number of sector cards, the game ends and the player with the most victory points will be the winner.<br/><br/>Units can also be used to attack the opponent's base. Units in your deck and discard pile will defend against attacks on your base. If you fail to defend your base, it will be damaged during attacks and you might eventually lose the game because your base is destroyed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It happened on the S&atilde;o Mateus River, also known as Cricar&eacute;, in the until then Povoado do Cricar&eacute;, including on the Mariricu River (variation of the word Marerike, which means fortress of pau-a-pique), in the current state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo, at the beginning of the year 1558.<br/><br/>Fern&atilde;o de S&aacute;, son of Mem de S&aacute; governor-general of Brazil at the time, when he arrived in Porto Seguro in Bahia, he received the information that there were many Indians in the region of the village of Cricar&eacute;. He set up a punitive expedition with about six caravels and 200 men. He disembarked on the banks of the Cricar&eacute; and began to slaughter the Gentiles, using their firearms against the ill-armed Indians.<br/><br/>By underestimating the bravery of the Indians and the carelessness of the soldiers, the governor&rsquo;s son went a long way in the persecution and ran out of powder. The Indians realized and advanced on him that he was only with ten men. He was killed along with Manuel &Aacute;lvares and Diogo &Aacute;lvares, both son of Diogo &Aacute;lvares Correia, The Caramuru - The man of fire - and three other soldiers.<br/><br/>Despite this victory by the Indians, a large number of Portuguese soldiers joined the Cricar&eacute; River region, killing thousands of Indians. However, two notable facts occurred: the first defeat of the Portuguese on the Brazilian coast and, in return, the greatest genocide committed against the Indians in Brazil.<br/><br/>The Bellum Brasilis series was originally produced by the extinct Riachuelo Games and was directed to games at the tactical level, covering several episodes in the history of Brazil. <br/>This wargame is the second in the Voxelhouse Old School Wargames series.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Featuring the surf photography of Brian Bielmann, the game board and box are covered with magazine quality surf photos, making looking at the game almost as enjoyable as playing it. Roll a 10-sided die and execute the take off, drop and tube of waves on the north shore of Hawaii. If you make it past the barreling tube, you can execute a variety of maneuvers to accumulate points in search of the perfect 10. Additional surf break charts are also available to localize your Waimea Wipeout experience (not included). This is the game for surfers...but not only for surfers. Waimea Wipeout educates even the most novice of fans about the essential elements of competitive surfing, while also giving the chance of victory to all players. Unique would be an understatement for this game !<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ミックスジュースパーティー (Mix Juice Party) is a Japanese card game. The game proceeds mainly with card drafting; each player picks a card which they want to keep from their hand and reveals them together, then gives the remaining hand to the next player. Repeat this until last one card remains in the hand, which is discarded.<br/><br/>After drafting cards is over, each player makes a juice mix from the cards they kept. The player sorts their card by type of fruit, and then loses the highest card from the highest value fruit set.<br/><br/>Then players work out their total fruit mix value. If all the players have got a different total, the highest and lowest total players will lose milk (victory points). If some players have matching totals, those players lose milk instead.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player has lost all their milk. The final score is the total from the last round, plus the value of milk retained. Most points wins with heavenly milk!<br/><br/>Watch out for the cat cards. During the rounds, if a single cat appears, it steals fruit and the other players get no card. But if more than one cat appears, they run away together and no fruit is lost.<br/><br/>Keep away from losing your points and make nice juice by using three kind of fruits, honey, hot pepper, and special cards like the cat!<br/><br/>手札から欲しいカードを1枚選び、一斉に公開してから手札ををとなりに渡すドラフト形式でゲームは進行します。<br/>ドラフトを行った後獲得したカードでジュースを作りその合計点数が他の人とかぶると失点です。<br/>かぶった人がいなければ？最高点と最低点の人が失点となります。<br/><br/>一定の失点を獲得した人が出た時に集めていたカードの点数が最も高い人が勝者となります。<br/>ですが、点数計算の前に自分が一番集めたフルーツはジュースにせずに食べてしまいます。<br/>そして、ネコは今選んだカードを持って逃げてしまうので注意しましょう。<br/><br/>ゲームのメインはドラフト（与えられた手札から1枚選択し、残りを隣に渡して順にカードを集めていくシステム）となっております。<br/><br/>集めたカードの内合計値が最も高いフルーツは捨て札になります。<br/>そして、残ったカードの合計値が他の人とかぶるとライフを失います（ミルクが1本なくなります）。<br/>誰かがライフがなくなった時にゲームは終了し「その時点でのカードの合計値が高い人」が勝者となります<br/>※最終ラウンドの点数しか見ません、ライフが残っていた分はボーナス点になります。<br/><br/>3種類のフルーツとハチミツとトウガラシ、そしてネコといった特殊カードをうまく使って失点を受けないようにうまくジュースを作りましょう！<br/>publisher' summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Episode IV, players are trying to create two poker hands, and the player with the most valuable hands will be the winner.<br/><br/>The game uses two decks of cards.  One is referred to as the &quot;Normal&quot; cards, and consists of ranks 1 through 10 in each of 4 suits.  The other is referred to as the &quot;Randolph&quot; deck, in an allusion to the designer Alex Randolph, as they are acquired through the mechanism popularized in Hol's der Geier.  The &quot;Randolph&quot; cards may have more than one possible color and/or rank.<br/><br/>The game consists of 4 phases, and each player will have ten cards in their hand at the beginning and end of each phase.<br/><br/>In the first phase, the players are dealt 10 cards each from the Normal deck, and will draft cards until they have one card of each rank in their hand.<br/><br/>In the second phase, the players will reveal a certain number of Randolph cards face up and have an auction for them using the Hol's der Geier mechanism.  For players who have their bid cancelled, they will return their Normal card to their hand at the end of the round.  Otherwise, players will enter the next round with any Normal cards they did not bid, and any Randolph cards they won.<br/><br/>In the third phase, a trick-taking round occurs, which is must follow and does not have a trump suit.  The winner of a trick distributes the cards from the trick to the players as they choose, with each player getting 1 card.<br/><br/>In the fourth phase, the players make two face down rows of 5 cards with the cards they obtained in the trick-taking phase.  Each row is revealed simultaneously and awarded a given number of points based upon poker hand type conditions.  There are a few exceptions in cases where only one player scores, or only one player does not score.<br/><br/>",

Losses are taken in Bases as well.<br/><br/>Uncontrolled and unexpected Events can result from the effects of enemy fire, but also randomly. A distinct and separate Mexican and US Army Event Deck is provided.  Unique and historical occurrences impossible to write rules for, but which could or did happen in fact, are now part of the mix as players seek to create a battle plan then react as best they can when it actually makes contact with the enemy.<br/><br/>Prairie fires, false truce, amazing individual acts of courage, etc, all could influence battle in Mexico, and can for the players, too.<br/><br/>GTSTE also provides optional Rules, including Ammunition, Stamina and Fatigue, Skirmishers, Sappers, Night Fighting, and Weather, among others.  <br/><br/>Special Resolve advantages are available to the Mexican force which can field in miniature figures for the conduct of pre-battle Mass, a military band, field hospital, and Soldaderas supporting the soldiers.<br/><br/>Introducing an innovative ground scale system for basing, the game may be played with ANY size figures, from 5/6mm,10mm, 15mm, 25/28mm to 40mm, using the same 1&rdquo; x .75&rdquo; and 2&rdquo; x 1.5&rdquo; square bases without effecting movement or weapons ranges. Artillery is mounted on pre-measured triangular templates (provided with the rules) indicating maximum firing angles eliminating the need for measuring in play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But there is a volcano which is becoming very active, and only one player will be able to survive this nightmare...<br/><br/>The game board exists of a standard setup of hexagonal tiles, with the volcano in the middle of the board. On your turn, you play one of the six standard action cards that are the same for every player, like sprint/walk/push &amp; steal/dig/look and rest (to get your action cards back). Every turn you play two action cards, and you try to dig up special treasures like God cards, which will give you special actions.<br/><br/>But, there is a caveat. There are ten rounds in the game, and every round the volcano spreads across the island, dictated by the random direction of the wind. The player who plays his cards right, who is able to receive the favour of the gods and who is able to stay away from the lava, will survive and will be the only one left standing... Let the nightmare begin!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Wanneer je aankomt op Vuureiland, lijkt het met zijn slaperige vulkaan en witte stranden recht uit een droom geplukt.

The vehicles have different values for range, energy consumption and data traces. The values are modified by events like weather effects and individual player abilities. Felicitas always chooses the vehicle with the highest maximal range and the player winning the bid gains victory points depending on the number of fields she travelled. However, a hacker from F1X collective chases her, so the players are forced to leave as few traces of data as possible. At each location switch, the chaser makes an attractive offer and players may individually choose to help him. But whenever he catches Felicitas, all players lose the game.<br/><br/>Felicitas Fogg has been published by the organization Deutschland sicher im Netz (Germany safe in on the Internet) and is sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.<br/><br/>",

The first &lsquo;camper&rsquo; back to camp wins the game!<br/><br/>In more detail, each player chooses a Camper and places it in the starting space on the game board in its matching color trail. Shuffle the cards and place them to the side of the board, facedown. Let the camping trip begin!<br/><br/>On your turn, draw a card from the playing deck. If a plus card (+) is drawn, jump your Camper forward the number shown. If a minus (-) card is drawn, move backwards the number shown. It's a great way for young players to practice counting skills and learn the concept of plus (+) and minus (-) while having fun!<br/><br/>Watch for special Camper cards while you play! If a card is drawn with a happy Camper with a sun/rainbow, draw two more cards and move. If a card is drawn with an unhappy Camper under a rain cloud, you lose a turn.<br/><br/>The first Camper to reach the campsite wins! For additional challenge for older players, the exact number card must be drawn in order to move the remaining spaces to the finish.<br/><br/>",

The heart of the Perilous Expeditions Set is the Narrative Campaign Book which includes all the Rules, Campaign Objectives, Story Threads, Enemy Lists, Expedition Hazard Charts for Land and for Sea, for both the Norse Coast and the Jungle Island Chain, as well as a host of other new material, including 8 brand new Missions for use with the Expedition Ship Board, the Wilderness Encounter Board, and some unique Campaign Story Missions. Heroes use the Gold and Dark Stone they collect on Missions to upgrade their Expedition Camp and Ship over the course of the Campaign, unlocking new options and powerful bonuses as the Darkness grows ever-stronger. Heroes explore the Campaign Map to reveal Adventure Locations, travel to OtherWorlds and back, hunting down Campaign Clues that lead you through the Story, and eventually (if you survive the perils thrown at you) reaching a climactic final push to defeat whichever powerful creature or sinister scheme the Darkness has unleashed upon the world!<br/><br/>Double-sided Expedition Ship and Wilderness Encounter Boards are used when your ship or camp is attacked by Enemies. Each of the three new Board types is double-sided, with unique content for Viking and Conquistador play. The Expedition Ship Board is a tactical Game Board for fighting off Enemies that attack your Ship and crew at sea, allowing you to move around the deck of the ship repelling boarders and protecting key areas of the ship and crew. This board features a Viking Long Ship on one side and a Spanish Tall Ship on the other. The Wilderness Encounter Board is a tactical Game Board for having battles on land as your Heroes trek through the uncharted territory on your journeys. It can also represent your Expedition Camp being attacked by Enemies! This board features a Snowy Forest on one side and Jungle Pathways on the reverse. The Campaign Map Board is a strategic Game Board for playing out the Campaign Rounds between Missions, allowing your Heroes to sail the seas on your Expedition Ship and make landfall to seek out Adventure Locations, progressing the story and launching narrative Missions as you explore the region. This board features an icy Norse Coast region on one side and a Jungle Island Chain on the reverse.<br/><br/>Two new Enemy types are included: Deep Stalkers are terrifying fish-men that climb aboard ships that stray into their oceanic domain, kidnapping the crew for their dark feedings.

The remaining cards are placed face down into a draw pile. On a player's turn, they ask another player if they have an artist card (e.g do you have a piece by Van Gogh?). The player they're asking then has two options. They can either say yes and give the other player their Van Gogh cards, or say no, either truthfully or in an attempt to bluff.  As this game involves bluffing, if a player does not believe their opponent is telling the truth when they say they do not have a card by the named artist, they can challenge their opponent. If their opponent did have any cards by the named artist, the opponent loses a turn and has to give all cards by the named artist to the person who challenged them, and the person who challenged them takes another turn. If the challenge fails, the person who made the challenge must give the person they challenged all their cards by the named artist and the turn then passes to the left.<br/><br/>When a player builds a complete collection (four cards by the same artist, by artists from the same country, in the same genre, or by female artists), they place those cards on the table face up, these cards form your collection. If when doing this a player runs out of cards in their hand, they draw four new cards from the draw pile. Play continues until the draw pile is empty and all cards are placed into collections, or no more collections can be formed from the cards left in player's hands.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players add up the value of their collection, taking into account any end game and wild card bonuses. The player who has the most expensive collection wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Unlike other trump card games, this game uses four different suits, from which the player can choose to play their card for.  Every card has four symbols/strengths, these are: Tactic, Attack, Defense and Range.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the warrior cards are shuffled and all are dealt among the players as equally as possible.  Every player gets one joker card, the remaining joker cards are removed from the game.  After receiving their cards, players put them -face down- in front of them.<br/><br/>The starting player takes the top card from his deck and pick one of the four symbols to play.  They call out both the symbol and the point value.  Then the other players take the top card of their decks and call out the point value for the chosen symbol and show their cards to prove their claims.  The player with the highest point value in the chosen strength wins the trick and places all cards -face down- at the bottom of their stack.  The game continues until a single player owns all the cards.<br/><br/>Jokers can be used to win a trick, they always have the highest point value.  But they can only be played at beginning of the turn or if the corresponding symbol has been called out.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Players create characters, customize decks of 40 cards, and go back and forth against opponents in 1 vs 1 games, 3+ player rumbles, and 4+ player team games.<br/><br/>Each deck comes with 10 cards of 4 different types:<br/>Defending/Block<br/>Defending/Parry<br/>Attacking/Strike<br/>Attacking/Fake<br/><br/>Before the game, players must fill out a character sheet if they haven't already. They can then customize and organize their decks, keeping the number of cards in the deck at 40 and a minimum of 8 of each type of card. If not everyone has a custom deck, players must instead draw cards from a single pile of 80 cards (two standard decks shuffled together).<br/><br/>All players then place an aggression coin by their right arm and draw 4 cards from their (or the community's) deck. Players then place the card they want to play with the indicator side (Defending/Attacking) facing up. They then decide what they want to do in response to their opponent(s) cards. Once everyone has their cards down, players flip their cards over and compare each hand independently (Player A's right hand vs Player B's and vice versa).<br/><br/>The goal is to get enough hits on your opponent to knock them out of the game (a new character can take 5 hits before dying), tearing up their character sheet in the process and (if you win) adding +1 hit point to your character for the next game you play. The game ends when the last player (or team, in a team game) is left standing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Flanks of Gettysburg is a two, two-player games on a company level, simulating the two brigade sized flank attacks on Little Round Top and Culp&rsquo;s Hill on July 2, 1863.  Each assault is a separate game based on a chit-pull system that can be completed in several hours.  Historically the Union bested rebel forces on both flanks because it fed enough reinforcements in to stem the gray tide But that is not to say that the rebels don&rsquo;t stand a chance. They do.<br/><br/>FOG uses a chit pull system similar to John Poniske&rsquo;s Ball&rsquo; Bluff and Belmont designs.  Both games follow similar rules applying unique fire and movement, melee and order assignment. These are simple, rapid playing approaches to complex situations.  FOG clocks in at three to three and a half hours per game and provides high solitaire capability.<br/><br/>The battles of Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Little Roundtop demonstrated Lee&rsquo;s determination to attack and envelop the Union Army of the Potomac. FOG does not attempt to recreate either grand assault in full, rather it presents the desperate three-hour finale that took place on the extreme ends in both cases These were the two instances when Lee came closest to claiming a Gettysburg breakthrough. <br/>Culp&rsquo;s Hill offers the Union prepared defensive positions but the liability of having reinforcements report to General Greene before joining the line. Little Round Top introduces artillery and sharpshooters and challenges players to exit or block the exit of Rebel forces between Little and Big Round Tops.<br/><br/>Each game offers a beautiful Rick Barber map and a low counter mix. Regimental draw chits allow companies to move, volley fire or melee at the player&rsquo;s discretion. The ground over which the Confederates must assault is rough and at times movement under fire can be distressingly slow. Casualties mount rapidly until the rebels are close enough to exact revenge.<br/><br/>&ndash;Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The tops battled (hitting against each other) until the last top spinning was the winner.<br/><br/>Spin Fighters tops were ~1 inch across, came in black and gold colors, and bore a prismatic sticker featuring a character from a TV show or video game. Usually, the black tops represented the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; and the gold tops represented the &quot;Good Guys.&quot; Spin Fighters were sold two to a package: one gold and one black spin fighter. Power Launchers and Battle Arenas were available separately or bundled. Spin Fighters tops can be disassembled and worn on jackets, shirts, and hats, through any small button hole.<br/><br/>Production of Spin Fighter ceased around 1997. They are widely seen to be the forerunner to Beyblade, which began production in 1997.<br/><br/>Spin Fighters series included: World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Saban's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and Capcom's Street Fighter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After years of quasi-peace since 2016, the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist armies that Russia supported and built-up launched another attack with the aim of seizing more territory. It was hoped to occupy the city of Kharkov and Dnipro but even more modest gains would have political and military value, in addi-tion, further destabilize the Ukrainian government.<br/>Both sides had similar military strength with 35,000 front line troops manning the fortified front lines. The DPA and LNR, 914 AFVs, 720 artillery guns, 202 rocket artillery between the two pro-Russian forces. Each had around 200 tanks. Among these were at least 2100 Russian forces to assist. However, Putin also had placed elements from the 3rd Motorized Division along the northern border from its 20th Army and the 150th Division not far near the Crimea. The 150th was quite strong with two tank regiments and two mechanized infantry regiments. Either or both, if used, would be a decisive in seizing more Ukrainian territory.<br/>The Ukrainian forces were capable and equal in most aspects, especially their elite units that proved their worth in 2014 and 2015. The front lines were vintage WW1 with trench lines and fortified areas along the main avenues of approach. Many of the Ukrainian units were mainly reinforced battalion strength de-spite their regimental or brigade designation. In fact, many &quot;bri-gades&quot; only had one or two battalions.<br/>While they had many more AFVs, many needed refitting or repaired as with much of their equipment. The one new weapon was the American Javelin AT. Ukraine had 47 launchers and 360 missiles which could be used against armor and structures. They also had 12 Turkish Bayraktar UAV for reconnaissance.<br/>As in previous battles, both fought with tenacity and the tipping point was always whether the Russians would send in their units, which they did in 2014, 2015. The other potential was whether the Americans also send in help from Poland.<br/>With both sides facing each other since 2016 in a quasi-peace, both the DPA and LNR forces had built up and trained their forces with Russian aid. The Ukrainians also built up forces and created a fortified line along main avenues of advance. Finally, sometime in 2020, Putin decided to try to get a larger section of the Ukraine in 2021. The offensive would be limited.<br/><br/>Designed by Perry Moore in 2020, this game seems prophetic on the battle of Kharkiv in Feb to May 2022. along with the use of Javelins and supply issues for the Russian army.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Pok&eacute;mon Match Battle players are trying to be the first to win 3 match battles. It is a simple &lsquo;spin-and-compare&rsquo; game where each player has only one Pok&eacute;mon card. Players are each dealt one card at the beginning of each game and keep that card for the whole game. Games appear to be of short time length.<br/><br/>This game is very simple and designed for play by young kids by using simple rules, low complexity and short time length. These were distributed in August 2022 as part of a McDonald&rsquo;s Happy Meal program, at least in the US. As usual for McD&rsquo;s there were multiple sets. The only apparent difference between them is the color highlight and representative Pok&eacute;mon on the box and also used on the plastic game spinner for that set. Each set has a sealed pack of 4 Pok&eacute;mon cards.<br/><br/>On their turn, the player flips the &lsquo;coin&rsquo; (cardboard circle about 1.5&rdquo; diameter) to determine whether high or low will win. Next the player uses the spinner to determine which of the 5 attribute categories will be used for this turn. Then all players compare that attribute among the cards. The player with the highest or lowest (based on the coin toss) value wins the match point. The first player to win 3 matches (points) wins.<br/><br/>The cards that we&rsquo;ve seen show a distinctive set logo in the lower left corner and show #/15, for a total set of only 15 different cards apparently. They are a mix of Basic and Stage 1. Presumably any Pok&eacute;mon cards can be used with this game.<br/><br/>",

Each army has 50 cards of varying numbers from 1 to 10.  Additionally there is a deck of Battle cards that further influence the game by increasing or decreasing values, preventing other players from playing cards, stealing played cards, etc.  A round consists of each player flipping a card from their deck.  Players can then play battle cards or draw additional cards from their deck with the goal of being closest to 10 without going over.  In the event of a tie where multiple players have the same number close to 10, or 10, then each tied player draws a single card from their deck and the highest card wins.  If the newly drawn card results in another tie, keep drawing cards until their is no tie and then whomever had the highest last drawn card wins.  Winners of a hand take all the cards played by all players and put them in a second stack by their deck.<br/><br/>Play continues as the above until one player deck of 50 has been depleted.  Then players count up the number of cards collected.  Highest amount wins.<br/><br/>",

The title translates to &quot;build a nest&quot; and refers to getting your own place of residence (with someone).<br/><br/>Players roll a die and move around a circuit performing transactions and purchasing furniture or car tiles. Occasionally a wheel is spun which mostly leads to more purchases but may indicate taking a loan, selling a tile to the bank or auctioning off an excess tile to the other players. A player wins by paying their initial mortgage, obtaining a full set of tiles, and having at least 5,000 in money.<br/><br/>",

During your turn, you roll the three runic dice and spend them on three possible actions:<br/>Move: If a die shows the rune of an adjacent space, you may spend the die to move to that space.<br/>Jump: If a die shows the rune of an adjacent space, and the color of that space matches the color of the die, you may spend the die to jump over that space to the next space with a matching rune.<br/>Droggel: If multiple dice show the same rune, you may move directly to the next space showing that rune. No dice are spent during a Droggel. After a Droggel, you reroll all of your remaining dice.<br/><br/>If you move to a space that is already occupied by another player, you fight over that space. Fights are resolved using a simple dice-based combat mechanism. The loser of the fight has to move their piece one or more spaces backwards.<br/><br/>",

The game's child-friendly mechanics, which do not require the classic shuffling and dealing of cards, make it particularly suitable for the youngest players.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player fishes five cards from the ocean (a special shared pile of cards in the middle of the table). Then, by cleverly asking the other players, they try to collect a group of four identical marine animals. If the asked player does not have the desired sea animal in his hand, he replies with &quot;Go fishing! In this case, another card is fished out of the ocean. This often leads to funny dialogues, making Geh' Fischen! a communicative game with a lot of wit. At the end, the player who has collected the most groups of sea animals wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Instead of rolling dice, all players choose a tile to show their move, and after revealing players decide which of their three animals to move.

The player with the most points at the end is the winner, and the bears receive bonus points as well.<br/><br/>The publisher says: <br/>Squirrels, rabbits, and bears escaped the dried-out forest with only a bit of food.

On their way to escape, they need to get food from other animals in order to survive.<br/><br/>Basically this is sugoroku game but with tiles instead of dice. Players moves 1 of their animal tokens out of 3 each turn with stealing/being stolen their food each other. The first three animals reached to the paradise will get bonus points.

Each on turn, players draw a card then try to follow their recipe by building a tableau made of a Chef's hat (mandatory to start cooking), then a couple of kitchen utensils and all the necessary ingredients (flour, eggs, butter, etc.).<br/>The first player able to bake their cake will win. However, every other chef will try before that to hinder others' progression by attacking with various incidents (flat cake, burning cake, etc). Some rare cards in the game allow you to become a special chef, definitely protected by such attacks.<br/><br/>While typical of the time for its mechanisms (Take-that, draw and discard), Le Petit Patissier is a hard to find collector's item.<br/><br/>",

The circular board has numbered bars around the perimeter that pull out for keeping track of each players score, one for each province, and a central disc for keeping track of each teams score. Players place a red or green pawn on the end of their score bar to indicate their team. When a player reaches ten points, they reset their score bar and score one point for their team, turning the central disc clockwise for a green point or counter-clockwise for a red point. When a player reaches five points, instead of answering a trivia question, they roll a six sided die to determine how many points they get. The winning team is the one to reach ten points first, or if using a timer, the team with the most points when time is up.<br/><br/>Questions are read from cards, and each card has four questions. Before playing, a difficulty level of one to four is chosen, which determines which questions are read from the cards (Level one is just the first question, level two is the first and second question, etc.).<br/><br/>The instructions mention that it can be played solitaire.<br/><br/>",

The dealer must declare which character is being offered but may lie about this. The recipient then faces the choice to accept or decline the card. If accepted, they gain control of the character; if declined, the dealer gains control of the character. In either case, the player on the left becomes the new dealer. Characters grant players with coins or valuable belongings, but some, like the Sheriff and the Gunslinger, bring trouble or arrest. And, of course, no one wants to get the Goat because it's worthless.<br/><br/>Following three rounds (or four in two-player games), the game concludes.

At the beginning, each player must equip themselves with a button because no pawns were added to the game. (In those days, all Mr. Kleks's fans collected buttons, like Mr. Kleks, looking for a button for a magic hat, needed to turn his enchanted friend into a starling back into a human.) Players roll the dice. If the result is even, they move the number rolled. If the player rolls 1, he draws a card from the &quot;surprise&quot; deck, if 3 - from the &quot;obstacle&quot; deck, if 5 - from the &quot;adventure&quot; deck. Each of these decks consists of 10 cards and one whose content you can come up with yourself. The cards describe situations such as: you lose 1 turn, you gain 2 throws, you move 10 spaces, stand 20 fields away from the finish line, return to the start, etc. The player who reaches the finish line first wins.<br/><br/>",

Here&rsquo;s how it works: pick a card from the deck, see the word on it and read it out loud. This word is most likely UNKNOWN to you but painfully SIMILAR to a word that you most likely do know.  <br/>Your task is to summon your deepest knowledge or, even better, your acting skills, and convince the other players that you know exactly what the word means.<br/><br/>What is an Enchiridion? A collapsible folder? A Mexican food? A rare-earth metal? Do you have your own version?<br/><br/>There is only one word, but everyone will have their own interpretation of what it means. You have to convince everyone that YOUR definition of the word is correct. The key to Abracadabra lies in a player&rsquo;s ability to improvise the definitions and persuade all the other players that you really do know what you're talking about. Players earn points by convincing other players that their definition is correct, or at least close to correct, by betting on the most accurate definitions and by actually getting the definition right.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This multi-faceted colorful bilingual game was issued without charge to schools and citizens who requested a copy from the Commissioner of Official Languages of the Canadian Federal Government's Language Development Program.<br/><br/>All of the components of the game fit into the cardboard game board, which when closed is a large envelope that is 35.7cm long x 31cm wide. The game was created by Madeline Knonby and illustrated by Geo Boka, copyrighted 1974.<br/>The game board when open is 35.7cm long x 62.3cm wide and about 1cm thick, and is a stylized map of Canada. Each province and territory (of the time) is in a different color and major cities are indicated on the map appropriately. In addition there are colorful scenes depicting various activities across Canada. Some places are indicated with their names in English  and others indicated with their names in French. Different types of  lines between cities illustrate modes of transportation between cities. For example, the dotted black line at the bottom between Winnipeg and Regina indicates a railroad, while the double red lines from Winnipeg going east indicates a highway; the yellow line from Churchill going northwest indicates an air-route and the white and black line going northeast indicates a water-route! The &quot;legend&quot; at the lower-left side of the board indicates these transportation modes as well as moves of players during the game.<br/><br/>The spinner on the board indicates the transportation modes a player must use while attempting to travel across Canada. The 32 page included bilingual book contains instructions for playing the game and other bilingual information. The game is for four players (illustrated in circles on the front of the book), each of whom is represented during play by a 1.5cm diameter plastic disc of white, green, red, or yellow.<br/><br/>The 33 1/3 RPM phonograph recording (17.8cm diameter) includes 2 songs in both English and French. There is also a glossary of phrases in both languages which includes phrases such as: &quot;It's snowing&quot;, etc.<br/><br/>This game appears to be a modified later version of an earlier game - From Coast To Coast, but an earlier version of The Great Game Of Canada.<br/><br/>",

Try and take out as much of the enemy specialists as soon as possible, but remember while you are doing all that to your enemy, they will be trying to do the same to you!<br/><br/>",

The first step is to set out your equipment and select a person to be Banker. The Banker pays off all bets for any agreed number of plays or time limit at the completion of which another player acts as Banker.<br/>All numbers on the layout do not have to be sold. For example, only two or three people may participate in a single play. The profit percentage is exactly the same as if all numbers were covered. <br/>When all bets are down on the layout, the Banker gives the cage a turn which raises and drops the dice at the opposite end of the cage. The three numbers on the top surface of the dice are the winners. <br/>If a bettor's number appears on one die he receives the return of his stake plus a like amount (even money). If it appears on 2 dice he is rewarded with the return of his bet plus twice the amount bet (2 to 1). Three like numbers rewards the players with thrice the amount bet plus the bet (3 to 1).<br/>Lowe's CHUCK-A-LUCK is an exact duplicate of the regulation casino game. It has all the play features of the larger size game and will give players the same high degree of enjoyment.&quot;<br/><br/>",

During each session, five elections take place followed by the formation of the government. The goal is to advance as far as possible in the parliament. Advancement comes, on the one hand, through luck (namely, your cards) and the way you use it, that is, playing the right cards at the right time, and, on the other hand, through skillful negotiation with your fellow players about posts and their related points. <br/>Success is measured in points. Each player has a sixth of the game field (the plenary hall) in front of him, his points are marked in the track of his color. After 15 elections, the strongest party-chairman wins; that is, the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

As the Private Investigator, the Femme Fatale (or Homme Fatale), the Politician and more, players uncover clues and trick their friends, all while searching for their enemies&rsquo; true intentions. Six roles, five agendas, and twelve character cards combine randomly so that a new story is told every time you play.<br/><br/>From top to bottom, The Big Fix is designed to play and feel like a Film Noir. Our goal was to create a game which is not only fun and strategically deep, but makes its players think and act like they were a character in a Film Noir. The game emphasizes individual agendas, simultaneous and interconnected player storylines, and temporary alliances driven by mutual benefit - all of which are key themes and motives in Film Noir. Winning at The Big Fix requires strategy, cunning, and a hard-boiled attitude.<br/><br/>",

In the box there are 12 fields (like the field on a clock). The position of the dog (standing, on its side or on its back) and the place in the box give (or take) points. Also the place of the bone gives points. The first one to reach 100 points is the winner. A very nice game to play in a pub.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Pass the Pigs<br/><br/><br/>",

The game is mostly dictated by the spinner and the cards are primarily the game board and status markers for the spinner results. The one exception is the fielding cards which will give variable results for base running after hits are spun. There is little to no decision making in the game as it is totally run by the spinner and fielding cards.<br/><br/>The instructions are in English and French.<br/><br/>",

Players keep going until a set time limit is reached (I suggest at least 2 hours) or when the there is only one player left in the game (if played without descendants).  If descendants are being used, the game is never ending and can go on indefinitely.<br/><br/>The highs and lows of society are portrayed by spaces on the board.  Businesses may be bought and sold, players may get a higher education, join a Co-op, become a thief, enter the military, etc.<br/><br/>An additional random element is in the form of 'Change' cards.  With the draw of a card you can become an alcoholic, get busted and sent to prison, become a parent of quintuplets, etc.  Because there are only 54 of these cards, they seem to come up again and again... expecially when six are playing.<br/><br/>Elections make the game the most fun.  During an election, players are encouraged to put issues to a vote... majority rules.  This allows aspects of the game rules to be changed or outright ingored!  Because of this, interesting things can happen, for example: elimination of taxes or a military coup d'etat.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the player that reaches the most &quot;trouble spots&quot; at the end of the game (&quot;Sparkplug to the rescue!&quot;).  A deck of cards is shuffled and the first card is drawn and placed on the appropriate spot on the playing board.  Each player then spins the dial once, and EACH player must move their playing piece with the intention of reaching the spot with the trouble card (the spaces on the spinner have a number 0,1,2, or 3, related to each players color so during each spin, each player moves their playing piece the number of spaces indicated for the color of their playing piece).  Pieces can move forward or backwards and any number of players can occupy the same space.  Once a player lands on the card that represents the trouble spot, the card is taken by that player and a new card is drawn and the process repeats.<br/><br/>",

Once the chicken makes a sound, the last egg the player wanted to take, is taken out of the game and the next player takes his/her turn.<br/><br/>In the end (when all eggs are either caught or taken out of the game) the number of eggs and the size of them make out the score. Large eggs are 3 points, medium ones 2 and small eggs only 1 point. The player with the most points wins. Ages 6 years and older.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>Penny the Chicken has laid a lot of eggs. She doesn't want anybody to take them. If you try to take them she will squawk loudly! Can you trick Penny and steal her eggs? If you are gentle and clever you can slowly take them - one by one. But if she clucks then you have lost your turn.

It could be played in any of three ways.<br/>In the preferred method, a slightly souped-up version of &quot;Authors,&quot; the player to the left of the dealer reads the quote on one of his cards. If the next player knows which play the quote is from and needs that card for a set of the four scenes from that play, he gets it. Completed sets are laid down on the table, and whoever has the most sets at the end of the game wins.<br/>&quot;When mere amusement is desired and the educational feature not cared for,&quot; the second game play method is the most basic version of &quot;Authors&quot; in which the players ask each other if they have a card for a particularly play. The third game play method is, strangely, a non-bidding four-handed partnered trick-taking game in which the four series of scenes substitute for the four suits in a regular card deck, with the &quot;A&quot; series always being trump.<br/>The maximum number of players for the third method is four. The maximum number for the other methods could be higher, but it might prove difficult to build sets. The approximate playing time is a guess.<br/>Bottom line: I guess they knew their Shakespeare a lot better at the start of the 20th century than we know him at the start of the 21st.<br/><br/>",

The board divides the Belgian coast and part of the sea in sectors. You have to respond to an SOS, pick up the survivors with one of the six helicopters and transport them to a nearby hospital corresponding with your playing color. The helicopters can be moved by all the players. Each player decides in secret how many spaces each chopper will move. You gain points for each successful delivery (the number of points depends on the mission). After a fixed amount of missions, the player with the most points wins. Event cards spice up the game.<br/><br/>The game contains 6 cardboard &quot;3D&quot; Seeking rescue-choppers.<br/><br/>",

It deals with their roles in the economic order of the world.&quot; (translated from Swedish)<br/>Players assume the position of either a poor, semi-poor or a rich country, or even that of a multinational corporation. The game has three different phases: in the first phase the game &quot;simulates&quot; the current economic world order. In the second phase some rules are changed in favor of the poor countries. In the third phase the players are to make rules that are fair to all players.<br/><br/>There is also an earlier version of the game called V&auml;rlds-Monopol, with the only difference being the name.<br/><br/>According to the manual, the game has been published in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and English. Even Finnish rules can be found.<br/><br/>The publishers must have had at least production help from Alga even though this is not credited anywhere; the box is standard Alga size and quality, money is standard Alga money (with even the Alga logos included!) and the dice and playing pieces are also Alga standard - depending on edition, houses and hotels from Monopoly or factories from Nya Finans to represent the &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; factories in this game, player pawns and plastic stands for the cards as used in several Alga games.<br/><br/>",

Tiles played to the table must be connected in such a way that the tracks are joined correctly and the winding train grows longer with each play. A tile may not be placed so that the track turns back upon itself preventing another tile from being added. At first, players may add tiles to both ends of the train. When an engine or caboose is drawn, it must be added to the front or back respectively, thus reducing plays to only one side. When the train has both an engine and a caboose, the game ends.

The categories are Current Affairs Home, Current Affairs Abroad, Royal, Human Interest, Sports and &quot;...And Finally&quot;.<br/><br/>To collect a story players have to collect a headline card, a picture card and a story card which the majority of other players consider satisfies the category. But beware, other players can stop your story with a &quot;Commercial Break&quot; or a story can be stolen with an &quot;Editor Card&quot;.&quot;<br/><br/>Note: It's actually spin-and-move, not roll-and-move, but they're functionally identical.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Created to make your preparation for English exams more fun, 800: The Game of Verbal Perfection features the most commonly found words in over 2400 questions, divided into three levels. The questions are modeled after the verbal SAT in a Trivial Pursuit-like format. You'll increase your vocabulary while having fun with your whole family!<br/><br/>The questions simulate actual questions from the SAT, ACT, GRE, and MAT with a bit of a humorous bent.<br/><br/>A board is placed on the table with an octagon track on it. The track is made up of six rings, each ring, containing spaces that are either a number (the outer ring spaces are &quot;300&quot;, with numbers increasing until the final inner space, which is &quot;800&quot;), an arrow, or a &quot;RC&quot; space (Reading Comprehension.) Two decks of cards: the Level Deck and the Reading Comprehension Deck are placed on the table, and each player puts a pawn of their color on one of the arrow spaces on the outer ring. All players roll the dice, with the highest roller going first, with play proceeding clockwise around the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player simply rolls the die and moves their pawn counter-clockwise that many spaces. Depending on what space a player lands on, the following occurs:<br/><br/>     &quot;RC&quot;. Another player reads the passage on the top Reading Comprehension card to another player, and then asks them a question with five choices.<br/>     Level Space (&quot;300&quot; through &quot;800&quot;). Another player asks them a question, using the matching question on the top Level card. These questions are ones such as &quot;Machete is to brush as&hellip;&quot;, and there are five choices to pick from.<br/>     Eliminate One: Some level spaces say &quot;eliminate one&quot; on them - and are the same as a normal space, but a player only has to list one wrong answer to get the question correct.<br/>     Arrow Space: The player is asked a question from a Level card that is equal to the level of the ring they are currently in. If they get the question correct, they move their pawn one ring further in; if incorrect, one ring out.<br/><br/><br/>No matter what space they landed on, if a player gets the question right, they may roll again and continue.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player gets their pawn into the middle 800 space and answers a question correctly. At this point, all other players gladly crown them the winner.<br/><br/>--gameplay summary from Tom Vasel (see <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12318.phtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12318.phtml</a>)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game for 2 to 4 players. The instructions say that it should be played by girls and boys together. Each player gets a particular color to start on. That color is used later on. A girl starts the game! There are spaces on the gameboard such as First Class, Air Mail or Special Delivery. When a player lands on one of them the player picks a card and reads it aloud. The card will list some kind of stunt that must be accomplished in order to score points. If a partner is needed to accomplish the stunt then the player spins a spinner, the male who has that color representing him is the girls partner for the stunt. There is a time limit to accomplish each stunt. The stunts are childish (this game is appropriate for perhaps 8 to 12 year olds).  Some examples of stunts that need to be done;  You and your partner eat a potato chip at the same time and immediately whistle Yankee Doodle. First one to whistle the first line wins the points. Or Standing back to back with your partner, remove his or her jacket or sweater and put it on yourself without turning around. The successful completion of a stunt in the given time limit results in winning a certain amount of points. First player to reach 500 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Suursaari, also known as H&ouml;gland, Gogland, or &lsquo;the Great Island&rsquo;, is a large island in the Gulf of Finland. In 1942 and again in 1944 it was the focal point of a battle. The island is centrally located, perfect for dominating sea lanes leading to Leningrad or those crossing between Finland and Estonia. Float planes, or ski planes in winter, could use it as a base; strings of minefields could be monitored from it; coastal guns placed on it could engage passing ships. Immediately before World War II the island belonged to the Finns. It was a rustic vacation destination, complete with casino. The Russians acquired the island without a fight during the Winter War of 1939/40. In the winter of 1942, the Finns took it back from the Russians. In September 1944 the Germans tried and failed to take it from the Finns. This game comprises two scenarios covering these battles, using a common set of rules.<br/><br/>Scale is 300 meters across a given hex. Contour lines are 20 meter intervals. Since the 1942 battle took place in winter and the 1944 battle took place in summer, each scenario uses its own map. The military units are sections (squads), platoons, and companies. Other counters represent batteries of artillery and mortars, naval craft, individual commanders, and bunkers. Each player&rsquo;s military forces must manoeuvre across the game board, attacking the opposing force with direct and indirect fire, airstrikes, naval gunnery, and fighting hand-to-hand. One player is the Defender and the other is the Attacker. The Attacker must achieve his objectives before time runs out. The longer the game goes on, the more objectives he must achieve to win. Turns are one hour. Special rules include snow storms, the Finns attacking across the ice in winter, German naval landings using barges and assault boats, naval gunfire by flak barges and a destroyer squadron, airstrikes, variable visibility due to terrain, weather, and time of day, antitank guns that can fire HE in an indirect role, and much more.<br/><br/>In the 1942 scenario, the Finns attack across the ice in a blinding snowstorm against a reinforced Soviet battalion of half-frozen men, some of whom nevertheless resisted for 3 days. In the 1944 scenario the Germans fail in their attempt to bluff the Finns into handing over the island peacefully, land a motley force including worn-out infantry, coastal artillery personnel, 88mm flak guns with no ammunition, and 580 men of Marine-Artillerie-Abteilug 531. The 531st was no sedentary coastal garrison, but a special commando unit whose men took part in the very first battle of the war, the assault on the Westerplatte at Danzig on 1 September 1939. The Finns defeat them all, just in time to hand the island over to the Soviets as part of the Armistice agreement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The grandfather clock in the Pimpola Manor has stopped. Turns out that there are ghosts living inside the clock, and they don't like the striking of the clock. In order to get the clock working again, you have to find a new place for the ghosts to live in. Luckily, in the attic there's a wardrobe in which all the ghosts could easily fit.<br/><br/>This is a simple roll-and-move game. The first player to get all his ghosts inside the wardrobe wins. On the way to the attic there are four special spaces. Whenever a ghost lands on one of these spaces, it might sneak out for a nap, go doing pranks, or simply run back into the grandfather clock.<br/><br/>This game belongs to Peliko's line of children's games illustrated by Mauri Kunnas. Included in the box are a game board, a wardrobe, a die, and 16 ghosts in four player colors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mazemaster is a 2-4 player game where stone, zombies, dragons and even physics are merely obstacles to be surpassed as you build, fight and wend your way through a maze of your own construction in order to claim the legendary Relic. Starting from the very edge of the mountain, you &ndash; a mage on a mission &ndash; must use your powers not only to make your way to the centre, but also to impede and slow down your opponents through myriads of magical trickery - rotating their mazes into dead ends, burning their caverns, or even outright destroying what they create - all in order to ensure that the only wizard making it to the centre is you and you alone. But beware, not only do you have to make it to the centre, you have to make it out again.<br/><br/>With up to 3 other mages trying to stop you, that may not be such an easy feat!<br/><br/>The rules for Mazemaster are simple. At the beginning of every turn, players select up to three action cards they wish to use once the turn begins. These could be anything from as simple as move and build to cards that allow a player to rotate other player&rsquo;s maze tiles, teleport them across unbridgeable gaps or even to destroy their path altogether. Each player, when selecting the actions they are going to take, can&rsquo;t just think about what they plan to do; they also have to remember to try and slow down any player that may be ahead of them, or even preparing for a dastardly piece of magical trickery coming their way from an opponent, even as they try to make their way to the centre of the map, wherein lies the relic.<br/><br/>Reaching the relic, however, isn&rsquo;t the end; your wizard has his powerful new weapon, but he needs to get out of the mountain in order to understand how to use it! And chances are, if you reached it first, your fellow players may not be too keen on letting you escape so easily!<br/><br/>",

There are men on one side, women on the other, you choose which side to play at the start. The faces are divided into three strips like a photo-fit, and players use chips to move them around to form the best pictures. Players then score points by selecting which sections look best.<br/><br/>The game appears to work best as a tactical 2 player game, and the hand drawn portraits look good, recognizable as famous people, but it doesn't seem to be a successful result.<br/><br/>",

The high card of the suit led wins all the other cards played. After the round, all players draw a new card from the deck to bring their hands back up to 6. Play continues until the draw deck depleted and the players have played all the cards in their hands. Players then score 1 point for each Zip Code card they have won.

If the two cards are the same rank (like two Fives) and are both Black, show the cards to the other players and choose a player to return that many tokens to the Bank. If the two cards are the same rank and are both Red, show the cards to the other players and choose a player (including yourself) to gain that many tokens from the Bank. If the two cards are the same rank and are different colors, show the cards to the other players and refer to the Mixed Chart [which is included in the rules.] Once the effect has resolved, set the cards aside in the discard pile and end your turn.<br/><br/>If the two cards do not match, put them back in their original spots, face-up. You can choose to put one or both of them back face-down, but you must give one token to the Bank for each card that you don't reveal. Once you've made your decision and shown (or not shown) your cards, your turn ends.<br/><br/>If you run out of tokens, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>The game emds when only one player has tokens left, or when all possible matches have been made.

When taking a turn a player moves her piece one space, then draws a card from the appropriate deck.

One card is placed face-up on the table. The starting player turns up the top card from his deck. If it is the same character as the open card, or if the balloons on the cards are the same color, the player plays the card on a common pile and continues turning his cards. When the cards don&acute;t match the player discards his card and the next player turns up his top card. If a player turns up a card that is both the same character and the same balloon color as the open card, he may put all his discards on the pile. Players may have to turn their discard pile into a new draw deck. The first player to run out of cards is the winner.<br/><br/>No decisions to make at all, but an easy game for small kids.<br/><br/>",

The actual rules for this 2-player version of Bridge are on the back of the wooden steps.<br/><br/>Although the actual date of manufacture has not been established, the game carries a patent dated 1905.<br/><br/>",

The most imminent threat is the dragon. If you happen to stay on that circle you have to almost start all over again. The game is suitable for smaller children and the dice is the only tool. So there is no skill what so ever needed to be able to play the game. Some reading knowledge might be needed to support the first round to be able to solve what is written. But even the smallest children will get the point after the first round. The advantage of the game, that it is very easy to play, might also be its disadvantage. It gets boring quite fast. Even for the smaller children.<br/><br/>",

The dice are rolled, and players declare how many cards they have that match a single die or a sum of two or more dice.  Later players either raise or call the claim.  Whoever loses the call loses a card from their hand.  The last player with cards wins.<br/><br/>- &quot;Chuck-A-Luck&quot; -- world famous betting Carnival betting game of chance.  Players place a card from their hand next to High, Low, or High/Low, then the 3 dice are rolled.  If their total is 13-18, players who bet High save their card in their winnings plus a card from the dealer; if 3-8, those who bet Low do the same; if 9-12, those who bet High/Low save their card but with no extra card.  After all the cards are played out, players reveal their saved cards, and the highest total wins.<br/><br/>- &quot;Good Riddance&quot; -- a fast-paced elimination game.  Players place a card from their hand face up on the table, and the 3 dice are rolled.  Cards that match any die or sum of dice discard their card; if doubles or triples are rolled every player passes a card from their hand to the left; and any player who matches the sum of the dice gets a free roll and discards all cards matching any dice or sum.  When a player goes out of cards, the rest total their remaining cards.  The lowest total after a certain number of rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

There must be one winner from each couple.

Landing on an unowned asset gives you ownership of that asset.

        "description": "'Veils of Verdandi' is a fantasy board game in which players work together to complete a heroic quest.The game has been created with the aim of translating the excitement of interactive storytelling of role-playing games to board games, while simplifying existing game concepts as well as adding new ones.<br/><br/>In the game, players must rescue the nephew of the king, prince Ture, from the dangers and mysteries of the Dark Forest. To do this, the players move across the game board as an adventuring party and visit strange and magical places while battling vicious enemies. But the players must move quickly, for when day changes to night, the Dark Forest becomes much more deadly indeed.<br/><br/>Used in this game are 4, 6 and 8 sided dice for combat and movement across the board, as well as for specific interactive story challenges the game has to offer. Players may buy new equipment and magical items during the game, and train their special abilities to a higher level.<br/><br/>The game is the first in a saga, the next installment of the game, Veils of Verdandi Book II, will carry the story beyond the Dark Forest and into a vast and deadly mountain range, and Slavic mythology. Players will be able to carry over any equipment and skills acquired in the first installment, and use them to defeat such dire foes as the Vampire, the Werewolf, and other dark and dreadful creatures born of mist and moonlight, that will challenge the might and magic of even the hardiest of adventurers.<br/><br/>",

As you play, you will see that each move is like life itself, with rules that allow for freedom of choice and ensuing consequences. Here you will witness the gravity of your own judgement and values, as well as that of others. What will be sacrificed to win the Human Race?<br/><br/>Unlike other games that endorse a win-at-any-cost moral, The Human Race demonstrates that employing such a moral is possible, but not likely to win the game. Points, intelligence, cunning or luck may win the game, but if you play with heart and conscience you will never lose.<br/><br/>Bitterness over loss has no role in The Human Race. For if you lose, it is totally your own doing. The freedom of choice is yours. Whether you play to teach your children or learn about yourself, The Human Race gives you hours of fun.<br/><br/>The rules are simple. The play, intricate. Downright soul-searching. The Human Race.<br/><br/>Playing the Game: First player rolls the white die and moves the number of squares indicated by the die moving in a clockwise direction. If a player lands on a square which points are indicated those points are added if it is a blue square (good)<br/>and deducted from the score if it is a red square (evil). After the player has moved, they draw a blue card or red card determined by their final location, either adding (good) or deducting (evil) points from their score or following the instructions on the card.<br/><br/>Rolling the Life Dice: After following the instructions on the card the player rolls the three black &quot;Life Dice&quot;. If all three dice show the same number then the player dies. If on a red square or has negative points the player is out of the game. If a player dies while having positive points and on a blue square, then even though the player is out, they still may win the game -- that is if all the other players do not reach the Final Resting Place with positive points or if the others die with fewer good points.<br/><br/>Final Resting Place: The game is won by the player to reach the Final Resting Place. If no player reaches the Final Resting Place, then the player who dies with the most good points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Earn tokens by going out first and being named the Pumpkin King.<br/><br/>The goal of Mischief Night is to get rid of all of your cards as fast as possible. The 92-card deck contains 78 monster cards ranked from 1 to 12, along with two Jokers (wild) and a Mischief Night X-deck of 12 cards.<br/><br/>Each monster card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. There are twelve 12&rsquo;s, eleven 11&rsquo;s, ten 10&rsquo;s and so on, and a single card ranked #1 which is the Pumpkin King.  The lower the number, the better the rank. While the #12s are low ranking cards and the hardest to get rid of, they each have a unique ability that may be used during the Mischief Night part of play at the beginning of each round.<br/><br/>In addition to the standard monster cards, there is another deck of twelve special (X) cards with different backs. This deck serves two purposes; it is used before the game starts to determine the starting player order and then 2 cards are earned each round by the player who earned Pumpkin King status.  During the Mischief Round they are very useful in battling the individual special powers of the #12 cards. The more rounds you win, the better chance you have of protecting yourself from the mischief.<br/><br/>",

Do you see a herd of African elephants or a bunch of cotton balls? Every day we are exposed to images that prompt or provoke our psyches. And what we see says a lot about our personalities--or lack thereof. That's why the simple act of seeing images in an ink blot can be so revealing--especially with the assistance of a highly paid, over-educated psychotherapist. But not everyone has that kind of time... or money. Which is exactly why Rorshock! cards are so indispensable.<br/><br/>Game includes 20 ink blot cards and a &quot;Diagnosis Book&quot; and offers multiple ways to play. Play can be as straightforward as one player saying what they see in an inkblot and another player diagnosing it with the closest matching diagnosis for that card in the book. Alternatively, the ink blots can be used to inspire  writing prompts or games of Charades.<br/><br/>",

The road can get complicated if obstacles appear, but in the end, the ants always reach their goal.<br/><br/>On each turn, players use cards to build tunnels to their queen and place obstacles in the other players paths. You must end your turn with exactly five cards in hand. Only one card can be played per turn.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player manages to lower the minimum number of tunnels, in order to place the queen at the end of the course and thus win the game (as long as all the cards are connected). As soon as you have played the required number of cards in a continuous line, you can add your queen to the end of this line in the same turn and win the game!<br/><br/><br/>Hormiguero Infinito<br/><br/>From top to bottom or from bottom to top, connect the paths of the underground maze and create your own anthill.

Or they can try to sabotage their opponents by playing obstacle cards.<br/><br/>ATTENTION: If the queen is not lowered, cards cannot be downloaded from tunnels or grass, since a colony does not exist without it. Once she is there, those cards are lowered until an obstacle is presented. Whoever has one in their anthill cannot continue to download cards until they solve it with the corresponding card.<br/><br/><br/>     The first player to solve all their obstacles and add more than 100 ants to their lowered cards will be the winner.<br/>     There are no more cards in the deck and the players have discarded all the cards in their hand, or that no one can bring down more cards, because the game is blocked. In this case, the dropped ants must be added, and whoever gets the most wins.<br/><br/><br/>",

It all depends on what they choose to be from the card they've picked.<br/><br/>It sounds easy doesn't it, but don't be fooled, as the person can only answer your questions with a Yes or No. Choose your questions wisely as twenty questions will soon fly by or you might be lucky and guess the answer in less!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players race to the finish by rolling a die on their turn and advancing their player piece the number of spaces rolled. The first player whose piece reaches the finish wins!<br/><br/>Players will be asked Bible Trivia questions of their chosen difficulty level when their piece lands on a red ladder or a rope. When a player's piece lands on a red ladder they are asked questions until they give an incorrect answer or reach the top of the ladder. For each question answered correctly the player moves their piece up one section of the ladder.<br/><br/>When a player's piece lands on a rope they are asked questions until they give a correct answer or reach the bottom of the rope. For each question answered incorrectly the player moves their piece down one section of the rope.<br/><br/>If a player's piece lands on any part of a blue ladder or blue chute they automatically move their piece to the top of the ladder or bottom of the chute.<br/><br/>Whenever a player's piece lands on a green arrow an action card is randomly drawn and the player must perform the action indicated on the drawn card. Typical action cards move a player's piece forward or backward several spaces. After moving forward from an action card a player ignores ropes, chutes, and slides but the above rules still apply for ladders. After moving backward from an action card a player ignores ladders but the above rules still apply for ropes, chutes, and slides.<br/><br/>Multiple player pieces can occupy the same space on the board. The first player to reach the finish line wins!<br/><br/>",

One player is chosen as the totalisator manager and collects the starting fees from each horse driver as well as the V5-coupons for betting on individual horses and their final places in the race.<br/><br/>The race itself is a simple roll-and-move affair, with horses allowed to move diagonally, block other horses by running in front of them, and naturally always trying to choose the inner lane to get and stay in the lead. Unsportsmanlike play - ie. not letting your horse win even though you can, maybe because of bets placed - carries a fine.<br/><br/>When a race is over, the manager turns over an odds card and deals out any winnings based on that combined with the V5-coupons, while the total of collected starting fees is dealt 2/3 to the winner and 1/3 to the second. The rules also stipulate that as many races are driven as there are horses in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Three-Card Monte is played one of two ways.  The first method is a children's game in which three cards or objects are laid out face-up.  The cards or objects are then turned face down and scrambled.  The challenge is then to pick out where one of the objects is now positioned.  It's flipped over and the guess is either correct or not.<br/><br/>Variations of this &quot;honest&quot; version are now commonly shown on the big screens of sporting events.<br/><br/>The &quot;confidence&quot; version of Three-Card Monte actually uses 4 cards.  The dealer uses a palming technique to make a card switch, so that the player can't find the correct card.  This method is a rigged game, which often involves the use of a shill to create the illusion the game can be won.<br/><br/>",

Some cards ask for an opinion on interpersonal issues, some present Ozzie and Harriet-type domestic problems then ask for possible solutions.  Certain squares direct you to spin a large spinner built into the game box that directs similar tasks (&quot;Share a time when you had good luck&quot;, &quot;Describe your favorite teacher&quot;)<br/><br/>The game morphs into a Christian version with the substitution of one deck of cards and the use of a spinner overlay.  New spinner directions are like &quot;Say something about forgiveness&quot; and the new cards have Bible verses and stick figure drawings of Jesus doing things.<br/><br/>Great concept, but the execution is a little mundane and unimaginative.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are feeding the hungry fish a fist full of worms (hand of worm cards).  The goal of the base game is to be the first to feed all your worms to the fish (empty your hand).  The fish mechanism gets programmed to know where all the players.  The fish will make jokes, chuckle at players, ask for food, and make other comments while the game is in progress.  When the game finishes, the fish will automatically announce the winner.<br/><br/>To start, every player gets a hand of cards that evenly distribute the 12 worm cards.  The Fish mechanism gets setup by placing it on the base and pushing it's fin.  The fish will spin and ask &quot;Are you ready to play&quot; at one of 4 player positions.  If there is a player at the position, hit the fish fin to confirm.  If not, wait a few seconds and the fish will skip to the next possible player position.  Then the fish spins and randomly stops to face a player.  It makes an automated comment like &quot;I'm hungry&quot; and waits for the player it's facing to add a worm card to it's mouth.  Players need to be quick or the fish will skip the player.  Once you put a worm in the fishes mouth, the fish will make a crunch noise, spin and then randomly stop on a player position, spit the worm card out and chuckle.  It may spit the card out to the player who put the worm in it's mouth in the first place.  This process will repeat and eventually one player will have no cards left in their hand and win the game.  The Fish will announce the winner.<br/><br/>There is also an advance game play variant:  To start the game, separate the cards into stacks by color. Each player chooses the stack of cards that match the color of their player number on the game base. Turn Fish Food ON, and all players press the fish&rsquo;s fin.<br/><br/>Feed the fish when he spins to you, but instead of trying to get rid of your card, try to collect three cards of another player&rsquo;s color! When you have collected three cards in another color, press the fish&rsquo;s fin once - you&rsquo;re the winner!<br/><br/>From the publishers website:  Fish Food is the FINtastic game with the smart fish that knows how to play! If he lands on you, feed him one of your cards. Watch out on the next spin &ndash; he may spit the card back to you! Get rid of all of your cards to win. The fish knows who wins and will call out the winner at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A boardgame where even losing is fun!&quot;<br/><br/>This is a promotional boardgame based on, and published in support of, the 2008 musical comedy of the same name, the name itself being that of one of Eppu Normaali's biggest hits originally published in - you guessed it - 1985. The other two local (but of nationwide fame) artists whose songs the musical is based on are Juice Leskinen, and the band Popeda.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is for each player to try and complete three random tasks around the city, collecting stuff needed to throw a bachelor party for Palle, who's getting married with Karoliina. The game is set in the city of Tampere in the year 1985, and is naturally full of references to the city, it's vibrant rock music scene, and the '80s culture in Finland in general. For example, the two special vehicles with their own playing pieces present in the game are a Datsun 100A compact car and a Solifer Suzuki moped, and one of the tasks is to get 10 kilos of black sausage (a local delicacy) while another is to obtain a portable VHS player for the party.<br/><br/>There are six different characters, based on the characters of the musical, with unique starting points and their own little characteristics such as the ability to call a taxi anywhere with a Mobira Cityman mobile phone, or get on/off a bus at any point in a bus-line.<br/><br/>The first player who succesfully completes three tasks and returns to the central market wins the game.<br/><br/>",

This is done in such a way that by the end of each trick, each player will have a card face down in front of them. These cards are then turned face up and the winner of the trick is determined. So the idea is to use your own good cards to force opponents to take tricks which will, you hope, contain cards which will count as penalties against them.&quot; Stuart Dagger, Counter, November 1999<br/><br/>",

The counters are placed in the box, thus creating a Log Cereal Box. The History Eraser strip is placed in the middle of the table.<br/>In a turn, a player reaches in to the Cereal Box and pulls out a counter. If it is the same colour as your comic strip, you add it to your strip. If it is a History Eraser counter, add it to the History Eraser comic strip in the middle of the table. If it is none of these things, place it back into the cereal box and shake the box well.<br/>If you pull out a log, various things might happen. All players might have to slide their comic strip to the person on their right or left. Or you might be able to take one counter of another player's comic strip and put it back into the box. And so on.<br/>One really annoying rule - if you draw one of your comic strip counters, before you add it to your strip you must quote a line from the show indicated on that particular counter. If you cannot or will not do this, you don't get to keep the counter - it goes back into the box.<br/>The first player to complete their strip, wins.<br/>However, if the History Eraser comic strip is completed before any player's strip, then the game is lost by all players.<br/>For die-hard Ren &amp; Stimpy fans only.<br/><br/>",

There are 349 seats (mandates) up for grabs and the government can only be formed by a force with 175 or more seats.<br/><br/>On their turns, the players move their pieces on the board.  Most of the spaces on the board are Profile spots that give seats to the controlling party.  Players contest for these spaces by participating in a closed bid, using their Argument cards.  The values on their selected cards is added to the value of their party's color on the spot, and the party with the higher total value wins the Profile.  Players can also moving their pieces to the TV debates spot and try to bluff their way to win more seats.  The Chance spots instruct players to draw a Chance card, making them win or lose seats, or even swap electorates.  Players are free to wheel and deal in this game.<br/><br/>The game ends when all seats have been distributed.  The winner is the leader whose party has the required majority.

        "description": "&quot;Being the most agreeable &amp; rational recreation ever invented for youth of both sexes.&quot;<br/><br/>A roll-and-move racing game with 84 space illustrating different stages of a man's life, broken down into 12 ages - boyhood, youth, young man, the prime of life, the sedate man, the old man, and decrepitude. The players race to reach the ending space, depicting The Immortal Man.<br/><br/>RULES OF THE GAME (engraved in the centre of the playing surface)<br/><br/>The Immortal Man, who has existed 84 years, seems worthy of his Talents and Merit to become for the Close of Life, which can end only by Eternity. When we shall arrive at the No.84, we shall have gain'd all we can by this Game, but if we exceed this number, we must go back as many points as we have proceeded beyond it. <br/>The Age of Man is divided into seven periods of 12 years, viz. Infancy to Youth, Manhood, Prime of Life, Sedate Middle Age, Old Age, Decrepitude and Dotage. He passes through life in a variety of situations which are arrange in the order they generally succeed each other. <br/>This game like all others of the same kind is played with a totum, each Player spinning twice in his turn, the only difference is, that the Players cannot stop at any one of the seven ages, but must proceed as many points beyond, as they have in coming to them. Yet as they may spin at the first 2 sixes and consequently would go onto 84, which would be most improper, those who have this chance at first, must content them selves with going to the Historian at 39. <br/>The Studious Boy at 7 shall receive a Stake and shall proceed to 42, the place of the Orator. <br/>The Negligent Boy at 11 shall pay a Stake and shall remain two rounds without spinning. <br/>The Assiduous Youth at 15 shall receive 2 Stakes, and proceed to 55, where he will find the Patriot. <br/>The Triflet at 19 shall pay 1 Stake, and proceed to the Songster at 38. <br/>The Duellist at 22 shall pay 2 Stakes, and return to take the place of the Boy at Number 3. <br/>The Complaisant Man at 26 shall remain there, and let others play until another comes to take his place, and then he shall go back to the place of his liberator. <br/>The Prodigal at Number 30 shall pay four Stakes, and go back to the Careless Boy at Number 6. <br/>The Married Man at 34 shall receive two Stakes for his Wife's Portion and go to be a Good Father at 56. <br/>The Romance Writer at 40 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Mischievous Boy at 5. <br/>The Dramatist at 44 shall pay 4 Stars to the Masters of his Art and shall begin the game again. <br/>The Benevolent Man at 52 shall go to 78 to amuse himself with the Joker. <br/>The Temperate Man at 58 shall go to 82, to find the Quiet Man. <br/>The Drunkard at 63 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Child at 2. <br/>The Patient Man at 68 shall receive 2 Stakes and go to amuse himself with the merry fellow at 80. <br/>The Manhater at 71 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Obstinate Youth at 16. <br/>The Old Beau at 74 shall receive 1 Stake and let each of the others play one round. <br/>The Satyrist at 77 shall pay 4 Stakes and go back to the Malignant Boy at 8. <br/>Lastly the Tragic Author at 45 shall go to the place of the Immortal Man at 84 and win the Game by Succeeding him.<br/><br/>DIRECTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS (engraved in the spandrels) <br/>1. The Utility and Moral Tendency of this Games. <br/>If parents who take upon themselves the pleasing task of instructing their children (or others to whom that important trust may be delegated) will cause them to stop at each character and request their attention to a few moral and judicious observations, explanatory of each character as they proceed and contrast the happiness of a virtuous and well spent life with the fatal consequences arising from vicious and immoral pursuits, this game may be rendered the most useful and amusing of any that has hitherto been offered to the public. <br/>2. Directions for Playing <br/>This game may be played by any number of persons at a time; but care must be taken, that each player makes use of a different mark to move with, and be provided with at least twelve counters each, and agree how much to value them per dozen. <br/>Let us then suppose that four gentlemen agree to play a game together, and stake four counters each. A takes red for his mark, B green, C black and D white. A begins and spins 9 and accordingly places his mark upon No. 9, which is the Docile Boy. B plays next and spins 7, but as the rules of the game specify instead of putting his mark on No.7, he must receive a counter from the pool, and carry his mark to the Orator, at No. 42. C being next in turn, spins only 2, and puts his mark on the place of the Child at No. 2. D being the last player spins 11, and goes to the Negligent Boy; but this being a forfeit, he must pay a counter to the pool and remain two rounds at No. 11 without playing in his turn. A now resumes the totum and spins 3, which brings him from No. 9 where he was to No. 12, but this being one of the seven ages, he cannot stop there, for agreeable to the rules of the game he must proceed as far beyond the age to No. 15, the place of the Assidious Youth; but instead of that he must receive 2 counters from the pool and go to No. 55, the place of the Patriot. B now takes the totum and spins 6, when being already at No. 42, the place of the Orator, he should naturally go to No. 48 but that being the age of the Sedate Man, he must proceed 6 points beyond 48 and put his mark on the place of the Vigilant Man at no 54. C's turn being but instead of stopping at this last number (according to the rules of the game) he pays a counter into the pool and goes to the place of the Songster at No. 38. D must as already mentioned also remain this round without playing. A again takes the totum and spins 2, and being before at No. 82 compleats No. 84 takes the place of the Immortal Man and wins the game.<br/><br/>NB. It is necessary to inform the Purchaser the Totum must be marked with the figures 1-6 and avoid introducing a dice box into private families, each player must spin twice, which will answer the same purpose.<br/><br/><br/>The playing sheet is numbered in an anti-clockwise direction starting from the lower left corner. Each compartment shows a boy or a man at ages between 1 and 84. These are:- <br/>1. The Infant; 2. The Child; 3. The Boy; 4. The Darling; 5. The Mischievous Boy; 6. The Careless Boy; 7.

        "description": "&quot;Rrrum um's Eck!&quot; or &quot;Rrround the Corner!&quot;<br/><br/>Over the years Spielbox magazine has published some great games in its magazine. Usually they are originals by well-known authors that have appeared nowhere else, and at times they were so good that they were later appeared in full-on productions. Sometimes they were welcome reprints of highly regarded and hard to get games (3m's Jati). Exactly what prompted the republication of this old German children's game is better left the mystery it is, as there is very little remarkable about it. Maybe it was a great game by 1931's standards, but the German market by 1986 should have left a game like this in a corner best forgotten.<br/><br/>It is what can be typified as a Snake-and-Ladders game without the ladders, or 1-pawn Ludo with traps in which the prettiest girl may start. Players make their way with a single pawn from start to finish along a track of 6 rows, each 7 spaces long. The last square (on each row end before turning the corner) is a trap. When a player's pawn lands in one of those traps it will be sent back to square one, but not before a 6 is rolled to release the pawn from the trap. The only quicker way to start all over again is when another player lands in the same trap, because any player ending a move on another pawn's square sends that pawn back to the very beginning. Can it get worse? Yes, by landing in the last trap, because you get an immediate &quot;mercy&quot; die roll. A 6 means instant victory, any other number rolled will mean permanent removal from the game.<br/><br/>Maybe it was a reminder how far German game design had progressed in the 55 years since 1931. Saying that, it probably takes some considerable skill to make a game that is worse than Snakes-and-Ladders into a classic that warrants a reprint in one of Germany's most respected game magazines. What were they thinking.<br/><br/>Publishing history: this classic German family game can be traced back all the way to 1931 and appears to have been in print for a while. Much later it was reprinted by Spielbox magazine (4/1986 Aug-Sep) as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. It was presented with the original artwork and with an exact replica of the original rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of box:<br/><br/>Hooked (tm) is an exciting board game of chance and skill that keeps everyone at the edge of their seat.  Players never know what the next move will bring.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>To move your boat as quickly as possible to the fishing grounds (required at least four times), pick up your fish (one fish per trip), deliver it to the processor at some point during the game and then return to your home port.  The first boat (team) to deliver all four fish to the processor and return to its home port wins the game.  Advancing around the board becomes more of a challenge when the team members must guess mystery words related to the ocean, seashore or boats by the means of CHARADES and SKETCHES.  There are short cuts and good news/bad news situations that also come up during the game which make HOOKED(tm) even more exciting and always changing.  Playing time is about 60 to 90 minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>Requires at least four players (two teams) to play.  Up to four teams (eight players) can play.  Teams take turns rolling the die and moving the boat and following the directions on the space landed on.  Spin the spinner when instructed and following the instructions.  In SKETCH situations, one player must guess the mystery word based on clues drawn by the partner.  If the mystery clue is correctly guessed, the team goes again.

        "description": "This old game comes in a huge box (20&quot; x 13&quot; x 5&quot;).  It consists of five components only - a large plastic clam-like frog with identical halves almost 12&quot; long and wide; two thick plastic oval beetles 4&quot; x 6&quot; and two 20&quot; long solid plastic tubes (the 'boppers').  The two halves of the frog are joined by a hinge at the rear which causes the frog to lock in an open position when set.<br/><br/>The beetles are placed on the ground an equal and agreed distance away from the set frog and must be 'bopped' into the frog using the plastic tubes provided.   This is accomplished by whacking the plastic tube on an edge of the beetle, causing it to fly up in the air.  The first player to successfully bop their beetle into the frog causes the frog to snap shut and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The field is laid out on a 30 by 21 grid. Play alternates between the Offense and the Defense. The ball is advanced by passing dribbling and heading. When a defensive man is within specific distances from the ball and attempt can be made to tackle or intercept. The result is determined by throwing a die, but strategic placement of the men can affect the odds. Goal tries are similarly determined by die throws adjusted to the positioning of the goalkeeper and other defensive players.<br/><br/>From Designer's Notes:<br/>KICK-OFF Soccer has been developed to follow as closely as possible the real game of soccer.  The strategy and tactics are the same, as are most of the rules.  Soccer is not a complicated game.  There are very few set plays, these mainly arise on Corners, Free-Kicks and Throw-Ins.  The game is played through with the skills, flair and innovation of individual players working together as a team.  And so with &quot;KICK-OFF&quot;, by using simple Basic Moves, the flair and innovation has been left up to the individual player.<br/>After playing one or two games of &quot;KICK-OFF&quot;, the method of play becomes easy and only brief reference is necessary to player and ball movement, and die throws.  The die throws do not determine the outcome of the game, they merely simulate the chances played in real soccer.<br/>&quot;KICK-OFF&quot; has been play tested by enthusiastic &quot;youngsters&quot; aged from eleven to adult.  For the young enthusiasts, some adult assistance was found advisable at first, but once advised, they were at home with &quot;KICK-OFF&quot; as they were on the real field!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spear Song is a set of tabletop wargame rules primarily based on the Dark Age/Medieval period. By concentrating on the 'mechanics' of pre-gunpowder warfare, rather than focusing on particular armies or battles, the system should be flexible enough to cater for the historical preferences of most players who are interested in this era. Rules for chariots and 'Eastern style' warriors further increase the potential by allowing for Celtic or Crusader type settings.<br/><br/>Whilst the rules are mainly designed to create skirmishes and small-scale actions, a section is also included to enable larger scale battles to be fought using the same basic system.<br/><br/>Each major section of the text is followed by a fictional narrative that explains how the system works in game terms, and an introductory scenario based around the narratives is provided to familiarize players with the game.<br/><br/>As with other Dropwing systems, it is intended to extend the historical material that we produce in line with market demand. Having said this, Spear Song provides a 'stand alone' system in it's own right, which provides players with the basic material to fight battles using a wide variety of warriors from the 'Sword and Shield' era.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wicked Narrows covers the Roman disaster in the Teutoburg Forest on September 9th, 2 A.D. Led by one of Rome&rsquo;s favorite son&rsquo;s, German born Arminius, turned on those that loved and trained him, leading four German tribes (18000 men) into deadly battle with Varus&rsquo; Roman Army. The German ambush at the Kalkriese Narrows ( a narrow strip of land only 220m wide) caught the Romans by complete surprise with an am-bush. One the 2nd day, all 20000 Romans had been killed. This game focuses on the second day as the Romans approached the narrows and the German attack !<br/><br/>The map scale is about 550 yards per hex. Each combat unit is a cohort of 500 men for the Roman and between 500-1000 men for the German. A game turn represents one hour of time.<br/><br/>The design is unique and captures the flavor of battle during this period. The game depends upon the German player and when he launches his devastating attack. In fact, until the German attacks, the Romans simply casually march towards their destination. When the attacks begin, blood will spill across the map as the Romans try desperately try to maintain damage control. But this is hard, as the German tribes create an attack like a shark frenzy, which only continues to become more barbaric!<br/><br/>The battle sequence contains three rounds of types of combat, leaders and morale are vital and is impacted by what happens in the combat rounds.<br/><br/>One 11x17 Map, rules, 280 counters. Still only $16.00. Designed by Kerala Cironi. Developed by Perry Moore.<br/><br/>",

In March 1920, as the White Army retreated to their last escape route, the British, which had supported them with material since 1918, finally committed a battalion of troops to secure the port. At sea, several battleships and the first aircraft carrier provided cover. On shore, the fighting was desperate using all available resources including tanks.<br/><br/>The game depicts the situation from March 20th to 27th, when the last evacuees left and the Reds stormed into the city.

        "description": "This is a religious-themed trivia game for members of the Latter Day Saints (Mormon) church.  The trivia questions are religious in nature and are asked and answered in a mechanism simulating a simple baseball game. The key to the game is the question and answer booklet, which includes two pages of rules and 53 pages of questions. Each page has six numbered questions and answers. There is a cardboard field inset in the box and plastic pegs to use as runners.<br/><br/>For each &quot;at bat&quot;, the batting player rolls a D6. For the first batter, the &quot;pitcher&quot; on the opposing team reads that numbered question from page 1. If the player answers correctly, he receives the result designated for that question. If he answers incorrectly, he is out. Pegs are placed on the field and advanced accordingly. One roll on each page provides a result without a question.<br/><br/>With each succeeding batter, the question moves to the next page of the booklet, allowing a long game before any possibility of a repeated question arises. As per normal baseball rules, three outs ends an inning and the team with most runs scored after nine innings wins. The game seems to expect high scores: there are holes in the scoreboxes for 24 runs by each team.<br/><br/>Many of the questions are very basic: &quot;Who was the real father of Jesus?&quot; (God). Others require more detailed knowledge of the Mormon church: &quot;Name the brother of Joseph Smith whose name begins with the letter H who was one of the Eight Witnesses&quot; (Hyrum), or &quot;Which of the following is not an office in the Melchizedek Priesthood: Elder, Seventy, Teacher, or High Priest?&quot; (Teacher).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Good News! Bad News! game is a cross between Monopoly and Life with a twist.  You can move your pieces by using a roll of the dice (Luck) or you can use the Rubik's cube-like pyramid called a &quot;Pyraminx&quot; (Minimal SKill) to decide how far to move.  By twisting the pyramid in a certain way you can guarantee yourself so may places to move. Avoiding low paying vocation spaces, for which you qualify initially, maximizes your chance to later get more than your fair share of the lucrative positions after attaining higher educational qualifications. Of course, even an expert can not expect to get all of the best jobs, but what you can do is leave some low paying ones vacant and &quot;Bad News&quot; all opponents into financial oblivion!<br/><br/>The designated &quot;Adult cards&quot; can be excluded when playing with children or adults who are sensitive to the subjects on the Bad News cards. No cards are really X-rated, but some Adult Cards quote embarrassing subjects from newspapers or TV which must pertain to someone! Use discretion and delete cards which could be found objectionable. Or just go ahead and offend your friends!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Can YOU gain freedom for the oppressed minorities? Or as the Russians can you preserve the last multinational colonial empire in the world? Play this game and find out!&quot;<br/><br/>The focus of this game is the struggle of five minorities (Armenians, Balts, Belorussians, Moslems and Ukrainians) to establish republics independent of the central Soviet government (which, in practice, was actually that of the Russian majority). They do this by declaring secession (consistently misspelled &quot;succession&quot; in the rules) and defending its breakaway move. Combat is conducted by matching cards and either &quot;battle&quot; or &quot;guerrilla&quot; tactics, which leads to gain or loss of support points. Play is varied by events (e.g. Sino-Soviet War), foreign support (from America, China, Iran or Western Europe), and betrayals. The Soviet players wins by playing all five reform cards (e.g. &quot;release political prisoners&quot;, &quot;purge hard-liners&quot;)and having no independent republics. The Minorities win by having at least three independent republics in play.<br/><br/>",

The player then has up to four choices on how to move his wheelbarrow around the circular board: by the amount shown on either die, by the sum of the dice, or by the difference between the dice.  Every time the player lands on a wheelbarrow space he may add another piece of food to his wheelbarrow.  The first player to fill his wheelbarrow and return to his animal's stall wins the game.<br/><br/>Additionally, every time the player passes another player he must make his own animal's sound.  Whenever he passes an animal shown on the board he must make its sound.  If a player fails to make the correct animal sound he must return a piece of food to the stockpile.<br/><br/>The box recommends ages 6 and up, but the gameplay seems more suited for ages 3-7.<br/><br/>Components: The game board and other pieces are all of cardboard construction.<br/><br/>",

The cards are color-coded, so there is a blue, a red, a yellow and a green tile for each profession. <br/>One color is picked out and the 12 tiles are placed openly on the table. Each player picks one of these. <br/>Then players take turns flipping open a tile from the draw stack. If the tile belongs together with that player's first tile, he/she can keep it. Otherwise it is openly discarded. The next player can take it if he/she needs it, then draw a new tile as usual. When a player thinks he/she has 4 matching tiles, the tiles are placed on top of a large plastic cube. A mirror shows the backside of the tiles - if these form a picture of the profession, the player keeps the set. <br/>When all sets have been distributed, the player with most sets is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is themed for the a German children's TV show called &quot;Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten&quot;<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Theme - A fortune telling game based on cards and pendulum. Played solo or between two players with roles of questioner (later on just Q) and interpreter (N). The interpreter leads the game and the questioner is the one receiving information about his/her home, work, personality, love, future and past.<br/><br/>Game-play - The game-play is divided into two phases 1) the card turning and 2) the pendulum swinging.<br/><br/>1) The card turning phase starts by picking up the proper coloured scarabs to the game board; the hair, eyes and favourite colour of the Q. The Q shuffles the purple 54 card deck and hands it over to N. N divides the deck into 3 separate decks of 18, 9 and 27 cards. The cards are dealt on the game board in the order 18, 27 and 9. The 18 cards are dealt on locations shown at the front page of the rule leaflet. The cards have 6 words in them and one of those is picked depending which is forming a pyramid with the game board (the black half of the pyramid on the left side of the card and the white half of the pyramid on the game board). While the cards are dealt, the N questions the Q if the word on the cards have any special meaning. The forming words are related to either home (1st vertical row), work (2nd), personality (3rd), love (4th), future (5th) or past (6th), depending which vertical row the cards are placed to. The 27 cards are then dealt on the game board (some restrictions apply, see the rule leaflet). Then the deck of 9 cards is used as a key to whole interpretation. At last the rest cards of the deck of 27 are used to check if something is being dominant on some areas of the Q's life. The final interpretations varies each playing time.<br/><br/>2) The pendulum swinging phase starts by placing the four decks of 28 cards onto the game board. The decks are placed on lower part of the game board, around the pyramid (letter A shown on the first page of the rule leaflet). The decks represents the areas of home, work, personality and love. The players decide one of the four categories and Q decides a question he/she wants to get answered related to that category. The transparent pyramid is placed on the game board and the pendulum is used for random number selection. There is numbers of 1-28 around the pyramid on the game board and the random pendulum swing decides the number of the chosen card. The N reads the text on the proper card to the Q. Same is repeated to other categories and questions.<br/><br/>Goal of the game - Interpreting the message gotten with cards and pendulum and gaining more self-consciousness.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>1 game board<br/>1 transparent pyramid<br/>1 pendulum<br/>4 decks of cards (28 cards each)<br/>1 purple deck of cards (54 cards)<br/>2 bags including different coloured scarab buttons<br/>1 rule leaflet (4 pages)<br/><br/>From Finnish intro on the rule leaflet:<br/><br/>&quot;Karnak on kiehtovan j&auml;nnitt&auml;v&auml; ennustuspeli, jota voi pelata yksin tai yhdess&auml;. Se perustuu er&auml;isiin muinaisegyptil&auml;isiin mysteereihin ja kulttuuriperinteisiin.

Purpose of this game is to help students revise information about ecology.<br/><br/>Game box includes: 12 tiles with questions and tasks, chart with correct answers, 4 pawns and a dice.<br/><br/>Game is played by 4 players. They randomly choose pawns' colours and thus are assigned names: green &ndash; producer, blue &ndash; primary consumer(herbivore), red &ndash; secondary consumer(carnivore), black &ndash; decomposer(saprotroph). Green pawn moves first, next is blue, then red, and black last. Players move their pawns on the board by the number of fields indicated by the dice.<br/><br/>The are 12 marked fields on the board. Whenever a player's pawn steps on any of those fields he takes a questions and tasks tile with the number of field he stepped onto. He has to read a question or task aloud an immediately answer it. Illustrations near the board's edge might help. Answer is then checked with the chart.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who acquires the most points. For every correct answer player is awarded 3 points. Bonus for track completion: 1st place &ndash; 3 points, 2nd place &ndash; 2 points, 3rd place &ndash; 1 point. For incorrect answers players have to skip a turn. If there are any unanswered questions behind the last pawn, players that have reached finish line can try to answer them.<br/><br/>",

These zoos don&acute;t consist of &quot;ordinary zoo-animals&quot;, instead there are for example aliens, monsters, ghosts and wherewulfes.<br/><br/>The game mechanics is very simple. You start with some cards in your hand, and there are cards of four different kinds.Different colours on the back sides of the cards. Different families, but within each family the cards have different values. Each familiy (group of cards) are placed faced down in four different piles. On your turn you discard one card from your hand and take one card from the pile of that family. Then you try to get cards with as much value as possible, and the player with the best total value (points) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Conquer the islands and increase your wealth so you can be a powerful admiral.<br/><br/>Have you found a section of ocean where there are several islands that are not under the power of any kingdom or country and it is your duty to land on them and claim its riches for you. Be careful as other pirates have been established on nearby islands and are in search of new domains, you will fight them, showing who is the most powerful captain, using your ships to take out your opponents.<br/><br/>Have fun, managing your ships, conquering islands landing in their ports, increase your wealth,  and if necessary destroy your opponents by blowing up your traps. Who will be the most successful captain?<br/><br/>The board represents a section of ocean with several islands, each with its port and wealth. Each island has a number that represents wealth and every time you take possession of an island, its richness is added to the total wealth of the player.<br/><br/>Each turn each player can make up to six actions that can be: Build, move or disembark. Additionally, the player may attack one or more opponents or blow up one of his traps.<br/><br/>There are two ways to end the game:<br/><br/>1 - Time limit: At the beginning of the game  a limit of time is proposed. Upon completion of the time the winner is determined by the number of ships that the player have on the board and the wealth earned.<br/><br/>2 - Total Victory: The game ends when one player remains on the board or when a player takes possession of all shipyards.<br/><br/><br/>Del editor:<br/><br/>Conviertete en un poderoso capit&aacute;n acumulando riquezas y dominios.<br/><br/>Eres un joven capit&aacute;n a cargo de tu propia flota de barcos, buscando fama y fortuna.

If the spinner comes up &quot;win&quot; then you win, if it doesn't, the game goes on.<br/><br/>On their turn, players roll dice trying to match fruit machine symbols. They can only move if they match at least two symbols. They can gamble on rerolling some dice to improve their move, but with the risk of forfeiting their go completely.<br/><br/>After moving, players will collect a certain amount of money based on how many symbols they rolled. They can then bank this money or gamble it by rolling a special six-sided hexagonal metal dice.<br/><br/>The game is mainly of interest for the incorporation of different luck-based elements: four six-sided dice with fruit symbols, three six-sided dice with numbers, one six-sided metal hexagonal dice to gamble with (which has sides labelled &quot;lose,&quot; &quot;double win,&quot; and &quot;treble win&quot;), and one six-sided spinner.<br/><br/>",

If you were lucky and picked for the show, you not only fulfilled your ambition, you were also awarded a Jim Fixed It For Me badge. This became a much sought after item.<br/><br/>The players are children, wanting to have an ambition accepted. A 'Jim' playing piece starts life on the board and is moved by a Jim spinner. The player moves by a normal die. The objective is to land exactly on the same square as Jim. If you do, you draw four cards. The cards say things like &quot;I would like&quot;, &quot;I wish&quot; etc., and also the subject of a dream wish, something like water-skiing or flying. If you can make a legitimate statement out of the four cards, you win. But this is unlikely on the first attempt and you will need to meet Jim again. If you do, you add two cards to your original four and again try to form a legitimate statement. If you can't, you discard two cards and you will have to meet Jim again.<br/><br/>The first player to fulfil a request with their cards, wins.<br/><br/>",

The player who has gathered most cards is the winner.<br/><br/>Before starting to play, shuffle the 24 cards well and place them on the fields with the blue side upwards and with the poles of the sign posts pointing all in the same direction. No card should be placed on the field with the traffic lights. This field is used to place the pieces. Now agree on a player who starts, and then alternate clockwise. The player whose turn it is throws the dice and forwards his piece on the game board by the number of pips. After starting the game, the field with the traffic lights must not be entered again. You may move in all directions but not diagonally. During a move you may change the direction as often as you want. However, you have to keep two things in mind: you must not move on to a field twice during a move, and at the end of the move you must not arrive at the starting field. Bad luck, if you throw a six, because you will have to miss this turn. If a move ends on a field with a card, you have to guess which of the two signs shown on the blue side is displayed on the yellow side of the card. Subsequently look whether the traffic sign you think is shown on the yellow side. If the guess was correct, the player may take the card. The player places this card with the blue side upwards in front of himself. If the guess was wrong, the player has to return the card to the same place on the game board. If one card only is left on the game board, the player whose turn it is may throw the dice twice and move. If this card has been removed as well, every player counts his cards. The winner is who has most cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from Amazon<br/>Now is your chance to build the custom Hot Wheels car you've dreamed of! Packed in a clever and portable lunch box, Body WorX has you put together parts of Hot Wheels cars printed on cards. The player who puts together the most cars wins the game. Box measures about 5-inches tall x 5 1/2-inches wide x 2 1/4-inches deep. Ages 4 and up, 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Players have a hand of cards. They are attempting to complete a Hot Wheels set: one &quot;tires&quot; card, one &quot;chasis&quot;, one interior, one exterior. The cards have to be collected and played in order.<br/><br/>There is a drafting mechanic not unlike Uno. Players may draw from the top of the deck blindly or select the top discard.<br/><br/>There is some &quot;take-that&quot; where players can slow down their opponent's progress by giving them a &quot;flat tire&quot; card or some other setback card.<br/><br/>",
