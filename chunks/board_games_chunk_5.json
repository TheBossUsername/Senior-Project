        "description": "Hordes can be viewed as either an expansion to Warmachine, or a totally separate game using the same system.  Either way, it contains four new factions and is based on the same system.  It is 100% compatible with Warmachine.  Rather than the steampunk theme of Warmachine, Hordes focuses on the more primitive tribal powers:  Trollblood, Skorne, Legion of Everblight, Circle Orboros, Farrow (pig-men) and Gatormen.  They wage war with great warbeasts in place of warjacks and, instead of warcasters, have warlocks that draw power from their beasts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 2010, designer Klaus Teuber overhauled the two-player Catan card game with the release of The Rivals for Catan &ndash; released in Germany as Die F&uuml;rsten von Catan &ndash; and in 2011 Teuber, Kosmos and Mayfair Games present a new multi-player card game set in the Catan universe: The Struggle for Catan, aka, Die Siedler von Catan: Das schnelle Kartenspiel.<br/><br/>As in the original The Settlers of Catan board game, players need to manage their resources in order to build settlements, roads, cities, city improvements and knights, all of which grant victory points (VPs) or special abilities. Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities! The first player to have ten VPs wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is dice-less and resource gain and exchanging is based on each player's developments making this version less luck dependent than the original. A twist in the game is that certain developments are limited and can be stolen from other players once there are no new ones left. The first player to gain 10 victory points, wins the game.<br/><br/>(Note that Kosmos lists this game with a 30-minute playing time, while Mayfair Games sets the playing time at 45-60 minutes.)<br/><br/>Mixing two copies of game, can be played with 5 and 6 players.<br/><br/>",

Playing as either Kennedy or Khrushchev, your aim is to exit the Cuban Missile Crisis as the most powerful superpower. During the game you play only five strategy cards that you use to place Influence on battlegrounds to score majorities or manipulate battlegrounds. Each card you play turns into a new battleground, so the &quot;world map&quot; is ever-changing. Be careful because each decision is important and you may trigger global nuclear war!<br/><br/>13 Minutes, a sequel of sorts or different take on 13 Days, builds on the classic microgame genre heralded by Love Letter, but 13M uses the card-driven game mechanism to ensure that the five cards you play each game all adds up to agonizing choices!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beyond the last continent on the remote island Windbark, diving is an ancestral tradition. During a rite of passage celebrated at the summer solstice, divers compete to retrieve the sacred stone of the village. The elder throws it from the top of the cliff, and the stone leads the contenders for the title of &quot;hero&quot; down to the depths of the ocean, aided in their quest by friendly sea turtles and manta rays.<br/><br/>However, to retrieve the stone, they will need to avoid upsetting the sharks that inhabit the ocean...<br/><br/>Dive plays simultaneously for all player divers, who start the game facing a shuffled stack of 36 transparent &quot;ocean&quot; cards. You have your own diver board and a set of five air tokens that are numbered 1-5 on both sides, with a shark on one side of each token.<br/><br/>Dive explores the notion of perception, the ability of the divers to observe the ocean through a deck of transparent cards and to benefit from their observations. At the start of each round, you look into the &quot;waters&quot; before you to see how far you want to dive, with five levels being the maximum you can go (since you have five tokens). You then place the tokens on your board:<br/><br/><br/>     If you think a shark is at a certain level, you need any tokens on this level to be shark side up &mdash; and if you goof, calling &quot;shark&quot; when no shark is present or vice versa, then you remove all tokens from your diver board at this level and at deeper levels. You're done for the round.<br/>     If you think a certain level has a sea turtle or a manta ray, you might want to stack tokens on this level because whoever places the highest sum advances 1-2 spaces on the descent board (for a sea turtle) or moves onto the player token directly in below them on the descent board (for a manta ray).<br/><br/><br/>If you've finished evaluating a level for sharks, sea turtles, and manta rays, and anyone still has an air token on their board, you explore the next level. Once no one has any air tokens for the next level, the round ends, and everyone advances on the descent board equal to the number of levels that they successfully dove. Once you reach space #16 on the descent board, you can't use a manta ray to catch up to anyone, and if you fail the shark/no shark question for a level, you don't advance at all during that round, regardless of how many levels you first dove through successfully.<br/><br/>Dive includes rules for solitaire play in which you compete against the village chief, and you can optionally play a competitive game with animal companions that give you a one-time bonus.<br/><br/>",

This UNO card deck is double-sided with a &quot;light&quot; side and a &quot;dark&quot; side. You start off playing with the light side, but if someone plays a Flip card, you have to switch to playing the dark side. And on the dark side, there are different action cards with stiffer penalties. Instead of a Draw One card, the dark side has a Draw Five card. Instead of a Skip Card, the dark side has a Skip Everyone card. You have to continue playing with the dark side until another Flip card is played.<br/><br/>If you don't know how to play UNO, each player takes a turn matching a card from their hand to the card on the top of the discard pile, either by number, color, or symbol. If you don't have a match, you must draw a card from the draw pile.<br/><br/>The symbols represent the action cards, such as Wild, Skip, Wild Draw 2, Draw One, and Reverse. This version also includes a Flip card that turns the cards to the dark side, which has the following actions: Draw Five, Reverse, Skip Everyone, Wild, Wild Draw Color, and Flip.<br/><br/>When you play your next-to-last card, you must yell &quot;UNO!&quot; to indicate you only have one card left. If you don't yell &quot;UNO&quot; and someone catches you, you must draw two cards. Once a player runs out of cards, the round is over, and that player receives points for all of the cards left in their opponents' hands. Play until one player reaches 500 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Ruhr: A Story of Coal Trade, the second game of Thomas Spitzer's historic coal trilogy, you are transported to the Ruhr region in the 18th century, at the beginning of the industrial revolution. Coal, after being discovered in Haspelknecht, is in high demand as cities and factories throughout the region are in need of this coveted resource. The Ruhr river presented a convenient route of transportation from the coal mines. However, the Ruhr was filled with obstacles and large dams, making it incredibly difficult to navigate. Trade coal for valuable upgrades and plan your route to victory along the Ruhr!<br/><br/>In more detail, the players transport and sell coal to cities and factories along the Ruhr river in the 18th and 19th centuries. By selling coal to cities and factories, players acquire unique progress markers. In the beginning, players have access only to low value coal. By selling coal to certain locations, players gain access to high value coal. In addition to selling coal, the players build warehouses, build locks, and export coal to neighboring countries in the pursuit of the most victory points.<br/><br/>This game, an updated version of Ruhrschifffahrt 1769-1890, includes the standalone expansion The Ohio: 1811-1861. In this game, players transport and trade goods along the Ohio River during a time when Ohio was granted statehood and became heavily populated as its industries flourished. The Ohio is played in a manner similar to The Ruhr, but with new and additional elements.<br/><br/>",

Climb the Cliffs of Insanity, brave the Fire Swamp, and help Buttercup, Westley, Fezzik, and Inigo Montoya survive the dastardly machinations of Prince Humperdinck, Count Rugen, and Vizzini. Follow the incredible story of The Princess Bride through six chapters and work together to keep the plot on course despite Shrieking Eels, kissing, and constant interruptions! Will the forces of evil &mdash; or true &quot;wove&quot; &mdash; prevail?<br/><br/>In The Princess Bride Adventure Book Game, players work together to advance the plot and tell all six chapters despite interruptions from a sick grandson. Each chapter is represented by a new board within a &quot;book&quot; of game boards. Instead of each player controlling a single character, players cooperate to complete challenges by moving characters and discarding story cards from their hand.<br/><br/>Each chapter has a series of challenges that require characters to be in specific locations and specific story cards to be discarded from a player's hand. All challenges must be completed before players can advance to the next chapter. A chapter can be interrupted by different story-based conditions or by the grandson. Players have one more chance to complete the story after an interruption, or they lose the game. Special story cards earned as a reward for completing challenges as well as miracle tokens give players more options and help them along the way.<br/><br/>The Princess Bride Adventure Book Game includes paintable miniatures for Westley, Princess Buttercup, Prince Humperdinck, Count Rugen, Vizzini, Inigo Montoya, and Fezzik.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They do not compete by brazen force of arms, but within the confines of Confucian philosophy. Subtle influence is wielded, gifts are given and received, setting up a network of relationships that will lead one family to dominate the government under a benign Emperor. Players of Confucius participate in this discreet and delicate struggle for power. As well as influencing the three principal ministries of government, leadership of the great exploration and trading fleets will bring renown to the one who heads them, and glory attends the general leading invasions of foreign lands.<br/><br/>",

The pins are initially placed in a tight group in an upright position. Knocking over one pin scores the amount of points marked on the pin. Knocking 2 or more pins scores the number of pins knocked over. After each throw, the pins are stood up again in the exact location where they landed. The first one to reach exactly 50 points wins the game. Scoring more than 50 will be penalised by setting the player's score back to 25 points.

As you play, you activate bonuses for each other and build extra multipliers when you enter the cage together.

        "description": "This game lets each player take on the role of a Northern Chinese prince. His task: the construction of a massive wall. His reward: Honor everlasting! To gain the honor, though, requires some sweat. The requirements are the same for each player. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player shuffles his deck of 20 cards and places it face-down in front of himself. He then draws five cards from the deck. Now, depending on the number of players, 2 to 4 pairs of prestige tiles (with values from 1 to 8) are set out as the starts of card rows.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he first checks to see if he has a point majority in any of the card rows. Then, he carries out two additional actions. He has the choice of either drawing another card from the deck or adding cards to one of the rows. The added cards must  be identical. It is then the next player's turn.<br/><br/>If, when checking point totals, a player sees that he does have one or more majorities, then he chooses one of the prestige tiles and puts it onto one of his cards in that row. That prestige comes at a price: as long as the second prestige tile isn't claimed, the value of the prestige is subtracted from that player's total for that row. Once the second tile is claimed (which can be by the same player on a later turn), then both winning players set the tiles they won aside to score. Two new prestige tiles are revealed and the prestige for that row replenished.<br/><br/>The fight for prestige is also influenced by cards with special actions. For example, if a 'noble' card (1) is played, then the values of all cards in that row are reduced to 1. A 'dragon' card (1) can be played onto another player's card, neutralizing it. 'Cavalry' (2) are worth 2 points, and, equally valuably, do not cost an action. 'Infantry' (5) are strong in groups. A single 'infantry' card is only worth 1 point, but the next one is worth 2, and then 3, etc.<br/><br/>The game ends either when one player has played his last card or when the last prestige tile is taken. Afterwards, each player gets one last turn and then all card rows are resolved in turn order. The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.  Players only receive prestige for tiles they have set aside for scoring.  Tiles remaining on wall segments do not score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Combat! is a solitaire game on man to man combat in the 20th century. The player will control Friendly forces and attempt to complete a scenario against enemy forces that are controlled by the game system. At the start of each turn the player will play 1 card from their hand to the Initiative track. This card will determine the initiative values for each of the player&rsquo;s friendly teams and may have other effects depending on the card. After this the player will assign orders to each character on his side. This will determine the actions that the character can take this turn. Once all of the friendly characters have orders assigned to them the player will draw an Enemy AI Card for each enemy team with alerted characters on the board. These cards will determine the Initiative value for each enemy character and the Order that they will receive. The Order determines the actions that an Enemy Character will take that turn.<br/>The game turn is then played through in 4 Impulses. From the lowest initiative value to the highest each Character (Friendly and Enemy) each Character will perform the action specified on their Order counter. All Characters will act on Impulse 1 before moving to Impulse 2, then Impulse 3 and finally Impulse 4. At the end of the turn all Orders are removed and the played cards returned to the respective decks.<br/><br/>With multiple maps and nearly a 800 counters Combat! will keep you entertained for years to come.<br/><br/>There was a counter printing problem in the first copies, but that was corrected with replacements long ago; any copy you buy should have correct countersheets.<br/><br/>",

Only the most courageous creatures from the world above will descend to the mysteries of the underground and board one of the legendary sewer frigates to challenge destiny and to amass immeasurable treasures.<br/><br/>In Sewer Pirats, deep underground in a maze of domed caverns, narrow tunnels, and piped passages, a motley cast of rodents, insects, and other vermin sail the treacherous waters of human refuse aboard bizarre vessels in search of discarded booty. In order to claim the best haul from the abandoned flotsam, players must make careful use of the unique abilities of their crews' rats, cockroaches, weasels, and other critters. Don't settle for less than left-over fast food and dumped toys. Go for your goal to become a true legend among the sewer pirates.<br/><br/>Players compete in deception and tactics to fill the best positions aboard the three pirate frigates. A pirate's rank determines his share of the expected loot &ndash; but even the best crew ain't worth nothing without their talismans. Each of the three frigates has its special fetish, and no pirate would dare to board her without the matching talisman for fear of terrific calamities.<br/><br/>Sewer Pirats includes three levels of difficulty as well as thirty detailed pirate figures, twenty Color-Click&trade; bases, and a rich assortment of game boards, tokens, and cards. Starter rules get you into the game quickly, and a Crew Member Auction variant increases the strategic depth and lighthearted action.<br/><br/>",

For each cyclist the player chooses one of his available movement allowances and moves that many squares. Once all cyclists have moved, the expended movement allowances are replaced with new ones calculated according to the cyclist's position in the peloton; being at the back of a group brings a high replacement value, and being at the front a low one.<br/><br/>Sprint points are earned by being among the first eight to cross the sprint lines so there is always a trade-off between slipstreaming (&quot;drafting&quot;) the other riders in order to build up high movement allowances and making a break for the front to be the first to cross the finish line.<br/><br/>Note: The first edition from Fiendish Games comes with six teams, but additional teams can be ordered to allow for games with up to twelve people; the additional colors are orange, pink, purple, brown, silver, and gold. The New Order Games edition is for 3-5 players, with a separate expansion allowing an additional four players to compete.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Remade and re-themed Santa Fe. Players own trading settlements on islands in the Pacific and must attempt to get trade routes established in order to make those settlements score points. Trade routes are established by connecting various different shipping companies, represented by different colored Clippers, to land at your island. The more Clippers that land at an island, the more points a settlement there will be worth.<br/><br/>Players control creation of trade routes by six trading companies by laying down wooden sticks that advance the appropriate clipper. The different islands have point values, as well as a set amount of potential settlements and a number of ports that clippers can land at. Throughout the game phases, players will have to manage placing their settlements, claiming option cards, laying track segments, and adding new clippers. With no luck involved, it is a difficult task to both advance the clippers in the way you want without alerting your opponents to your plans. Successful play heavily involves taking advantage of situations your opponents leave open and capitalizing on ports that they make valuable.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, an island will be worth its value multiplied by the number of different companies that have landed at it. Duplicate landings by the same company do not increase the score. For every settlement you have on an island, you will score points. For instance, an island with a base value of 5 that has 3 different companies will be worth 15 points. If you have placed 2 settlements there, it will earn you 30 points. Place your ports too early and no one will send ships there; place them too late and you may not get a spot!<br/><br/>",

Each conquered tile creates new opportunities to tackle tougher tiles around it, both for you and your opponents (so you have to be careful!).<br/><br/>Conquering a tile gets you a reward equal to its difficulty level.

Star Munchkin is a complete game using the best-selling Munchkin rules (with a few new twists like Sidekicks), and it can be combined with any other Munchkin items.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars. The same applies to Italian edition from Raven Distribution.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kings of Israel is a board game taking place in Israel (the Northern Kingdom) during the reign of its kings up until Israel's destruction by Assyria. Players are on a team, with each person representing a line of prophets that are trying to remove evil and idols from Israel, while building altars to help guide Israel in the upcoming difficult years. If the players are able to build enough altars before the game ends, they win. If the game ends by either the team running out of sin cubes or idols, or by Assyria destroying Israel, the prophets lose.<br/><br/>A typical round has four phases:<br/><br/>1.  King's Godliness Phase: During this phase, if a bad king is reigning over Israel, the players must draw a Sin &amp; Punishment card, which means bad things occur in Israel because of evil or in response to evil. If during the reign of a good king, the starting player receives a Blessing card.<br/><br/>2.  Sin Increases Phase: Location cards are drawn and sin increases at each revealed location. This can possibly cause idols to appear or sin to spread further if sin increases at a location with an idol.<br/><br/>3.  Prophets Work Phase: In this phase each prophet gets to use four actions to accomplish their goals. They may use their actions to move, remove sin or idols, draw resource cards, build an altar, make a sacrifice at an altar, or to give resources to another player. A prophets may also play Blessing cards at this time if they have them. In expert mode, after all the prophets take their turn, the false prophet takes his turn.<br/><br/>4.  End of Round Phase: The starting player changes to the next player and the timeline token moves down to the next king chronologically. In easy mode, any player who had made a sacrifice that turn then draws a single Blessing card.<br/><br/>The family version of Kings of Israel is available on the game's website. This version eliminates the King's Godliness phase, Abilities, and the Blessing cards, which makes for an easier, quicker, and more simplified game.<br/><br/>",

Players set up the two different starter armies consisting of seven holy warriors, seven power-harvesting pawns and two power-harvesting uber-pawns. Fourteen warriors came with the starters, fifteen from the first expansion, and fifteen from the final expansion. Instead of the initial fourteen warriors, players may chose to draft seven (per side) of these 44 warriors which are summoned onto the board one-at-a-time during play. They can be promoted to more powerful chess/shogi style movement using power crystals. Many of these warriors have special magic powers (e.g., teleportation, resurrection, obliteration) which can be turned on by spending crystals.<br/>One of the most exciting things about this chess/shogi variant is that there are multiple ways to win: <br/>&bull; Creating a mating solution that forces surrender - Capturing the Navia (She's like the chess/shogi king)<br/>&bull; Getting one's own Navia across and off the other side of the board <br/>&bull; Economic victory by attaining enough power-crystals for your Navia to blast your opponent off the board.<br/><br/>",

(Each good has only five cubes.)<br/>     Buy a special card, which are explained below.<br/>     Pass.<br/><br/><br/>The second action is one of these choices:<br/><br/><br/>     Play goods cards of one color onto cards in the demand row, placing each card played onto a different spot in the demand row, covering the card already present; after you do this, each player with cubes of the color played receives 1 coin for each visible card of this color per cube on their ships. (For example, if red was played and you have two red cubes and three red cards show in the demand row, you gain 6 coins.)<br/>     Draw two goods cards from the deck.<br/><br/><br/>The special cards you can buy aren't worth money on their own, but they can help you earn more coins:<br/><br/><br/>     Ship (costs 10 coins): After buying the ship, place a goods cube from the reserve on it.<br/>     Office (8 coins): After your second action, draw a goods card from the deck; if you have three offices, draw three cards.<br/>     Docker (12 coins): If you exchange goods for your first action, you can exchange one extra goods cube per docker you have.<br/>     Trade agreement (11 coins): If you earn coins in any player's second action, gain 2 extra coins per trade agreement you have.<br/><br/><br/>When the goods deck runs out, the game ends immediately.

On one side are the Athenians and the Delian League, the Demos team; against them, the Oligarchs of Sparta and Corinth are teamed.<br/><br/>The Peloponnesian War is a great setting for a historical game, having two evenly matched factions with very differing capabilities. Athens (and the Delian League, including Corcyra) commanded the seas, and relied on trade to feed their masses. On land, the Spartan phalanx was virtually unbeatable, as all adult Spartan male citizens were professional soldiers<br/><br/>Players of Quartermaster General will find most of the concepts familiar. Since the game has a smaller maximum player count, the amount of activity during a turn has been slightly increased.For example, after the Play step there is a Planning step, when you can place a Prepare card on the table. Prepare cards in Victory or Death work a lot like Response Cards in Quartermaster General, but have a much broader scope of application. Many Prepare cards are used during the Strategy step, which is at the beginning of a player's turn. Much of the game play is structured around putting together effective combinations of played cards and prepared cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Fantasy Fair is about to begin, and storybook characters from all over the realm are coming to town for the show. Everyone knows there's only one place the visitors all want to stay: The Fairy Tale Inn!<br/><br/>It's everyone's favorite home away from home, and like always, the place is going to be fully booked. Each of the Inn's two owners compete to be the one who takes the best care of the guests. They take turns ushering guests into enchanted rooms, gaining gold for strategic placement, and successfully keeping the guests from fighting. (Note to self: NEVER put Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf in adjoining rooms!)<br/><br/>In Fairy Tale Inn, two players try to earn the most gold coins by the end of the game. To set up, players select the character cards of guests who will be present during that game, then take the corresponding character tokens and toss them into the mixing bag. Next, players randomly draw those tokens to fill up the guest list board. After randomly choosing who goes first, the first player gets a gold coin, while the other player gets two. Now the game begins!<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they pick a character token from the guest list board, paying the cost indicated on the board, then they place that guest in the inn, sliding the token into the vertical game board with the colored side facing themselves (while the monochrome-colored side faces their opponent).<br/><br/>After the token slides into the slot, the player may score points based on the room the guest ended up in, as well as any other guests that might be around. Each character has different abilities that say how they give gold to their corresponding innkeeper. For example, the Little Pigs like to be close to one another; they automatically give the player who placed them 1 gold coin and an extra gold coin for each other Little Pig token connected to them. The Big Bad Wolf, on the other hand, gives their player three gold coins for each row where their innkeeper played more Big Bad Wolf tokens than their opponent at the end of the game. (In case of a tie, neither player gets gold.) There's an art to placing guests as several rooms of the Inn are enchanted and will give a bonus or penalty to the player that places a guest there.<br/><br/>The game continues with players picking and placing guests until three columns in the inn have been completely filled. When that happens, players gain gold from characters with end of game abilities, then the player who has gained the most gold wins.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you roll six dice (three white and three black); two dice (one white and one black) form an action. Every roll you must pick exactly two dice to take out (any colour). In the end you combine the six dice any way you want, no matter in which order you chose to take them out of your rolls beforehand. You can use only two actions on your turn. On your development sheet you enter the actions chosen for this turn and note your points. You can also decide to &quot;expand your lab&quot; which will give you bonus actions or points. Other players may pick any action combination from your dice roll to add to their sheet. Do not forget to fight Octopodes. The game ends when each player has 6 turns. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This entry is for the original Jenseits von Theben; for the new printing by Queen, go to Thebes.<br/><br/>Jenseits von Theben is a game of competitive archeology.  Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Periodically, there are expositions at major European cities, and the archaeologist who shows up on time with the best collection of artifacts (plus a minor die roll) wins the purse.  The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and presents the biggest collection to the European exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.<br/><br/>The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact cards.  The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;.  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.<br/><br/>In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.<br/><br/>The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Thebes<br/><br/><br/>",

Then each player will place their one Lord in a Chamber of their choice. Only Courtiers in an Audience Chamber with any player's Lord present will be able to use that Chamber&rsquo;s actions. But be careful, since there are only a limited number of seats available in each Chamber and competing families can push you out of a Chamber!<br/><br/>Then all player Courtiers, in Chambers with a Lord, take turns performing ONE of the two Actions in their Chambers. The powerful Lords may also take both actions in the Chamber they occupy. Chamber Actions allow you to gain Court Cards and to move your Courtiers in the Throne Room onto spaces with square Court Tokens that represent various faction interests and demands at the court. You collect these Court Tokens, which are one way to gain Prestige at court.<br/><br/>When you reach the top space of a Court Office in the Royal Court, you will gain that title - represented by a Ring. A player's Rings are placed and displayed on their individual Player Hand Screens. Positioning your Rings on different fingers project your interests, intent, and inclinations to the other players, because different positions enhance specific Actions that your Courtiers take in the Audience Chambers!<br/><br/>You must always be vigilant, because another players can seize your Court Office, kicking your Office Holder out in disgrace and then taking one of YOUR Rings!<br/><br/>The player with the most prestige at game end wins!<br/><br/>In each game of Tudor, you will choose to play one of many scenario cards, each with their own special rules that can alter the game in dramatic ways.

Board shows an oval track of six lanes, straightforward in straights but graduated on the curves.  Although dice play a part in the game there is plenty of room for skillful maneuvering in the course of each race, which can be from 5 furlongs to 1 1/4 miles.  An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.  Odds on each horse are pre-set and depend largely on the number patterns described above.<br/><br/>Originally released as part of the 3M Sports Games line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.  After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.<br/><br/>Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.<br/><br/>Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:<br/>- discard 2 cards, then draw 2<br/>- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet<br/>- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.<br/>- Sets: if no wilds (&quot;pure&quot;), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets<br/><br/>Then rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth). Most VP wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By design, Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution is not overly complex. The game is based on the highly successful Commands &amp; Colors game system, where the Command cards drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; and the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution, however, introduces many new game concepts, which will add historical depth and provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors player many new play experiences and challenges.<br/><br/>The scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger American Revolution battles, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. In some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent an entire brigade, while in others a unit may only represent a few companies of soldiers. Still the linear tactics of the period, that you will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various American Revolution Armies of the day, and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought. To further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the British and Continental forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards.<br/><br/>Players, that are familiar with other Commands &amp; Colors games, will soon note that unit combat losses in a Tricorne game are typically not as great as other games covered in the Commands &amp; Colors series. This is a direct result of the linear tactic fighting style of the armies that fought during the American Revolution. Unit morale is the main thematic focus in a Tricorne battle as it was historically. Knowing that an entire unit, that has only taken minimal losses when forced to retreat, may actually break and rout from the battlefield, will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.<br/><br/>The 12 battles, showcased in the scenario section of this booklet, feature a stylized battlefield map that emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. These scenarios are a smattering of some of the better-known engagements of the American Revolution.<br/><br/>Bunker Hill -17 June 1775<br/>Long Island (Grant's Attack) - 27 August 1776<br/>Long Island (British Flank March) - 27 August 1776<br/>Freeman's Farm - 19 September 1777<br/>Bemis Heights - 7 October 1777<br/>Bemis Heights (British Redoubts) - 7 October 1777<br/>Monmouth - 28 June 1778<br/>Camden - 16 August 1780<br/>Cowpens - 17 January 1781<br/>Guilford Courthouse - 15 March 1781<br/>Hobkirk's Hill - 25 April 1781<br/>Eutaw Springs - 8 September 1781<br/><br/>",

Wild/Payoff cards give players a choice of where to place their chip and also award cash to all players for their chips on the board: $7 per chip, with a maximum payoff of $49.<br/><br/>The first player to claim four spaces in a row, in any direction, wins.<br/><br/>Zillionaires on Mars and Zillionaires: Road Trip USA keep the same gameplay as in the game's original release, but with dollar values now in the zillions as players bid for lots on Mars or roadside attractions alongside U.S. highways.<br/><br/>Luck: The Game offers the same gameplay in a handy travel bag with the game board printed right on the bag. Theme is based on the Skydance movie, Luck, released on Apple+ August 5, 2022.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>&quot;Reds! The Russian Civil War 1918-1921&quot; is a two-player wargame covering these dramatic events from August 1918 to the start of 1921, when the last organized opposition to Red rule outside the far east was destroyed.<br/><br/>The single large-hex map stretches from Warsaw in the west to Omsk in the east and from Murmansk in the north to Tashkent in the south. Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies.<br/><br/>Units range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Muslim partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train.<br/><br/>To model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side.<br/>From sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player's game. It is also a realistic depiction of some of the most titanic and unusual campaigns of modern history.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; Game Map<br/>    One Sheet of 240 Counters<br/>    Two Player Aid Cards<br/>    One Rule Book <br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE     1-2 months per turn<br/>MAP SCALE     65 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE     Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Armies<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS     Two<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ted Raicer<br/>DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis and Volko Ruhnke<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

These falling stars crashed to the surface, and in the ages to come, became enshrined in legends as the Lost Legacy. Discover where the Lost Legacy can be found and win the game!<br/><br/>Lost Legacy: Second Chronicle contains two sets of game cards: Vorpal Sword and Whitegold Spire. Each set can be played independently or mixed together with other sets to create a unique custom set.<br/><br/>As for how to play, Lost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:<br/><br/><br/>         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.<br/>         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.<br/>         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.<br/>         End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses. In Whitegold Spire, when someone discovers the Lost Legacy, the game ends, everyone tallies the value of the cards they've played and the card left in hand, and whoever has the highest total wins.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.<br/><br/>",

However, players are restricted in connecting railcars of only the same value or good type, so if you grab a railcar you can't use, it needs to wait in your sorting yard until it can legitimately hook up to your train.<br/><br/>Players start with five cargo cards in hand, and four railcar cards are laid out into the Arrival Yard. Each player has one exchange token, representing one of the five cargo types, and whoever is to the right of the start player has the Yardmaster Token. On a turn, a player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired; whoever holds the Yardmaster Token takes a third action on his or her turn, then passes this token to the right. Players can:<br/><br/>    Draw a cargo card from the deck or from the top of the discard pile.<br/>    Buy a railcar by discarding 1-4 cargo cards of the same color as the railcar, with the number determined by that railcar's value.<br/>    Swap your exchange token for another one; you can discard two cargo cards matching the color of your token to represent one cargo card of the proper color when buying a railcar.<br/><br/><br/>Five cargo cards provide bonus actions during play, such as paying less for new railcars or drawing free cargo cards.

Players are all interns on an alien UFO, working for an intergalactic corporation that has one main function: abducting ducks. (For research purposes, duh).<br/><br/>But, ducks need to be collected in specific formations, and you'll have to use spatial logic and cunning to rearrange your ducks before your opponents to win!<br/><br/>Abduct (collect) ducks in specific formations by using action cards to move your (or your opponent's) ducks around. Each player gets an individual stream board that can hold 10 ducks. Put the ducks into patterns by moving them around with action cards. When your ducks in a single color match a pattern on one of the shared formation cards, you earn the card and abduct the ducks into the UFO. Grab more ducks out of the UFO and try to make another pattern before the cards run out.<br/><br/>",

Many other card games are based on the same mechanism (The Great Dalmuti, Gang of Four, Tichu, etc.), but LEXIO uses tiles similar to those in Mah Jong instead of cards, and they are of excellent construction. In accordance with Chinese tradition, the number &quot;2&quot; is the strongest number. The suits are named after the sun, the moon, the stars, and the cloud.<br/><br/>In the game, a player leads a tile or set of tiles, and the other players must follow by either playing a higher tile or set of tiles or passing. The play continues until all players have passed in succession after the final play, and the player who played the last set leads next. Play continues until one player has played all of his tiles. Then each player pays chips to those players who performed better &ndash; that is, the player who went out will get paid by all other players, and the other players pay points to one another based on the difference in the number of tiles each held at the end of the hand. A game lasts five rounds, and the player at the end of the game with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

It has been posted on Consim that because Tunisia had a long run, that the later copies may have a newer version of the of the generic OCS countersheet.<br/><br/>The original game had four countersheets. The inventory listed in the game specific rule book has the following. Two sheets numbered 1 and 2. These have the unit counters for the various sides depicted in the game. Countersheet 3 has 80 generic OCS makers. Sheet 4 is listed as having 140 counters and has more generic OCS counters.<br/><br/>From the discussion on Consim it seem that it is possible some copies had the &quot;Countersheet 4&quot; replaced with a sheet labeled &quot;Countersheet OCS Markers&quot;. So be aware that it is possible that there are two different counter mixes for this game. One with the newer version of the generic OCS counters (with 280 counters.)  and the original &quot;Countersheet 4&quot; with a 140 countersheet.

These highly accurate maps are based on original Civil War maps in state and county archives. In the game, players control Union and Confederate armies in turns representing one day of real time. The game's interactive system of play assures that each scenario will be unpredictable, exciting and competitive.

The first shooting confrontation of the Cold War, and the first limited war of the nuclear age, it is the only time since the Second World War that two of the world's major military powers fought one another - in this case the United States and China.<br/><br/>Diplomatically, the war offers an interesting view of the miscalculation and ineptitude on both sides that led to open conflict. It also brings to light the United Nations' first opportunity to play a leading role in world military events.<br/><br/>Korea: The Forgotten War covers the first year of the war and highlights the mobile phases of the battle.

        "description": "from GMT website:<br/><br/>We are proud to announce the companion game to GMT Games' award winning Europe Engulfed. In Asia Engulfed the action takes place across Asia and the Pacific covering the entire war from the attack at Pearl Harbor to the final collapse of the Japanese empire.<br/><br/>Asia Engulfed is a complete stand alone game or it can be combined with Europe Engulfed to simulate the entire Second World War. A complete set of combined game rules allow for unit transfer, production allocation, and combined victory conditions.<br/><br/>Asia Engulfed focuses on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. Players actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in 6-to-9 hours once players become familiar with its elegant game systems.<br/><br/>Wood Block Units:<br/>Wood blocks are used for both land and naval units to provide a realistic fog of war. Different colors are used for not only the different nations but also for land and naval units so there is no confusion as to what is what and who is who. Only the controlling player knows where their elusive carriers are until combat is engaged. Players will have to decide during their naval reaction move if they have the guts to intercept the enemy's unknown forces.<br/><br/>Supply and Oil:<br/>Asia Engulfed incorporates a unique and simple system to realistically portray the Japanese resource limitations. The further your empire expands from Japan the harder it is to supply and operate your far-flung forces, not to mention defend your perimeter with a navy limited by its oil reserves.<br/><br/>China, India, and Australia:<br/>All three are in play and potential targets for Japanese expansion. Could any of them been captured if Japan had focused its resources? While it isn't likely, they are targets that the Allies have to defend and often seem just out of reach. Optional rules can bring the Soviet Union into the game.<br/><br/>Redesigned Air System:<br/>Air assets are critical to a successful campaign in the Pacific, influencing both movement and supply. A carefully designed area map allows air units to exert control into adjacent areas and move across areas to the next airbase without having to worry about tracking range or counting hexes. Carrier air assets are represented by their own counters allowing for their losses to be tracked separately from the carriers and for the Japanese to husband their elite pilots.<br/><br/>Redesigned Naval System:<br/>The naval system is totally redesigned from Europe Engulfed and along with the air system an integral part of Asia Engulfed. Basing limits, extended range movement, naval reaction movement, carrier day or surface ship night combat, surprise effects, port attacks, invasion support, it's all there and when combined with block limited intelligence and a healthy dose of lady luck every engagement brings the thrill of a potential victory and the fear of a devastating defeat. Even submarines get to put in an appearance as they try to pickoff stragglers.<br/><br/>Production and Strategic Warfare:<br/>Asia Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include Special Actions, Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, Cruisers, Submarines, Land Based Air and Carrier Based Air units, Infantry, Marines, and an assortment of strategic assets. The USA conducts a strategic submarine campaign against the Japanese naval transport system and later in the war is able to direct strategic bombers over Japan.<br/><br/>Special Actions:<br/>Special Actions are an innovative rule system to allow for not only extended operations during the course of a normal two month game turn but also to represent each sides unique capabilities. From code breaking to emergency rebasing, special actions provide a wealth of options for the player who has been able to commit the necessary resources to build them.<br/><br/>Rulebook and Playbook:<br/>The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, combined game rules, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play.<br/><br/>Integrates With: <br/><br/>    Europe Engulfed: WWII European Theatre Block Game<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gin Rummy is a popular two-player &quot;draw and discard&quot; standard deck playing card game derived from Rummy in which players follow basic Rummy rules for forming &quot;melds&quot; of three or more cards of the same suit, or 3 or 4 cards of the same rank. Each turn players draw a single card, either from the top of the discard pile or from the top of the draw deck, and then discard a card from their hand.<br/><br/>Melds are formed in a player's 10-card hand and kept there until a deal is ended by one player &quot;knocking&quot; when he has few enough non-melded &quot;deadwood&quot; cards to &quot;go out&quot;: generally cards whose values total 10 or less (with face cards valued at 10 and aces low), though some variants value differently. The player that did not go out then has the opportunity to place his melds and &quot;lay off&quot; any of his cards that he can add to his opponent's melds. The values of the remaining deadwood are compared and the player with the smallest total scores the difference.<br/><br/>If the player that did not go out's deadwood is the same or less than his opponent, he gets a 20 point (Variant: 25 points) bonus for &quot;undercutting&quot;; if the player that went out with &quot;Gin&quot; by emptying his hand without deadwood, he scores a 25 point bonus (and cannot be undercut, and the opponent cannot lay off deadwood to his Gin meld). The game continues with subsequent deals until one player's total score reaches at least 100. At that point, the winning player is awarded an additional 100 points (he also doubles this score if his opponent has not won a hand).  Each player then scores an additional 25 points for each hand won. The winner is the player with the most points. (Numerous variants and much regional variation occurs in the values assigned to these scores, and many bonuses and additional variations in scoring exist.)<br/><br/>Gin Rummy is distinguished from Rummy in general in being a &quot;knocking&quot; game in which melds are retained in the hand until the end of a deal, and in which it is possible to &quot;go out&quot; without completely emptying one's hand. It is distinguished from games like &quot;500 Rum&quot; in that only deadwood scores.<br/><br/>In Spanish-speaking countries, the game is played with the Spanish deck and it's typically called &quot;Chinch&oacute;n&quot; or &quot;Txintxon&quot; (in Spain) and &quot;Conga&quot; or &quot;Golpeado&quot; in Uruguay and Peru, respectively.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The fast-rolling, hard-hitting, body-slamming, neck-crunching, chair-smashing, table-slapping dice game for 2 or 4 players...<br/><br/>Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game (with optional rules for four-player tag-team play) based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or &quot;Lucha Libre&quot; (a.k.a. free fighting). Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a &quot;count of three&quot; to win by a pin.<br/><br/>The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice.<br/>Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die.<br/><br/>Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. <br/>The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc.  Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit.<br/>If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent.<br/><br/>Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the 'three count' begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match.<br/><br/>In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a hand of six cards that feature an animal on the back and one or two traits on the front.<br/><br/>Each round consists of four phases. During Development, players take turns playing one card from their hand either as an animal (face-down) or as a trait on one of their existing animals (face-up and tucked under the animal). Traits include Carnivorous, Camouflage, Sharp Vision, Swimming, Poisonous and Communication; if a card has two traits, the player chooses which trait the animal acquires, hiding the other trait under the animal. Once a player passes during this phase, he can no longer play cards.<br/><br/>During Food Bank Determination, a player rolls 1-2 dice (possibly adding two to the total) to determine the amount of food available for the round.<br/><br/>During Feeding, players take turns acquiring one food cube and &quot;feeding&quot; one of their animals. Some traits give animals special abilities that can be used during Feeding or at other points during the game. Animals can also be carnivorous, allowing them to attack one other animal to feed &ndash; although that animal might have a defense like High Body Weight or Tail Loss that allows it to survive. An animal can't take more food than it needs unless it has fat tissue, which allows it to store food for future rounds.<br/><br/>During Extinction and Draw, any animal not fully fed dies; the owner takes that animal and all traits and stacks them in his personal discard pile. Each player then receives new cards in hand equal to one plus the number of live animals that player has.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, the players conduct one final round, then score points. Each live animal is worth 2 VP, and each trait on a live animal worth 1 VP; some traits (Carnivorous and Parasite) provide bonus VPs, but make it tougher to keep an animal alive. The player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>By combining two sets of Evolution, you can have up to eight players in a game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Illuminati is a classic Steve Jackson (I) game of world domination. Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.<br/><br/>The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.<br/><br/>How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.<br/><br/>The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.<br/><br/>This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Illuminati Expansion Set 1<br/>    Illuminati Expansion Set 2<br/>    Illuminati Expansion Set 3<br/><br/><br/>Re-published as:<br/><br/>    Illuminati<br/><br/><br/>CCG Version:<br/><br/>    Illuminati: New World Order<br/><br/><br/>Magazine Articles:<br/><br/>    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)<br/>        European Illuminati - New cards.<br/>    <br/>    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)<br/>        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.<br/>    <br/>    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)<br/>        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The most common rule set in games sold commercially as Mancala is for this game of Kalah. Mancala is actually a whole family of games. Kalah was invented in 1940 by an American, William Champion Jr..  He started selling the game in 1944, patented the rules in the 1950's, and founded the Kalah Game Co. in 1958.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. The rows have a large store at either end called the Kalah. A player owns the six pits closest to them and the Kalah on their right side.<br/><br/>The game is started with four (4) seeds in each pit. A player takes all the seeds from one of their pits, and then they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the player's own Kalah, but not into the opponent's store (Kalah). If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured. If the last seed falls into the player's Kalah, they must move again. If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, they capture all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in their Kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of their holes. The remaining pieces are captured by their adversary. The player who has captured the most pieces is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Variants:<br/><br/>Beginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game can also be played with 5 or 6 seeds in each pit. William Champion Jr. recommended the expert game with 6 in each pit.<br/><br/>",

Bartering and trading will soon be supplanted by coins as the dominant medium of exchange throughout civilization...<br/><br/>Lions of Lydia is a bag-management and engine-building game about the dawn of currency. As an influential leader, you send merchants out to barter for resources and increase your landholdings. When the nobles arrive, they bring their Lydian Lion coins into play&mdash;which have unparalleled buying power.<br/><br/>To achieve victory, you must manage the merchants in your bag and complement their abilities with the cards in your tableau. Traditional merchants produce basic resources, which are necessary to build your engine&mdash;but if you fail to convert your resources into coins, you will not be able to buy the most valuable cards! Thus, noble Lydian merchants&mdash;and their golden Lion coins&mdash;are the key to success. When enough properties are developed, the game ends, and a winner is declared!<br/><br/>Will you draft the best merchants to achieve your goals? Will you be the first to gain the most valuable properties? Will you master the new, golden currency: the Lions of Lydia?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A war game that fits in the pocket!<br/><br/>When pressed for time and table space and the hankering for battle hits, this is the perfect remedy - and it is portable!<br/><br/>Tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army: just determine the size of the battle and create your own army from a pool of existing troops.<br/><br/>Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.<br/><br/>Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.<br/><br/>Celts vs. Romans is the first in the Ancients line and also the first in the Pocket Battle series. Each Pocket Battles game will feature two armies from a particular era or genre (yes, fantasy and sci-fi, we are looking at you).<br/><br/>The basic rules of the game are fairly simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).<br/><br/>On you turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one existing token on your unit, it would cost you two additional tokens to activate; if you had three tokens on the unit, it would cost you four additional tokens, and so on).<br/><br/>After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.<br/><br/>The battle is over when one army defeats the other.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>60 tiles, 6 dice, 20 wound/order tokens, 2 player aids, 1 set of rules.<br/><br/>Romans: 1 aquilifer, 5 archers, 4 auxiliares, 1 ballista, 3 cataphracts, 3 cavalry, 1 centurion, 1 imaginifer, 1 imperator, 5 legionaries, 1 onager, 3 praetorians and 1 scorpio.<br/><br/>Celts: 1 champion, 1 chariot, 1 druid, 2 gaesatae, 1 hero, 3 horsemen, 4 javelinmen, 3 noblemen, 3 noble cavalry, 4 slingers, 5 warband, 1 warchief and 1 warrior queen.<br/><br/>",

Powerful arcane runes were hidden in these ancient magical ruins protected by dark and deadly curses. Only the most courageous and adventurous Curse Breakers may enter the temples, break the dark curses, and bring back the arcane runes for the magic academy for its glorious bounty. Through teleportation, you can collect crystals of various colors from all over the world, and put them on your very own Crystal Grid in the correct order. Only then will the power of the crystals fuse together, and be powerful enough to break the dark curses inside the temples. Are you able to rise among your peers, and become the most reliable and professional Curse Breaker the magic academy has ever seen?<br/><br/>In Mystery of the Temples, players take on the role of Curse Breakers, traveling between the wilderness and the temples in order to collect crystals of various colors. Fusing the colorful crystals on the Crystal Grid in the correct order breaks the curse of the temple, and you earn runes and victory points in the process. Once a player has broken five curses, the game ends. Whoever has the highest amount of victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ruthless is a pirate themed game in which players will gather their crew and fight with their opponents.<br/><br/>The primary mechanic of Ruthless is deck building. Every turn a player must play a card or set of cards from their hand after which they may buy new cards to their deck. The deck consists of pirate cards, which allow to attack opponent, draw more cards and perform many more profitable actions, and treasure cards which allow to buy more and better pirates. Treasures can be discarded immediately to acquire gold when needed or added to the deck to benefit repeatedly from their bonus. New crew members are laid out in front of the players and their effects are used at the moment of acquisition.<br/><br/>At the end of each round the players will form poker combinations with the cards in front of them and compare the strength of their crew in play. The player with the strongest crew wins the battle and gains most points.<br/><br/>After five or six rounds (depending on player count) the game is over and the player with most points wins.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

More stations in use of the same type give better advantages. They must be occupied by a scientist before any advantage can be enjoyed.<br/><br/>-deploying scientists : players must pay to bring them into the game. They can be moved around to start using the research stations. Once deployed they remain at this station. When using a station built by another player there is a cost.<br/><br/>-exploration : Up to 3 submarines can be launched when certain requirements are met. These explore outside the base searching for scientific and financial treasures as well as trying to find remains of Atlantis. The amount of built research stations and deployment of scientists greatly aid in the performance of the submarines. <br/>All players have special goals, consisting of sea discoveries that provide more points when recovered.<br/><br/>The game ends when certain tiles or all of the Atlantis tiles are found, when nobody buys/builds anything to expand the base and when not a single sea discovery was recovered.<br/><br/>Points are scored for recovered Atlantis chips and sea discoveries. Discoveries corresponding to the player's special goals score more points. The total of the discoveries is multiplied by the points gained from the stations.

The game is quick (3-6 hours) and clean (map using area movement). Hearts and Minds uses most major events of the period, including proposed events such as the Macnamara Line which was never actually built. Although nominally a combat game, the mechanisms actually revolve around both sides occupying South Vietnamese provinces for propaganda purposes. The heart of the game is political influence. There is little doubt that the Allied player will eventually withdraw his American boys from the quagmire, but the question is, how quickly and in what numbers?<br/><br/>Hearts and Minds contains 80 cards, counters to represent the American army, the ARVN army, the NVA army, VC units of varying hidden strength, the Cambodian army, the Laotian army and a small contingent of international allies. Turn markers, withdrawal markers, reduced movement markers as well CAS (Close Air Support), communist Air Suppression and artillery are also included. More rules cover Air Cavalry, Naval support, Riverine interdiction, and bombers. Untried troops are a liability in the game; Veteran troops are a necessity. Ultimately, the Communist player must deal the American such a crushing public relations disaster that he will abandon his Southeast Asian allies before the momentum of those allies stalemates the irreversible infiltration of South Vietnam.<br/><br/>",

These are played one face up &amp; two face down. The aim is to get the most points. You get 1 point for a stand-alone-hut. You get more if you have huts on adjacent spaces. You have one TIKI (statue) to bring your opponents into trouble. You can put this one on any space you want. If your opponent wants to build there a hut: Bad Luck. There are also two cards which you use to change the color of a hut (to make it yours).<br/> The game ends if one player managed it to place all his huts on the island or if one beach is complete with huts and/or tikis at the end of a turn.<br/><br/>In the advanced rules, it is possible to legally &quot;cheat&quot;. If you play more than three cards, you can build more huts. If you play less than three cards, you can build more easily &mdash; but to prevent some excess, there can be only one denunciation every turn, and you can only denounce another player if you cheat &quot;less&quot; than your opponent!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Song of Blades and Heroes is a fast-play, skirmish-level fantasy miniature system. It uses an action-point system that requires no book-keeping. The rules are designed to be simple, fast and fun so that a mini campaign of several games can be played in a single evening.<br/><br/>The game uses only 6 sided dice and requires approximately 5-10 models per player. The rules recommend 15 mm figures on a 60x60cm play area, but can be played in other scales. There is nothing scaled in inches or centimetres, three measuring sticks to measure all distances and ranges. Alternatively the game can be played without measuring sticks on a hexgrid.<br/><br/>The game includes statistics for 180+ monsters and heroes, and details to be able to create your own. Also there are campaign rules where your warband grows more powerful after every battle, and six basic scenarios.<br/><br/>There are some stand-alone games based on the same system, which could also be used as expansions to the base game:<br/><br/><br/>     Song of Arthur and Merlin (2008) - Arthurian supplement featuring sections on the historical Dark Ages king, the Welsh legendary king, and the Hollywood king.  Originally an expansion, in 2011 this was re-released as a stand-alone product.<br/>     Mutants and Death Ray Guns (2008) - a post-holocaust skirmish game.<br/>     Song of the Splintered Lands (2009) - Sourcebook based on the Splintered Light miniatures line.<br/>     Song of Drums and Shakos (2009) - a Napoleonics skirmish game. <br/>     Flying Lead (2010) - a game of gang warfare to Pulp action, from military operations to black-clad assassins.<br/><br/><br/>",

Redesigned from the ground up, the core game mechanic remains the same, but all armies have been tweaked and modified along a structure that makes use of cards describing abilities and upgrades, cardboard bases and resources, measuring rulers for some special abilities, and large cardboard tiles representing special terrain.  The game now also includes a playmat.<br/><br/>The game is based on the classic Tiddlywinks.  The set includes four armies, each with three bases and a distinct assortment of bugs.  The bugs are plastic winks in three different shapes and sizes.  Two six-sided dice determine which bugs you may move on a turn.  Enemy bugs and bases are defeated by landing your bugs on top of them.  All bugs also feature special abilities, such as allowing multiple moves or firing projectile winks.<br/><br/>",

Triumphant against all the thrones of Europe, never could he penetrate the walls of oak that surrounded Albion to land an army and deliver the knockout blow.<br/><br/>Discover the secrets of Britain's superior ship handling in the age of sail with Close Action. Some 25 scenarios, ranging from ship vs. ship (training exercises) to fleet actions (the Nile Campaign) cover a variety of British, French, Russian, Turkish, and Spanish ships throughout the period. In addition to the Napoleonic Wars, there are selected actions from the American War of Independence and the War of 1812.<br/><br/>Developed for over 10 years by Mark Campbell, Close Action features 70 1&quot;x &frac12;&quot; ship counters, 140 markers and accommodates from two to sixteen players on its two 34&quot;x22&quot; maps. If your interest runs to miniatures, the rules and charts need no changes to adapt to the &quot;big mat.&quot; Can you do better than Nelson? Or, will you do what no one ever did and defeat him in a fleet action? Sail alongside, for it's sure to be a Close Action.<br/><br/>(source: Clash fo Arms website)<br/><br/><br/>Close Action is all about teamwork and out-maneuvering one's enemy by coordinating the movements of a fleet of wooden ships.  You plot movement for your ships, send signals to your friendly captains, and assign crew to various tasks such as changing sails or firing the great guns.  Played on a hex grid, the ships move fairly accurately and historic battles can be recreated with lots of realism.  This games scales extremely well, playing as well if not better with 20 players as with 3, 4 or 5.<br/><br/>(source: user's description)<br/><br/>",

Now you, as the prosecution or defense, must convince a nine-panel jury that Mary Surratt, one of eight people put on trial for conspiring to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln and other members of his cabinet, is guilty...or innocent.<br/><br/>Unforgiven: The Lincoln Assassination Trial is a two-player game that takes place during the May 9 - June 28, 1865 trial of the first woman, Mary Surratt, ever to be executed for treason by the United States. The game begins amidst the chaos of Lincoln's assassination as the country struggles to heal over the wreckage of the American Civil War. Each player must persuade the jury to convict or acquit the accused and thereby win the game. To do so, players draft and play cards that help them strengthen their case with the jurors and recruit them to their side, while also finding overwhelming evidence for or against the accused.<br/><br/>In one of the most high-profile trials in U.S. history, will Mary Surratt again face the hangman's noose of American justice &mdash; or can you stop the trap door from falling?<br/><br/>",

Design the foundations of a great pre-Columbian civilization, with its buildings, temples, and a grand pyramid in the center. Find perfect locations for production buildings and great temples, and build the might of the great pyramid overlooking your city. Establish yourself as the very best among competing architects, and your project will secure you a spot among the great Founders of Teotihuacan!<br/><br/>Founders of Teotihuacan is a strategy game where you compete against your friends to create the best design of the city of Teotihuacan. Over the course of three to four rounds you will place your action disks to the main board, forming towers of varying strength, strategically use the bonuses they offer, and construct temples, resource buildings and the pyramid central to your project of Teotihuacan. You will balance generating resources and using them, as finding good locations on your city board becomes increasingly more difficult, and you will try to outwit your opponents, making use of an innovative and interactive action system. Finally, once the eclipse comes, all designs will be assessed and the player with the most points will win and become the architect to join the ranks of Founders of Teotihuacan!<br/><br/>Founders of Teotihuacan is a stand-alone game, related to Teotihuacan: City of Gods only by the shared setting of the ancient city of Teotihuacan. Thematically, the events in Founders takes place at an earlier time in history, while what was to become a magnificent city was yet in its infancy and only few inhabited the area.<br/><br/>On your turn, you must either perform an Action or pass. To perform an Action, place between 1 and 3 of your Action disks on an Action space on the Main board that already contains at least one disk (minimum a Bonus disk and possibly also opponent disk(s)), and carry out a corresponding Action. The Action disk(s) should be placed on top of the disk(s) already on that space, forming a stack. Each Action space can hold a maximum of 4 Action disks&mdash;including Bonus disks!<br/><br/>Your personal player board is divided into four Districts or quadrants. Buildings and Temples can only be placed within the two Districts closest to your Architect. Pyramid tiles can only be placed within the six Pyramid squares closest to your Architect. Your Action Strength is equal to the total number of disks (whether yours, an opponent&rsquo;s disks, or Bonus disks) on an Action space.<br/><br/>After performing an Action (not when passing), move your Architect clockwise to the next side of your Player board, signifying<br/>the end of your turn. This changes your Architect's Reach for your next turn. After all players have passed, the current round ends.<br/><br/>After the game has ended, players score additional Victory Points for how well their Districts complement their Pyramid.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is one of the first Civil War games to concentrate on a specific campaign rather than a single battle. Despite its rich detail, the game is fairly easy to learn and play. Indeed, several scenarios can be played to completion in about an hour. <br/>The two beautiful game maps portray central Virginia as it was in the summer of 1862, featuring roads. turnpikes, railroads, rivers, mountains - even bridges and fords! These highly accurate maps are based on original Civil War maps in state and county archives. The players control Union and Confederate military units in turns representing one day of real time. The game features five Basic scenarios, two Advanced scenarios, and a detailed day~by-day historical analysis of the actual campaign. Stonewall Jackson's Way will appeal to Civil War buffs of all types as well as to those who are just being introduced to this dramatic period of American history. Its interactive game system assures that each game will be unpredictable, exciting, and competitive.<br/><br/>FEATURES <br/><br/>     Corps leaders * Infantry and Cavalry units * Artillery values <br/>     Force marches * Burning Railroad stations <br/>     Grand assaults * Flank attacks * Fatigue <br/>     Clear, Rolling, Rough, Woods, Mountain terrain <br/>     Demoralization * Entrenchments * Railroad movement <br/>     Cavalry retreat * Building bridges <br/>     Rain * Depots * Supply lines * Foraging <br/><br/><br/>SCENARIOS <br/><br/>     Cedar Mountain <br/>     Lee vs. Pope <br/>     Stuart's Cavalry Raid <br/>     Jackson's &quot;Foot Cavalry&quot; <br/>     From the Rappahannock to Bull Run <br/>     From the Rapidan to the Rappahannock (Advanced Game, short version) <br/>     From the Rapidan to Manassas (Advanced Game, long version)<br/><br/><br/>CONTENTS: <br/>2 Counter Sheets <br/>2 22&quot;x32&quot; Mapsheets <br/>1 Rules Booklet<br/>2 Charts and Tables Cards<br/>3 Displays Cards<br/>2 6-sided dice <br/>1 Counter Tray<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: One day per turn <br/>MAP SCALE: One mile per hex <br/>UNIT SCALE: Divisions and brigades (with corps leaders) <br/>PLAYERS: One, two, or teams <br/>PLAYING TIME: 1 hour for introductory scenarios, 2 to 12 hours for other scenarios<br/><br/>(from the back of the box)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This all-in-one boxed package is composed of new editions of the flagship game in the series -Saratoga, the long-out-of-print Brandywine, and Guilford/Eutaw Springs. Below is more detail on exactly what you&rsquo;ll find in the package. As you&rsquo;ll note, there are considerable additions and changes from the original games, as designer Mark Miklos has endeavored to create and update the finest version of these games that we&rsquo;ve produced to date. Plus, the package includes double-sided mounted maps for all four battles!<br/><br/>Saratoga:<br/><br/>     Includes all the replacement counters that have been provided over the years, plus new Momentum counters and &ldquo;Rally on Me&rdquo; (see description under &ldquo;Brandywine,&rdquo; below) counters for the series.&nbsp;<br/>     This battle includes a new historical scenario featuring the fighting around Freeman&rsquo;s Farm.<br/><br/><br/>Brandywine:<br/><br/>    An updated countersheet includes all the counters updated over the years, plus a new marker to the series, &ldquo;Rally on Me!&rdquo;&nbsp; As you know, one of the combat results is Disruption.&nbsp; When this occurs, a Disruption Marker is placed on&nbsp;top&nbsp;of the Disrupted unit.&nbsp; If the Disrupted unit is alone in a hex or if it stacks with other units that are also Disrupted, there is no issue because the Disruption Marker remains on top of the stack, in plain sight signifying that every unit under it is Disrupted.&nbsp; It serves as reminder to the player to roll for Rally in the Rally Phase.&nbsp; When, however, Disrupted units stack with Parade Order units, those Parade Order units are placed above the Disruption Marker.&nbsp; This typically obscures the Disruption Marker within the stack.&nbsp; Particularly in larger games with high counter density and multiple fronts, where lots of action is occurring, players often forget to make their Rally rolls because they can&rsquo;t readily see the Disruption Markers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Rally on Me!&rdquo; Marker is primarily intended to be placed on top of any stack that contains a combination of Disrupted and Parade Order units in the same hex.&nbsp; This will be a visual cue for the player to remember his Rally die roll.&nbsp;<br/>     There is a new amusettes counter among the Hessian forces in Brandywine<br/>     Includes an updated Brandywine mounted map with redone Charlie Kibler artwork.<br/>     The Brandywine rules have been split into a Series Rule Book and an Exclusive Rule Book. A couple of key updates here:<br/>        &nbsp;Updated unit deployment protocol for the Knyphausen&rsquo;s Feint scenario in the Exclusive Rule Book.<br/>        &nbsp;Also in the Exclusive Rules, new&nbsp;optional&nbsp;intelligence rules called, &ldquo;Muddying the Waters of Brandywine Creek&rdquo; are introduced.&nbsp;While the original game attempts to model the lack of good intelligence that plagued Washington by restricting American movement within the American Army Bivouac Area until a certain point in the game, this and the other devices used like optional British Brigade entry zones have become &ldquo;set-piece&rdquo; after all these years.&nbsp; Players familiar with this game can &ldquo;game&rdquo; those intel rules enough to mitigate their impact and as a result, the flow of action across the board is becoming a little too predictable.&nbsp; The new &ldquo;Muddy&rdquo; rules introduce a random element into both players&rsquo; decision making.&nbsp; There are four possible permutations: 1) neither do a recon, 2) both do a recon, 3) only the Brits do a recon, and 4) only the Americans do a recon.&nbsp; This is further complicated by five different possible states of the upper ford on the Brandywine (off-map):&nbsp; 1) Blocked, 2) Partially Blocked, 3) Hindered, 4) Open and 5) Dry.&nbsp; The interplay of these factors will influence how each side can maneuver so that it can never become predictable.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Guilford/Eutaw Springs:<br/><br/>     Mounted Mapboards for each game<br/>     Updated Victory Conditions for each game<br/>     An Updated Looting Table for Eutaw Springs<br/>     Replacement counters for each game.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Or will Finn and Jake save the day with a sturdy sword and a hearty &quot;Slamacow!&quot;?<br/><br/>Munchkin Adventure Time is both a standalone game and an expansion for other titles in the vast Munchkin family.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players &quot;kicks down the door&quot; by drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "STORY<br/>The future:<br/>Slowly but steadily, the Moon has been approaching the Earth. It has touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans. It has come to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants. That chaos grew greater when the Moon revealed itself to be a &quot;kami&quot; (a Japanese God of old) - the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves of their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...<br/><br/>In the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.<br/><br/>TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame that demands specific strategic skills of its players. Its particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Values and abilities of the factions still don&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: it&rsquo;s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players&rsquo; weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life.<br/><br/>FACTIONS<br/>THE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.<br/><br/>THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species - claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes.<br/><br/>THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.<br/><br/>THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win.<br/>After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.<br/><br/>According to the descending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their &quot;Homezones&quot;, pick three start-areas and place their units.<br/>Prior to the first round, they also choose a white action card - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.<br/><br/>Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red action cards. Every phase is represented by six of those action cards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase. The highest bid is awarded with the A-card, the next one with the B-card, and so on.<br/><br/>Each round consists of the following phases:<br/>White Phase: Players use the white action card they chose to emphasize their strategy.<br/>Blue Phase: Players can rise in the initiative order and/or draw an Impact Card.<br/>Green Phase: New units are generated and resources collected.<br/>Red Phase: Units are moved, adversarial areas and units may be attacked. Onis are placed, moved, and used for attacks.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>The player who gains the most Victory Points wins the game. Victory Points are earned by conquering and occupying areas, and by fulfilling goals and/or the faction's respective mission.<br/><br/>END<br/>The game ends after the number of rounds determined by the players beforehand - usually 3-4 rounds<br/><br/>MICROBADGES<br/> Tsukuyumi fan - logo<br/> Tsukuyumi fan - moon<br/> Tsukuyumi - Boarlords fan<br/> Tsukuyumi - Cybersamurai fan<br/> Tsukuyumi - Dark Seed fan<br/> Tsukuyumi - Nomads fan<br/> Tsukuyumi - Oni fan<br/> Tsukuyumi - Kampfgruppe 03 fan<br/> Tsukuyumi - Lords of the Lost Sea fan<br/> Tsukuyumi - Fireborn fan<br/> Tsukuyumi - Children of the Lion fan<br/><br/>",

Whoever is able to harvest the best grape yield from the vines will become the owner of this precious land.<br/><br/>In La Vi&ntilde;a, the players advance along the board, collecting cards with the most interesting grapes. To collect the cards you advance along a track that represents the rows of a vineyard. Each track has a series of different grape cards on either side, and you are allowed to choose the cards next to the space you are on, or next to the space you move to. Each turn you can choose a card and advance or advance and choose a card.<br/><br/>At the end of the track, there are different wineries (each preferring a different kind of grape variety). Get the best reward for your harvest from the local wineries by matching your hand of grapes with their needs. If the players go quickly, they may get the best cards, but risk not having enough grapes. If they go too slow, the competition can beat them to the best vines!<br/><br/>Selling your grapes to the wineries gets the players prestige points, and each player has a limited amount of deliveries. The end game triggers when a player makes their last grape delivery. The other players can finish moving through their track. Then, everyone counts their prestige points gained through their previous deliveries, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

By reading his diary, Ethan's best friends &mdash; the &quot;Elm Street clan&quot; &mdash; start uncovering the creepy mystery: a fearsome creature that has kidnapped children for centuries to feed off their memories who has now taken its next victim. But by striking out into the Duskworld, the creature's den, the kids will have a chance to retrieve Ethan's memories and bring him back into the real world.<br/><br/>The Faceless is a full cooperative experience with a never-seen-before mechanism: You indirectly move a compass by moving and rotating the double-sided miniatures on the game board. By playing cards from your hand, you can rotate and move these miniatures and, since they have all a magnet inside, you change the magnetic field they generate, thus influencing the direction of the compass needle. After playing a card, the compass moves in the direction indicated by its needle, but after every movement, the direction of the needle can potentially change, forcing you to move in new directions. Learning to control and predict these movements is vital to success in the Duskworld!<br/><br/>Collect all the memory fragments that are scattered in the game board to save Ethan and win the game! But watch out for Billygoat, an evil creature that's haunting you and that will try to entrap you in the Duskworld forever.

Noah himself stands on one ferry. On a turn, a player plays one card from hand onto the ferry where Noah is located, following two rules: (1) the total weight of all animals on board cannot exceed 21 and (2) animals on a ferry must be placed either in alternating gender order or must be all of the same gender. After placing an animal, the player moves Noah to a different ferry; if he played a female animal, Noah goes to either adjacent ferry, while if he played a male, Noah goes to either ferry on the other side of the circle.<br/><br/>If a player can't legally play an animal, he must first take in hand all the animals on the ferry where Noah is located, then play an animal.<br/><br/>In addition to moving Noah to a nearly full ferry, players have two other ways to benefit themselves or mess with other players. If a player plays an animal of the same species as the one last played on that ferry (regardless of gender), he moves Noah, then takes another turn. If a player brings the weight of a ferry to exactly 21, that ferry launches from shore to meet the ark located in distant waters, a new ferry becomes available for loading, and the player distributes 1&ndash;4 cards from his hand among his opponents. finally, some cards have special animals, such as the giraffe that lets you peek at an opponent's hand and the woodpecker, which stupidly pokes holes in the ferry and reduces its maximum weight to 13. Bad woodpecker, bad!<br/><br/>The round ends when a player runs out of cards in hand or a fourth ferry launches. Players receive penalty points for cards still in hand, scored according to the number of tears on each card, those tears representing Noah's sadness at the animal being left behind. Then players shuffle all the animal cards and begin a new round. The player with the fewest points after three rounds wins!<br/><br/>",

The dice allow you to recruit survivors of different types: tinkerers, brawlers, healers, sages, farmers, jacks-of-all-trades, or even useless survivors. At the end of each season, your survivors allow you to bid to improve your shelter. These survivors are recruited in five key areas and central squares of the Paris that we know, each one with different abilities:<br/><br/><br/>    The train station, which lets you grow your community faster<br/>    The restaurant, to collect food to feed your community<br/>    The tower, to choose the goals you can fulfill<br/>    The center, which gives you access to special equipment<br/>    The bridge, to gain access to new missions<br/><br/><br/>Players score points by recruiting survivors and feeding them, by fulfilling objectives from the tower, and by completing secret missions acquired at the bridge.

Therefore, the year 2009 will be Germany's 60th birthday and the 20th Anniversary of the Reunion.<br/>Klaus Teuber and the Kosmos Verlag wanted to do something special for this event and will bring out this gorgeous version of their CATAN game.<br/>It will feature a map of Germany, designed by Michale Menzel, and some slightly simplified rules. You will be able to build city landmarks as for example the 'Brandenburger Tor' or the 'Dresdner Dom' in one of the 12 possible cities. All these landmarks will be in the box as plastic miniatures of significant detail.<br/>In short: A must have for all German Catanien and a good addition to the collection of every other wood-for-sheep-enthusiast.<br/><br/>On the box: Discover and settle germany!<br/>Explore and settle the storied land of Germany using the elegant, award-winning game design from The Settlers of Catan. Here, you will find great social interaction, simple rules, beautiful German geography, rich history and lore, and 12 wonderfully-sculpted landmarks.<br/>Catan Geographies: Germany is a game about trade, building, and settlement. Start with town halls in 3 cities. Then build roads to neighboring cities, where you can purchase landmarks and new town halls. Town halls create resource production, while the unique landmarks generate special awards. Both yield victory points - as do the Longest Road, Largest Army, and historically-based victory point cards.<br/>So, have fun with friends or family while casually discovering the novel geography and history of Germany.<br/><br/>",

From your incredible Factory, you must race to claim ownership over the magnificent ruins of an abandoned clockwork metropolis. Each game plays in under an hour, and because only nine of the city tiles (from dozens available) are randomly chosen and placed each game, no two games ever play the same.<br/><br/>Each turn, you roll a number of production dice and activate City Tiles, then you move your automaton workers and perform a variety of actions (such as drawing and placing gears to reactivate areas of the city, sabotaging opponents, and activating unique steam powers) as determined by your resources. Along the way, you will develop your Factory with special powers which set it apart and provide you with powerful bonuses.<br/><br/>As the city is revealed and its abilities are discovered, players must concoct plans to accrue prestige and hinder opponents so that once Opening Day arrives, they will emerge victorious! Do you have what it takes to set the City of Gears in motion?<br/><br/>",

Each player will control one of six unique factions which represent the various groups that populate Plum Island. Each of these Factions has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the system encourages you to optimize for the group&rsquo;s strengths and marginalize its weaknesses. Players must coordinate with one another, and the resulting synergy will hopefully be enough to successfully evacuate a city under siege and contain the horrific outbreak that threatens to spread beyond the island itself. If the players can succeed, they will win together, and the world will most likely be none the wiser to the averted crisis. If not, they will lose together and share the blame equally for failing humankind.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From spielbox-online.de, translated via altavista babel fish (with a lot of manual tweaks):<br/><br/>Magna Grecia (The cradle of the civilization) is the main attraction of the year with Clementoni. The game is a joint work of Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht.<br/><br/>The southern region of Italy was called Magna Grecia and was settled 2,500 years ago by Greek merchants and adventurers. Before the arrival of the Greeks, the country was inhabited by only a few small tribes. Fruitful soil, navigable rivers, large forests, and bronze and silver mines offered enormous development possibilities. Larger cities developed, such as Tarantum, Syracuse, Katane, Locri, and Naxos. In addition, there were numerous villages of which no trace remains. A local road system promoted trade, and rich markets developed in the cities. More and more rivalries between the cities arose, particularly over control of the Oracle, which represented an important source for fame and wealth.<br/><br/>Sufficient material for an evening of play. Each player must successfully settle and develop Magna Grecia. At favorable points, markets are built, villages are developed into cities and interconnected by a road system. Only thus may the interior be opened and the Oracle controlled. Constructing your own large city is often very expensive, and it is sometimes worthwhile to build instead in the neutral villages or opponents' cities.<br/><br/>The board is covered with a hexagon grid on which pieces of road, towns, or markets are placed. A game is 12 rounds long. Each round is determined by an action map, which is set up at the beginning of play according to a certain pattern. The map specifies the player sequence and indicates to which extent the three basic actions (road construction, city building, and supply) may be used. There are also, of course, certain building rules to be considered. Additionally, markets can be established, the value of which depends on the number of connected locations. The Oracle is shown on the board. In order to control the Oracle, a player must connect one of his own cities to it by road. But if several cities are connected to an Oracle, the most important city takes precedence, determined by the number of locations connected to the city (not including Oracles).<br/><br/>Markets and the Oracle determine when the game ends.<br/><br/>",

There is only war.<br/><br/>After more than forty thousand years of war and strife among the stars, Humanity stands on the brink of extinction. Beset on all sides by hostile aliens and threatened from within by traitors, Humanity&rsquo;s only chance for survival rests with the continuation of the cruel and bloody regime known as the Imperium. Yet few among Mankind&rsquo;s untold population realise the full truth of their situation. If there is any future at all, it is a grim one&hellip;<br/><br/>The Book<br/><br/>A 280-page hardback, this is the essential book for any fan of Warhammer 40,000 &ndash; everything you need to know to collect, build, paint and play with Citadel miniatures.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>The Core Rules explain everything you need to play to play Warhammer 40,000. Moving, shooting, using psychic powers, charging, fighting and morale tests are covered, giving you the basic framework to play with. You can play a game using only these 8 pages, bolting on more advanced and complex rules when you and your opponent are ready.<br/><br/>Three Ways to Play<br/><br/><br/>     Open Play &ndash; pick some models, put them on the table and begin a game. This is the most flexible approach, designed with near-limitless possibilities; all you need is some models, their datasheets and the core rules. Included are some themes and ideas you can use or build upon to add atmosphere to your games, and 3 example missions.<br/>     Narrative Play &ndash; Warhammer 40,000 has a vast, rich history with countless epic battles. Narrative Play is designed to let you and your friends re-enact those battles at your leisure. There are special rules to help you do this, such as Concealed Deployment and unpredictable, random battle lengths, and the book includes several missions * 6 Crucible of War missions and 1 Echoes of War mission, each showing you how to play in this style.<br/>     Matched Play &ndash; for many players, Warhammer 40,000 is an opportunity to prove their mettle with tactics and strategy, an exercise in out-thinking and out-gunning their opponent with balanced, equal armies: Matched Play is for them. There are several ways to ensure that your forces are balanced against each other &ndash; a points limit is the typical way, but the system is flexible enough to allow armies based on unit numbers, Power Ratings, Wounds; as long as your limits are agreed, the possibilities are manifold. This book provides details on choosing your armies, and provides missions as examples of the tactical challenges available: 6 Eternal War and 6 Maelstrom of War missions, with explanations covering the use of Tactical Objectives.<br/><br/><br/>Advanced Rules<br/><br/>While the Core Rules provide with you with everything needed to play, the Advanced Rules are a selection of rules and expansions that can be used to play with your miniatures the way that you want to. With these rules, there are always new challenges to face, new battles to fight, and new ways to play:<br/><br/><br/>     Battle-Forged Armies: organise your models in a way that reflects the armies of Warhammer 40,000 &ndash; this places restrictions on your army, but makes up for it with powerful benefits, which use a system of Command Points;<br/>     Battlefield Terrain: rules for a variety of terrains (Woods, Ruins, Barricades, Obstacles, Imperial Statuary, Fuel Pipes, Battlescape and Hills), each of which introduce scenarios and opportunities that change the nature of battle;<br/>     Battlezones: rules for fighting amidst the effects of otherworldly environments, including low visibility, beneath an apocalyptic orbital battle and in the middle of a devastating psychic maelstrom;<br/>     Planetstrike: slam down from orbit in a terrifying planetary assault. Two players are separated into Attacker and Defender, with scenarios that play out a full incursion and a Planetfall mission;<br/>     Cities of Death: street fighting in the ruins of a shattered city, with buildings bitterly fought over &ndash; the claustrophobia of urban warfare makes for tense battles with snipers and grenades coming to the fore. Includes a Firesweep mission for playing out room-to-room combat;<br/>     Stronghold Assault: dig in for a game of fortified siege warfare. One player seeks to overwhelm the prepared defences of another, with a Bunker Assault mission included;<br/>     Death From the Skies: dogfighting for your Flyer models, allowing the recreation of epic clashes above the battlefield. A Tactical Strike mission involves a defence against a bombing run;<br/>     Multiplayer Battles: rules accommodating three (or more!) players, with an example of a multiplayer battle to work from;<br/>     Campaigns: an overview of linking your games into Tree, Matrix and Map campaigns.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by Patricia McKillip's Riddle-Master fantasy trilogy (Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister in the German translation), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;<br/><br/>The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.<br/><br/>You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.<br/><br/>Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.<br/><br/>A later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.<br/><br/>Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.<br/><br/>Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.<br/><br/>",

Each player must lead an aboriginal tribe to survival in a world ruled by gods and shaped by natural disasters.<br/><br/>Tindaya is a theme-driven survival adventure with the soul of a eurogame. This environmentally conscious game offers two play modes to please any group: Cooperative (including solo) &amp; Competitive, in addition to the Traitor variant for players avid of some old fashioned throat-cutting. Difficulty can be graded, and less experienced gamers can learn to play through a 3 game mini-campaign.<br/><br/>During 3 phases, natives will settle, progress, and battle invaders, all within a mythological setting ruled by two gods, Acoran &amp; Moneiba. They will demand specific goods at each stage of the game. If the natives are unable or unwilling to provide them, their godly rage will be unleashed. But players are not alone; two seers will make predictions by reading the smoke of their bonfires. Tibiabin will see the disasters to come. Tamonante will predict where they will happen. Disaster markers will be placed on the board to signal what is to come.<br/><br/>End of the Game: In Cooperative mode, players will check if their collective mission has been achieved. If so, the gods will be happy, and all natives win the game. In Competitive mode, solidarity points will be granted to players that have given more to the community, used fewer resources, or achieved both collective and personal objectives. The player with more points will win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first settlers of mars are arriving soon, but the colony is not ready yet! You are the robots that are trying to build the colony before the settlers arrive. The goal in Magic Maze on Mars is to build &quot;domes&quot; where the settlers can live, then to guide them to their domes when they arrive. When time runs out, they are out of oxygen.<br/><br/>To begin, place the starting tile in the middle of the table. Deal out the appropriate action tiles and shuffle the four A tiles in a pile face down.<br/><br/>Creating resources: A player with blue on their action tile can always create blue resources at the blue factory so long as a resource is not already there. The player simply takes a blue resource from the bank and places it on the resource station next to the factory. The resources of other colors are built on the factories of their color, with these factories becoming available when you build new tiles.<br/><br/>Moving resources: Players can move resources along the roads with a color that they have on their action tile. A player might have an action tile that shows red and orange, so they can move resources along red and orange roads. You move resources from one &quot;station&quot; to another, but each station can hold only one resource, and resources cannot move through a station that holds another resource.<br/><br/>Note: When moving resources, you must physically move the resource all the way, so the other players can see what is happening. Even if there is a long stretch of road that you are able to move on, you cannot move the resource directly.<br/><br/>Building new tiles: To do this, you need to have a resource of the station's color on the station, e.g., a blue resource on a blue station. Once the resource is there, a player with this color on their action tile can remove the resource and place the top tile face up at the position. Place the tile with the small arrow pointing from where it was build.<br/><br/>Watching the time: As in Magic Maze, players have a time limit in Magic Maze on Mars. To flip the sand timer, you must move any resource onto a timer space. Return the resource to the bank and place a timer token on the timer space to show that it cannot be used again. By doing this, you send a signal to the settlers that the colony is not ready yet; they will then orbit Mars once more before landing, but they can't do this indefinitely.<br/><br/>Building domes: Some tiles have spaces available for domes. In order to build a dome, you need to place the depicted resources on the dome spot, e.g., green, yellow, and red. When all the necessary resources are placed on the dome, any player can put all the resources back in the bank and place a dome (taken from the communication board).<br/><br/>When you have built all the domes, the settlers arrive. Place all the settlers on the rocket. Then move the settlers just like you move resources. You have won as soon as one settler inhabits each dome. There cannot be more than one settler on each station, and they cannot walk through resources. Once the settlers arrive, you can no longer flip the sand timer! (It does not help to send them messages about orbiting Mars since they are already here.) If time runs out, you have lost.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Unbeknownst to the powers in Harrows some of those leaders, namely the players, are secretly evil to the core and in the thrall of the Necromancer. Once away from the bustling city and the oversight of the courts, these overlords create domains that outwardly appear to be beacons of light and hope. Eventually however, their true colors will come through and those upstanding pillars of the community will retreat to their lairs as the masquerade ends and their lands begin to decay into wastelands overrun by foul monsters and nefarious henchmen.<br/><br/>But all is not peaches and cream in the lands of darkness. Harrows is home to the famous Torin Company and its never-ending supply of heroes and adventurers. Once the word reaches Harrows that darkness is afoot in the Domains, it is only a matter of time before these nosy adventurers begin to seek out the dens of horror to stop the evil.<br/><br/>Dark Domains is a worker placement game where 2-5 players attempt to create a Domain that provides them the most evil, depicted in the game by skulls. Players must use Minions, Henchmen, Monsters &amp; Magic to stamp out the good, repel the Torin Company and cover their land in darkness.<br/><br/>Tarot cards are used in the game as events to live up each turn and to regulate the phases of the game.<br/><br/>",

Players will recreate the first six months of furious aerial combat between the might of Imperial Japan and the surprised forces of the United Kingdom and the United States.<br/><br/>Zero! includes the important early-war fighters and bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army, Royal Air Force, United States Navy, United States Army Air Force, and the American Volunteer Group (the famous Flying Tigers). Fly the fearsome A6M2 Zero against the F4F Wildcat, Hawker Hurricane IIb, Curtiss P-40B and E Tomahawks, and the ill-fated Brewster Buffalo. As a pilot with the Japanese Army, take Ki-27 Nates and Ki-43 Oscars to the skies against the Allies over Malaya and Burma. Match your skills with American aces Wagner, Thach, McCuskey or their semi-mercenary countrymen of the AVG, Hill and Newkirk. The Japanese can counter with Sakai, Anabuki, Kato, and more.<br/><br/>As with the previous games in the series, Zero! includes the Campaigns covering the major aerial events of the December 1941 to June 1942 period. Each consists of multiple missions aimed at a variety of targets, for which you must wisely allocate your resources of men and material. New to Zero! are Carrier Campaigns, which give players some control over the carrier groups their naval squadrons fly from. Do you go all out for a decisive strike or hold your fighters back and let the enemy overextend himself? Campaigns included in this volume are: Pearl Harbor (solitaire), the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Coral Sea, and Midway.<br/><br/>Both Down in Flames veterans and newcomers to the series will enjoy this latest volume. All the components needed to play are included - ownership of the first two volumes is not necessary, but the three games are completely compatible. Beautiful, newly-designed, full-color action cards drive gameplay, while cards representing the major aircraft of the period and counters of the famous aces allow players to explore a wide range of scenarios. Besides the new Carrier Campaigns, historically significant missions have been added to the standard campaigns and the rules have been updated and expanded.<br/><br/>Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of the Zero, delaying or even stopping the appearance of American industrial might? Or will the Allies, in their outdated machines, halt the Japanese onslaught much earlier?<br/><br/>CONTENTS:    <br/><br/>     88 full-color, die-cut counters.<br/>     150 full-color Playing Cards<br/>     6 Campaign Map Displays<br/>     One Bombing Display<br/>     One Resource Sheet<br/>     One 16-page Rulebook<br/>     One 20-page Campaign Booklet<br/>     8 Target Displays<br/>     Three Campaign Logs <br/><br/><br/>Designed by Dan Verssen<br/>Developed by Mike Lemick<br/><br/>",

As freelance trade captains, the players bring food and other goods to the cities, in addition to fighting the pirates whenever they encounter them. Fighting without cannons leads to poor results, however, and cannons are expensive.

Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards are available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.<br/><br/>DC Comics Dice Masters: War of Light debuts both the Teen Titans and new Lantern Corps never before seen in Dice Masters!

Do you explore the first room you reveal, or press-your-luck and skip it to move on to another, and be forced to resolve the second? When you encounter an alien you must decide how much ammo you want to spend (Each ammo equals 1 die roll) in order to defeat it. Do you over-spend for a certain victory, or take a chance a spend less? When you defeat a foe and open a crate, do you take the larger more valuable resource, or the lesser valued resource that may be more useful now? Do you use a powerful one-use item early on in the game, or wait?<br/><br/>There are many choices per game, and when you die, and you will often, you will not be able to blame the roll of a die or the draw of card as much as you will have to blame yourself.

Visiting each city earns a City Token and having 3 or 4 of these earns rupees. Rupees are also earned for building palaces and collecting client tokens over the course of the game. The players with the best 3 totals also earn rupees and the most rupees gained at the end of the game determines the winner.<br/><br/>During the game the players will acquire goods which they will try to resell at the best price in four cities. Each type of good has its own market where the prices of the goods will fluctuate.

        "description": "Munchkin Apocalypse is a core set in the Munchkin series with an end of the world theme that includes natural disasters, zombie takeovers, Armageddon, alien invasions, nuclear war, etc. And while this is still a standard Munchkin game where you try to level up by killing the monsters, stealing the treasure, and stabbing your buddy, there's a new &quot;Seal&quot; mechanic that significantly changes the gameplay.<br/><br/>Seals are a reference to the biblical seals of the Apocalypse. They can be opened and closed, although it's typically more difficult to close them. Once seven Seals are open, the game ends immediately, and the player with the highest combat strength (excluding levels) is the winner. The Seal mechanic adds a sense of impending doom to the game, meant to mimic the sense of impending doom for a real apocalypse. It also tends to create situations where the group works together to close a Seal in order to prevent a player from winning via the Seal mechanic. So there is more teamwork than in a regular Munchkin game.<br/><br/>The balance of the deck is also different than the other Munchkin sets. There are a lot more Disaster cards, which are equivalent to traps and curses, so bad things tend to occur more frequently. Also, there are more monsters, especially high-level monsters. To offset this, however, there are more item enhancers and high-bonus items. It's been stated in the Munchkin forums that Munchkin Apocalypse is harder to play and is intended more for seasoned Munchkin veterans.<br/><br/>Munchkin Apocalypse has four new classes but does not have races, powers, or other &quot;thingies&quot;. It includes Undead and Shark monsters, which follow special rules.<br/><br/>The game comes with 180 cards (92 Doors, 76 Treasures, 12 Seals). The Seal cards are a different size than the regular cards--they're square and are shorter but wider (2.75&quot; x 2.75&quot;). The included d6 is orange with lime green pips, similar in color to the orange dice in the +6 Bag o' Radioactive Munchkin d6.<br/><br/>",

(Where X = the number of wood blocks in your set.)<br/><br/>The two or three player strategy game is accomplished on a square board divided into 64 smaller squares. Players take turns to place a piece on the gameboard. The first player who cannot place a piece anymore loses. (Similar to Blokus)<br/><br/>The two player puzzle game mode is accomplished by dividing the board into two sections, each player chooses five blocks and are also given 4 small &quot;filler&quot; blocks of 1 and 2 squares.  The first one to fit all their blocks perfectly into their half of the rectangle board, wins.<br/><br/>",

Will you take what you really want, or a different card so as to deprive another player of something cool?<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players mark different things off on their score sheets, corresponding to what they earned from the cards they selected. Players earn points for seeing sights, collecting Australiana, seeing animals, and so on. After five rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Mino Dice, first released as Skull King: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel, players try to predict the result of dice battles, and whoever predicts most accurately will come out the winner of the contest.<br/><br/>The game includes seven types of dice: minotaurs, griffins, mermaids, and four types of number dice. The game lasts 6-8 hands depending on the number of players, and in each round each player draws a number of dice from the bag equal to the current hand, e.g., five dice for the fifth hand, then places them behind their screen, keeping these dice a secret from all. After getting their dice, each player simultaneously bids the number of tricks they think they'll claim during the round by putting out fingers on their hand. Record these bids on the scoresheet.<br/><br/>The first player in a hand chooses a die from behind their screen, then rolls it in public. If they roll a number die, each other player must roll a number die of this color, if possible; otherwise they roll a die of their choice. Alternatively, a player can always roll a minotaur, griffin, or mermaid die. After each player has rolled, see who has the highest die and claims this trick. A rolled flag is a 0 and cannot win the trick. The minotaur beats the griffin, which beats the mermaid, which beats the minotaur &mdash; and all of these special characters beat numbers. If no one rolls a special character, the highest number rolled wins the trick, with a tie being broken in favor of whoever rolled later. The player who wins the trick collects the dice in front of their screen, then chooses a die from their collection to start the next trick.<br/><br/>After all the tricks have been claimed, players score points. If you made your bid exactly, score 20 points per trick bid; if you missed your bid, lose 10 points for each trick your bid was off, whether higher or lower. If you bid zero tricks and make it, score 10 points for each trick in the hand; if you miss a 0 bid, lose 10 points for each trick in the hand regardless of how many tricks you made. If you made your bid and captured a minotaur with a mermaid without also capturing a flag, score 50 bonus points; similarly, if you capture a griffin with a minotaur without capturing a flag, score 30 bonus points.<br/><br/>Whoever has the highest total score after the last hand is complete wins.<br/><br/>",

All sorts of tenants move into your houses: the family, a man with a dog, sometimes even odd ones. All tenants dream of getting a premium apartment, but most often you offer them low rent flats. But beware of squatters! With the help of various action cards you try to get essential advantages or defend yourself against mean attacks, at the expense of your fellow players if necessary &ndash; or even the poor tenants!<br/><br/>Friese's Landlord includes 120 full-colored cards with new tenants, brand-new coins and a fully updated rules sheet.<br/><br/>In the end, the player who squeezes the most money out of his tenants still wins!<br/><br/>",

Two actions are available on a turn: moving a Diplo of your color or moving a T. Rex. The players take turns performing two actions each, which can be the same or different, and which can involve the same Dino or T. Rex, or not.<br/><br/>A Diplo has one single goal: eating grass tokens. It moves in a straight line until it's blocked by another Diplo, a T. Rex, the edge of the playing area, or a grass token. In this last case, the Diplo takes the grass token to eat it and immediately applies one of the six effects: birth, T. Rex appearance, Diplo move, etc.<br/><br/>The T. Rex has one single goal: scaring the Diplos away. The movement rules for the T. Rex are the same as for the Diplos'. When it meets a Diplo, the T. Rex is placed on the Diplo's space, and the Diplo is placed back into its owner's pool.<br/><br/>The game ends when no grass tokens remain in the playing area.

Goals are revealed simultaneously, so you may or may not be in competition with another player for the same cards during the round.

Then his voice came through again, only, this time, it was sad, resigned, almost normal.<br/><br/>&ldquo;All of them.&rdquo;<br/><br/>STORMING THE GAP is the first volume in the World At War 85 series of games of fast and furious platoon-level combat. Set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III, when the Warsaw Pact armies storm across the border of East Germany in a powerful attempt to seize West Germany and the whole of Free Europe.<br/><br/>The World At War 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits are applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. The initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all integrated smoothly.<br/><br/>UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

However, hope is not lost, a mystical portal of 10 components can be built and save the island and all its inhabitants, but fail to build it in time and the island will sink forever under the waves, lost to legend.<br/><br/>Atlantis Rising is a fully co-operative game in which the players must race to create a cosmic gate before all of the island tiles have been destroyed. The gate's components are variable and determine the difficulty level of the game - Easy, Normal, Hard, or Cosmic. The players must also contend with the continually escalating threat of their Athenian enemies, who may destroy one or more island tiles each turn if insufficient Atlanteans are allocated to the island's protection.<br/><br/>Each turn players can choose to place their Atlanteans in any of eight different areas - with placements closer to the sea being more rewarding, but subject to a higher risk of flooding (and the subsequent loss of the associated action).<br/><br/>After placement of meeple but before gaining resources 'misfortune' cards are drawn per player indicating which areas of the island sink, any meeple stood there have a long swim back to shore and do nothing for their turn.<br/><br/>Players have limited 'mystical energy' which they can use to predict or prevent certain misfortunes and cards are available from the libraries that offer powerful one time use effects.<br/><br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Will you send your Atlanteans to mine the untapped veins of precious resources at the very tip of the island, hoping to reap great rewards before the oncoming waves smash into the shores? Or will you remain in the relative safety of the island&rsquo;s center, where resources have grown scarce? Perhaps you will tap into the power of the mystic energy source - the lifeforce of Atlantis and key to its advanced technology. You may even seek refuge in the vast libraries of the Lost City, hoping to find some tome which will lead to salvation for the doomed isle. Beware though - even as the island sinks into the sea, the Athenians continue to assault Atlantis, hoping to plunder its riches before it disappears beneath the waves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP's website :)<br/><br/>Battle Above the Clouds is the 8th game in the award-winning Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (GCACW) series. This is the first game covering a western theater campaign and will serve as the core area for a series of maps covering the entire corridor from Nashville, Tennessee to Atlanta, Georgia. The game includes both the Chickamauga campaign of August/September, 1863 and the Chattanooga campaign of October/November of the same year.<br/><br/>Battle Above the Clouds uses the same GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that were first published in MMP's Skirmisher magazine and Grant Takes Command. The game scale remains unchanged for the western campaigns, although two new terrain types (hills and ridges) have been added to properly represent the rugged terrain that dominates the Chattanooga area.<br/>[...]<br/><br/>Battle Above the Clouds includes a wide variety of engagements in the Basic Game scenarios. The seven actions include two introductory scenarios, a cavalry raid, a fighting withdrawal, a series of operational maneuvers through mountainous terrain, and two large battles:<br/>    -McLemore&rsquo;s Cove (4 turns, September 10-13, 1863)<br/>    -Crossing Chickamauga Creek (1 turn, September 18, 1863)<br/>    -The Battle of Chickamauga (3 turns, September 18-20, 1863)<br/>    -Wheeler&rsquo;s Raid (8 turns, September 29-October 6, 1863)<br/>    -Opening the Cracker Line (1 turn, October 28, 1863)<br/>    -Lookout Mountain &amp; Missionary Ridge (2 turns, November 24-25, 1863)<br/>    -Ringgold Gap (2 turns, November 26-27, 1863)<br/><br/>The two Advanced Game scenarios cover both major periods of campaigning in the region:<br/>    -The Chickamauga Campaign (32 turns, August 29- September 29, 1863)<br/>    -The Siege of Chattanooga (40 turns, October 28-December 6, 1863)<br/><br/>The Advanced Game rule set has also been standardized so players will be able to quickly move to new campaigns in the series.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2000 yards / 1.15 mile<br/>Unit: Regiment to Division<br/><br/>Battle Above the Clouds contains:<br/>    -GCACW Series Rules Booklet (approx 24 pgs)<br/>    -BATC Specific Rules Booklet (approx 48 pgs including scenarios/designer notes)<br/>    -Two 22&quot;x32&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>    -A full-color 11&quot;x17&quot; Off-Map Display<br/>    -Two full-color Force Displays<br/>    -Three Countersheets<br/>    -Two 4-page color Charts and Tables<br/>    -Two 6-sided Dice<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1887, a vampire wakes up and seeks to quench his thirst for blood. Brave men and women ally to destroy him &ndash; but to do so, they will have to thwart the plot of Renfield, his faithful servant.<br/><br/>Nosferatu is a card game mixing tactics, bluffing, and team play, with the vampire and Renfield facing off against the vampire hunters. At the start of the game, everyone knows who Renfeld is, and Renfield knows which of the hunters is actually a vampire (as he chooses how to distribute the character cards), but the vampire's identity is hidden from everyone else. The hunters must identify the vampire and kill him with the ancestral stake before he can play five bite cards; if the hunters accidentally stake one of their own, then demoralized and weakened they lose the game.<br/><br/>Each player other than Renfield starts with two cards from the library, which is comprised of rumors, incantations, bites and night cards. Five ritual cards &ndash; silver mirror, 2x blood transfusion, holy water and time distortion &ndash; are placed face-up on the table. Renfield creates a &quot;clock&quot; by taking one night card for each player and shuffling it with a dawn card.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds, with the rounds continuing until one of the winning conditions is met. At the start of a round, players take turns doing the following: Drawing two cards from the library, discarding one card face-up, placing one card face-down in an action pile, then drawing a card from the clock. As soon as a player draws the dawn card or each player has played once, this part of the round ends.<br/><br/>Renfield shuffles all the cards in the action pile, then reveals them. If the pile contains only incantations, the player holding the stake chooses one of the rituals, takes its action, then turns the ritual face-down. Once all five rituals have been used, the hunters win the game, but their main goal is to kill the vampire. If the deck contains bite cards, then Renfield applies the bites to the hunters, with a hunter losing one card in his stock for each bite; a hunter can have at most two bites. Night cards in the pile are added to the clock, thereby giving the vampire more time to work in future rounds, while making it tougher for players to achieve rituals.<br/><br/>If the dawn card was revealed, the holder of the ancient stake can stab someone, thereby ending the game with victory for one side or the other, or pass the stake to another player. (If dawn didn't break, then the stake passes to another player with no opportunity for stabbing.)<br/><br/>",

Push your pucks closest to the jack to win!<br/><br/>Push It is a tense game of skill that can be played anywhere. To win, push, flick or judo-chop your pucks so they are closest to the central jack at the end of the round. Sound simple? Well, it is! Find any smooth surface (tables are ideal, and luckily most people have them), whip out your Push It bag, and play with whoever is up to the challenge. The game is quick to learn but hard to master. Come up against a Push It maestro and you&rsquo;ll soon be put in your place (Warning: friendships can suffer as direct result of Push It). Play Push It either mano-a-mano, 3 player, 4 player or our favourite and most strategic version is two teams of two.<br/><br/>At Push It we want you to unleash your creativity, so there are no long-winded rules or measuring; players have to argue amongst themselves to agree whose puck is closest, or else a &lsquo;Push Off&rsquo; tie-break round decides. Only you can tell if that was really &lsquo;cheek lifting&rsquo; and not &lsquo;bum shuffling&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s all about having your own house rules, playing on different surfaces like car bonnets or pizza trays (tried and tested) and WINNING. So when the pressure is on and you&rsquo;re going for that extra point (without knocking your opponent&rsquo;s puck closer), try to remember &ndash; it&rsquo;s just for fun!!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fist of Dragonstones is a closed-fist, bidding game. Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. Those characters' powers collect valuable Dragonstones; lend their magical powers; help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.<br/>For each character card, players choose the number of coins they want to bid by placing them in a closed fist. All players reveal their bets at the same time with the winner of the auction then gaining control of the card's powers. Depending on the card they may: win additional coins or Dragonstones; place spells on other players; or win scoring points.<br/><br/>The Legend : <br/>Many, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.<br/>Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures - all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.<br/><br/>This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend. Yet, at a cozy inn, in a small forgotten village, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the inn's ancient proprietor. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade him to recount some of the ancient tales. And if he takes a particular liking to you, he may bring out his own collection of magic stones, and challenge you to a simple game of luck and skill and a chance to grab your own Dragonstones!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "American Bookshop is a trick-taking game in which players must follow suit when possible, there is no trump, and the highest card of the lead suit wins the trick. However, if the sum of the cards played to a trick exceeds a certain value &mdash; 14-17, depending on the player count &mdash; the trick ends immediately, and whoever played the last card claims the trick. As such, players may not have equal hand sizes.<br/><br/>A round ends when one player is out of cards; the remaining players then simultaneously choose and reveal which cards still in hand they want to add to their collection. Each card a player takes is worth -1 point, but if a player has collected more cards of a suit than each other player, they instead earn +1 point per card in this suit. After as many rounds as the number of players, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Gravwell, players command spaceships that have been pulled through a black hole, transporting them into a different dimension. With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route &mdash; but with careful card play, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!<br/><br/>Gravwell uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. At the start of each round, players draft fuel cards, picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible; you get some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships, but you won't know which moves you'll be forced to make when you draft your cards!<br/><br/>During a round, each player will play all of their fuel cards in the order of their choosing. During each phase of a round, each player chooses one card, then all cards are revealed and resolved in alphabetical order. When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would! Each player holds an &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; card that they may tactically play only once per round to avoid such a situation.<br/><br/>Whoever first reaches the warp gate wins, but if no one has escaped after six rounds, then the player who is closest to the gate wins.<br/><br/>Gravwell: 2nd Edition features the same gameplay as earlier editions of the game, but now 40 fuel cards are included, which allows up to six players in the game at the same time. (Earlier editions maxed out at four players.) Additionally, ship ability cards are included that can give a unique power to each ship's captain trying to find their way home.<br/><br/>",

Germany is a jigsaw puzzle of independent Electorates, Bishoprics, Dukedoms, and Imperial Free Cities nominally under the control of the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. An alliance of Protestant leaders rebel against the Emperor, who raises armies to suppress them and regain Catholic property lost during the Reformation; the surrounding kings of Spain, France, Sweden, and Denmark intervene to stake their own claims. Germany is plunged into thirty years of war that will last until 1648, when the exhausted combatants sign a peace establishing the competing spheres of interest that will control Germany for the next two centuries.<br/><br/>&quot;Thirty Years War&quot; recreates this conflict with the award winning wargame system used in GMT's Wilderness War, Paths of Glory, and For the People. There are four scenarios provided: the Full Campaign (14 turns), Early War (5 turns), Intervention (3 turns), and Apocalypse (5 turns).<br/><br/>This is a two-player wargame; one controls the Protestant forces (German Protestants, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, France) while the other runs Catholics (the Empire, Bavaria, Spain, and occasionally Saxony, which can switch sides during play!). The heart of the game is the playing card decks of 55 cards that each player receives. Playing a card gives a player the option to move and attack with an army, to recruit new units, to bank up money to pay ever-hungry troops, or to declare an event.<br/><br/>The Peace of Westphalia made certain that Germany would remain divided for another two centuries. Can the Catholic player defy history by recreating the power of the old Holy Roman Empire? Does Gustavus Adolphus survive to dictate peace to the Emperor in Vienna? Thirty Years War allows the players to determine these and other historical what-ifs, while opening a window onto one of the most influential events in European history.<br/><br/>COUNTERS: 456 full-color die-cut counters.<br/>MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>CARDS: 110 Strategy cards<br/>OTHER: Two 10-sided dice, 32-page Rulebook, 2 Player Aid cards<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 2 years per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: Point-to-point system<br/>UNIT SCALE: 3-5,000 men each<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two<br/><br/>DESIGNER: David Fox<br/>DEVELOPER: Michael Welker<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

MacGowan<br/><br/><br/>(BGG user description:)<br/><br/>A direct descendant of Paths of Glory, 30 Years War covers the confusing post-Reformation conflict in central Europe, as the Holy Roman Empire attempts to reassert domination over the protestant states. On the side of Catholicism we have the Holy Roman Empire (Austria and some of Northern Italy at this point) and Spain, opposed by a cast of thousands: the German Protestants, Sweden at the height of her power, France, England, Denmark, and others.<br/><br/>While there are some new mechanics, virtually the entire game is borrowed from elsewhere: Leader activations and movement are as in Hannibal, combat is straight out of Paths of Glory (minus the flanking), and Siege resolves much Hannibal. Your armies have to be paid, with Aid Points that are received just like Paths of Glory's RPs. An interesting twist is that the movement and support of armies results in the landscape getting Pillaged, so as the game goes on the board becomes less and less capable of supporting military operations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Burma - The Campaign for Northern Burma, March-August, 1944, is the sixth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers, and covers covers the 1944 campaigns beginning with the Japanese &quot;U-Go&quot; offensive and ending up as what would be know as Imphal-Kohima, the most dramatic defeat ever inflicted on a Japanese army.<br/><br/>In the spring of 1944, two equally matched opponents faced each other in the jungles and mountains of Northern Burma. During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.<br/><br/>Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.<br/><br/>While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply, elephant and oxen transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.<br/><br/>Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).<br/><br/>Scenario Info:<br/><br/>    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns<br/>    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet<br/>One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet<br/>Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)<br/>Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours<br/>Complexity: High<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Moderate<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SHASN is a political strategy board game where every player takes on the role of a politician in the midst of a political campaign. With each turn, players must draw an Ideology Card and take stands on divisive and urgent political issues. These choices will help them gather resources to influence voters or purchase strategic powers. Players can build diverse Ideologies with every policy decision, to best reflect their beliefs and play style. As they progress in the game, players must choose between sticking to their ideals or molding them as per their needs. In a game of trading, coercion, and strategy, players must do whatever it takes to survive and dominate.<br/><br/>The map is split into 9 zones with each zone having a different voter-count required to form a majority. The player with the highest majority votes - when all majorities are formed - wins the game. To influence voters, players will need unique combinations of the four resources at their disposal - (campaign) Funds, Media (attention), (public) Trust and (street) Clout. At the beginning of their turn, each player must answer an Ideology Card. Every answer on an Ideology Card belongs to one Ideologue. There are four Ideologues in the game - The Capitalist, The Showstopper, The Supremo, and The Idealist. As players collect more cards belonging to one Ideologue, they will unlock new powers that can help them cement their own positions or destabilize opponents.<br/><br/>Players must constantly juggle with the trade-off of giving answers that grant them the resources they need in that moment or investing in long term strategy with answers that strengthen their Ideologies to unlock greater combos later in the game.<br/><br/>Players must also navigate the effects of Headlines (triggered by placing Vters in volatile zones) and Conspiracy Cards (which can be purchased at any time in the game), providing them with a wide toolset to seize power or throw a spanner in the works of a rival.<br/><br/>Placing you in the shoes of a politician, the gameplay is often aggressive, action-packed and laden with long-term strategy building.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio, the third entry in Winsome Games's Historic Railroads System, players build railroads in the South that existed between 1830-1860, with the game board featuring cities from Richmond to New Orleans, and from Memphis to Savannah. Twenty-three different railroad lines exist in the game, each represented by two shares of stock: a charter share for the player who founds this railroad, and a common share that might be auctioned later in the game. Eight railroads are designated as starting lines, and initially only the shares for these eight lines are available to players. Railroad lines will be represented on the game board with wooden cubes that come in six colors, with the number of cubes ranging from 6 to 32.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player takes one of four actions:<br/><br/>&bull; Charter a railroad: The active player starts an auction for the charter share of a railroad that hasn't yet been founded. Players place bids for this share, with the winner claiming this charter share, placing a cube of the color that's most common on it, then using the money spent in the auction to place additional cubes on the game board at a cost of $3/cube. One cube of the same color is placed in the railroad's starting city (and sometimes you have a choice of starting city), and additional cubes are placed on track intersections and in connecting cities. You must bid enough that you can place this line in at least two cities. If the color of the cube that's most available in the stock is already in this city (thanks to railroad lines previously built), then the active player can't put this line up for auction.<br/><br/>Whenever you build or expand railroad lines, you can't place cubes so that two lines of the same color touch. If a white cube has been placed in Grenada, for example, you can't found the MC or M&amp;T lines in that city if white is the most common color of cubes.<br/><br/>&bull; Auction a common share: Once the charter share of a line has been acquired, the active player can start an auction for the common share of that line, with the winning bid once again being used to expand that line with additional cubes of that railroad's color, although in this case you have no building requirement and a winning bid of $0 is allowed.<br/><br/>After each auction, a &quot;common share&quot; tracking marker is moved, and after the second such movement, players receive dividends from the bank for the shares they hold: $5 for a charter share when that railroad has issued only that one share, and $3 for each share otherwise held.<br/><br/>&bull; Expand a line: If you own the charter share of a line, you can spend your funds to expand this line.<br/><br/>&bull; Pass: If all players pass in turn, the game ends.<br/><br/>When a railroad line expands into a city that's the starting city for a railroad line not yet available in the auction pool, you take the two shares of that new line and place them in the auction pool.<br/><br/>Each time you build railroad lines, you score victory points: 1 VP for founding a new line (with three lines being worth 2 VP), 1 VP for placing a cube in a city (2 VP for going into Atlanta), and 1 VP for the first time that a line connects to a line of each other color (which can occur only in cities). If all players pass in turn or the sixth color of cubes is on the board following the chartering of a railroad, the game ends. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Silver Bayonet recreates the pivotal November 1965 battle between a full North Vietnamese Army Division and the US 1st Air Cavalry Division in the Ia Drang Valley. NVA expertise in lure and ambush tactics resulted in significant US casualties. US mobility and the ability to bring massive amounts of firepower to bear quickly virtually destroyed the attacking NVA division and forced a change in NVA tactics.<br/><br/>This re-issue of GMT Games' 1990 CSR Award winning title that started it all keeps the original operational system, but streamlines to it to include innovative combat resolution integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, and support from gunships and air sorties.<br/><br/>Increased accessibility to primary and secondary source material has made it possible to make changes to more accurately represent both sides' unique capabilities without significantly altering or breaking the base game system. The major changes involve patrols, ambushes, landing zones, and the 1st Cav Brigade HQ, while minor changes tweak movement, combat, and coordination game mechanics to showcase radically different strengths and weaknesses the FWA and NVA force brought to the battles in the Ia Drang Valley.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Copenhagen: Roll &amp; Write features gameplay similar to the Copenhagen board game, but with players now finishing the facade of their building thanks to the colors shown on rolled dice, not drafted and played cards.<br/><br/>In the game, each player has a paper scoresheet that shows a building and five colored lines of boxes. A sheet in the center of the playing area shows various polyomino tiles in those same five colors, with tiles of two and three spaces on one side of a central divider and tiles of four and five spaces on the other side. The game includes five six-sided dice that feature the above mentioned five colors on five of their sides as well as a sixth color that serves as a joker. Each player starts with two red stars on their scoresheet; you can spend one of these stars on your turn to reroll as many dice as you wish.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the five dice. If you have rerolls in reserve, you can use them if you wish. You then choose a group of dice in a single color, then you see the shape of the polyomino that corresponds to this choice, then you draw that polyomino on the facade of the building, with the polyomino needing to &quot;rest&quot; on the bottom of the building area. One space in this polyomino is brick (represented by an &quot;X&quot;) while the other spaces are all windows (represented by an &quot;O&quot;). If you created a polyomino of four or five spaces, you cross it off the central sheet of paper as each tile shown on the right side of the sheet can be used only once.<br/><br/>Each other player then gets to choose one of the dice that you didn't use to claim that polyomino, then fill in the leftmost empty box of that color on their scoresheet. These boxes might have a symbol underneath them. If the box has a + under it, then this player can cross off the + on a future turn to add one &quot;phantom&quot; die showing this color to whatever they rolled that round, e.g., if you cross off a blue +, you effectively rolled three blue dice that turn instead of two. If a box has a star under it, then you can cross out that star on a future turn to use the power of that color:<br/><br/><br/>    Red lets you reroll as many dice as you want.<br/>    Blue lets you change one brick space to a window space when you're drawing something into your facade.<br/>    Purple lets you draw one brick space in an empty space of your choice (as long as this space isn't floating in air).<br/>    Green lets you change all dice of one color to another color of your choice.<br/>    Yellow lets you use a polyomino shape that was crossed out on a previous turn.<br/><br/><br/>You can use as many stars as you wish on your turn.<br/><br/>When you fill in a horizontal row in the facade of your building, you score 2 points if all the spaces are filled with windows and 1 point if at least one space holds brick; when you fill in a vertical column, you score 4 points and 2 points under the same condition. When you fill in predesignated rows and columns, you receive an immediate bonus &mdash; either drawing one window in an empty space or crossing off two boxes in one or two color lines on your scoresheet. If you cross out the final space in a color line, you score 2 points.<br/><br/>Gameplay continues until someone has scored 12 or more points. Complete the round so that each player has had the same number of turns, then whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

No game tells the story of World War II in Europe like Totaler Krieg!<br/><br/>This new edition of our popular Krieg! game is still the same highly playable, unpredictable and enjoyable experience it always has been. What&rsquo;s new is a design and graphic update and expansion to give you more options -- especially if you want to explore the critical pre-war period from 1937 to 1939. What if the Republicans had won the Spanish Civil War? What if Germany and Russia hadn&rsquo;t signed their Non-Aggression Pact? What if France had modernized its army instead of building the Maginot Line? All of these options are literally in the cards that form the strategies of the three factions -- Axis, Soviet Allies, and Western Allies.<br/><br/>Best of all, Totaler Krieg! can be linked with its new Pacific companion game, Axis Empires: Dai Senso!, to play the joint Axis Empires scenario, an eye-opening global look at all of World War II. The fate of the world is in your hands!<br/><br/>Totaler Krieg means Total War in German. In the game, play moves from Pre-War (where players mobilize their forces and engage in diplomacy) to Limited War (when open conflict begins) to Total War -- at that point, it&rsquo;s all-out warfare to achieve victory!<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>    Two 22 x 34 inch maps<br/>    840 counters on three countersheets<br/>    200 cards<br/>    A 64-page rulebook<br/>    A 24-page scenario book<br/>    Play aids and force pool displays<br/><br/><br/>",

Players then alternate turns, either moving a piece to an adjacent space, rotating a piece 90&ordm;, swap two adjacent pieces if one of them is a switch piece, or rotating their laser 90&ordm;; the pieces have two, one, or zero mirrored surfaces, and after moving or rotating a piece on your turn, you must then fire your laser, with the laser possibly being deflected by 90&ordm; whenever it hits a mirror on a piece (since the mirrors are angled at 45&ordm;). If the beam strikes a non-mirrored surface on almost any piece, that piece is removed from play. (One exception: The defenders have one surface immune from laser fire, which means you can use them to protect your king; they're vulnerable to laser fire from other directions, though.)<br/><br/>When a king is hit by a laser, the other player wins the game! Friendly fire is possible, so try to make sure that you won't remove one of your one pieces when you shoot &mdash; unless you need to clear a shot to the enemy, that is!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Tycoon, players are businessmen traveling around the world, doing what businessmen do: making money.  In this case, business is defined as opening hotels and factories in major cities, like Sydney, Cairo, and New York.<br/><br/>Players are seeking to build hotels in as many cities as possible while also building the first or second most hotels in given cites to earn money, which is also your score. Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.<br/><br/>During the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.<br/><br/>The regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.<br/><br/>At the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs. After three scorings the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Their main purpose is to increase the standard of living, and thus the happiness of its citizens. They have within reach a whole range of projects that the city council wants to achieve, but which lack the funds. By skillfully selecting plans, using available space and deciding which projects their money should be spent on they will be expanding the city and competing for the title of the most people-friendly company.<br/><br/>During play, the game board is expanded by players laying down tiles, with each tile representing a piece of the city, a district that might need to be provided with electricity or water in exchange for receiving some benefit. Some of the tiles require a supply of luxury goods; others generate them; others give only points of happiness, such as the hospital.<br/><br/>Resources are common, and each of them can be bought by players from power stations and waterworks. These resources, however, are not unlimited and their use must be well planned. Keep in mind, too, that you must pay opponents when transporting raw materials through districts they own.<br/><br/>Game play in City Tycoon passes through four stages, and in each of them the buildings get larger and more impressive while at the same time requiring more resources and giving better benefits. Players quickly notice the relations between them and may choose several possible strategies to develop their investments, for example, focusing on making money, constructing scoring buildings to the exclusion of all else. Each of these strategies has its pluses and minuses, and the actions of other players might force you to expand in new directions and change your tactic.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TECH? NO! <br/>Forget about expensive game systems, emulators, disconnected online games, and high-priced yearly roster updates. TECHNO BOWL takes everything you love about arcade and video game football classics like Tecmo Bowl, NFL Blitz, and Madden and puts it all on the tabletop.<br/><br/>1UP<br/>And as if that isn&rsquo;t cool enough, it also gives you a feature that gamers have long asked for but never gotten&hellip; until now! What is it you ask? As a coach in TECHNO BOWL, you will design your own formations and plays. That&rsquo;s right. Let me say it again. You get to design your own formations and plays.<br/><br/>And I&rsquo;m not talking about choosing several formation cards, lining up elements on a chart, or utilizing some other abstraction. This is putting the power to effortlessly create real football formations and plays into your hands.<br/><br/>ZERO DOWN TIME<br/>Thanks to the BOX SPORTS ENGINE, there is almost zero down time in the game [except for half time and timeouts of course!]. Coaches are constantly involved, and the on-field players are always interacting with one another as skill checks and ever evolving plays result in: free actions, reactions, read-and-reacts, and offensive and defensive adjustments. Add to that real world timers for setting up formations and selecting plays, and you have a truly dynamic fast-paced tabletop football experience.<br/><br/>UNPARALLELED FOOTBALL GAMEPLAY<br/>TECHNO BOWL delivers that authentic football feel like no game before it. Establish the running game by punching it in between the tackles or tossing it to a back for an outside sweep. Launch an air offensive while sitting in the pocket or throwing on the run with laser accurate throws directly to the receiver or exciting route passes where you lead the receiver in hopes of beating the coverage. Defense can run man, zone, and mixed defensive packages and bring the blitz. Oh, can it bring the blitz!<br/><br/>No matter which strategy you choose, the gameplay will look, feel, and flow like a real football play.<br/><br/>OPTIONS<br/>TECHNO BOWL is all about options, and there&rsquo;s a game mode, team, and play style for everyone. You even have the option to run an option!<br/><br/>MODES<br/>There are five different modes of play. Each of these brings a different experience to the table.<br/><br/>- TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with no skills and no field goals.<br/>- ALL TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with skills but no field goals.<br/>- INFERNO! It&rsquo;s ALL TECHNO with more awesome and fire! [more later]<br/>- PRO is 8-vs-8 with no skills but includes field goal rules.<br/>- ALL PRO is 8-vs-8 with skills and field goal rules.<br/><br/>Each of these modes offers a completely different game experience, and I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. How does adding an extra couple of players to the field [and the ability to kick field goals] equate with an entirely different mode? Trust me. Having that extra player on both sides of the ball quite literally changes everything.<br/><br/>MAD SKILLS<br/>When playing in modes that utilize special skills and abilities, coaches will have access to three types of players:<br/><br/>- IMPACT<br/>- STAR<br/>- SUPERSTAR<br/><br/>These players will come equipped with one or more of the 26 skills found in the game. That count of 26 skills doesn&rsquo;t even include core fundamentals or INFERNO MODE specific skills.<br/><br/>SKILL<br/>Speaking of skills, TECHNO BOWL is a game of skill and not a random &lsquo;dice fest&rsquo;. The 2d6 rolls used for skill checks mean that coaches won&rsquo;t fall prey to straight-line probabilities or random chaos. Winning is about getting the right match and modifiers to deliver a high percentage roll, having a plan when you get an unusually poor result, and knowing the right time to make a high risk roll for a shot at a very high payoff. Of course, your formations, play calling, and player positioning create these opportunities.<br/><br/>PLAYMAKER DIE<br/>The PLAYMAKER die powers some of the special skills in the game like stiff arms and spin moves allowing for sophisticated passive abilities to be triggered without the need for complex rules.<br/><br/>TEAMS<br/>There are 32 teams in the MORE FUN LEAGUE [MFL], and each of these has its own unique play style. This means that you&rsquo;re not just trying to get into the head of the coach that&rsquo;s sitting across the table from you, but that you have to take into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of the players on the specific rosters that you and your opponent are using.<br/><br/>PLAYER SKILL RATINGS<br/>The player skill rating system ensures that coaches and spectators will know how well or poorly a player performs fundamental actions by simply looking at the jersey number! No need to look at charts or extended stat lines. The league skill cap manages team composition so that you are never taxed to remember an insane number of special abilities or which players have them. Coaches get beaten by other coaches and NOT the rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to the More Fun League!<br/><br/>",

Once a beautiful land of craggy mountains, fertile valleys, and deep bottomless chasms, it has now wilted like a rose in winter.<br/><br/>The small kingdom, tucked away from the rest of the world, has had few rulers in its time. None certainly as evil as their current. It is rumored that Mirza Noctis came to power some two-hundred years ago. Eternally youthful, the man is whispered to have controlled the bloodlines of this place, carefully arranging unions between noble families and culling those of weaker bloodlines.<br/><br/>Now, the peoples of Krasvetelia live a harsh life, starved of happiness. Writing is outlawed and the caste system in place prevents all but a handful of nobles from holding titles and land in Noctis&rsquo;s name. Up until recently, starving to death was most of Krasvetelian&rsquo;s worries. But more and more, people are going missing in this land. Devoured by darkness, some say...<br/><br/>The scholars, left to themselves in their remote monasteries, have recently unearthed a terrible secret: Mirza Noctis is working tirelessly, his agents harvesting blood from the local populous. Years of unattachment to this land have left the people mostly unaware of his actions. But a terrifying fact is now clear: Noctis is working towards a massive blood ritual. He has all but locked away any tools that could be used to defeat him, and the scholars worry he is just beginning. A greater threat is about to befall the land...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As always, each deck in the line contains cards from three of the seven houses included in the line, but for Dark Tidings the Dis house will be replaced with the Unfathomable, which  specializes in controlling their foes by exhausting enemy creatures. Some cards keep your opponent's creatures down, making it difficult for them to muster a fighting force or reap enough &aelig;mber. Once your enemies are exhausted, you can keep them out of commission with other cards or even wipe away their board.<br/><br/>Each Dark Tidings deck also includes a high/low tide card. The card starts the game out of play, but eventually one player will bring it into play, especially since some cards in Dark Tidings can carry out their effects &mdash; or have a massively larger effect &mdash; when the high tide is on that player's side. Many effects can raise the tide, but if they're not available, the player with low tide can always suffer three chains to turn the tide in their favor.<br/><br/>Dark Tidings also features the debut of &quot;evil twin decks&quot;, a new type of deck. For example, you may open a deck that's entitled &quot;Speaker Domitia's Evil Twin&quot;. This deck is an exact copy of &quot;Speaker Domitia&quot;, a real deck that has been printed and can be found by another player out in the world. The crucial difference is that in an evil twin deck, many of your creatures look a little different. Specifically, in Dark Tidings, many creatures have evil twin variants, and if you find an evil twin deck, every creature with an evil twin variant appears in that form. These evil twin creatures feature new artwork, graphic design, and abilities, making them a significant departure from the original creature.<br/><br/>",

You don't want to be that guy. You don't &quot;go all in,&quot; you don't always keep your promises, and you don't do &quot;what's best for the group.&quot; Instead, you do everything you can to become indispensable, and &quot;everything&quot; is literal here &ndash; even if it means stealing from, betraying, and blackmailing other players.<br/><br/>In order to escape from Alcatraz, the players need to complete six parts of a plan. Each part is a &quot;pick-up and deliver&quot; task requiring specific items obtained in different parts of the prison. Once each part of the plan is completed, every player but the scapegoat moves a little closer to escaping, with the scapegoat being voted on each round by all the players &ndash; most likely the player who contributed the least to completing that particular task, but you never know. Thus, you could say that Alcatraz is a cooperative game &ndash; but with a twist.<br/><br/>The map of the prison constituting the play area is generated randomly each game, providing high replayability. Alcatraz is designed for 3-4 players, and due to its theme and complex gameplay is best suited for mature players.<br/><br/>",

The famous Dr. van Helsing got wind of Dracula's plans and immediately caught the next carriage to London. It is a race against time! Van Helsing tries to find and destroy all of the vampire's coffins, while the count tries to find five victims. Will the horror end tonight or will the count's reign of terror continue?<br/><br/>Dracula is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>Dracula is a two player game hand management/memory game. One player takes the role of Professor Van Helsing, the other player is Dracula. Van Helsing is trying to locate and destroy Dracula's coffins whilst Dracula is attempting to find victims that he can turn in to vampires.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of cards which they place face-down on the board. These cards contain the coffins/victims that they other player must find to win. They also contain minions, helpers and traps that can harm or distract the other player. Players can also place coloured barriers to obstruct their opponent's progress.<br/><br/>Players move their pieces by playing from a second hand of action cards. Each action card contains an ability and a distance to be moved. When a player ends their move they reveal the card that their piece has landed on and (if it is one of their own) replace it with a new card.

        "description": "Reichbusters: Projekt Vril is a fast and furious game with lots of weird science, witty one-liners, and heroic moments set during World War II. It is late December 1944 and, on the face of it, history has unfolded as we know it, but that could be about to change.<br/><br/>The Nazis have discovered a source of &quot;vril&quot; that has been brought back to the Reich for study. Vril is a source of energy that can control all types of matter. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms.<br/><br/>If the Nazis work out how to harness this power it will be more potent than the atomic bomb. The secret Nazi experiments are not just a threat to the outcome of the war, but to the entire world. Many different secret bunkers hold all manner of research into the properties of the enigmatic vril and we're sending you, the Reichbusters, on a mission to stop this research in its tracks!<br/><br/>Players will choose from a selection of Allied Heroes and visit R&amp;D to prepare equipment before venturing out on missions against the evil &quot;Vrilmeisters&quot;. Mission objectives will vary from mission to mission while secondary objectives could appear as the heroes explore the bunkers. Each mission will see the players facing off against more and more heinous enemies, from re-animated corpses to dark experiments, and from ferocious mutations gone wrong to the evil Vrilmeisters themselves.<br/><br/>Each mission begins with the heroes infiltrating, making the use of stealth, hidden actions and minimising noise to make their way towards their objective undetected. Players will have to choose how long to remain quiet because time will be of the essence.<br/><br/>Inevitably, however, the Nazis will discover the presence of the heroes and once the alarm is raised, players need to be prepared for all hell to break loose. Once the objective has been completed the heroes must escape to report back their success, however, anyone left behind will be captured and unavailable in future missions if playing a campaign.<br/><br/>Players will be able to take part in an ongoing Campaign of missions or they can set up a Raid with random maps, heroes, and Nazi faction to fight against.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Reichbusters: Projekt Vril is a fully co-operative game so the heroes will either succeed or fail together.<br/><br/>While remaining hidden players can choose the player order and on their turn players can take a number of actions including Moving, Fighting, Drawing, Picking up Items &amp; Interacting with board elements.<br/><br/>In addition to base actions, players will also have their hero specific card decks. These cards modify actions as they happen such as adding dice to attacks or making more tactical movement. The hero cards can also be used to take additional actions beyond your base actions.<br/><br/>Each hero also comes with exciting Feats which can be used to turn the tide or secure that crucial objective right when you need to. On top of that, each hero receives a number of &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; at the beginning of the game. &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; can be spent to automatically succeed at tests such as attacks. In desperate moments you can also use &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; to prevent failed tests, but this will find you running out of them fast!<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the players will find items that they can carry and use. Some of these will be things they are looking for as part of their missions. Other things will be useful stuff like medical supplies, vril healing potions, guns, grenades, etc.<br/><br/>Custom dice will be used to decide the outcome of attacks, defence and the impacts of noise created by players. Each card tells you how much noise it creates, and how much Nazi activity it triggers. The more cards you play, the more noise you generate, and the more the Nazis act in response.<br/><br/>The Nazi reinforcements will be relentless so the heroes need to complete their objective and escape before time runs out and they get overwhelmed by the Nazi forces and their vril tech.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1947 and you are a member of the thriving movie-making industry of Hollywood. However, it is suspected that there are communists hiding among your small production studio slipping &ldquo;un-Patriotic&rdquo; messages, themes, props, and lines into your movies! Will you be able to find all the communists before your studio is shut down? Or will you be suspected yourself and banned from the industry?<br/><br/>In the game each player will secretly be a Patriot, Communist, or Rising Star. Each round every player will have a unique Job to perform (such as the Screenwriter, Gaffer, Director, Actor, Editor, etc). These jobs will affect what kind of movie is getting made that round, what cards are in players&rsquo; hands, and who will receive special information. Players can choose to skip their jobs to instead re-roll any two of the dice in the game. At the end of each round the players with stars showing on their dice will get to add a card into the movie.<br/><br/>The added cards will be shuffled, one will be removed, and the rest will be revealed. The team with the majority of revealed symbols (including the symbols on that round&rsquo;s movie poster) wins the round! Indicate the winning team for the round by placing that team&rsquo;s matching film-strip over the movie poster. The first team to win 4 rounds wins the game! The Rising Star plays both sides by trying to make the game go to 7 rounds and making the 7th round a tie.<br/><br/>Hollywood 1947 is a social deduction game. You must never show your cards or loyalty to anyone, but you may say whatever you&rsquo;d like about the cards you put into a movie, or about your true allegiance. Open discussion about which cards were added into a movie is encouraged. However, if you are a Communist or the Rising Star, lying will often help you accomplish your goals since the majority of players will be Patriots.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s a wrap. Most players get the hang of the game after only a few minutes. So let&rsquo;s go make some movies, but be careful who you trust!<br/><br/>Hollywood 1947 is the 5th standalone game in the Dark Cities Series by Facade Games. Previous games in the series include Salem 1692, Tortuga 1667, Deadwood 1876, and Bristol 1350.<br/><br/>You can follow the Kickstarter at this link: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/travishancock/hollywood-1947-a-movie-making-game-of-strategy-and-deception?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/travishancock/hollywood...</a><br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

As the new century dawns, players ply the thriving trade of finding treasures in shipwrecks around the island. Before a hurricane hits, players need to search the many shipwrecks and sell the lost treasures to the island denizens for as much cash as possible.<br/><br/>This was designer Paul Randles' final game before passing away in 2003. Tilsit Editions published it in French, German, and Italian in 2005, and Titanic Games made it available in English for the first time, with an all-new graphic design and pieces.<br/><br/>The Titanic edition of Key Largo contains:<br/>Full-color board of the island in the Florida Keys<br/>5 wooden boats<br/>1 diving helmet<br/>130 cards<br/>15 divers<br/>40 hoses, tridents, and weights<br/>Money<br/>Full-color rulebook<br/><br/>The setting :<br/>The action takes place on a Caribbean island, in the very last days on the 19th century. The island has long been a pirate's harbour, and it has recently be found out that there were many sunken galleons around. Hurricane Katty is due in ten days, so you have little time to hire a diver team and bring back as much sunken treasure as possible.<br/><br/>The systems :<br/>Key Largo is a double-guessing game, like Paul Randles' other game, Pirate's Cove. Every morning, each player secretly decides what he will do the coming day - take tourists dolphin watching, search a wreck for treasures, sell treasures at the market, buy equipment at the local shop, or go to the tavern to hire more divers and listen to the rumours. It's also a light management game, where you start with little cash and must make your money grow through fruitful investment. The winner is the richest player when the hurricane breaks through and stops all diving around the island.<br/><br/>",

After all cards for the round have been dealt, you bid on how many tricks you think you/your team will win. (In a four-player game, the higher of the two bids on a team becomes the team's bid.)<br/><br/>During the round, you can lead with any non-gold card. On your turn, you must not play a suit that has already been played (unless it is a gold card). The highest number played wins, but gold is the trump suit and always wins. Whoever played the lowest non-gold card adds a gold card of the same number from the supply to their collection if it is available. All gold cards played in a trick are returned to the supply.<br/><br/>The round ends immediately when a player cannot play a valid base metal card and does not have a gold card to play or chooses not to play a gold card. If you win more tricks than you bid, you earn your bid value as points; if you met your bid exactly, you earn twice your bid value as points. Additionally, you earn points for the number of gold cards in your collection. The player/team with the most points wins a gold nugget, and the first to collect two nuggets wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Trial by Trolley, one player acts as the Trolley Operator and must choose where to send a murderous, out of control, trolley. Every other player at the table plays cards and argues in order to convince the operator to spare their lives and condemn everyone on the other track to a gruesome death-by-trolley.<br/><br/>Each round, one player will act as the trolley conductor. This person will be the judge, and will choose which track the trolley will murder.<br/><br/>Each other player is divided evenly among teams, and each player(s) will have a role for the round.<br/><br/>To begin, one player will draw 3 angelic tracks, choose one to play to the table, and then randomly reveal a 2nd angelic track from the deck to add to the track. Another player will draw 3 demonic tracks, and choose to add one to the opposing teams track, attempting to sabotage them, and spare their own tracks. Finally, player(s) will draw track modifiers to place on any track card on the table. They can play on their own tracks, to sway the judge, or they may play on their opponents, to further sway the judge into murdering their opponent's track.<br/><br/>The judge will ponder this conundrum, and eventually decide to murder one track. The track that was spared is the winner for the round!<br/><br/>Play continues for a number of rounds pre-determined by the number of players at the table.<br/><br/>Trial by Trolley is a game for 3-13 players, and plays in about 30-90 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Rise of the Luftwaffe&quot; is the first in Down in Flames series of card wargames that simulate World War 2 air combat. Each player has a hand of maneuver cards which he uses to improve his position relative to an enemy plane or fire on the enemy. The opponent is allowed to counter the maneuver by playing cards of his own, to which original player can counter back, etc. The last player to play a card determines whether the original action occurs or not.<br/><br/>Each plane is rated with horsepower (which indicates how many card you can draw), performance (how many cards to be held), burst (the values of fire cards that can be played), etc. The number of cards in your hand abstractly represents the momentum of each aircraft.<br/><br/>A dogfight lasts a mere 6 turns and take about 15 minutes to play. There are also campaign games which represent a number of interconnected missions and various operations the players can take. A campaign can take about 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>You have been caught looting the hoard of the dreaded Drakon. For such transgression, a fiery death should be the only appropriate response &mdash; but Drakon has decided to toy with you before she devours you. You and your rival heroes will each be released into the labyrinth, and the first hero to discover ten gold pieces will go free with his treasure. The rest of you will satisfy the dragon's hunger.<br/><br/>In every game of Drakon, you and your opponents must fight to stay alive in the midst of the labyrinth. On your turn, you can either move your hero to another room, or add another piece to the labyrinth, placing beneficial chambers in your own path and throwing your opponents into harm's way. But you must be cautious. The chambers of Drakon's labyrinth are filled with danger and ancient magics, not to mention the dragon herself. To navigate these deadly corridors and survive, you&rsquo;ll need to be quick and careful.<br/><br/>On every turn, you have a crucial choice to make. You can either move forward into a new chamber, or you can expand the labyrinth by playing a new chamber tile from your hand. The new chambers that you play feature unique circumstances and magical objects that you may encounter on your adventures through Drakon's lair.<br/><br/>The majority of these chambers offer powerful effects to any hero that enters the chamber. You may gain the power to destroy any chamber in the labyrinth, or call a windstorm to carry you along, increasing your movement. You may even take command of a floating chamber and fly it to the other side of the labyrinth. Other chambers force more harmful effects on those heroes unlucky enough to enter. A room may cause you to lose a coin as you avoid the dangers within, and any hero who hears the siren song of the magical harp is forced to move into its chamber. As you and your fellow heroes play these chambers from your hand, they form a cunning maze, and only the wise can find their way out.<br/><br/>Despite the power of these chambers, the central goal of your quest is to find gold: only by being the first player to claim ten gold can you escape the dungeon. Plenty of chambers allow you to find a coin or steal a coin from an opponent, but the gold value of coins can vary dramatically. Your most recently stolen coin may have a value of three gold or just one. Because coins are kept face-down, hiding their value, you'll never know exactly how close your opponents are to victory.<br/><br/>Six heroes are trapped within Drakon's sadistic labyrinth, and each hero has his own unique abilities to help him survive. Each ability can only be used once per game though, making the timing of the ability incredibly important. You may play as the sorceress and escape from a most dire situation by passing through a wall. You may play as the thief and collect the gold you need at the most opportune moment by preying on another hero. You may even play as the ranger and use a burst of speed to race across the maze when necessary. No matter which hero you play in a game of Drakon, you'll need to take full advantage of your unique ability at the opportune moment if you want to grab the gold and escape from Drakon's clutches.<br/><br/>Of course, the heroes are not alone in the labyrinth. The legendary dragon also stalks the halls and chambers of the maze, taunting any hero unlucky enough to encounter her. Certain chambers throughout the labyrinth allow you to move Drakon through the dungeon. If you can move Drakon into the same chamber as a hapless hero, that hero is immediately sent back to the entrance chamber and loses three coins, as Drakon toys with him before releasing him once more into the maze.<br/><br/>You and your rival heroes are trapped. Your greatest threat may be Drakon or the other heroes. In this dark labyrinth, only one thing can save you: your own greed. Will you ruthlessly grab gold and undermine your opponent&rsquo;s schemes before escaping to victory? Or will you fail and become just another meal for the dragon? You decide your fate, but only one hero can escape from Drakon!<br/><br/>",

During each turn of Godtear, players compete to influence the momentum of battle, allowing them to gain the upper hand. This is represented by moving the turn token on the battle ladder closer to that player&rsquo;s warband token.<br/><br/>Here are the ways a player can influence the tide of battle and move the turn token closer to their own warband token:<br/><br/>&bull; Knock out an enemy champion - 4 steps<br/>&bull; Knock out a small enemy follower - 1 step<br/>&bull; Knock out a large enemy follower - 2 steps<br/>&bull; Make a claim action during the plot phase - 1 step<br/>&bull; Have a friendly banner on an objective hex during the end phase - 4 steps<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, the player with the turn token in their half of the battle ladder wins the turn and gains the number of victory points shown on the reverse side of that turn&rsquo;s turn token.<br/><br/>The first player to have 5 victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In Junk Orbit, you're captain of your own scavenger ship, picking up space junk and transporting it to any city that will take it. Launch your junk ... uh, *cargo* ... out of your airlock to propel your ship! Race to deliver your cargo as you navigate the orbits of nearby planets and moons! It's astrodynamics for fun and profit! On your turn, carry out these three steps:<br/><br/>1. Launch junk &mdash; Choose any one junk tile in your cargo hold and move it away from your ship (clockwise or counter-clockwise, your choice) a number of spaces equal to its numeric value. If it reaches its destination city this way, you have made a remote delivery. Otherwise, it simply comes to rest after moving its full distance. It is also possible to hit an enemy ship with launched junk, causing that opponent to discard one junk tile from their cargo.<br/><br/>2. Move ship &mdash; Your ship must now move the same distance that your launched junk did, but in the opposite direction. When your ship reaches a transfer point between location boards, you may choose to switch orbits. If you do, your ship changes direction (from clockwise to counter-clockwise, or vice versa) as it enters the new orbit. If the space your ship lands on is the destination of any junk in your cargo, you have made a direct delivery.<br/><br/>3. Pick up junk &mdash; After moving your ship, pick up all junk tiles present in your current city, adding them to your cargo hold. Then, refill your current city with one new junk tile from the corresponding stack (e.g., if at a Mars city, refill from the Mars stack).<br/><br/>Each player has their own ship with a unique ship power that breaks the rules above in some way. The end of the game is triggered when a city cannot be refilled because its stack is empty. When this happens, every player gets one final turn, then players tally the values from all of their delivered junk tiles, and whoever has the highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Avalonhill web site:<br/><br/>German tanks thunder into the snow-covered Ardennes forest, opposed only by a few unsuspecting divisions of exhausted American troops. As Axis forces plunge into the countryside, Allied troops must struggle to hold the front line in order to repel the all-out offensive. Axis &amp; Allies: Battle of the Bulge challenges you to control territory and contend with supply shortages, while directing infantry, artillery, tanks, and aircraft in one of the most decisive conflicts of World War II.<br/><br/>Scheduled for release in November, 2006, Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge will feature detailed game components including a new truck piece, a hex-based game board with new original artwork, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the Battle of the Bulge game box. Other elements of this new Axis &amp; Allies variant include crucial elements that were key factors in the historical battle, such as supply shortages and late-battle air support, mechanics for overland vs. road movement and randomized casualties of war<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies depicts Wacht am Rhein (Watch on the Rhein), the German code name for this counteroffensive that took place toward the end of World War II. The objective: to capture the port city of Antwerp. It was expected that the capture of Antwerp would cause a great disruption in the flow of Allied supplies, and also have the effect of breaking apart the great Anglo-American alliance.<br/><br/>One player controls Germany, whose massive build up of forces have gone undetected by the Allies and are poised to unleash all their fury on the Allies. The other player controls the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States and they must stem the tide of German armor and hold their positions until reinforcements arrive.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is designed for two players and can be played in three to four hours. Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is the fourth Axis &amp; Allies variant, following the successful Axis &amp; Allies D-Day, Axis &amp; Allies Europe and Axis &amp; Allies Pacific versions. Axis &amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge is available on November 17th, 2006.<br/><br/>Box Dimension: 15.8 x 10.5 x 3<br/><br/>",

The two players compete by seeing which grouping of Allies can conquer as much German territory as possible&mdash;while they also play against their opponent to stop the opposite front. Never a dull moment as both players are always playing one side or the other at the same time.<br/><br/>The scenarios start the campaign at various points and as an added feature, the game includes a 16 Dec 44 (Bulge) campaign start for the Western Front.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 10 to 15 days<br/>    Hex: 15 miles / 24.1 Km<br/>    Units: Company to Corps<br/><br/><br/>Contents (Original edition):<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; map (France except Brittany, Belgium, Netherlands, West Germany)<br/>    One countersheet (280 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>    One 8-page SCS-specific series rulebook <br/>    One 16-page TME specific rulebook<br/><br/><br/>Contents (Revised &amp; Expanded edition):<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full-color map (France except Brittany, Belgium, Netherlands, West Germany)<br/>    One 22 x 28&quot; full-color map (Germany except west, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary)<br/>    One 8.5 x 11&quot; full-color map  (Brittany)<br/>    Two countersheets (560 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>    One 8-page SCS-specific v1.7 rulebook<br/>    One 16-page TME-revised specific rulebook<br/>    One 16-page TME-Expansion rulebook<br/><br/><br/>(source: MMP website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from BoardgameNews.com:<br/><br/>The Gonzaga family ruled part of northern Italy for nearly five hundred years, losing control to the Hapsburgs from Austria in 1708. During their reign, two daughters of the House of Gonzaga married Holy Roman Emperors. In Gonzaga, players must get into the expansionist spirit of the times and build fiefdoms across Europe to stake a claim on harbors and cities, while also trying to complete secret missions. The game lasts 7-12 rounds, and players are competing in some of six regions in Europe. (The number of regions and the specific regions vary based on the number of players and the scenario tile drawn at the start of the game.)<br/><br/>A round starts with each player drawing a fief card from their individual deck; each fief card depicts one of twelve fiefs: plastic components comprising multiple hexagonal loops with castles on some of these loops. Each player then secretly chooses both a region card and an action card, then reveals them simultaneously. Part of the fief (but not all of it) must lie in the chosen region, and the action card determines whether a player must play the fief on one or more harbors, on one or more cities, on open land, or on both harbors and cities. With this last action &ndash; the alliance card &ndash; a player can alternatively place one or two of six individual rings on the board, even on spaces that another player has already claimed with a fief. You score points for covering cities and harbors, for connecting at least three harbors in a sea, and for setting aside your fief as a donation to the church. The cards you play are set aside for the next turn, thereby forcing you to switch regions and actions as you place fiefs.<br/><br/>The game ends either after twelve rounds or after a trigger point based on the cities and harbors not covered. The player with the most connected fiefs, including the individual rings, scores a bonus, then players reveal their hidden objectives and score based on the number of target cities they covered.<br/><br/>",

Players collect Keeper cards to satisfy the victory requirements but watch out for Cthulhu and other fiendish Creepers that will prevent you from winning &ndash; even if you otherwise have the winning combination!<br/><br/>",

These adventurers are there to collect as much of this rare resource as they can, while their rivals constantly try to steal it. You are one of these superstars on a quest for wealth, and you must overcome the gravitational challenges set before you!<br/><br/>What is really original about Gravity Superstar is the manner in which the players' pawns move: Each turn, they move one or two spaces, then they are affected by gravity, which makes them fall until they are stopped by a platform. This effect is made possible by the fact that the pawns are used lying down on the board. Thus, they move up (above their head), down (below their feet), left, or right.<br/><br/>During its movement, a pawn can collect stars (to score points at the end of the game) or replay tokens (to take a second consecutive turn), and eject opponents' pawns from the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Awakening the Bear is the first game in the multi-award winning Conflict of Heroes series. This series is a squad level combined arms training game used by history fans, universities, and military personnel throughout the world.  This game takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.<br/><br/>You command German or Soviet forces comprised of infantry squads, crewed support weapons, individual tanks, armored cars, artillery, and more. Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank's defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system. You do not have to worry about the details; they are all built into the system! As the commander, you concentrate on tactics to execute your mission and firefight objectives.<br/><br/>The 3rd Edition Rules change several key elements of Conflict of Heroes from previous editions. A Unit no longer receives 7  Action Points. Instead, each Turn, a player selects one of their Units to take an Action. After completing the Action, they roll a custom d10 die to determine if the Unit becomes Spent. If the player rolls higher than the Action&rsquo;s Cost, the Unit is free to continue taking Actions on future Turns. More involved Actions have a higher Spent probability. On average, Units will be able to take the same number of Actions as in the previous 7AP edition rules, but now your units may not always perform as expected.<br/><br/>This and other new mechanics like Stress encourage players to experiment with integrated battlefield tactics that make use of multiple Units working together. They also heighten the experience of &lsquo;Fog of War,&rsquo; in that players must now assess the risk attached to each Action they take, and determine the best time to use their CAPs to mitigate that risk.<br/><br/>All previous Conflict of Heroes editions are 100% compatible with these 3rd Edition rules. This game can also be played with previous edition rules.<br/><br/>",

Millenia after the collapse of the Federation, the greatest empire to ever rule the galaxy, a few species are taking up to the stars again to escape their dying worlds. They all have the same goal: to rebuild their civilizations and reclaim their former glory. But there can only be one ruler.<br/><br/>Fractal is a living, breathing world, with a story-driven legacy campaign: the Aftermath. As you play, you&rsquo;ll discover a deep and rich lore spanning millennia, and featuring cosmic Gods, fallen empires and warring civilizations. The choices you will make and your victories will shape the fate of the universe and let you unveil the secrets of the game. The core game also pushes the boundaries of the genre further with a lot of bold and innovative designs, among which:&nbsp;<br/><br/><br/>     Faction asymmetry. Each faction has three different points of asymmetry: their innate abilities, political philosophies and battle masteries, for a modular and completely different experience based on your civilization.&nbsp;<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Tactic cards. There are no dice in the game, and you&rsquo;ll never lose a battle because of bad luck. Instead, the combat system was devised as an intense game of bluff, deception and deduction based on upgradable tactic cards, with an initiative-based turn-order.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Living galaxy. The game contains various mechanics and components whose purpose is to create a universe in flux, so players are forced to adapt to the game instead of mindlessly playing the same strategy over and over again.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, the design and art work in tandem to create a modern, visually impacting take on the genre, and a true 4X experience of the future.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "South Louisiana has a long, rich history of delicious Cajun dishes like gumbos and jambalayas. A big part of what makes these meals so great is the seafood in them that is fished from the Gulf of Mexico. The men and women who run the shrimp boats that fish that seafood have to be both hard-working and crafty, finding the optimum strategy to bring in the best catch. They are the &quot;Captains of the Gulf&quot;.<br/><br/>Captains of the Gulf is a thematic action selection game, full of flavor. In the game, 2-4 players each operate a fishing boat in the Gulf of Mexico, hoping to make the largest profit over eight game turns. The players try to upgrade their fishing boat, add crew members, then move out to fish crabs, oysters, and shrimp, after which they need to deliver them to ports.<br/><br/>Cards are multi-purpose; they are added to a player's mat on top (licenses), at the left side (crew), or at the right side (boat upgrade). Moreover, when you fish you need to play them out of your hand.<br/><br/>",

Poor Coyote had lost everything.<br/><br/>They sat down by a fire to dry off and rest. Coyote became jealous of the other animals because they still had all their things, so he challenged them to a bluffing game to win their belongings. The other animals agreed to the challenge as they thought Coyote would never win. After all, he is known to never tell the truth &mdash; but in this game everybody has to lie because no one knows the truth...<br/><br/>In the bluffing game Coyote, you always see the cards of the other players, but never your own. When it's your turn, you must announce a number that is less than the total of all the cards in the game, yet higher than the previous number given. Alternatively, you can challenge the number previously announced. Finally, when all the cards are revealed, you'll see who has the cunning Coyote on their side.<br/><br/>Coyote is in the same game line as Spicy, with the game box and card backs being decorated with a special metallic print in copper. As in the tradition of the Northwest Coast Tribes, copper is a symbol of prosperity and cultural wealth.<br/><br/>The artist Zona Evon Shroyer (Yupik Alaskan Native) is a master of the traditional Northwest Coastal art, whose richness of detail and complexity requires years of study and practice. For the cover illustration of Coyote, she designed a modern silhouette for the coyote, which she then filled in a classical manner with other animal motifs: turtle, beaver, and bear &mdash; the animals that he is sitting around the fire with and playing a game, in our little story.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In fact, it is fairly common among Deep Space Miners (5th class), and some say that it is almost unavoidable. And, well, it is. Especially since the crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten.<br/><br/>But, no reason to panic. We are here to help you deal with the physical and mental challenges of being eaten. This handy simulation/survival guide is standard issue for all recruits and will eventually lead to a productive, if not potentially brief, career in space mining.<br/><br/>Should you achieve your objective and mine enough crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jet pack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the beast. While the beast&rsquo;s immune response was not enough to prevent its demise, its contribution to human progress and corporate profitability are most definitely appreciated.<br/><br/>In the eventuality that the bacteria present in the beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not worry. Your non-organic parts will ultimately provide much utility to future space miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of attempts by evidently less-than-qualified recruits.<br/><br/>Finally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary crystals by the time you reach the end of the beast's digestive tract. In this case, the so-called &quot;ending #2&quot;, you will then exit the beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive, and yet forever changed. In this case, and after a thorough decontamination and quarantine period, we will have to evaluate your performance versus that of the beast&rsquo;s efforts to consume you.<br/><br/>In So, You've Been Eaten. the Miner and the Beast face off against one another. The Miner earns points by collecting crystals, and the Beast earns points by developing immune responses and by its bacteria attacking the Miner.<br/><br/>The Miner wins instantly by collecting all eight different crystals, and the Beast wins instantly by digesting the Miner after the attack of four bacteria of the same type. Of course, there's always the possibility that the Miner will simply pass through the Beast's system, in which case the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>So, You've Been Eaten. can be played as:<br/><br/>        A game for 2 players, with a Miner player against a Beast player.<br/>        A game for 1 player, with the Miner player against a sleeping Beast.<br/>        A game for 1 player, with the Beast player against a robot Miner.<br/>        A game for 0 players, with a sleeping Beast against a robot Miner.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Aptly enough, your building materials are cubes, or more precisely, dice!<br/><br/>On each turn, you roll two dice and place them in your studio as raw materials for your cubist sculptures. From there, you position these dice to complete commissioned installations for the museum. Dice with identical numbers can be stacked on top of one another to give your sculpture elevation and grandeur. Dice with adjacent numbers go next to one another to construct unconventional footprints of modernism. You can press your luck by committing to a certain risky commission &mdash; hoping that no one else will complete it first &mdash; or play it safe by locking up your dice for later use.<br/><br/>You can also use your dice to enlist the aid of masters of modern art like Juan Gris, Franz Marc, and Olga Rozanova. Each installation you complete allows you to contribute dice to the building of the Museum itself. You will have to sculpt cleverly but quickly to get the new Museum named after you!<br/><br/>",

Each spaceship is equipped with 1 to 4 lasers, and the lasers have 3 different &quot;strengths&quot;<br/><br/>The game is played in two stages. In the &quot;fast round&quot; players play their cards onto a table, trying to position them so that their laser beams will hit either the asteroid (and thereby &quot;mining&quot; it) or other players (causing them damage). Once one player has gotten rid of all of their cards, the &quot;scoring round&quot; begins.<br/><br/>In the Scoring round, all ships of the same rank will fire at the same time. (All &quot;1&quot; ships will fire, then all &quot;2&quot; ships, etc.) If, after all the ships of the same rank have fired, a ship has more damage than it does Health, the ship is destroyed. Play continues through the ranks 1-10. Once all ships have fired, players receive 1 point for each point of health they took from their opponent, plus one point for each successful &quot;mining&quot; of the asteroid.<br/><br/>Light Speed is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.<br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/>    2004 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100<br/><br/><br/>",

To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.<br/><br/>Game Description:<br/><br/>This simple card game is very reminiscent of Wiz-War. Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of &quot;Boons&quot; (special abilities) he may have. Players are dealt 3 quest cards initially in front of them (public knowledge) and have 5 Adventure cards in hand.<br/><br/>Each turn a player may:<br/><br/>     Discard unwanted cards and draw back to 5 cards.<br/>     Play Encounters and/or Bane cards (always on opponents never on yourself).<br/>     Build the Dungeon.<br/>     Move (collect Peril and Glory tokens).<br/><br/><br/>Players will collect Peril tokens as they move which then makes them targets for others to play Encounter/Bane cards against them (Encounter/Bane cards have a fee to play - which is paid for by the person who the card is played ON with Peril tokens). This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.<br/><br/>Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero &quot;go up a level&quot; which increases his abilities.<br/><br/>Treasures &amp; Boons help you, Banes, Traps &amp; Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).<br/><br/>The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.<br/><br/>This game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca. There are several planned expansions, and two special cards available by mail if you purchased at the convention.<br/><br/>First game in the Dungeoneer Series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Enemy Coast Ahead: The Doolittle Raid uses the game format to explore the first raid on the Japanese home islands by the United States during World War Two. It is a solitaire game challenging the player to conduct a successful mission where the criteria for success is not purely military. The player must organize, equip, and train a squadron of B-25 &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; medium bombers to attack a distant and rather dangerous target. The game not only covers the raid from launch to landing, it extends the story on both ends. Threatened from the air and from the sea, the player must do his utmost to strike the Japanese capital, avenging the attack on Pearl Harbor, and then land his aircraft safely. If the raid goes poorly it may boost Japanese morale and deflate the mood in the United States. Getting the B-25s close enough to launch is vital, as is the recovery of aircraft and crewmen, but above all, the player&rsquo;s main dilemma will be secrecy. The risk is great. Failure could mean the loss of an entire squadron, or worse, the sinking of a precious aircraft carrier. Will the Doolittle Raid add to the dismal news of Pearl Harbor, Guam, Wake Island, and Bataan, or will it signal the turning of the tide?<br/><br/>The History<br/>Washington &ndash; April 21, 1942: After two days of rumor prompted by Japanese radio broadcasts, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt finally agrees to a press conference. Deftly avoiding difficult questions, he claims insufficient information to neither confirm nor deny the biggest news story of the four month old war. To placate tenacious journalists, however, he tells the press that the attack on Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo by United States aircraft, was launched from a mysterious base he would only call &ldquo;Shangri-La,&rdquo; an imaginary island from the recently published novel Lost Horizon. His impish grin, if not his words, tell the press that the top secret operation dubbed Special Aviation Project Number One has indeed been a success.<br/><br/>That same day China&rsquo;s foreign minister hands a telegram to Army Air Corps Chief Hap Arnold. It has taken some time to arrive in Washington, an indication that all may not be well with the mission. Dictated two days ago by the commander of that top secret operation, a distraught Lt. Colonel James Doolittle, it reads:<br/><br/>Mission to bomb Tokyo has been accomplished. On entering China we ran into bad weather and it is feared that all planes crashed.<br/><br/>Telegram in hand, Arnold immediately admits to the commander of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the mission has failed. No bombers have been recovered. After sending that telegram, Doolittle himself expects a court martial, confiding to his engineer that they&rsquo;ll tie him to a desk for the rest of the war, if he&rsquo;s lucky. Days later he is astonished to learn of his promotion to Brigadier General, and even more so when he is notified that the president recommended the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br/><br/>The Doolittle Raid remains an enigmatic and contradictory episode of World War Two, defying easy interpretation even to this day. Was it a victory or a debacle? Was it a minor footnote in the annals of that war or a significant military event? Was it a desperate bid to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor, or, a harbinger signaling death and horror soon to visit Japanese cities from the sky?<br/><br/>Narrative Sequence<br/>Much like chapters in a story, the game is organized in six narrative segments, chronologically arranged. Each poses its own set of challenges and prompts decisions that establish the environment and conditions of subsequent chapters.<br/><br/>Planning<br/>Naval<br/>Flight<br/>Over Targets<br/>Recovery<br/>Debriefing<br/><br/>Historical Scenarios<br/>Besides play of the full narrative, the game offers a number of historical dissections, each a scenario focusing on a fragment of the raid. They are also a handy way to learn the game, since each scenario uses only part of the rules. For example, Scenario One covers Doolittle&rsquo;s flight over Tokyo, using only the 8.5x11 Target Map and the Attack Segment. An alternative scenario looks at a night raid by that flight, as Doolittle originally planned it. After playing one or two small scenarios using only the Attack segment&rsquo;s rules, a larger scenario can be played adding the Flight segment. Graduate next to an even larger scenario that starts with the Naval segment. In this way a player can learn the game in program fashion, little by little, studying the history of the raid by playing it as he learns.<br/><br/>Player Aid Folders: The game comes with several 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; bi-fold aids allowing the play of each game segment with minimal study of the rule book. The mapsheet is designed to interlock with other game components, including those play aids, in order to make the player&rsquo;s experience fluid.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Five Crowns is rummy with a five-suited deck and a twist. The set collection aspect of rummy is basically the same, with groups of three cards in either runs or denominations making a valid meld. The twist is that in each hand the number of cards required to create a meld increases, from three cards in the first hand to thirteen in the last. The game, therefore, consists of eleven hands.<br/><br/>In each hand, in addition to the six Jokers, other cards are designated as wild: in the first hand 3s are wild; in the second hand 4s are wild, and so on until in the last hand the Kings go wild. (You can remember which cards are wild because it matches the number of cards in hand, i.e., in the first hand you hold three cards and 3s are wild.) A hand ends when a player can meld all cards in her hand after the discard.<br/><br/>",

Lead Patton or Rommel to the final victory; seize buildings; destroy your enemy and conquer the battlefield! Play historical scenarios: go ashore in Normandy, defend Monte Cassino or dig in the Ardennes!<br/><br/>You can play 2GM TWG in two ways. You can play a &ldquo;Battle Royal&rdquo; - players will establish a number of points, they will set up the battlefield prior commencing the battle and the goal is to destroy your opponent&rsquo;s Head Quarter; or you can play a &ldquo;Scenario&rdquo; &ndash; historical or not &ndash; with a predefined set of rules to deploy units and the terrain, and pre-established conditions of victory.<br/><br/>In a player&rsquo;s turn you&rsquo;ll gain a number of &ldquo;Action Points&rdquo; that will be used to deploy new units on the battlefield and to employ other supporting cards. These Action Points will increase by several ways as the game evolves.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Objectives&rdquo; to achieve the victory during a game are very diverse: from destroying your opponent&rsquo;s HQ to capture the battlefield or inflict a specific number of kills to your enemy. Seizing or bombing a building, capturing enemy&rsquo;s supplies, rescue a flag objective or hold a position for a number of turns are other ways to achieve the victory.<br/><br/>The game includes three different decks: one for the American Army, one for the German Army and a third double-sided deck to represent different types of Terrain.<br/><br/>Each side&rsquo;s deck is composed by cards representing unique types of units and supporting cards. Different types of units - infantry, vehicle, armor, aircraft and transport -, all with their own specific capabilities and with additional equipment to be deployed.<br/><br/>Supporting cards are assorted: you may find &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo;, &ldquo;Promotion&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mines&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo;, among others.<br/><br/>Terrain deck includes anything that is needed to make every single battle a unique experience.<br/><br/>Additionally, you&acute;ll find Help and Summary cards along with Flag Generals that will improve your army with their command abilities; 2d10 and more than 100 counters (damage counters, victory points, etc.) and additional equipment to gear up our units depending on the situation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When it turned out that faster-than-light travel was deadly for every lifeform, humans sent their inventions out instead to explore the galaxy &mdash; colossal factory ships capable of building and deploying automated Extractors. Those ships drilled, mined and transported raw minerals from faraway planetary systems back to Earth. Soon hundreds upon hundreds of star systems were visited and their planets were drilled down to their cores and stripped of valuable resources. After the ships moved on to the next system, the leftover excavation installations still lingered as a grim sign of past mining operations. In no time, two corporations monopolized the galaxy mining business, but with myriad systems to exploit they remained in a state of uneasy peace &mdash; a peace about to be broken due to an automated analysis of reports from a system mined many decades ago that yielded something weird, that led to a discovery of...Metallum.<br/><br/>This new substance, which seems to carry a promise for interstellar travel for living organisms, is bound to stir conflict. The Earth Government immediately steps in and claims ownership of the system in the name of the &quot;good of mankind&quot;, but it's clear that one of the two corporations will be afforded the exclusive rights to extract Metallum &ndash; and the huge profits that come with it. The tension raises instantly. Outright corporate war is avoided only thanks to a promise to grant the mining rights to the corporation that will develop more efficient mining infrastructure on the planets. Incidents are bound to happen with old installations used to destroy enemy Extractors since it's clear that the Earth Government will be handing their grants based on Metallum extraction rates of each corporation before finally awarding exclusive mining rights to one of them. The best pilots from each corporation sit down behind their consoles as their factory ships approach the system with production of Extractors set to maximum.<br/><br/>Metallum is a strategy game for two players who take on roles of corporate pilots charged with the task of directing their factory ships in order to construct a more efficient mining network on the system's planets than their opponent does. Each round consists of three main phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Programming: Players simultaneously create a program by composing puzzle-like subroutines that activate various systems on the factory ship (engines for moving, production for deploying Extractors, etc.). Some of the more powerful subroutines take more time to execute and hence impede your ability to react to the other player's moves &mdash; and they might even prevent you from activating other ship systems.<br/>     Action: Players execute programs composed during the programming phase. Since the order of execution of subroutines is decided by the player, the same program can yield vastly different outcomes, which leads to many interesting tactical decisions. During this phase new Extractors are also deployed on the system's planets.<br/>     Profits: Players earn credits for the planets on which they have their Extractors depending on who has more of them.<br/><br/><br/>After nine rounds, the pilot who's earned the most credits for his corporation is declared the winner. Will you be able to cover the planets of the system with a network of your Extractors and at the same time disturb the plans of your opponent? Although the conflict is officially only an economic one, the successful pilot needs to know when to strike at a rival's mining infrastructure or make &quot;slight modification&quot; to it. When all is said and done, nobody will remember the details of the struggle &mdash; only the name of the greatest pilot in the history of the galaxy.<br/><br/>",

Every decision and every action is set against a backdrop of dwindling time and rising concern.<br/>For a long time, we were at war with The Jackals. But now, we&rsquo;ve driven them off, and we have this &ndash; a year of relative peace. One quiet year, with which to build our community up and learn once again how to work together. Come Winter, the Frost Shepherds will arrive and we might not survive beyond that. But we don&rsquo;t know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something.<br/><br/>The game plays through a year of relative peace for a small post-apocalyptic community. Players take turns playing through weeks in this year. Each week, the active player draws a card from the top of the deck (which represents the year), and reads the card. They carry out the actions or answer the questions that are specified on the card. Once the card is resolved, some quick upkeep occurs: projects that the community has in motion get closer to completion. Finally, the active player picks an action from a short list: hold a discussion, make a decision, discover something new.<br/><br/>The three actions give players a meaningful and difficult set of choices: do you spend time listening to others, in the hopes that they'll listen to you in kind? Do you pursue your own goals, ostensibly for the good of the whole community? Do you focus inward or outward?<br/><br/>The game is played using a deck of cards &ndash; each of the 52 cards corresponds to a week during the quiet year. Each card triggers certain events &ndash; bringing bad news, good omens, project delays and sudden changes in luck. At the end of the quiet year, the Frost Shepherds will come, ending the game.<br/><br/>",

As the U.S. commander, you maneuver your task forces and conduct air searches in a tension-packed contest to find the Japanese carriers before they locate and attack yours.  Simple game mechanics control Japanese movement and determine the timing and strengths of their attacks. You will not know that a Japanese air strike is headed your way until it actually appears in the skies above your task force.

Face those fears and bring tactics used in generations past to fight the darkness.<br/><br/>Nightfall: The Coldest War is a stand-alone expansion to the competitive deck building game Nightfall. The Coldest War brings you a complete, all-new set of cards with special powers and features a full set of 6 exciting new starting minions! The Coldest War also introduces Moon Phase cards that change the game globally as well as new, fully illustrated Wound cards.<br/><br/>Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.<br/><br/>Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.<br/><br/>The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!<br/><br/>",

The siblings loved each other very much. They were strong of build and sharp of mind. Whatever they attempted, they succeeded with ease, and faultlessly. When the young gods had grown to adulthood, Artaois and Branwen bade them each create something to add it to their creation, so that it would enrich the world and populate it. And thus, the gods created six very different types.<br/><br/>Time passed and the creations of the gods multiplied and spread without restraint across the biosphere. And so it came to pass that Artaios and Branwen bade their children bring order to their creation. Whoever would be the first to bring their population into accord with the biological order would be called &quot;Lord of Creation&quot; from thereon.<br/><br/>In Biosphere, the player siblings each control groups of different populations (dubbed &quot;types&quot; in game terms). In each round, a percentage of the types goes extinct, then players receive and spend evolutionary points to make their types either larger or smaller, and more versatile or more dedicated depending on what they think is appropriate for the landscape (which is scaled based on the number of players) and the current state of the game. Reproduction, movement, and lifespan can all be modified by players during the game. If a player meets the right conditions, they can play one development card from hand, gaining benefits from this. Players then move across the landscape, reproduce, and fill the different terrains based on their positions relative to other players.<br/><br/>How do the siblings prove their worth to Artaios and Branwen? By fulfilling assignments revealed at the start of play. One assignment is drawn from each of seven categories, and once a player completes an assignment, they mark it, with others still being able to mark it later. Whoever first fulfills five assignments wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1776 is a two-player, turn-based war game played on a hex grid map of the thirteen colonies and Canada.  It is primarily concerned with the military aspects of the American Revolutionary War. There is a basic game, various scenarios with advanced rules and a campaign game.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 7<br/><br/><br/>(from the back of the box:)<br/><br/>The shot heard round the world at Lexington set off more than just another brushfire war in England's scattered dominions. It gave birth to a struggling new nation led by a comparative handful of patriots whose refusal to bow before tyranny set the tone for an American heritage preserved from defeat to this very day. But victory did not come cheap. <br/>After showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots. But the coming spring found Clinton facing a revitalized and strengthened rebel army which proceeded to chase him across New Jersey in the Monmouth Campaign. Reassured by news of the French alliance and the great American victory at Saratoga that fall, American troops dug in for what they knew would be a long and bitter battle for independence.<br/><br/>6 Games in One Package - Each a Realistic Simulation of the War for Independence...<br/><br/>1776, like all Avalon Hill games, is more than just the standard roll the dice and move game. It is a realistic simulation of the strategic situation faced by British and American alike in that fiery decade when the United States won its independence. <br/>Actually, 1776 is six games in one: a Basic Game that gets you quickly and easily into the routine of simulation gaming; an Advanced Game with scenarios that provides additional complexity and realism; and a Campaign Simulation Game that encompasses the entire war and balances successes in one region against failures in another - truly the ultimate in a simulation gaming experience! <br/>And if you don't have the time for a complete Campaign Game, there are four scenarios to choose from; each of which poses a challenge for everyone; from the most erudite of military historians to the fellow who just managed to pass American History:<br/><br/>Scenario 1: The Invasion of Canada - 1775 to 1776 - Can YOU do better than the bumbling General Schuyler and Benedict Arnold in the vain American atttempt to make Canada a 14th colony?<br/><br/>Scenario 2: The Saratoga Campaign - 1777 - Can YOU as General Horatio Gates surround and destroy the forces of the British General Burgoyne in this reinactment of the turning point of the Revolution?<br/><br/>Scenario 3: Greene's Southern Campaignv - 1780 to 1781 - Can YOU as General Nathaniel Greene lead Cornwallis' tested regulars on a merry chase with your force of rag-tag militia and Guerilla bands without being crushed in a major engagement?<br/><br/>Scenario 4: The Yorktown Campaign - 1781 - Can you duplicate Washington's encirclement and crushing defeat of Cornwallis in the battle that won the Revolution?<br/><br/>Contents: <br/><br/>     a 16&quot; x 44&quot; four-section, full color mapboard depicting colonial America from Quebec to Georgia; <br/>     two sets of die-cut troop counters representing over 400 units of Continentals, British Regulars, Rebel and Tory Militia, French Regulars, Indians, and naval units of the British and French fleets; <br/>     1 die; <br/>     1 Terrain Effects Chart; <br/>     2 sets (8 per set) of Tactical Combat Cards used in the innovative, new Sustained Combat system; 1 set of scenario, CRT, and play chart cards organized on an index-card format that puts a summary of all levels of the game at your fingertips; <br/>     a 32-page Rules &amp; Designers' Notes Manual telling you how to play all 6 game versions plus the inside story on research and development and why the game was designed the way it was.<br/><br/><br/>Rated &quot;Tournament Level&quot; on Avalon Hill's Simulation-complexity scale.<br/><br/>Note: 1st edition has 416 counters (this includes some blanks)<br/><br/>",

A set of simple mechanisms form the basis of 1824 Austria-Hungary.<br/><br/>You use the yellow, green, brown and gray tiles to create a rail network on the map. Just as in a real railway business, the track in the game connects railway stations to each other. The trains (train cards) make notional journeys from one station to the next and thereby earn money. The (imaginary) passengers pay for their journeys. The more numerous and the more important the stations on a train's journey are, the more money it earns for the company and its shareholders.<br/><br/>In the game you and your fellow players can own up to 6 Mountain Railways, 4 Coal Railways, 7 forerunners of the National Railways, as well as shares in 3 National Railways and 5 Regional Railways. The Major Companies (the National and Regional Railways) belong to their shareholders. The player with the most shares in the company is the Director of that company and decides how the company will act.<br/><br/>This game is a further streamlined version of the self-published 1824 from 2005.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seeders from Sere&iuml;s is a trans-media science-fiction universe that's been created over five years by Serge Macasdar and Charbel Fourel and which contains post-humans, space opera, extensive journeys on space arks, lost empires, exo-biology, genetic evolution, android developments, and more.<br/><br/>Seeders from Sere&iuml;s - Episode 1: Exodus is the first game of a serial of ten set in this universe. When an unknown force threatens to render their home uninhabitable, the Seeders must build arks &mdash; giant colony ships &mdash; to ensure their survival. Players work to create the most promising design to be chosen for production. Each turn players draft cards into their hands as cards are laid out on the board. Players strategically place negotiator chips between the cards they want, using their alignment and position to determine who has the most influence over a desired card. Once all negotiators and tokens are placed, influence is calculated and the winners of each card is determined.<br/><br/>Once obtained, cards can be played for points, adding value to your ark, or discarded for resources. Each card represents a different component of the ark &mdash; locations, items, personnel &mdash; and players will find unique synergies between cards as well as their player color's unique power. Asymmetry and complex interactions add layers of strategy that lead to a unique experience each time you play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stellar Horizons is a &quot;build your own space program&quot; game in which you lead one of seven Earth factions to explore and develop our solar system. Designed by a real-life space engineer with a PhD in long-duration spaceflight from MIT, Stellar Horizons is intended to be a plausible representation of the first steps of humanity towards the stars between 2030 and 2169, with each turn representing a year of time. You control your faction's space program, outposts, and fleets spanning across the solar system, although you also have some influence over your faction's politics back home on Earth as space development becomes more important.<br/><br/>Movement is based on real physics. You move from orbit to orbit, or conduct long range transfers to move between planetary systems like Earth, Mars, or Jupiter. As you send out robotic explorers and crewed vehicles to explore the solar system, they bring back valuable data to further your scientific research. Technologies are intended to represent plausible extrapolations of existing development during the next 150 years: there are no transporters or warp drive, but you will be able to develop rockets powered by fusion and even anti-matter. In the engineering and biology domains, you'll eventually be able to construct space elevators and put your crews into safe hibernation for long journeys.<br/><br/>You'll have access to a wide variety of robot explorers and crewed ships. These range from tiny probes intended to merely take photographs as you fly past Jupiter, to giant destroyers, cruisers, and battleships which ply the space lanes with peaceful or hostile intentions. New ship types become available as you gain access to better technology over the course of the game.<br/><br/>You'll be given a budget to spend on Earth and can also build bases to harvest minerals, organics, and fuel to expands your economy. You can also forge diplomatic relationships with players and non-player factions alike, and trade resources at their bases to earn extra cash. Each of the seven factions has different strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and available ships based on their unique geopolitical situation. Military conflict is certainly possible but not always encouraged. Stellar Horizons features more diplomatic, technological, and economic competition than outright combat, although neglecting warships entirely leaves you vulnerable to pirates, trade embargoes, and sneak attacks by rogue players and factions.<br/><br/>Stellar Horizons includes short co-operative and competitive scenarios lasting an hour or more, and campaigns lasting a day up to about a full weekend for experienced players. Up to seven players can play at a time and the game is most fun with at least two, but there are also one-player scenarios, and the campaigns are highly suited for solo play. There are three ways to win the campaign: be the first to develop an Interstellar Colonizer, terraform a world, or achieve dominance in space over your rivals.<br/><br/>",

You have joined the ranks of the infamous Guild of Thieves, seeking your own path to wealth and glory. Your tiny gang has been chosen to relieve the fat merchants of the city from a portion of their, ahem, &quot;excess&quot; wealth. But there are many factions within the Guild, and yours is not the only band working in the district tonight! In fact, your greatest challenge may not be the militiamen who guard the streets...<br/><br/>Cadwallon: City of Thieves is a fast-paced board game of cunning thievery and ruthless skulduggery in a fantasy city steeped in magic and intrigue. Two to four players each control their own gang of four thieves, competing to amass the greatest haul of loot from the many carefully locked chests scattered about the board. This is no friendly competition, however, and there is little loyalty among thieves in Cadwallon! The most successful players are as likely to claim their loot from the other gangs as they are to do the time-consuming legwork themselves...<br/><br/>Get ready for a deviously fun battle for treasure! Good fortune in the Guild of Thieves is a double-edged sword that cuts to the bone; other thieves will want your loot, and they have no qualms about drawing your blood to get it. The result is a fast and furious brawl for control of the best treasures in the city. Precious jewels change hands rapidly, and you'll quickly find yourself positioning your gang to not only grab the loot, but defend it desperately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Until the second half of the 18th century, most people thought that larger barges could not navigate the Ruhr River. However, the convenient route meant that attempts were conducted to transport the coveted coal resource along the river at the beginning of the industrial revolution. The first coal barges reached Kettwig in spring 1770. A little while later, barges reached the Rhine mouth at Ruhrort. The empty barges were drawn upstream by horses afterwards.<br/><br/>However, the Ruhr was not generally navigable in this time. Large dams at mills and low dams for fishing were common. At these spots the coal had to be transferred from one barge to the next. This decreased the quality of the coal considerably &ndash; sometimes only &quot;coal dust&quot; reached Ruhrort. Only the building of 14 locks between Witten and Ruhrort changed this.<br/><br/>The Ruhr remained an important route for coal until the end of the 19th century. At that time the railway superseded it.<br/><br/>In Ruhrschifffahrt 1769-1890, 2-4 players transport and sell coal along the Ruhr river in Germany as profitably as possible. Progress markers are helping them. The position of each player's Ruhr barge is most important; the player furthest upriver is allowed to conduct his action first in each phase of a game turn.<br/><br/>",

The Warcraft boardgame features an adaptable/expandable geomorphic board, exciting components, and the innovative &lsquo;Command/Movement&rsquo; system that simulates the real-time action and excitement of Warcraft.&quot;<br/><br/>Warcraft is based on the computer game series. Each player takes on one of four factions: Humans, Orcs, Night Elves and Undead. It can be played cooperatively, with humans and night elves in one alliance and orcs and undead in the second.<br/><br/>The game is set up with a modular board, depicting resources, victory point locations and the players' town halls. Throughout the game, players need to harvest resources, build units and buildings, and use their army to defeat their opponents.<br/><br/>Each turn, players move their existing units, harvest gold and lumber with their workers, deploy units onto the board that were built on a previous turn, and finally spend resources on further units, buildings and outposts. Players also have access to a unique deck of Experience Cards, which are drawn during events like battles and can be used later for special effects.<br/><br/>A player can win by eliminating all opponents, or by accumulating 15 total victory points.<br/><br/>",

Build barricades, clash with police, occupy districts, loot shopping centers, build mutual aid networks, and liberate the city before time runs out and the military arrives!<br/><br/>Object of the Game: When playing fully cooperatively, all factions win or lose together and must cooperate to defeat the police and liberate the city. To liberate the city, each faction must complete the objectives on 1 Conditions card. Each Conditions card specifies certain districts of the city that must be liberated and where occupations must be built. When playing semi-cooperatively, each faction has a secret Agenda card that determines how it wins the game. Factions with Social Agendas can still win together cooperatively. But a faction with a Vanguardist or Sectarian Agenda can only win alone and must work covertly to undermine the other factions.<br/><br/>Bloc by Bloc is played in rounds and each round is 1 night. The countdown marker starts with 10 nights remaining.  Each night has 2 phases, Nighttime and Sunrise.<br/><br/>Nighttime: The Nighttime phase is when each faction takes its turn. At the start of a turn, cards are drawn from the Police Ops deck that move and deploy police squads across the city. Higher Police Morale means more cards. Next, the faction rolls action dice and spends those dice to take various actions around the city using their blocs. Each bloc represents an organized group of 5-15 people.<br/><br/>Sunrise: After each faction has taken its turn, the Reaction card orders police to attack and police vans to move around the city. Next, factions may liberate districts and draw Liberation cards if enough blocs are gathered in those districts. There might also be a meeting to draw more Conditions cards.

If time runs out or any 1 faction has no blocs in the city, all factions lose.<br/><br/>",

This is an unusual EXIT adventure set in the world of Marc-Uwe Kling's kangaroo trilogy!<br/><br/>Like other titles in the series, EXIT: Das Spiel - Die K&auml;nguru-Eskapaden includes components meant to be folded, written upon, or torn, so it's marketed as a single-use game.<br/><br/>",

The scientists programmed each of these Worlds with an individual set of laws and rules which the residents strictly follow and consider most important for their lives. These may be exploration, consumption, economics, military, etc., and each is unique. You can visit all of these 504 alternate Earths to experience how the people are living, and decide which of these worlds harbors the best civilization. On which World do you want to live? Explore them all and decide!<br/><br/>504 is a game that creates 504 different games out of one box. The game consists of nine modules:<br/><br/><br/>    Module 1: Pick-Up &amp; Deliver<br/>    Module 2: Race<br/>    Module 3: Privileges<br/>    Module 4: Military<br/>    Module 5: Exploration<br/>    Module 6: Roads<br/>    Module 7: Majorities<br/>    Module 8: Production<br/>    Module 9: Shares<br/><br/><br/>In each single game, you take three different modules from the nine available and assemble them in any order you like to create a new game. (504 = 9 * 8 * 7 = the number of distinct permutations of three items from a set of nine. The order of the three game modules is significant, and modules cannot be repeated.) For example, you can play:<br/><br/><br/>    a racing game that expands through exploration with technology improving the racing or exploration (World &quot;253&quot;).<br/>    an 18XX-style stock game with network building for income and production sites to provide workers for the road building (World &quot;968&quot;).<br/>    a war game with a pick-up and deliver economy and bonus scoring from majorities (&quot;World 417&quot;).<br/><br/><br/>Each single game takes from 30 to 120 minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

Each player has their own fleet and based on the size of the battle, they choose which ships will be deployed for combat (deployment phase). Each race has its own power and abilities which grants it different advantages in combat.<br/><br/>After both players have deployed their forces in this time-limited real-time phase, the combat phase begins.<br/><br/>The Combat Phase lasts a random number of Rounds based on which ships have been deployed on the battlefield. Each Round, different ships fire their weapons and perform their abilities trying to destroy enemy ships and/or complete objectives.<br/><br/>Stellar Conflict offers a more advanced, deeper alternative to Light Speed. Each race has its own fleet of different ships and abilities guaranteed to offer lots of replayability.<br/><br/>",

Each game consists of ten hands, with the hand size shrinking by one each time, until the final one-card hand.  Along the way, trump is randomly determined and can be changed during the hand through the use of special cards.  There are also special cards that make the trump not count for a trick, others that can be declared any suit and value when played, and others that will give bonuses or penalties for taking the trick on which they're played.  A newer version of this game was released by Amigo in 2000.<br/><br/>",

Numerous scenarios are included to play out various smaller battles in Normandy. It is intended for two players or player teams.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique sequence of play and a system of fire combat throughout the airdrop and beach assault phases with company-level breakdown units, then a more traditional odds-type combat approach throughout the rest of the game. Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel.<br/><br/>The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved. Scenarios include &lsquo;Bloody Omaha&rsquo;, &lsquo;Operation Epsom&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cobra&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Fight for Cherbourg&rsquo; and more.<br/><br/>A future expansion will extend the play area south, to include the Mortain and Falaise scenarios, and extend the campaign to late August and the 3rd Army breakout.<br/><br/>Game Equipment: <br/><br/>     One Rule Book <br/>     One Scenario Book <br/>     Five (5) 22x34&rdquo; full color Maps <br/>     Nine (9) full color counter sheets <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Allied Air Allocation Log (laminated) <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Axis AAA Allocation Log (laminated) <br/>     11x17&rdquo; Turn Record Track <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Terrain Effects Chart (x2) <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Repl/Recon/Weather chart (x2) <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; German Record Track <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Allied Record Track <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Combat Results Table (x2) <br/>     Dice - 3d6 and 1d10<br/><br/><br/>(from the GMT Website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pacific Typhoon is a strategy card game for 3-7 players, ages 10 to adult. The game uses the same system that first appeared in the popular 1998 Avalon Hill card game Atlantic Storm.<br/><br/>The game setting is the naval and air war in the Pacific theatre during World War II. Pacific Typhoon depicts the history of the air-naval battles of the Pacific War with 40 battle cards, each of which represents an historical naval or air battle such as Pearl Harbor, Midway, Surigao Strait, etc. Players compete by fighting a non-sequential series of twenty of these battles. A battle lasts for one round of play, so each player gets to play once per battle. The round-leader starts by picking one of two battle cards (he discards the unpicked one). The chosen battle card determines the year of battle. The battle card is also worth a certain number of victory points and resources to whoever wins it. The round-leader alternates after each battle, and the game ends after 20 battles (when the Battle Card deck is exhausted).<br/><br/>Players are not assigned to sides. Instead, each player has a hand of force cards that typically includes both Allied and Japanese cards. The force cards represent warships, submarines, aircraft, special weapons, and events. Non-event cards have three separate combat values: Air, Surface, and Sub. For example, the battlecruiser Kirishima has combat values of 1 air, 4 surface and 0 sub; the submarine Flasher has combat values of 0 air, 1 surface and 3 sub; the Zero fighter (Sakai) has combat values of 3 air, 0 surface and 0 sub. Force cards are also worth victory points because they can be destroyed in battle.<br/><br/>After the round-leader selects the battle card, he announces the &quot;suit&quot; of battle: Air, Surface, Sub or Combined. Only the combat values in the announced suit will affect the outcome of the battle. In a Combined battle, the combat values of all three suits are added together. The round-leader also announces the time of battle: Day or Night. Some force cards are only playable in a day battle (for example, the aircraft carrier Lexington), a few are only playable in a night battle, but most are playable in day or night battles. The round-leader then gets to play from his hand. He may play on one side or the other (but not both sides together). Each player after him in turn may then play on one side or the other.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After millions of years of wasteland on Earth, animal life is finally emerging. But the world is still forming and undergoing a constant change. Only those species able to adapt to the ever-changing conditions will survive to leave their mark in history. Here is your chance! Do your best to become Darwin&rsquo;s Choice.<br/><br/>Darwin's Choice is a competitive card game in which players create their own animal species from more than 230 animal cards. These animal species will be placed in biomes that differ strongly in their requirements and the food supply. The highest possible adaptation of animal species to their biomes not only ensures their survival but is also rewarded with the coveted Darwin points. In addition to a high adaptation the species with the highest competitive strength are also awarded across all zones.<br/><br/>Between the 3-4 eras played, conditions can change completely due to biome changes and event card effects. The task now is to adapt the successful animal species of the past eras to the conditions of the present, either through sophisticated mutations or smart migration to other biomes. However, you must always keep an eye on the animal species of the other players in order to anticipate their actions, because anyone who acts too quickly or imprudently might be unable to react at the decisive moment.<br/><br/>In Darwin's Choice the victory points (Darwin Points) are assigned to the animal species and may only be collected by players after the last era has ended. With this mechanism, the game remains exciting to the very end, because the extinction of a species also means the loss of its associated Darwin points.<br/><br/>Darwin's Choice is a strategic allocation game in which you must think carefully about how to use your cards. The large number of own possibilities and the ones of your opponents lead to a high variability, which makes thinking through each action and thinking ahead indispensable. The randomness caused by drawing cards (animal cards, biomes, event cards) requires flexibility and fast rescheduling. This results in each played game being completely different and guarantees a high replayability.<br/><br/>All pictures, icons and symbols of Darwin&rsquo;s Choice are hand-illustrated by the French illustrator Rozenn Grosjean, giving the game its very own style.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It covers the battle of Gettysburg.<br/><br/><br/>(from the back of the box)<br/><br/>Roads to Gettysburg is the third volume in Avalon Hill's series on the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War. Unlike most Civil War simulations, which portray specific battles, Roads to Gettysburg concentrates on the entire three-week campaign that led to the great struggle at Gettysburg. The Union player's objective is to defeat the Rebel army and push it back to Virginia. The goal of the Confederate player is to maintain control over the rich agricultural regions of Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Roads to Gettysburg is easy to learn and several scenarios can be played to completion in about an hour. The two beautiful game maps, which are based on original Civil War period maps in state and county archives, portray Maryland and Pennsylvania as they were in the summer of 1863, including roads, turnpikes, railroads, rivers, mountains, cities, and villages. In the game, players control Union and Confederate military units in turns representing one day of real time. <br/>The game's interactive system of play assures that each scenario will be unpredictable, exciting, and competitive. An extensive historical article, detailing the day-to-day activities of the actual campaign, is included in the game.<br/><br/>You do not need to own Stonewall Jackson's Way or Here Come the Rebels! to play Roads to Gettysburg.<br/>Note: Owners of those games can join their maps to the Roads to Gettysburg maps to portray the eastern theatre of the Civil War from Fredericksburg, Virginia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>CONTENTS: <br/>2 Counter Sheets <br/>2 22&quot;x32&quot; Mapsheets <br/>1 Rules Booklet <br/>1 Charts and Tables Card <br/>2 Display Cards <br/>1 Ammunition Pad <br/>2 6-Sided Dice <br/>1 Counter Tray<br/><br/>Time Scale: One day per turn <br/>Map Scale: One mile per hex <br/>Unit Scale: Divisions and brigades (with corps leaders) <br/>Players: One, two, or teams <br/>Playing Time: One hour for introductory scenarios, 2 to 14 hours for other scenarios<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of fifty cards, with cards coming in five colors numbered 1-10 in each color. Each player has a hand of two cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, you play one or two cards onto one or both of the two discard piles. On one pile, you must play a higher card that whatever the top card is, and on the other, you must play a lower card. The exception is that you can play any card on a discard pile if it's the same color as the current top card. Thus, on the ascending discard pile the cards played might be blue 1, red 2, gray 4, yellow 6, yellow 2 &mdash; and that drop down gives you breathing room in which to play more cards.<br/><br/>You can't reveal the specific numbers you have in hand, but you can say things like, &quot;I have a high yellow card.&quot; In the &quot;professional&quot; version of the game, you must play exactly one card each turn (even if you want to play two), and you can reveal only the color of cards in your hand and on which stack you want to play.<br/><br/>",

Holding steadfast, I swung my axe one last time. As I crashed to the ground, I knew I had found, at last, peace.<br/><br/>Ragemore is an 18 card solo game where you will complete quests, while managing your hand and resources as you delve though the dark, fighting demons, all in a span of 10-15 minutes.<br/><br/>Each card is two sided; a demon and a hero. In the beginning of the game, the player will set up 2 piles of demon-sided quests and a party of 3 hero-sided cards. Then an immediate threat is revealed from the draw deck as the current demon card that may or may not be dealt with. If it is not killed, the demon card will go to one of the quests piles and an event written on that card will take effect. If it is killed, the demon card is flipped to the hero side and becomes one of the party. The player can also ignore the immediate demon threat and goes on a quest to obtain the win condition, or parlay with some of the demons to turn them into heroes but with the cost of the hero's morality: the hero is flipped to the demon side and joins the draw deck of demons.<br/><br/>The game is won when the hero gains the required number of quest card by using a combination of four symbols drawn on each cards. The game is lost when the graveyard has 3 deaths or when a quest pile has 4 demons or the party has no more heroes or the draw deck of demons is empty before the number of quest cards is fulfilled or if the quest piles are empty before the number of quest cards is fulfilled. 1 winning condition and 5 losing conditions.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the May 2020 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sixty years of tense, uneasy peace are shattered as the Korean Peninsula erupts in renewed warfare. One historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous people polarized and separated by superpower politics and economics hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their arbitrary division once and for all.<br/><br/>From Pyongyang in North Korea to Busan in the South, the war rages. In a scene reminiscent of the first attack by the In Min Gun in 1950, the North Korean People&rsquo;s Army surges across the Demilitarized Zone and penetrates deep into South Korea.<br/><br/>Special Operations Forces from both sides conduct raids, interdiction, and reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines while airborne, air assault, and amphibious forces strike far behind those lines attempting to outflank the main army forces of both sides. In the air, both sides wage a heated campaign in an effort to establish superiority over the skies of Korea. With rough terrain and the full ferocity of modern armor, airmobile, airborne, and marine warfighting capabilities, there is no safe haven in the lethal cauldron of battle which has engulfed the Korean Peninsula.<br/><br/>While North and South battle for a quick, decisive victory, the world awaits the response of the two military superpowers in the region: the United States of America and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. Will the United States, stung by high casualties among the soldiers of its 2nd Infantry Division near the DMZ during the surprise artillery barrages and initial assaults on the first day of the war, be able to reinforce the South quickly enough, and, if so, how and in what strength? Will the Communist Chinese again react (or pre-emptively intervene) to a massive US response and join the fray, thus widening the conflict? As the situation evolves, choices are made, forces are committed, and the security of Japan and the future of the two Koreas hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Next War: Korea, the first of a planned series of Next War games, allows players to fight a near future war on the Korean peninsula. In this updated and improved version of the previously-released Crisis: Korea 1995, players have access to virtually all military assets of North and South Korea, as well as large forces from the USA and the PRC. The integrated, easy to learn air-land combat system allows for unit efficiency, armor effects, light infantry, attack helicopters, Close Air Support, Cruise Missiles, and the particularly tough terrain of Korea.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: Next War: Korea is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>So our hope is that we have created a game with enough variety and scaling of complexity that you can find an engaging and maybe even enlightening experience whether you want to play a fast two-player game, a longer monster game, or an ongoing solitaire study. We intend to provide tools for online game play as well (a Vassal module is being created now for use during playtesting) so that this game can be played in either real-time or over longer periods on the internet.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tUnitsGround units in Next War: Korea represent primarily divisions and brigades of armies of North and South Korea, The United States and her Allies, and the People's Republic of China. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.<br/><br/>Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.<br/><br/>Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tMaps and TerrainThe game's two maps present a portion of modern-day Korea at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The maps cover the entire peninsula east-to-west and stretch from about 30 miles north of Pyongyang in the North to Taegu in the south. Hexes are larger than the standard 1/2&quot; hex found in Crisis Korea: 1995, allowing us to use larger 9/16&quot; counters in this game and make it a bit easier for players to move game pieces in the congested areas around the DMZ.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame SystemAs in Crisis: Korea 1995, there are two types of game turns: Initiative turns (longer turns where the side with the Initiative has more opportunities to move and attack) and Contested turns (shorter turns where neither side has the initiative but each is trying to muster the resources to regain the initiative). Thus the inherent &quot;initiative player advantage&quot; built into the game system incents each player to always be thinking about how to seize and maintain the battlefield initiative.<br/><br/>A Standard game turn is composed of:<br/><br/>    Weather Determination. Bad weather can severaly hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.<br/>    Initiative Determination<br/><br/><br/>an Air/Naval Phase, wherein air superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.<br/><br/>    One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns<br/>    Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements<br/>    Victory Determination<br/><br/><br/>Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody, reflecting both what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early on in light of the massive artillery concentrations near the DMZ as well as the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses, but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapidity and pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tScenariosThere are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three one mappers, &quot;Seoul Train,&quot; &quot;Uijong Blues,&quot; and &quot;East Coast Highway&quot; (North Map only) cover the first week of the war by dividing the DMZ into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults to break the South Korean lines and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire DMZ front scenario, &quot;Militarized Zone,&quot; (North Map only) for the first week (basically, combining the three scenarios above). In addition, players can add the South Map and play the entire Standard Campaign game, &quot;All In.&quot; Two other scenarios are provided which examine the U.S. Amphibious landing. &quot;Inchon Again&quot; and the battle for Taejon, &quot;Spearhead.&quot; In addition, a scenario, &quot;They Did What?&quot; is provided for players to experiement with a South Korean attack on North Korea without, however, the help of the United States.<br/><br/>The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.<br/><br/>There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan – The Fifth Arab-Israeli War to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Korean players in the region.<br/><br/>In Next War: Korea, the Korean Peninsula is on fire with two of the world's most well-prepared, antagonistic forces arrayed against each other. Can you, as the North Korean People&rsquo;s Army commander, conquer the South in 3 weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of Korea&rsquo;s Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will China do?

Who owns the most forces gets the Revenue of that area: Men, Gold and Tower-Points. The players can use these new resources to improve their position in the city. At the end of each round the players can rise their Towers building new floors. Also players will have to manage the Special Privileges and bad Events that will take place at end of each Round.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the highest Tower will be the winner and his family will rule the city!<br/><br/>",

A construct of intrigue and secrets is knitted around a supposedly simple burglary. Be there live to support the Inspector a second time and catch those responsible in the act. Throw yourself headlong into an exciting crime case and find your way to the solution using multimedia. The village also has a few skeletons in its cupboard...<br/><br/>One thing is clear: this calls for true pros. To find the culprit, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.<br/><br/>As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone with which you can receive text messages. It is also helpful (but not absolutely necessary) if you have a laptop or tablet at hand. Mobile phones are also allowed!<br/><br/>You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day.<br/>You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another. The game is suitable for people aged 14 and over. It is too complex for a group of younger children. In a family, however, younger children can also make a contribution and assist with the detective work.<br/><br/>Languages<br/>This game is available in:<br/>German: Das Diadem der Madonna<br/>British: The Midnight Crown <br/>American: The Midnight Crown<br/>French: Le Diad&egrave;me d&rsquo;Amaryllis<br/>Italian: Il Diadema di Mezzanotte<br/>Dutch: De Diadeem van de Madonna<br/>Spanish: La Diadema Escarlata<br/><br/>Canadian: The Midnight Crown (coming soon)<br/>Australian: The Midnight Crown (coming soon)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pocket Landship is based on the print and play Board Game Geek Award nominated (2017) soloplay card wargame. In this version we see a steampunk theme and expanded gameplay with additional enemy and friendly options, as well as multiplayer options.<br/><br/>Command a Landship (the original British term for tanks) to clear a sector of enemy infantry, artillery, and enemy mech and alike.<br/><br/>The player chooses a Landship to control with weapons or support units to create either a single high powered Landship or a more disparate defending force, including a squad of shock troops.<br/><br/>The enemy appears as waves of enemy mech, artillery, infantry, and mine fields arranged in 2 rows of 3 cards.<br/><br/>Each turn, the player will roll 3 6-sided dice and assign each die to each of their cards to attack the enemies. Then, for the enemy turn, roll the 3 dice and assign them low to high left to right across the front enemy line, then take the assigned actions.<br/><br/>Each card has its own damage track. When a card is destroyed, it is removed from the game. Win by destroying all 9 enemy cards. Lose if the enemy destroys your landship.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players assume the role of animists, heroes that can summon creatures both great and small (represented in the cards you build your deck with), then combine those creatures in unique ways. With the creatures' help, the animists strive to work as a team to defeat the evil forces of Karn. Karn was once a great animist himself, but was corrupted by his lust for greater power. Throughout the game, Karn tries to hunt the heroes and defeat them before they can grow strong enough to face him in the final showdown. The game is split into three chapters, with a &quot;game save&quot; mechanism to allow for the packing and saving of the game between game nights.<br/><br/>The game also includes treasure, magic, unlockable upgrades, boss fights, a large pool of minions to randomly face each playthrough, over 130 creatures, and ten unique heroes!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This racing game is packaged in a long, plastic tube.  Included in the game are huge maps on large poster-sized sheets, a collection of miniature touring cars (complete with spoilers, hood ornaments, roll-bars and lots of other details), and dice.<br/><br/>The cars are lined up and the race begins.  Going in order from first to last, players have a choice of rolling one, two, or three dice.  The first die is a special die with only 1's, 2's and 3's on it, but the other two are normal d6.  The dice may be flipped to the opposite face. Before moving the car, the player must commit to the order that the dice will be used. The dice are then used to move your car.  However, if you use a die for movement in a corner that's not rated for that speed, you'll get a driving error.  Depending on the severity, you might have to journey through pit row on the next lap.  Dice showing 2,3,5 allow the car to move diagonally, or else the car must maintain its lane. There is a drafting mechanism that entails following into specially marked spaces. All of this would make the game fairly computational and boring, until you time the players' turns and make the rule, &quot;A die laid is a die played...&quot;<br/><br/>The original game came with the DTM Hockenheimring track and there are two subsequent maps to find or purchase, which includes the latest track released at Essen 2000.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    N&uuml;rburgring<br/>    Oschersleben<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From 1941 through 1943, Army Group South fought a campaign in southern Russia. Hitler issued goals that ranged from the far oil fields to a city on the Volga by the name of Stalingrad, finally deciding not to decide and ordered the far flung Army Group to divide and go for both.<br/><br/>Across endless steppe, in the blazing sun and freezing cold, the Axis legions advanced to the edge of Asia and the Caucasus mountains. Some of the oil fields, and most of the city were taken.<br/><br/>Then the Red Army had its turn...<br/><br/>Case Blue is a game that covers both the Axis advance (1941 and 1942) as well as the Soviet counterattacks (Nov 42 to Jan 43) and the German counteroffensive at Kharkov (Feb-March 1943) that ended the series of campaigns in the south. The game covers in great detail all the operations from October 1941 until May 1943 on a large play area extending from Voronezh almost to the Turkish border. The full scope and grandiose nature of these operations come to life here.<br/><br/>Case Blue covers and replaces the 1994 award winning game Enemy at the Gates. Players get to encircle Stalingrad, run their pocket and relief attempts and the many operations that game covered.<br/><br/>Case Blue is the 10th game in the award winning Operational Combat System and is the result of over 6 years of intensive research and testing. Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions (OK, there are a few very strange companies), making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.<br/><br/>Case Blue is designed to be played both separately or linked to the 2001 game Guderian's Blitzkrieg II. The monster linked game allows players to run operations on the entire Eastern Front (except for Leningrad) from the fall of 1941 until mid-1943.<br/><br/>Multiple scenarios (one map to very large) allow play to be picked up at various key points in the campaign.<br/><br/>If you want a serious look at these pivotal campaigns while having fun at the same time, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Operational Combat System finest hour, this game is huge.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: Half Week<br/>    Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>    Units: Company to Division<br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Nine 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets (Maps A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K)<br/>    One 14 x 22&quot; full-color mapsheet (Map E)<br/>    Ten dual-side printed countersheets (2,660 1/2&quot; Unit counters)<br/>    Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; Marker counters)<br/>    One 48-page OCS v4.0 series rules booklet<br/>    One 16-page Case Blue game rules booklet<br/>    One 80-page Case Blue Scenario Book 1<br/>    One 48-page Case Blue Scenario Book 2<br/>    One 24-page Case Blue Axis Booklet<br/>    One 24-page Case Blue Russian Booklet<br/>    Two 4-page two-color OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>(from MMP web site:)<br/><br/>",

They send out telegrams along a linear worker-placement track &mdash; reserving those action spaces for themselves &mdash; then take turns in telegram order, loading and unloading to a shared train that travels across the country. Players can use these resources to complete developments ranging from lumber mills and farms to cities and national parks, or they can use the resources to bid to extend the railway. Powerful one-time-use ally cards, themed around a rich and inclusive cast of Canadian historical figures, allow players to make powerful combined actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Noah is tearing out his beard as he doesn't have much time left to finish loading his ark. After all, the clouds are gathering and the rain could come at anytime. Meanwhile, the animals are gathering before the ark and waiting to be told who goes in which stalls. A handful of people have showed up to offer help, but they look like gamblers and game players!<br/><br/>In Ark, the players need to help load animals and supplies into Noah's ark in preparation for the rains to come &ndash; but you can't just shove animals into stalls willy-nilly. If the meat eaters are boarded with plant eaters, you won't have those plant eaters around by the time the water recedes. Animals from cold and warm climates also need to be bunked separately so that they can all be comfortable. On top of all that, you have to worry about the weight of the animals; load too many on one side of the ark and you'll all be treading water for the next forty days and forty nights...<br/><br/>The game consists of cards, animal tokens, and &quot;action&quot; discs.  Your goal is to place your animal tokens (as victory points) based on characteristics of the animal and provision cards loaded on the &quot;ark&quot;.  Each player takes turns either placing cards or drawing cards from a face-up draft pile (Card Drafting) and the supply stack.  Each card has characteristics (such as the animal size, diet, climate, scoring category, and special ability).  Animals and provisions must be placed according to rules that prevent animals from eating each other, eating the supplies, or tipping the &quot;ark&quot; with their combined weight.  When a card is played, the player may place a &quot;victory point&quot; animal token on one of the 5 scoring category cards.  In this way, the game combines Tile Placement of the cards with Set Collection for types of victory points.  The game ends when a fifth &quot;Rain Card&quot;, somewhat randomly shuffled into the deck, is drawn.  Players then score points for their animal tokens, and bonus points for having the most or second most tokens per category.<br/><br/>",

The balance of power shifts back and forth amidst foiled assassinations, successful rebellions, and futile invasions &mdash; and not infrequently, those who sympathize with the weak are expelled from the country.<br/><br/>The real enemies, then as now, are not the rival religions.

        "description": "Asteroyds is a racing and pre-program game similar to RoboRally but with enough significant differences to make it stand out as its own design.<br/><br/>Each player takes on the role of a famous Shuttle Racer Pilot and they have been drawn to a deadly event put on by a mega-rich entrepreneur that has recently bought the Ujitos system.<br/><br/>The aim of Asteroyds is to navigate the highly dangerous asteroid field and pass through four gates. What sets the game apart from other games of this design is that almost everything in the race zone can move position, so the players need to plan with that in mind.<br/><br/>So each round begins with the rolling of three dice; red, white and blue. These relate to coloured asteroids of the matching colour and each rock has a set of numbers from 1-6 printed on them. This gives every pilot the information they need to know where each object will most likely move to (the value rolled for each dice determines which direction the object moves in) using the hex based board.<br/><br/>The trick is that some objects move a differing number of spaces and objects react differently when collisions occur, thus a player's best laid plans may not pan out due to mistakes.<br/><br/>Mistakes introduces the other unique aspect of Asteroyds. The players only get a given amount of time to work out their best flight path and then plan their moves on their planning board. A minute is recommended and 30 seconds for experts. This real-time tension in the planning is tense and helps the game to stick to a good play length.<br/><br/>Asteroyds also offers advanced rules such as shooting, special pilot powers and also varied play modes such as; Shooting, Targets and drones. Some of these allow for team play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Reworld, players attempt to terraform a newly discovered planet, and to do that they need to use terrabots to establish new cities and shuttles to deliver materials that will populate those locations.<br/><br/>In game terms, over five rounds players fill the five levels of their spaceship with tiles featuring terrabots, shuttles, material vessels, and satellites. Each round twenty of these tiles are placed at random around the perimeter of a large ship, and each player receives a hand of cards. On a turn, a player can play one or more cards to claim a tile following these rules:<br/><br/><br/>     If neither tile adjacent to the desired tile has been claimed, the player can lay down any card next to this tile, claim it, then place it in the leftmost space of the level of their spaceship that matches the number of the card played. If you play a 4, for example, then you must place that tile in the leftmost position of your fourth level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     If one tile adjacent to the desired tile has been claimed, then you must lay down a card of the same number used to claim that previous tile or any two cards of your choice (with those two cards thus serving as a joker). Whatever number is topmost indicates the level of your spaceship on which you must place this tile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     If both tiles adjacent to the desired tile have been claimed and the cards used to claim them show the same number, then you do the same as described above. If the cards have different numbers, however &mdash; e.g., 1 and 3 &mdash; then you must lay down the same two numbers (1 and 3), one matching number and any other two cards, or any four cards. You place this tile on your spaceship in the same manner previously desired.<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has no cards in hand or cannot play further, the round ends. Any remaining tiles are thrown away, then you reset the board and deal out a new hand of cards. After five rounds, players now deploy these tiles onto the new planet, each turn playing 1-3 of the leftmost tiles from the row of their choice to create their personal terraformed world. If you deploy a terrabot, which are labeled A-E, you start a new city with this letter or extend an existing city of yours. Material vessels, which come in five colors, can be delivered to the planet's surface only if attached to shuttles, and each city can have vessels of only a single color. Satellites provide bonus scoring when added to a city. Shuttles and satellites can also be used for shields to protect your newborn planet.<br/><br/>Players earn points during the first half of the game for picking up terrabots and having cards left in hand. During the second half, players score for deploying satellites and for meeting targets set at the start of the game, e.g. having a city with eight tiles in it, having a city of each letter, emptying a level on your spaceship, having a certain number of shields, etc.<br/><br/>Once all the spaceships are empty, players score their final points for how well they've developed each city and their shields in comparison with their fellow terraformers. Whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tin Goose is a game about the early years of commercial air travel. Beginning as a regional operation with just an airmail route and a &quot;tin goose&quot; (the Ford Trimotor), players build an airline empire through the 1930s and 40s. As the game progresses, planes improve, being safer and more fuel efficient while having a longer range. Companies become more organized and shed their early inefficiencies. The stakes of a disaster &mdash; crashes, strikes, and oil shocks &mdash; get higher.<br/><br/>A deck of 96 cards includes all of the planes and events that enter the game. Of these, only about 36 are played in any given session, and all of those exist in players' hands at the outset. The result is a game of &quot;calamities&quot; with more planning and less luck: A skillful player seeing high bids on the safest planes may guess several bidders are holding crash cards.<br/><br/>Tin Goose is a business game that features a balance between greed and fear, without random events. It's designed by Matt Calkins, who previously designed Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan, and will be available in print from Rio Grande Games and digitally in the Apple iTunes store.<br/><br/>",

Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards are available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.<br/><br/>DC Comics Dice Masters: World's Finest will introduce new game mechanics: the &ldquo;Allies&rdquo; keyword as well as the &ldquo;Iron Will&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vengeance&rdquo; abilities.

        "description": "Alhambra: The Card Game is a game that both inspired and was named after the more popular, award-winning game and franchise, Alhambra.<br/><br/>This game has been released in several different versions, with the same core rules but different themes. The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Game: Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra.  Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.<br/><br/>The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:<br/>1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.<br/>2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.<br/><br/>Stimmt So! A description of this version:<br/>Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six <br/>different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.<br/><br/>Al Capone  A description of this version:<br/>Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.<br/><br/>Other versions/re-themes:<br/>Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game. The re-themes are collectors items that people like to collect.<br/><br/>Player Counts:<br/>Earlier versions typically had a player count of 3-6 players while more recent versions, such as New York, is listed as 2-6 players.<br/><br/>",

The rules are available for free on Knizia's web site. The game is played with eight dice, pen, and paper. In each event, each player rolls a pool of dice, rerolling a limited number of times, and freezing desired rolls. The goal is to obtain the highest score across all the events.<br/><br/>The first edition of the game (in German) and the second printed English edition (a translation of the first edition) give two variants:<br/><br/><br/>     Energy: each player starts the game with a fixed amount of energy and must use one unit of it for each roll. Some minor adjustments are made to the rules for two of the events. Remaining energy can optionally be added to each player's score.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     With two or more players you can play a championship game where the best scorer in an event gets as many points as there are players, the next-best gets one less, etc.<br/><br/><br/>The web-published version includes a different version of the second variant (3/2/1 for 1st/2nd/3rd place, ties are friendly).<br/><br/>",

Each player has five wooden figures, and if you're the first to place all five of your figures on the board, you win!<br/><br/>Ga&iuml;a includes two levels of rules, with the basic rules allowing for play with those as young as eight thanks to the game's simple mechanisms and non-attacking nature. The advanced rules give you the opportunity to use godly powers &mdash; lightning, volcanoes, rain, sun, earthquakes, etc. &mdash; to shape the world after it has been created. You can even steal an opponent's cities, making it a more aggressive game with a higher level of strategy.<br/><br/>",

This is not a complete game; players are required to independantly purchase miniatures and construct a playing surface (wargames terrain). The game is scaled for 10mm miniatures (1:144, N Scale), and is designed to represent combat at the regiment and brigade level set in a fantasy/renaissance techology world.<br/><br/>In Warmaster, combat and casualty calculations occur at the stand level. That is, for every stand in a unit, a number of dice are rolled in combat. As whole stands are removed by sustaining casualties, the number of dice similalry decreases.<br/><br/>The command mechanism in Warmaster is simple but evocative. Each leader model has a Command factor. To issue a command, such as 'move forward' to a unit, two dice must be rolled against that target command factor. For every subsequent order attempted the target number becomes more difficult to achieve. As a consequence, despite being on the surface a move-counter move system, the turns are variable length and each player may not have the full opportunity to achieve everything they may want to. This simple mechanism introduces enjoyable tension into what is otherwise a largely conventional set of wargame rules.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Warmaster Annual 2002<br/>    Warmaster Annual 2003<br/>    Warmaster Armies<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Warmaster Ancients<br/>    The Battle of Five Armies<br/><br/><br/>Supported by the Warmaster magazine.<br/><br/>",

In Wreckage you'll repair and outfit your vehicle with new and upgraded parts. In the Run phase, you battle enemies over a series of turns, and hopefully survive to fight another day!

        "description": "Hex was invented by the Danish mathematician and poet Piet Hein, who introduced the game in 1942 at the Niels Bohr Institute. The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex, and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a &quot;swap rule&quot; (also known as a pie rule) which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player.<br/><br/>There are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers. If you want to play face-to-face, used Hex sets are occasionally available, and you can also make your own set. A Battlemat with 1&quot; hexes can be cut into a 15x15 rhombus grid. Standard Go stones also work well for this board.  It is also playable as a pencil-and-paper game, like the 3M Paper Game version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this card game based in H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, you play an investigator (represented by a double sized card that has your stats, special abilities and keeps your story organized) who must complete stories without going insane.  From a deck of at least 52 cards you draw 13 and take turns playing one at a time so it moves at a brisk pace.  You stock your deck with at least 20 points of stories (usually 3 or 4) and try to get the required cards into play.  As an example The card 'A Day in the Life of a M. U. Student' requires you to visit 3 Different Miskatonic University Locations, cast a spell, summon a monster, go to a country site and play an ally of the opposite sex.  When you have fulfilled the conditions you score the card and gain sanity.  In this card's case you score 8 points and gain 2 sanity.<br/><br/>The types of cards you have are locations (you almost always occupy one), allies, monsters, events, tomes, spells, artifacts and adventures.  A round lasts until there are two passes, at which time all monsters played fight each other then go after the investigators to disable their allies or reduce their sanity.  You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.  Because of this you blow through your deck very quickly and you will go through it a couple of times in most games.<br/><br/>There are also some very nasty phobias and events to play on your opponents to interfere with their strategies.  There is a lot of interaction and the Lovecraftian atmosphere is keenly felt.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "King Solomon presided over a golden age of peace and prosperity in ancient Israel. During this time Solomon instituted an unprecedented building program. As one of Solomon's chief governors, you must procure materials and oversee construction of buildings and roads across the land for the glory of Solomon. You will also help to construct the Temple, one of the wonders of the ancient world.<br/><br/>Kingdom of Solomon is a worker-placement game with a few new twists and turns. Do you claim a resource space, an action space or throw in all your remaining pawns to grab a powerful Bonus Space? Will you spend your resources to extend Solomon's kingdom, take some points in the Market or add to the Temple? These and many other choices await you in this highly interactive game.<br/><br/>You play Kingdom of Solomon in rounds of four phases.  You start the round placing your pawns to get resources, take actions or get a bonus.  In this placement phase players take turns, each placing one pawn at a time.  After all pawns have been placed, players resolve what they get from placing their pawns.  This is called the resolution phase, and each player, in turn, resolves the placement of all their pawns before the next player.  Next the players can go to the Market to sell or buy resources.  In this market phase, like the placement phase, players alternate taking turns, except that players take turns in reverse order.  The last shall be first, and the first shall be last.  Finally, you build in the building phase.  Players, one at a time, can build a building, roads and add blocks to the Temple.<br/>  <br/>When you place pawns to take actions, you can get an additional resource for a resource space, trade one resource for another, steal a resource from an opponent, get victory points or draw Fortune cards.  You can play Fortune cards at any time.  Fortune cards provide resources, victory points or special actions.  Bonuses your pawns can gain for you include one of every resource, three Fortune cards or victory points with a rearrangement of turn order so you become the new first player.<br/><br/>You use resources to build things.  Each thing costs a specific set of resources.  The buildings you build give you victory points and additional spots to place pawns for resources or actions.  Roads link resource spaces into resource regions so you can get more resources per pawn placed in the resource region.  Building Temple blocks give you either victory points or temple tokens that help you gain or keep the High Priest.  The High Priest lets you take advantage of another player&rsquo;s resource region and gives you victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end the round when a player places all his building tokens on building sites, there is a building token on each of the building sites, or the Temple is complete.  The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players are competing to manage and grow their entire mining outfit while acquiring the most gold before the ground is too frozen to dig. The Alaskan countryside is an inhospitable environment, so players will face hardships that affect their entire outfit &ndash; not to mention the ever-dropping temperature that will shut down their operation.<br/><br/>In Pay Dirt players start with a small basic crew, an unimpressive claim, mediocre equipment and just a little bit of cash to make a go in one of the toughest competitions this side of the globe. Gold mining isn&rsquo;t cheap and players will have to sell their gold throughout the game to keep the equipment running and their workers happy. Through clever use of their equipment and workers, players can make their mining outfits more efficient and dialed in to their preference of play. Will you recruit heavily and stack your camp with workers or will you keep your eyes on better and more efficient equipment? Will you have what it takes to hit to strike it rich and hit pay dirt?<br/><br/>",

Goal tiles stay off to the side for endgame scoring, and dino tiles are arranged in front of each player. Dino tiles include three sizes each of herbivores and carnivores. Each tile must overlap previous ones, either on top of a quarter tile, half tile, or even a whole tile, ensuring that any covered dinos are completely hidden.<br/><br/>Adjacent dinos of the same species form herds, which will eat together if connected to a single food source &mdash; or die together if they are unfed, adjacent to a tar pit, or next to an otherwise unfed carnivore!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each living and fed dino scores 1-3 points depending on its size, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is a real-time, roll-and-write game in which the frantic action around the table mimics the kick-arse fighting action in the game-world! Set in the world of Vengeance and designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi, Noralie Lubbers and Gordon Calleja, Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is a standalone game that transforms the fast-paced dice puzzles of the original Vengeance into roll-and-write mechanisms in which you're building combos, striking off enemies, and scoring points for an action-packed, brain-teasing fighting game that's easy to learn and hard to master.<br/><br/>The aim of Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight is to infiltrate a gang den, carve your way through its rooms, and kill the Boss, while completing side objectives printed on the dens themselves.<br/><br/>The game is split into three parts: planning, fighting and montage. In the planning phase players roll and re-roll 4 dice in real time, aiming to roll a combination of dice that match an ability they wish to trigger in the upcoming, fight phase. Assigning dice to an ability allows players to fill their hand back to four dice from a large, common pool and repeat the process as quickly as they can manage.<br/><br/>Once the dice pool is depleted, the fighting proper begins. Here players take a set of dice assigned to an ability and execute that ability, moving their piece through rooms full of enemies, and crossing them out when they are hit with the multitude of available abilities. Finally, players heal and upgrade their characters, bring new abilities and items into play to help them on their road to vengeance.<br/><br/>Vengeance: Roll &amp; Fight comes in two boxes: Episode 1 and Episode 2. Both episodes are standalone games with the same rules, but with entirely different content: different heroes, dens, bosses, abilities and items. Each episode accommodates up to four players, so combining the two increases the player count from 1-4 to 1-8! Content in both Episodes can be switched like-for-like as you choose.<br/><br/>",

But simply reaching the boat does not mean they have escaped as re-capture is always possible, perhaps, even likely. They will not be really safe until they reach their Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.<br/>Each player leads a group of pirates to Pirate's Nest on Tortuga.The path leads the pirates through wild jungle and across the waters of open ocean to the island of Tortuga. In addition to the innate perils of the trip are the other pirates, as each group wants to be the first to arrive at Pirate's Nest and will do what they can to slow the others' progress. As soon as one player has all his pirates in Pirate's Nest, he can raise the Jolly Roger and win the game.<br/><br/>The game is a sequel to Cartagena with the pirates trying to figure out what to do now that they have escaped from the prison.<br/><br/>Inside the box:<br/><br/>    5 game board pieces with 7 symbols: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass<br/>    3 Game board parts: boat, Pirate's Nest and Jolly Roger flag<br/>    105 cards - 15 cards of each symbol: parrot, treasure chest, spyglass, dukats, treasure map, cannon, and compass plus 1 of each symbol with gold border<br/>    30 pirate figures 6 each of five colors<br/><br/><br/>Each player receives seven cards. A turn consists of taking at least one and up to three of the following actions:<br/>1) Play a card and move a pirate forward to the next unoccupied matching symbol.<br/>2) Move an opponent&rsquo;s pirate forward to the next space with one or two pirates on it (you may not skip over pirates), then draw one card for each pirate already there (max. 3 pirates on any one space at the same time).<br/>3) Sail the boat between the islands.<br/><br/>To sail the boat to the second island, you must have at least one pirate in the boat. If, at the start of your turn, your pirates outnumber the pirates of your opponent/s, you may sail the boat as a free action. You can only move the boat back to the first island if you still have at least one pirate on the first island.<br/><br/>There is no hand limit, but if a player plays a card with a yellow border, all players must discard down to 7 cards.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to move all his pirates into the Pirate's Nest and raise the flag.<br/><br/>",

Players will play sets of cards from their hands each round to beat the sets of their opponents. You'll also need to be able to correctly assess the strength of your hand in order to predict how many sets you'll win each round. Once the predictions are revealed, players will also be able to bet against each other reaching their goal.<br/><br/>You'll need to stay alert and keep an eye your opponent's plays to avoid letting a brawl break out. If that happens, only one player will walk away a winner...<br/><br/>The game is played over 10 rounds. Points are scored for each winning card set, for correctly predicting your number of winning sets, and for correctly betting against other player's predictions. Additionally, bonus points are scored at the end of the game for the longest streak of correct predictions.<br/><br/>",

Well now the real game begins &mdash; how on Earth will you fit it into your alphabetized, colour coordinated and divinely crafted new board game shelf? Well, what does it really matter? It&rsquo;s probably going to just sit there in shrink for the next six months anyway &mdash; sorry, too real? Let&rsquo;s just move on then...<br/><br/>In Shelfie Stacker, players compete to accumulate the most illustrious board game collection, by carefully filling their shelf with their most recent purchases.<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of 7 rounds. Each round, groups of 3 dice are randomly rolled and placed into piles. These dice represent groups of board games. From their hand of 8 action cards, players must select 1 card to play facedown. These cards will not only determine turn order, but also provide a one-time ability to help players better stack their shelf.<br/><br/>There are specific rules around how dice can be placed into players' shelves, so careful planning is required. At the end of 7 rounds, the player with the best shelfie wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Granada &ndash; many artisans, traders and entire families have settled at the foot of the Sierra Nevada because the Palace of Alhambra promises all people work, contracts and above all prosperity.<br/>(From the publisher's blurb.)<br/><br/>Granada is new member of the Game: Alhambra family with a more challenging character: in this standalone game the players develop the city of Granada next to Sierra Nevada, where the famous Alhambra stands, by buying building tiles to construct the city which will earn the most victory points. Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types for which the value is set during the game.<br/><br/>Link to Trailer <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.queen-games.de/index.php?id=2537----2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.queen-games.de/index.php?id=2537----2</a><br/><br/>Play Differences from Alhambra<br/>Alhambra advanced. Play is the same: buy a building tile, take money or remodel. If you buy a tile for the exact amount, you can take another action, same as in Alhambra. The differences: new building types, building values are dynamic, two-sided tiles, and moats instead of walls.<br/><br/>There are 9 building types in Granada. Unlike Alhambra, the buildings do not have a set value. Instead, building value is determined by the count of that type of building in all players' cities times a multiplier. As in Alhambra, there are 3 scoring rounds during which each building type is examined and points awarded for the player with the majority of that type of building. In the first scoring round, A, only the player with the most tiles of a particular building type scores for that building type (1 times the total count). In the second scoring round, B, the top 2 players score (2 times the total count and 1 times the total count respectively), and in the final round, the top 3 score (3x, 2x, and 1x the total count of that building type). Scoring for a &quot;Beginners Game&quot; is a little different.<br/><br/>There are no ties in Granada: points are never divided like in Alhambra. In the case of two players having the same number of tiles of a particular type in their cities, the player with the highest valued tile of that type wins, and the other player takes next place. So, in Granada, it pays to buy the more expensive buildings.<br/><br/>For example: When the A round-scoring card is turned up, Cindy has 2 Schools, Diana has 2, Tim has 1, Tina and Bailey each have 0, for a total of 5 Schools currently in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Diana's is a 7. So, in round A, Cindy would score 1 x 5 = 5 points.<br/><br/>When the B round-scoring card is turned up, the count for Schools is: Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina and Bailey 0 each for a total of 6 Schools. So, Diana scores 2 x 6 = 12 points and Cindy scores 1 x 6 = 6 points.<br/><br/>In the final round, the School count is Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina 2, Bailey 0 for a total of 8 Schools in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Tina's is a 4. So, Diana scores 3 x 8 = 24 points, Cindy score 2 x 8 = 16 points and Tina score 1 x 8 = 8 points.<br/><br/>Another difference in Granada is that the tiles are two-sided: on one side an even-numbered building of some type, on the other a different, odd-numbered building valued exactly one higher. The configuration of the buildings on both sides is identical in terms of moat placement or lack thereof on each side. When purchasing a building, a player can immediately place the building, as is, into her city or may flip it to the other side and place it in her supply for later placement during a remodel action.<br/><br/>The Building Market is initially filled with tiles even-side up. The next time the market is filled, the odd side will be placed up, then even, then odd, etc. A handy toggle feature is provided on the board near the Building Market to facilitate this.<br/><br/>The last difference between Alhambra and Granada, moats instead of walls, is really just a difference in artwork. As in Alhambra, during each scoring round, each player scores points for her longest continuous moat, instead of wall, surrounding her city. The rules are the same regarding tile placement: must be able to trace an unbroken path back to the city's center, moat can touch moat, etc. In games I've played, players have often commented that it seems to be harder to build with the moat tiles of Granada than with the wall tiles of Alhambra. Just one more way to make Granada an advanced version of Alhambra?<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Alhambra<br/><br/><br/>",

They explore, using a new movement mechanic, for the raw materials they need to build the settlement. Along the way, they discover useful natural products - but also encounter wild animals and are confronted with adventurous situations. Those who survive these encounters obtain the raw materials they sought as well as experience points that improve the abilities of the player's character. Over time, then, the player becomes stronger, smarter or more charismatic and is better and better suited for the dangers of the wild.<br/><br/>Back in the village, the natural products can be used to brew beverages while the raw materials are used for building. Through this building, the settlement grows and players obtain victory points.<br/><br/>The main attraction of the game lies in the exploration of the island and the development of the individual player characters. But trading and interaction between the players is also important.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the game, you score 1 point per tile of a terrain type for each sheep in a region of this type; you also score for coins still in hand.<br/><br/>The map on the game board shows regions separated by roads: three regions of each terrain type for a total of 18 regions. Numbered &quot;rest stops&quot; lie along the roads, with each rest stop between exactly two regions. Shepherds move from one rest stop to another, with the first movement being free and all the others on the same turn costing 1 coin. When you buy a terrain, you can purchase the top tile of either of the two terrain types next to your shepherd. When you move a sheep, you move one sheep from a region adjacent to your shepherd to the other region adjacent to that piece, i.e., you lead the sheep across the road to a greener pasture &ndash; well, greener for you, if all goes well.<br/><br/>Each time you move the shepherd, you place a fence in the rest stop from which it started moving, making that location off-limits for the rest of the game. During the game some regions become inaccessible and, if they are full of sheep, a rush for the tiles takes place. The only black sheep in the game, which is worth two points, serves as a semi-random element, possibly moving to an adjacent region each turn while still being movable by shepherds as long as it's not fenced in.<br/><br/>After twenty fences have been placed, you end the round so that all players have the same number of turns, then you count up the points.<br/><br/>",

The heroes work together to some degree to defeat villains and monsters as they collectively lose the game if ten cards land in the shadows during play. That said, the game has only a single winner &ndash; the player who has the most investigation points at the end of the game. (Villains come in three levels of difficulty, and at the start of the game, you create a villain stack with one card of each difficulty level being chosen at random.)<br/><br/>The game uses three currencies &ndash; combat (red), cunning (green) and spirit (blue) &ndash; with some cards having a silver cost that can be paid with any currency. Players can acquire cards from a row of six that are available from the main deck or from piles of cards that are always available. If you fight the &quot;Hungry Dead&quot; &ndash; an always available card that costs one of each color &ndash; you can remove a card from your deck or from the central row.<br/><br/>&quot;Dark Secrets&quot; are a special type of card that get added to your deck through various means. The card is worth negative points at the end of the game, but should you draw it during play, you remove it from the game, then draw a &quot;Shocking Discovery&quot; &ndash; which will affect you or all players with some kind of pernicious effect.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Dien Bien Phu - The Final Gamble&quot; is a two-player wargame about the decisive battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 that not only ended the French Indochina War but also had political repercussions far outside the region itself. One player represents France and her colonial troops. The other player represents the armed force of Viet Minh, the communist/nationalist independence movement of Vietnam. This is a cage fight. There are no victory points, there is no marginal victory and there is no draw. Viet Minh wins by forcing the French troops to surrender. France wins by not surrendering.<br/><br/>Map and scale: The map covers the former village of Dien Bien Phu and surrounding areas. There is a small submap of the French strongpoint &quot;Isabelle&quot; further south in the valley. There are several groups of French strongpoints scattered around the map, each one with a female name (all named after the commander - de Castries' - mistresses, according to lore). The map is divided into three divisional sectors (plus a fourth one facing the submap &quot;Isabelle&quot;). Each sector has several zones that represent Viet Minh trenches winding from the map edge towards the center of the map. Each hex represents 150 meters and each game turn covers three days. There are 21 turns in the game, but historically, it ended after 19 game turns with a Viet Minh victory. The scale allows stacking of three French units (usually infantry companies) in a hex, but there are no stacking limits for Viet Minh battalions, which creates a chess feel.<br/><br/>Three Viet Minh battalions form a regiment and three regiments become a division and there were almost four full divisions in the valley, as well as a full artillery division off map. There was also an equivalent of another three divisions in a replacement pool outside the valley. The French troops were a colorful array of colonial paras, Vietnamese troops, units from French Algeria and Morocco, and, of course, the French Foreign Legion. Some units are of average quality, some are outright terrible, but some are the very best that could be mustered ... anywhere. A French battalion consisted of four companies and there were 12 battalions together with 11 auxiliary light companies at the start of the siege, as well as 16 artillery and mortar batteries, and three tank platoons. Waiting in Hanoi were another five para battalions together with an expected replacement pool of about 14 companies. In neighboring Laos, there were four battalions ready to march and perhaps save the day at the very end.<br/><br/>French supply: This battle took place far out in the wilderness of Vietnam and both sides had to adjust to the limited flow of supplies that could be brought forward, though the air to the French, and through vast forests to the Viet Minh. Supplies, as historically was the case, tend to be a lot less than wished for. There are several supply tracks on the map showing how much ammo, food &amp; bullets, fuel &amp; spares, medicine as well as the amount of truck transport available for the French. Each game turn air transports will bring in a mix of supplies together with replacements and reinforcements. This is done on a chart with a grid where a mix of supply markers are placed together with eventual reinforcements and replacements. Weather will then decide what will arrive and what will abort back to Hanoi. The French player will never know for sure what and how much will arrive and has to take that into account.<br/><br/>Viet Minh supply and morale: Viet Minh will receive a more steady flow of ammunition, but not enough to barrage whenever wished. There is a large pool of replacements to use, but although it is large, it is not infinite. If Viet Minh losses are too heavy, then the fact that you can only replace one step per regiment per game turn will be a painful experience. If loses are too heavy for too long, then the pool will dry out. Viet Minh's main concern is troop morale. The battle force starts with excellent morale, but each division's morale will decrease when taking replacements thus diluting the experienced veterans with newly drafted peasants with no combat experience. Morale will rise slightly when resting (not assaulting). But then again, time flies and there is a battle to win. Morale is a very important part of the game and if it falls too low, the troops will be rendered useless.<br/><br/>Artillery: Artillery is another important aspect of the battle. There is bombardment from both sides before assaults commence. You wish to achieve two things with barrage: Losses and to make the target shaken. Targets that are shaken lose abilities to react and support combat, and they become easier to assault. Defending units bring in barrage to make it harder for the attacker to succeed. Viet Minh artillery is off-board and safe from French artillery fire (mainly that they were dug deep into the mountainsides). French artillery and mortar units, on the other hand, exist as units on the board and may fall prey to Viet Minh bombardment. French artillery units that are reduced and/or shaken are not as efficient, and those that are eliminated are obviously out of play. Both sides have a limited amount of ammunition and therefore have to spend it wisely.<br/><br/>Combat: The main effort in the game is, of course, the assaults. Each player will conduct two die-rolls during the course of an assault to determine the outcome. The defender first conducts defensive fire in the hopes of inflicting losses, but also to possibly force the attacker abort the assault. The defender&rsquo;s first die roll is compared to their strength and will show how well they defend. The defender&rsquo;s second die-roll (modified from the result of the first die roll), is compared to the assaulting unit's morale and will determine the result of the defensive fire. Providing the assaulting units do not abort, the attacker (who has suffered the effects of the defensive fire) conducts two die rolls. The first one to see how well the assault is conducted, and the second one to see the outcome of the assault. Modifications, such as trenches, terrain, support from other units, etc., adjust the strength of a unit to make it stronger or weaker.<br/><br/>You will never know for sure what that result will be due to the two die-rolls on each side. Dien Bien Phu &ndash; The Final Gamble, will be as tense and brutal a simulation as was the historical battle that determined the fate of this war as well as shaping the events of things to come.<br/><br/>Kim Kanger<br/><br/>",

While striving for power, happiness and wealth, they leave their own village and travel towards the City of Rome. The road to Rome is long and there are many ways to reach your life purpose. As a hardworking farmer you can work the land and grow large quantities of grain and wine. A clever farmer irrigates the land to improve the yield of his harvest. Trading your harvested goods for the best price may bring you the means to move up the ladder of the Roman hierarchy. When will you decide to move on and buy yourself an army of Centurions? Or will you choose the sacred way of Religion and serve the ruthless Roman Gods? Along the way, you will have the opportunity to find happiness and wealth in marriage. Will you take this chance to become happy or not? If you contribute well to the Roman Empire, you will grow in the favor of the Emperor and move further to Rome. Will the citizens of Rome welcome you jubilantly?<br/><br/>Coming nearer to Rome and the Emperor's Palace the tension in the game becomes higher. Which of the players has contributed most to the Empire? And which of the players has saved the city in times of crisis? Just when water and food supplies become exhausted or Centurions are needed to protect Rome against a hostile invasion, only the most prestigious Romans show their courage and value. The Emperor will reward this Roman with golden Fortuna coins, and the deeper the crisis, the richer the reward. When a player has reached the centre of Rome, only the player who has done most for the Emperor and the People of Rome will become Victorious.<br/><br/>Make sure to be in the City of Rome so you are able to take that triumphal march to Victory!<br/><br/>How to win the game?<br/>The player with the highest number of Victory Points at the end of the game wins. The game ends when one player gets to the Center of Rome (the Palace of the Emperor), then this final round is completed. Scoring in the game is partly based on the number of steps you have made towards Rome = each step is one VP. The other Victory Points are scored by collecting the right combination of privilege cards and resources. The VP scored with the privately held privilege cards stays a secret till the end of the game when the total scoring is revealed.<br/><br/>",

Mercs can then rest and repair or heal themselves, but each turn resting will move the time counter forward to the next counter-attack from the enemy or a new event, that will change the conditions of battle and/or add extra side missions to solve. Players have to manage the different threats and missions while advancing their main goal on the map, which changes with each scenario.<br/><br/>Mercs take their gear, allies and experience with them through the campaign, continually improving their mercs.<br/><br/>​Players can gear up and improve mercs, free sectors from occupying forces to receive cash and better gear, save grateful civilians to man your militia or stumble into roaming bloodcats as you try to fight Deirdranna's nefarious commanders and their plots, which will escalate the more sectors you liberate.<br/><br/>​<br/>The game uses elements from combat games such as Dark Souls, Imperial Assault or Conan and adds more tactical player decisions and influence such as terrain and cover and  different, evolving enemies as well as new merc skills and tons of gears and weapons and a meta gameplay managing your militia and defending your hard won sectors.<br/><br/>Also: Bloodcats!<br/><br/>Based on the Jagged Alliance Video game series<br/><br/>",

The scenarios highlight the key elements that made these battles so fascinating: the defensive power of the longbow, especially when used in coordination with dismounted, or even mounted, men-at-arms. Given the right deployments and forces, the inability to take advantage of the marvelous abilities of the vaunted knights, the finest mounted force in Europe, became something of a surprise to many &quot;experts.&quot;<br/><br/>Men of Iron is designed for quick learning and easy play.

        "description": "Zombicide: Gear Up is a co-operative flip-and-write game set in the world of Zombicide.<br/><br/>To set up, each player takes a survivor card, which shows four weapons, along with damage, armor, and ammo tracks. Determine the level of play (easy to nightmare), then give each player the appropriate number of random regular and special zombie cards to place next to the &quot;third street level&quot; of their card. Shuffle the ten turn cards, then lay out nine in a row, placing seven spawn cards by the last seven of these cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, reveal the next turn card, which shows which color weapon each player activates. Each weapon has a &quot;hit shape&quot; (typically a polyomino), and you must fit the hit shape into the outline of a zombie to use it, with no overlaps to any damage you've dealt previously. Some zombies might then advance toward players, moving from their third street to their second one. If a zombie is on your &quot;first street&quot; and would advance, you take damage equal to the unmarked red stars on that card. If you mark off ammo or armor on a zombie, you circle those symbols on your survivor card; you can spend one ammo to mark off a single zombie space, and you can spend armor instead of taking damage.<br/><br/>After the third turn, you reveal the first spawn card, which will put more zombies in play, with players collectively deciding how to add those cards to their third streets. Whenever you mark off the final space on a zombie card, remove it from play, then upgrade one of your weapons, perhaps gaining the ability to use it multiple times or gain armor when you cover red stars. After nine turns, reshuffle the ten turn cards, then lay out nine of them, along with the level 1 and 2 boss cards under the final seven turn cards. Place the boss in front of one player. During a turn, if the boss is in front of you or if you have an activated long-range weapon, you can attack the boss instead of zombies close to you. If you defeat the boss before the ninth turn ends in the second round, you win; if not &mdash; or if any player is killed by damage &mdash; then you lose the game.<br/><br/>For the solitaire mode of Zombicide: Gear Up, take companion cards for three survivors not in play and place them next to your survivor card. When a turn card has a smiley face on it, you can activate the power of one of your companions, in addition to your own weapon. Each companion can be used only once in a round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Elements, a.k.a. Khmer, is a bluffing and deduction game for two players that contains only sixteen cards, with each player trying to figure out the best time to end the round so that they can win. The goal each round is to have a hand of cards with a higher sum than the opponent, but equal to or less than the sum played to the table.<br/><br/>To set up a round, deal six cards face down to each player, then remove the remaining four cards, unseen, from the game. On your turn, you take one of these five actions:<br/><br/>1: PLAY a card from your hand to the table, overlapping any cards previously played and announcing the sum of all revealed cards.<br/><br/>2: DRAW the most recently played card from the table and place it in front of you; this card counts as being in your hand, thereby increasing the sum of your hand and lowering the sum on the table, but you cannot discard or play this card.<br/><br/>3: DISCARD a 6 card from your hand, placing it to the side out of play for this round.<br/><br/>4: KNOCK to end the round and see who wins; you may do this only if the sum of cards in your hand is equal to or less than the sum on the table. The players then compare sums, and whoever has the highest sum (without going over the sum of cards on the table) wins 2 points; if the players are tied, the player who knocked loses.<br/><br/>5: FOLD to end the round because you think that you will lose; the opponent wins 1 point.<br/><br/>Shuffle all the cards, and redeal; the player who scored in the round starts the next round, and the first player to collect 6 points wins. Alternatively, players can play only a single round to determine the winner, ignoring the FOLD action since that's a sure loser...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ragnar&ouml;k is coming. The fate of all existence is at stake. Is destruction inevitable, or are there ways to avoid ultimate cataclysm? The Norns, mystical beings of great power, have decided they will not go quietly into oblivion and have turned their attention to the well of Fate, Ur&eth;r, in order to find any possible way to stop Ragnar&ouml;k. Looking deep into the swirling waters, they can foresee which potential combination of heroes, villains, battles, victories, and defeats might stop the end of all that is known &mdash; but will they find the right combination in time? Is there any true path to salvation at all? They must hurry and seek the true way through, before all is lost.<br/><br/>In God of War: The Card Game, players take on the role of the Norns as they try different combinations of heroes and events in order to stop Ragnar&ouml;k. Each game is a new attempt to find the right key to saving Midgard from destruction. Players must work together, embodying mighty heroes such as Kratos, Mimir, Atreus, Brok and Sindri, and Freya. They will fight enemies and bosses from the popular God of War video game, but combined and remixed in exciting new ways, creating unique &quot;What if...?&quot; scenarios each time they play. If they succeed, the way forward has been secured and Ragnar&ouml;k can be halted. Failure means the Norns will have to try again as only death and destruction lay along that particular path.<br/><br/>Each quest in God of War: The Card Game is made up of a mosaic of cards that recreate monsters and locations from the video game. Each quest's mosaic is different, and each card is double-sided, depending on whether a section has been destroyed or not, and each has special rules that go into effect when it is face up on the tabletop. Learning how each quest is won, as well as what strategy to employ, is key to victory.<br/><br/>As players progress, earlier quests have an effect on what comes after them. At certain points along their path, players must choose which quest they will complete. Completing one might grant a bonus, but quests left untouched result in dire permanent consequences as the players move forward. These choices and challenges lead to new strategies, making it so no two games of God of War: The Card Game are alike.<br/><br/>Heroes in the game have several elements that make them unique. Each comes with their own dashboard that explains their special abilities and health totals, in addition to tracking the number of cards a player can keep in their hand from round to round. Tokens are used to keep everything clear as heroes gain and lose health and build up their power so they can unleash a mighty special attack. Heroes begin the game with a unique starting deck of cards that will be augmented from additional decks as the game progresses. Players can construct their deck to focus on their strengths or look for ways to generalize their approach, preparing for future quests that lie ahead. Each hero also has a unique standee that indicates which portion of the mosaic they are facing. With multiple heroes from which to choose, numerous ways to build their deck, and various different quests to attempt, each game of God of War: The Card Game will be a new experience that will echo throughout eternity.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of a round, cards are turned face up until all six colors are showing or seven cards are face up. All players secretly decide which color cards they hope to win at the end of the round. On their turn, players bid by placing a stone on the table. If a player passes, he picks up all the stones currently on the table and places his token on top of the token pile. The last player remaining grabs all the cards of the color he had chosen earlier in the round. The second to last player, whose token now sits at the top of the token pile, then picks up all the cards of his chosen color if any cards of that color are left. The same process is repeated for each player when their token is at the top of the token pile. The game ends when all the cards of the deck have been claimed. Players then earn points for each animal for which they have majority.<br/><br/>Components: 54 cards, 50 stones, 30 markers, rules.<br/><br/>Released: Essen 2007.<br/><br/>",

When there is only one die left, the ship sinks a number of fields according to a token drawn. If the water level reaches a rat, the rat and the corresponding die is taken out of the game. When a rat reaches a cheese token, the player who moved the rat gets the token. <br/>The first rat to reach the top deck gets nothing; the second rat scores 5 points, the third one 3 points and the fourth one 2 points.

Players compete to complete contracts by selecting contracts from the Market and by collecting fish from their fleet at the wharfside. It's what happens when the fleet comes home!<br/><br/>Tales of the bountiful harvest at Ridback Bay have traveled far, attracting merchants to the local wharfside who wish to pay handsomely for your haul. A successful fisherman&rsquo;s day is not done with the catch; keen business decisions will determine if your fleet has amassed a rich profit! Merchants have offered generous contracts for the catch, but which offer the greatest benefits? Choose and complete the most lucrative contracts and reap your reward!<br/><br/>In Fleet Wharfside, players fulfill Contracts from local Ridback Bay businesses. Each turn, players will either collect fish from their fleet at the wharfs (by taking cards) or choose to purchase a Contract from the Market. Contracts provide a bonus while in play, but once they are completed the bonus goes away too! The player who collects the most VP from Contracts, Trophies, King Crab, final Goods, and their Captain Bonus wins the game!<br/><br/>Fleet Wharfside is game #8 of the E-G-G Series!<br/><br/>",

The lower the club card you take, the more points you could win. But there's a catch: The last player to go out for the round does not score ANY points. So players who get too greedy might pick up a pile of clubs, but end up with 0 points for the round!<br/><br/>First there was Hearts, then there was Spades, and now North Star Games is bringing you Clubs. The suit of clubs finally gets some respect!<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>Clubs is a climbing game similar to Tichu, Haggis, Big Two and The Great Dalmuti. It can be played with 2 - 6 players in less 30 minutes.  There are two ways to earn points in Clubs:<br/><br/><br/>    Play all your cards as quickly as possible each round.<br/>    Win tricks with clubs in them.<br/><br/><br/>To play a round, deal out 10 cards to each player. Players may call Double or Nothing anytime before playing their first card.  The player to the left of the dealer leads with a Trick-Type.  Legal Trick-Types include any singleton, pair, 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind, or any run of 2 or more cards. Players can either pass or follow with a similar hand of higher rank.  When all of the players have passed consecutively, the pile is taken by the person who played last. That player leads with a Trick-Type of their choice.<br/><br/>Players score bonus points for playing all of their cards each round.  A 6-player game has all of the following Bonus Cards:<br/><br/><br/>    12 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    10 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    8 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    5 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    2 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    0 bonus points.  Do not score points for clubs<br/><br/><br/>The last player out for the round does not get bonus points and does not receive points for any clubs he may have taken. The points for clubs varies from 5 points (for the 1 of clubs) to 1 point (for the 10-15 of clubs). The first player to 50 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Turns are played out simultaneously, with each player selecting an action without knowing those chosen by opponents.<br/><br/>The City Watch player levies taxes on the Merchant and patrols the streets for the Thief, looking to fill the city's jail with ne'er-do-wells. Players in the role of the Merchant are out to cut deals and line their coffers in a quest for untold riches. As the Thief, that player is attempting to pilfer coins from the Merchant, while earning infamy and the respect of the secretive Foxtail Gang.<br/><br/>The coastal city of Trieste is a flurry of trade and activity, but where there's power, there are always those who will compete to grab as much of it as they can.

The game is driven by a card deck that captures developments ripped straight from today&rsquo;s headlines, bolstered by cards with a context-setting reading of recent history, and a set of speculative cards capturing a diverse range of potential future events.<br/><br/>The Chinese player works to influence other countries in the region, establish territorial claims and regional hegemony, and improve its world standing. The U.S. player works to maintain influence with allied countries in the region, secure freedom of navigation, and keep China in check. Success for both players hinges on the support and allegiance of non-player countries in the region. The game stops short of dealing with a potential full-scale military conflict. Rather, it requires the nuanced exercise of political, economic, and military resources, in a form of prima facie diplomacy &ndash; on the waters, in the air, and ultimately in the minds of the people &ndash; to achieve victory.<br/><br/>",

Deep underground mad scientists are raising monsters from the planet Moongha. Once fully formed they will emerge to spread terror and destruction. Cities will be laid waste to, and the human race will be hunted to extinction.<br/><br/>Through the sewers oozes the Bloob, quietly growing in size. The Drakoor, alien vampires, stalk the night, feeding off the unwary. Meanwhile, the strongest of the Moongha invaders, Mechoor, sucks in energy from the earth. Once sated it will rise to destroy whole cities with its heat ray. These are just a few of the monsters that will terrorise the people of Earth.<br/><br/>It can only be hoped that just as in the movies there's a hero around who can thwart their evil plans; otherwise there will be no more &quot;just another day&quot;s for anybody! But who's behind those evil plans? You! You are one of those sadistic, power-thirsty, psycho nerds, eager for revenge after a whole life of study, disregarded by everyone. All of you have received a visit from a mysterious flying saucer, carrying strange alien machinery &ndash; an engine that finally brought you POWER! And now you are ready to fight your insane struggle to be the first in destroying the human race. This time no &quot;Klaatu barada nikto!&quot; will stop you...<br/><br/>Moongha Invaders: Mad Scientists and Atomic Monsters Attack the Earth! is for three to four players and should take about ninety minutes to play. You have control of a number of different types of Moongha monsters. When you sit down to play, the side of the board closest to you is your monster display. There you will see the seven different types of monster. You will place your monster counters in these boxes. Note that some monster types have more than one counter.<br/><br/>The game lasts either eight or nine turns, depending on the number of players, although it may end before then if a player manages to get down all twenty of their damage cubes.<br/><br/>At the start of each turn a random number of actions are made available. Three of these actions relate to the monsters and allow you to create, attack, and move them. These actions are represented by orange, white, and purple tokens. There are three human action boxes, one that allows you to place a hero, the other two allow you to place military counters.<br/><br/>To create a monster you have to place a certain number of orange tokens in the monster box. Once the monster has been created you place it in one of the twelve cities on the board. When you do so, you place the monster on its hidden side. The monster is alive but as yet the world does not know of its presence. While hidden a monster is safe from attack and can build up its strength so that when it does attack it will cause carnage. Another player may attempt to reveal your monster by placing a hero counter in the same city.<br/><br/>Military units will try to destroy monsters. When you place a military unit or a hero, you can then attack with all military counters in that city. When a monster attacks a city, armor units will attack it first, then after that attack has been completed, any surviving infantry units will attack. All combat involves rolling dice and in all cases a roll of four or more is successful.<br/><br/>Each monster type has its own special abilities. Only three monsters are powerful enough to destroy entire cities; these are the Bloob, Mechoor, and Moogre. When you attack a city, you mark the damage you do with your colored cubes. At the end of the game, players score victory points depending on how many damage cubes they have in each city. Players also score points for the cities that were randomly assigned to them at the beginning of the game, depending on how much damage they have suffered. Points can also be scored for having vampires on the board and for killing other monsters with your Moogre monster.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maharaja is a new edition of the classic game by the authors Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling. In this new version of the game which supports 1 to 4 players and is enriched with new graphics and components, you build statues of your God of reference to please the Maharaja during their visit and score victory points at the end of the game depending on the majority you reach.<br/> During the game, players take the role of priests who travel to different cities in India, building statues and shrines dedicated to their favorite Gods to expand their worship. To do so, they are assisted by several characters with different abilities. Every year, the Maharaja, the great king of India, will change his residence and players will receive rewards according to their Gods' worship value. At the beginning of each year, players plan their actions in a secret phase to be played simultaneously.<br/><br/>At the end of the seventh year or when a player builds their seventh statue, the game ends, then the player with most prestige wins.<br/><br/>Aside from the new graphics and components and from players now building statues instead of palaces, this new edition of Maharaja includes new characters to use during the turn that change turn order, additional ways to earn victory points, an additional bonus each time you score a city after the Maharaja's visit depending on the assistant you chose, and additional modular rules that can be added during the game and in the final scoring.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Includes solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi &amp; Simone Luciani<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Feierabend, a.k.a. Finishing Time, the after-worker placement game for 1-6 players.<br/><br/>In Feierabend, you are playing a team of workers (female, male, and non-binary, too). Each day you leave work stressed and look for some fun in the evenings &mdash; but thanks to a 70-hour work week and a low income, you don't have many possibilities for relaxation. Sure, you can head to the pub for drinks, go on blind dates to find a partner, or fish or jog outside, but this is not a good work-life balance. It's a rat race.<br/><br/>If you really want to relax, you need a higher income for you and your fellow workers &mdash; and the women on your team should be paid the same as the men. You want to work fewer hours each week, and taking a vacation would be good, too. Let the union help you fix this depressing lifestyle. This change might stress your employer, of course, but they already earn enough to be able to de-stress their life.<br/><br/>Each turn, place one (or more) of your workers on any available after-work spaces to gain relaxation. Taking leisure time doesn't cost anything, but going to town for amusement requires you to spend hard-earned money. Going on vacation for real relaxation is out of the question until your employer is convinced to grant your workers some time off. When your workers meet partners, you gain access to even better relaxation options.<br/><br/>At the pub, workers can relax and have drinks in front of the bar &mdash; or they can earn additional income and suffer more stress by working a second job there. You'll want to visit the union office, too, to strike for better working conditions. If you have enough strike tokens, you can force your employer to reduce working hours, increase your income, close the gender gap, or even send you on vacation.<br/><br/>After all your workers have been placed and taken their after-work actions, they are forced to return to work. You place them all on your factory where they then suffer stress, earn income, and gain strike tokens from the union, depending on the current working conditions.<br/><br/>The end of the game is triggered once a team gathers at least 40 relaxation. (In this game, relaxation is considered to be a currency.) Your workers are then placed on after-work spaces and go back to work one more time, after which the most relaxed team wins Feierabend.<br/><br/>Create a better (that is, more relaxing) life for your workers and their partners. Which team will relax the best and win the game? But really every team is a winner since they fought for better working conditions. Workers unite!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In AD 1096, hope fills the air like a bird's song after a long winter, the seeming endless road of the Dark Ages may soon come to an end. For years now, warlords have roamed the land, every surface is covered with filth, and disease has ripped through towns like great tornadoes. King Sivolc has dreamed that building a great gothic structure is the answer to leave this Dark Age behind forever. But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.<br/><br/>Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.  With Elias&rsquo; help, he has hired some of the greatest architects and monks in the land to complete this task. He waits patiently for this great abbey to be raised from the earth, filled with people, changing the course of history forever!<br/><br/>The King's Abbey is a worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.<br/><br/>Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned. Whoever has the most prestige wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Their surprising victory led to the creation of the first overseas European colonies and the reshaping of Muslim power in the Middle East. The repercussions of their journey continue to live with us today.<br/><br/>In Kingdom of Heaven - The Crusader States 1097-1291 (KOH) two players use cards to activate forces, trigger random events, conduct diplomacy or prosecute siege warfare on a vast arena stretching from Antioch to Cairo and from Cyprus to Mosul.<br/><br/>Nine scenarios cover all the major campaigns of the era, from the First, Second and Third Crusades to the Mongol invasion and the rise of the Mamluk Empire. In addition to the &lsquo;basic deck,&rsquo; each scenario adds different cards representing historical events unique to that campaign. Turns are yearly, and most scenarios can be finished in 3-4 hours.<br/><br/>The historical scenarios pit the greatest commanders of the age against one another: Nur ad-Din, Richard the Lionhearted, Saladin, Frederick Barbarossa, Louis IX, Hulegu Khan, Baibars, and many others. They range in length from the 3-turn First Crusade learning scenario to the 7-turn assault of Baibars on the faltering ramparts of the Crusader States.<br/><br/>(source: MMP website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

Harvest, hire, build, and plan your way into the history books!<br/><br/>At its heart, Ancient Realm is a civilization-building-themed puzzle game in which you try to maximize your points by deciding which blocks to keep and which to build over, while carefully managing your resources. Balance endgame scoring goal needs with immediate tactical needs to create a mighty civilization replete with wonders of the world.<br/><br/>Each turn, you have four available cards to place. Some of them will be districts, the basic building blocks of civilization, while others will be wonders, powerful but costly constructions. Wonder cards feature one block and a wonder; wonders are worth a large number of points and offer potent effects, but require significant resources to construct and cannot be covered by further cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, you pick one of these cards and place it in your realm. Cards can be placed next to, overlapping, or entirely covering one or more cards in your realm. When a block (or multiple blocks) is covered by a new card, those blocks can be activated to gain their effect. Mines fill your coffers with valuable gold; with gold, you can activate production sites and citizens. Citizens come in two types and might affect other cards, such as the value of certain wonders.<br/><br/>On the back of each district card is an event that impacts the growth of your civilization, and the event on the top of the district deck is active for the round.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, score your wonders and mines as well as any remaining gold and resources to determine how your civilization stacks up.<br/><br/>",

The Khan must appoint his successor. He will choose the bravest and most glorious of his generals, and you intend for that to be you! But you are not the only contender, and you will have to prove your worth.<br/><br/>Each turn in Huns you must choose between raiding for resources or picking a card that will grant you a special ability. In more detail, the game includes five decks of cards in five colors that feature equipment, raids, mercenaries, curses, and treasure, as well as goods cubes in the same five colors. Each player starts the game with two wagons that require specific colored goods to fill them.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, the active player rolls five d3 dice in the five colors, then chooses one of the dice and takes either cubes or cards in this color. If you take cards, they draw 1-3 cards (based on the die roll), keep one of them, then place the others face down under this deck. Equipment gives you an in-game bonus, raids have a one-time effect, treasure earns you points at game's end if you meet the condition listed, mercenaries give you a reusable effect once you give them goods, and curses are played on opponents, who must apply goods to them to dispel their effect. If you take cubes, you can place them on a single mercenary card, a single curse card, or any number of your wagons in the appropriate spaces. If you fill a wagon, you draw a new one from those on display. Each player takes one die in turn, choosing cards or goods, until all the dice have been chosen. The first player marker then moves clockwise, and the new active player rolls all five dice again.<br/><br/>When one of the cube colors or one of the decks is empty at the end of a round, the game ends. Players score points for raids undertaken, treasure achieved, mercenaries paid off, and wagons delivered, and whoever has the most points wins! Card combos, drafting strategies, and resource management is what Huns is about, set in the universe of the mighty warriors of Huns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What was old is new again. I am excited to have this opportunity to bring back into print and enhanced version of my original Peloponnesian War design that was originally published by Victory Games. This military game of ancient warfare lets YOU chart the destiny of the war. Peloponnesian War uses a still-unique solitaire system that was a pioneer in this genre, yet was never copied.<br/><br/>Most current solitaire systems on the market today have the player take one side for the entire game. This pits the player against a random 'Bot system, even the best of which have some difficulty giving you the same challenge as playing against a human opponent. In Peloponnesian War, you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best that YOU can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory. In this manner the player competes against himself in the classic tradition of the Greek tragedy. - Mark<br/><br/>From the opening of the Archadameian War in 431BC to the Fall of Athens in 404, The Peloponessian War allows YOU to compete against the man in the mirror, as you live through the suicide of Greece. Maneuver your generals, hoplites, and navies to fight battles and attempt to bring the war to an end on your terms. Take heed, however. As you weaken your foe, you create a greater game challenge for yourself. For as you improve in strength, so does your opponent.<br/><br/>In terms of physical components, Mark's enhanced version is getting the full GMT treatment: mounted map and strategy boards, high-quality thick counters, redesigned rules and playbook, all with new art throughout. This will be a product that you'll want to own and play for a long time! We hope you enjoy this enhanced GMT version of Mark Herman's classic solitaire game design.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Most other Civil War simulations portray specific battles, but Stonewall in the Valley concentrates on the full campaign in the Shenandoah from March to June 1862. The Union player's objective is to maintain control over the key regions of the Valley; the goal of the Confederate player is to drive the Federals out.<br/><br/>Stonewall in the Valley is easy to learn and several scenarios can be played to completion in an hour. The game contains three beautiful hand-painted maps, which are based on original Civil War period maps of the Shenandoah Valley. All topographical features affecting military operations are portrayed, including roads, pikes, trails, railroads, villages, mountains, and waterways. In the game, players control Union and Confederate military units in turns repr esenting one day of real time, The game's interactive game system assures that each scenario will be unpredictable, exciting, and competitive. An extensive historical article detailing the day-to-day activities of the real campaign is included.<br/><br/>You do not need to own any of the three earlier volumes of the series (Stonewall Jackson's Way, Here Come the Rebels!, and Roads to Gettysburg) to play Stonewall in the Valley. However, owners of those games can link their maps to the Stonewall in the Valley maps to portray virtually the entire eastern theater of the Civil War.<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/>2 260-piece Counter Sheets <br/>3 22&quot; x 32&quot; Map Sheets <br/>1 Rules Booklet <br/>2 Charts and Tables Cards<br/>1 Display Card <br/>1 Ammunition Pad <br/>2 6-sided Dice <br/>1 Counter Tray<br/><br/>Time Scale: One day per turn<br/>Map Scale: One mile per hex <br/>Unit Scale: Brigades and regiments (with district leaders)<br/>Players:  One, two, or teams<br/>Playing Time: One hour for introductory scenarios, 2 to 14 hours for other scenarios<br/><br/>",

Unable to determine who amongst themselves are werewolves, they've called in a group of master inquisitors to help sort out this mess before it's too late. That's where you and your team come in. No stranger to werewolf infestations, you know that the best thing to do is to start lynching suspects.<br/><br/>You no sooner get started on this project when you discover that there's a problem &ndash; Werewolves have also infiltrated your team of inquisitors! Now you're in a serious pickle: You need to save the village while thwarting the werewolves whom are working alongside you...<br/><br/>Ultimate Werewolf: Inquisition is a standalone game of deduction, secrets and betrayal with no elimination. Part of the fun is figuring out who the werewolves are on your team, but even then, you've still got to outsmart them!<br/><br/>More specifically, the humans need to rid the town of werewolves in order to win, while the werewolf players need to eliminate human villagers so that the werewolves can overrun the town. To do this, each round players either use the power of a villager's hut or take two votes from the supply. Each player then places one vote on a resident, and the resident with the most votes against him is lynched, with him and his hut being taken out of play. The werewolf players then secretly choose to kill a resident &ndash; but only one of those chosen by the Grand Inquisitor, a role that passes hands each round. Who will live? Who will die? It's in your hands...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The world struggles in the Cold War, and many see the sky as the next battlefield. The era of Space Race has just begun. Do you have what it takes to lead a daring space agency into a new age of human achievement?<br/><br/>Space Race takes place during the first seven decades of the space conquest, and players become directors of newly established Space Agencies. Their goal is to expand them and to achieve astonishing breakthroughs. During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.<br/><br/>Space Race is a card game based on finding synergies and constructing powerful combinations out of different abilities. There is no guaranteed winning strategy: players have to respond to an ever changing environment in order to identify the best course of development while competing with their opponents for the most interesting discoveries.<br/><br/>The game is played in seven rounds. In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.<br/><br/>Space Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe. As there are only 3 Control Cards of each of the 4 types and no Control Card can be used more than once, players have to combine different types of cards and abilities to be successful during the 7 rounds of the game.<br/><br/>",

You must explore the twisting paths and waterways, leading your expedition from one village to another. Each village offers an opportunity to establish a new outpost. But beware &ndash; the Amazonas is not for the timid! Fearsome crocodiles lurk in the tepid waters of the rivers, and hungry jaguars stalk the twilight paths. Do not shy from such dangers too long, for the cost to build a new outpost increases the longer it takes you to reach each new village. Your funds are very limited, so speed is essential. Your sponsor has also sent you a secret directive. You must fulfill the demands of this special mission, or you will lose much of your newly earned fame!

        "description": "18Ireland is a member of the 18xx family of games, set in Ireland.<br/><br/>From the rule book:<br/>18Ireland represents a rather different take on the 18xx system. Ireland was a poor country, but there is no lack of enthusiasm for railways among investors. Up to 13 5-share companies will start in a random sequence. Some of these companies will become successful, others, as a result of underinvestment, isolation or poor timing will struggle to survive. All is not lost for the strugglers, however. A unique shareholder voting mechanism allows companies to merge into 10-share companies(sometimes against their director&rsquo;s wishes) with their more or less successful neighbours.<br/>Track laying provides its own problems as many track tiles are unique. Often, there is no available tile to provide the most efficient route so a roundabout route sometimes must suffice. There are two types of track that can be built: broad gauge and narrow gauge. There are no purchasable narrow gauge locomotives; instead narrow gauge track operates in an abstract way and boosts the value of the broad gauge stations to which it connects.  <br/>Trains in 18Ireland are hex trains. They become obsolete in two stages: rusted trains may be bought back from the bank at half price (but also half capability) and continue to operate until they rot and are then removed. As the game progresses the train rush becomes brutal. Player bankruptcy does not end the game and survivors continue until they have broken a bank that starts with just &pound;4,000.<br/>18Ireland can be played by 3 to 6 players. Experience has shown that at a low player count, this is a &ldquo;run good companies&rdquo; game. At a higher player count, the game is more combative as share portfolios are more diverse and the hostile merger becomes a bigger factor in the game. By choosing the player count, players can select the style of 18xx game that they prefer.<br/><br/>",

The rest of the Nations of Europe (and northern Africa) are represented by 'independent' client states who are to be &quot;taken under the wing&quot; to win the game.<br/><br/>Many of the events refer to (historical) crises which could have started a World War. Each of these events will increase the Tension between the European Nations and cause a Crisis roll, a roll modified by both the current Tension and the amount of Alliances that have been made by the major powers of Europe. Eventually, unless Tension is managed carefully, such a Crisis roll will spark the Outbreak of the Great War, ending the game after resolution of the war and a final Scoring.<br/><br/>Will the strongly Authoritarian Empires of Central Europe hold out against rising Liberalism? Will the Workers combine forces with land-hungry Farmers and marginalized Intelligentsia to oust the ruling Bourgeois, Nobility and Monarchy?

        "description": "Snowblind is a press-your-luck and risk-management dice game in which 1-4 players take control of a polar expedition, racing to be the first to return from the South Pole.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect the most prestige points. The further you advance your flag, and the more men who survive the Antarctic winter at the end of the game, the more prestige your expedition receives. This requires careful management of crates, food and camps: without supplies, your explorers will not survive.<br/><br/>Play proceeds over a series of rounds. Within each round, players may make as many moves as they like, from those available, with each additional move becoming increasingly dangerous. In more detail, each turn, players may take an action (which involves taking a risk die from the action board, adding the die to their dice pool, then taking a corresponding action), or they choose to pass. Actions include moving explorers and crates, hunting for food, collecting research, and building camps. After completing an action, the active player rolls all the dice in their dice pool. High numbers result in exposure, the loss of supplies (crates and food), explorers being incapacitated, and even death. Exposure results can be offset by explorers remaining together (company) and the building of camps.<br/><br/>A round ends when all players have passed. At the end of the round, a weather card is drawn that may cause additional attrition, then the next round begins. When the pack ice card is drawn from the weather deck, one last round is played and the game ends.<br/><br/>",

In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.<br/><br/>If, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare &quot;Zero!&quot; and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.<br/><br/>After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!<br/><br/>",

In each round, players can perform two actions from this list: draw recipe/wine cards, buy ingredients, buy rooms, take a &quot;personal touch&quot; cube, buy a bonus card, or buy a cooking training course. Special events during the game include VIP visits, culinary reviewer visits and the final National Cooking Contest, in which players will compete with their best recipes.<br/><br/>To achieve victory, players can follow an economic strategy &ndash; focusing on a menu which provides a strong revenue &ndash; or a quality strategy, in which the restaurant features special recipes matched to unique wines. Both strategies can lead to victory, and a balanced strategy can also be a good idea.<br/><br/>Ristorante Italia, scheduled for release in October 2011, can be played in two versions: Recipes for Novice Cooks (lighter version) and Recipes for Great Chefs (complete version).<br/><br/>",

So you will find previous strategies may no longer be effective or possible.<br/><br/>In Key Market, each player controls an extended family of workers.  Over the course of two years, players will organize their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.<br/><br/>After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favors sought and acquired.

The seat of power is vacant and waiting for you to take it &mdash; unless someone else takes it first.<br/><br/>In Complots, as in the original game Coup, you control two characters and start with two coins, and through trickery, manipulation and bluffing, you want to eliminate all other players who stand in your way, possibly by having them eliminate one another along the way.<br/><br/>The 24-card deck includes four copies of six different characters, each with a unique set of powers:<br/><br/><br/>     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.<br/>     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.<br/>     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.<br/>     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.<br/>     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.<br/>     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters, or force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice). If you wish, you may then force them to draw a new card from the deck. They then shuffle the old card into the deck. Block someone from stealing coins from you.<br/><br/><br/>(Either the Ambassador or the Inquisitor can be used in a game, not both.)<br/><br/>On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.<br/>     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.<br/>     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an character. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)<br/><br/><br/>When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses a character of their own, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.<br/><br/>The last player to still have a face-down character wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Players then start shaking the igloos to find one that matches the number of beads shown on a card.  When a match is found, the player marks that igloo with a colored chip and places it on the card with the same number.  If the guess is correct, that player receives the card (worth points) as a reward.  If the guess is incorrect, that player loses the chip used to mark the igloo.  The game is finished when one player has no chips left, or when all of the cards have been claimed!<br/><br/>Although the appearance of Igloo Pop is quite silly, it takes a steady hand and well-trained ear to be able to determine how many beads are inside an igloo.  The sound and vibration when shaking each igloo is slightly different, allowing skilled players to judge the contents quickly and accurately.  Also, a risk/reward system is introduced in the cards: cards with several numbers are easier to guess, but are worth less points; cards with a single number are often difficult to guess exactly, but are worth more points.<br/><br/>Background story, from the back of the box:<br/>The young ice giant has a big problem: he wants to buy fish sticks, but he cannot remember how many and he has nine shopping lists in his basket.<br/><br/>So he goes from igloo to igloo and shakes each. In each he listens to the delicious fish sticks bouncing off the igloo walls. When he thinks that the igloo in his hand has the same number of fish sticks as one of his shopping lists, he takes it home.<br/><br/>When he gets home, there are no fish sticks in the igloo. Instead, wild and laughing Inuit children tumble out of the igloo. Excitedly they shout, &quot;Shake us again!&quot; &quot;That was great fun!&quot; &quot;This is super&quot;, thinks the young ice giant. &quot;Now, I have found some new friends to play with!&quot; And, he promptly forgets all about his shopping lists.<br/><br/>",

But who will join them in the imminent struggle to become the next galactic superpower?<br/><br/>In Empires of the Void, two to four players compete to expand their empire in a vast, diverse galaxy.  Each time a player reaches a new planet, he must decide whether to conquer it and strip the land of its resources, or befriend the natives and obtain their special ability.  With 7 starting alien races to choose from, and 15 more to conquer or befriend on a variable board, no two games will be the same.<br/><br/>The game uses an action point system and exciting dice-rolling combat with plenty of tactical decision making. There are 19 technologies to research that break the rules and change gameplay. Players must use negotiation and trade, even when it is not their turn, which ensures that there is very little downtime. A random event deck helps build the story of the game, as each round something new happens, usually galaxy-wide. A game lasts around 2 to 3 hours and has intuitive rules which are easy to teach.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shiver Me Timbers is a highly thematic, strategic sandbox game set in the Golden Age of Piracy. The game is heavily Euro-inspired: It uses a tactical card-based combat system and takes lots of strategic planning to use your available actions to optimal effect and become the most notorious pirate of your era.<br/><br/>Each playing will vary as you randomly reveal five of ten vastly different victory conditions: One game, you'll be rescuing your lost family, the next you might have to conquer enemy ships and fortresses or face the hideous Kraken.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses two of the revealed conditions as their personal goals. After all players have chosen, they set-up the fully modular board, each of them trying to find a constellation that optimally supports their hidden agenda. Then they outfit their modable ship miniatures, select their starting abilities and equipment and set sails to fight, conquer, trade, loot, hunt for treasure and much more.<br/><br/>During play, every achievement is rewarded with victory points. The game continues until all five victory conditions have been met. There's a final scoring in which players collect extra points if they managed to achieve the goals they chose, and highest point total wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In the game of CODA players try to crack each other's &quot;code&quot; - a sequence of secret numbers.  Guess an opponent's secret number and it is revealed (by knocking it down).  Guess incorrectly and you must reveal one of your own secret numbers!  On each turn, a new number enters play, which helps you to narrow the possibilities and grow your own code.  Common sense, intuition and your &quot;detective&quot; skills will guide you to success.<br/><br/>From me:<br/><br/>There are two sets of tiles (similar to Stratego pieces without the soldiers) numbered 0-11.  One set is black, one is white.  In four player game, everyone one grabs three random pieces and arranges them in numeric order, with white pieces going to the right on ties.  In order a player grabs one of the remaining tiles and guesses on of the opponents pieces.  If correct, that piece is revealed. If the player is incorrect the piece that was just drawn is placed in the correct place in his own sequence and revealed.  If the player was correct in guessing he MAY make another guess.  If he chooses not to then he places the picked piece in his code, in sequence, but does not reveal it.<br/><br/>Play continues until only one person has a piece standing.  When the new tiles run out, just keep going without drawing tiles.<br/><br/>Belongs to a series / trilogy, containing:<br/><br/>    Bernini Mysterie<br/>    Da Vinci Code<br/>    Salomon's Dilemma<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Fort Sumter is a two-player Card Driven Game (CDG) portraying the 1860 secession crisis that led to the bombardment of Fort Sumter and the American Civil War. Fort Sumter is a small footprint game (11x17&rdquo; mounted map) that takes approximately 25-40 minutes to play. The game pits a Unionist versus a Secessionist player. Each player uses the area control mechanic pioneered in Mark Herman's We The People design and immortalized in Twilight Struggle to place, move, and remove political capital. The location of political capital determines who controls each of the four crisis dimensions (Political, Secession, Public Opinion, and Armaments). After three rounds of play, the game culminates in a Final Crisis confrontation to determine the winner.<br/><br/>The heart of the Fort Sumter design is Mark's CDG system where you use Strategy cards for their value or historic event to acquire political capital from the crisis track. Political capital tokens are used to compete for control of the twelve map spaces. Here the likes of William Lloyd Garrison, Sam Houston, Jefferson Davis, and Harriet Beecher Stowe walk on stage, while the Southern states dissolve the Union.<br/><br/>The twelve map spaces are grouped into the four dimensions of the crisis. You gain a victory point each round that you control a dimension&rsquo;s three spaces. For example, the Armaments dimension is characterized by Federal Arsenals, Fort Pickens, and of course, Fort Sumter. In addition, each round you score a victory point for controlling your secret objective space. But beware; either player can score active objective spaces. At the end of the dual Presidential inaugurations (round three) a new Final Crisis mechanic drives the game to its hotly contested conclusion.<br/><br/>Utilizing a new Final Crisis Series mechanic, you may accelerate the crisis by breaching zones (escalation, tension, final crisis) that yield bonus political capital. However, beware, as the first person to breach the final crisis zone gains political advantage, yet loses victory point ground. Each game ends with a Final Crisis, where cards set-aside during the three rounds complete your final political maneuvers that determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Nuggets (2003), players try to surround the &quot;gold mines&quot; (numbered cylinders) on an 8x5 grid board. On a turn, a player either places a numbered tile face down or places two fence sections on the board; these fences determine the borders of each claim, and each claim must be at least four spaces large. At the end of the game, all tiles are revealed, and each gold mine is awarded to the player whose tiles in that claim have the largest sum, with ties resulting in an equal division of points. Whoever collects the most mine points wins.<br/><br/>Armad&ouml;ra (2013) uses the same gameplay as Nuggets for the base game, albeit with the players themed as orcs, elves, mages, and goblins on the hunt for dwarven gold. Armod&ouml;ra also adds advanced rules to the game, with each player receiving one reinforcement token and 1-2 special power tokens. Instead of placing a warrior or erecting palisades (fences), a player can place a reinforcement token on one of their warriors in a territory that's already filled, boosting the strength of that warrior by one. A player can use their special power before taking one of the three normal actions, with the elf shooting an opposing warrior in an unfilled territory (lowering his strength by one), the orc placing an additional palisade that turn, the goblin placing a second warrior (with this one being face-up), and the mage looking at the value of an already placed opponent's warrior.<br/><br/>Pearlad&ouml;ra (2022) moves the gameplay to the water, with players now placing two pontoons or one diver on a turn in order to fence off parts of the sea, then use the strength of your divers to claim pearls. This version of the design includes the advanced rules, with slight tweaks to the previous powers from Armad&ouml;ra.<br/><br/>",

You should be alert in this game stretched to wrenching choices.. Rebuild Carcassonne: one card at a time!<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of rounds, with a number of cards per round, both based on the number of players - in a way that you get through the entire deck of cards.<br/><br/>In each turn you either play your only meeple to the end of a row of cards to claim them, or play a card to a row matching the colour on the card. The first card played each round must be face down and does not have to follow suit. When all cards and meeples have been played for the round points are awarded for cards claimed.<br/><br/>The different types of cards score in different ways:<br/>People cards - add up their printed values and multiply with the number of people cards. Then remove cards from game.<br/>Animal cards - compare the number of animals to the reference card for points. Keep cards in front of you. Animals of the same type claimed in previous rounds are also counted.<br/>Building cards - are placed facedown under the chest token until the end of the game. Points are awarded for sets of colours.<br/>Colour-mismatched cards can be discarded for 10 points each or add to a collection of animals/buildings.<br/>Dragon/fairy cards - score 10 points each and are removed from game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description of the game play from co-designer Michail Antonow:<br/><br/>The board shows the Caribbean in the 18th century. Six pirate ships lie in wait on sea, ready to pillage the rich ports or to rob the booty from other ships.<br/><br/>The sea is divided into spaces. Each player is in possession of three safe havens, marked in his color on the board. If only two or three players are playing, the safe havens in the vacant color(s) are treated as normal sea spaces.<br/><br/>The aim of each player is to lure the pirates to deliver treasure crates to one of their own safe havens, and not to the safe havens of the opponents.<br/><br/>The pirate ships do not belong to any player. That is why the players must bribe the pirates each time they want a pirate ship to act on their behalf. And what is the greatest temptation for a Caribbean pirate? Rum of course, barrels full of rum!<br/><br/>In every round the players try anew their best to bribe the pirates. The player who has offered the most rum to a ship gets to move that ship as many spaces as the number of barrels shown on the bribing chip. An active ship can (a) rob a crate from a port or from another ship, (b) reach a crate over to another ship, (c) swap crates with another ship, and/or (d) deliver a crate into a safe haven.<br/><br/>The aim is to have the most doubloons at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege,18-27 Dec '44,  is the thirteenth game is the Standard Combat Series.  This game covers the defense of the little crossroads town of Bastogne from 18 December to 26 December 1944. It is not a game about the whole Ardennes Offensive, but rather a close-up look at the actual perimeter battle to protect the town and the mechanized delaying actions leading into it. The map only extends as far east as Longvilly and north to Noville at 400m per hex. Each turn is a day, units are generally companies.<br/><br/>Bastogne comes with special rules for road marching, Team SNAFU, barrages, and air strikes - but is built around a quick-to-play, simple-to-learn framework. Bastogne has three scenarios: an introductory scenario covering the Battle for Noville, a medium-sized one covering the Battle for Longvilly, and the withdrawal of Team Cherry plus the counterattack by the 501st Airborne Regiment, and the campaign game itself covering the whole action in a jam-packed 10 turns. A number of variants have been provided so you can experience the game over and over looking at fresh insights.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: One day<br/>Hex: 400 meters<br/>Units: Platoon to Battalion<br/><br/>Players: 2 (suitable for solitaire play)<br/>Playing Time: 4+ hours<br/>Complexity: Low<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Barbarossa is set in a fictional Second World War setting in which cute German military girls rush against Moscow to defeat the evil magician Stalin.<br/><br/>The game uses the in-game deck-building mechanism from Dominion &ndash; that is, each player starts with a small deck of resource cards and during the course of the game one buys cards from an open card pool to build a deck of cards to play with. Goal of the game is to conquer Moscow. If Moscow falls the player with the most victory points wins. Victory points are acquired by conquering different cities and/or strategical positions during the game. Every time you attack a city, event cards from an event deck are drawn (e.g. General &quot;Winter&quot;). Barbarossa uses six different kinds of cards:<br/><br/><br/>    Supply Cards: These provide points to buy other cards from the open card pool. <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Unit Cards: The use of these cards require &quot;Operation Points&quot; (Each turn you start with one Operation Point) and deliver the military strength to attack cities or strategic positions (or in other words gain victory point cards).<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Operation Cards: They give you a one time bonus in different forms. After use they are not just discarded but put out of play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Deploy Cards: They stay in the players play area and deliver bonuses in different forms every turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Target Cards: The cities and strategic positions which deliver VPs, also if you conquered strategic positions it becomes easier to attack cities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Event Cards: If you attack the Target cards an event is drawn and stuff happens.<br/><br/><br/>Like all of Arclight's deck construction games, the illustrations are provided by famous Japanese fanzine artists.<br/><br/>Integrates with<br/><br/>    El Alamein<br/><br/><br/>",

However, players can really only win if they make as many valuable card combinations as possible.<br/><br/>Players have a choice: to be finished and make &quot;Mhing&quot; quickly -- or to form rare and valuable combinations, which are worth hundreds of points instead of just a few. Lots of possibilities make the game entertaining and always exciting.<br/><br/>Mhing is a beautiful, elegant game -- a classical game. So simple that one can play it after few minutes; in addition, so varied and exciting that it can be enjoyed for years on end.<br/><br/>Mhing has a deck of 150 cards: 108 suit cards, 28 Honour cards, 8 Flower Cards and 6 Wild Cards. It is designed for 2-6 players ages 10 and up.<br/><br/>Unlike Mah Jong, Mhing scales well from 2 to 6 players.<br/><br/>",

Building on his first real time card game, Falling, which was multi-player with a dealer, he created Brawl, a two-player card game with no dealer.<br/><br/>Summary: Brawl is a lightning-fast combat game where two players burn through their 35-card decks in about 35 seconds. Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.<br/><br/>Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &quot;base&quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.<br/><br/>",

Each hero has variable melee, magic and speed scores, as well as a unique ability. Your second role in the game is as the malevolent &ldquo;Dungeonlord&rdquo;, trying to exterminate the other heroes.<br/><br/>You win the game when as a hero you complete 3 Quests such as destroying an evil laboratory or rescuing a princess. An alternate win goal is as the Dungeonlord if all the other heroes are defeated except yours.<br/><br/>Vault of the Fiends features a variety of new heroes.  Elf Assassin, Human Beastmaster, Drakan Sentinal, Ork Shaman, Dwarf Runecaster, and Gnome Illusionist.<br/><br/>Each turn you may:<br/><br/>     Play monsters, traps and other bad events on opponents<br/>     Build a dungeon<br/>     Move around the dungeon with your hero (collect Glory and Peril resources)<br/>     Play abilities and treasures for yourself<br/>     Complete a Quest<br/>     Discard an unwanted card<br/>     Fill your hand to 5 cards<br/><br/><br/>This game is similar to Wiz-War where you race in a dungeon to complete your objectives.  This dungeon is created by the laying down of Map cards. You collect Glory and Peril as you move through the dungeon.  Glory buys cards that help your hero such as abilities and treasures, but your opponent spends your Peril against you to play monsters, traps and other unpleasant stuff.<br/><br/>Combat is similar to Talisman. Roll a six-sided die and add the score you are combating with, either Melee or Magic, to beat your opponent&rsquo;s roll.<br/><br/>The way the cards interact will be familiar to CCG players, in that you have &ldquo;Permanents&rdquo; and &ldquo;Instants&rdquo; that you can use strategically, or in combinations, but this game is not really a strategy game.  Most of the fun comes from the theme, and surprising combination of events that occur.  Dungeoneer is likely to appeal to those who enjoy a classic dungeon crawl and RPG like action.<br/><br/>Vault of the Fiends features a few new mechanics that should serve to enhance the game play which players of Tomb of the Lich Lord will be familiar with.  Some monsters, and attack cards are &ldquo;pumpable&rdquo; that means you may spend extra Glory or Peril to boost the effectiveness of the card.  Also conditions on the map change such as effects being deactivated when a certain Quest is completed or throwing a switch in a room to extend a bridge across the Fiery Chasm.  One of the more unexpected new mechanics are &ldquo;artifact&rdquo; Quests, such as the Armor Golem&rsquo;s Glove which makes your hero more powerful or the Sunken Treasure which makes your hero faster.  These do not confer a level, but are rotated 180 degrees so you can read the bonus they provide.<br/><br/>Part of the Dungeoneer Series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>Reluctant Enemies: Operation Exporter: The Commonwealth Invasion of Lebanon and Syria, 1941, is small game meant to serve as an accessible introduction to the Operational Combat System (&ldquo;OCS&rdquo;).  It is one map, with 60 or so combat units (both players) in action at any given time.  This allows for a pace of play not possible with the previously published OCS monster games. Regardless of the reduction in scale it remains an OCS game with all features relevant to the system.  In this game there can be wide open, swirling, DAK-like battles in the desert (with some: limited armor forces), river lines to break, and very rough, mountainous terrain to contend with. The British have the possibility of an amphibious invasion.  Naval shore bombardments, by both sides, can be important in the early part of the campaign. There is a small but significant air campaign.  As always in the OCS, supply constraints make each player feel he may be on the edge of disaster.<br/><br/>This campaign remains a footnote in WWII history even among many knowledgeable enthusiasts.  However, given the nature of events in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations during the first half of 1941, this campaign was arguably the hot spot in the world at that moment in time.[...]<br/><br/>The Vichy were well equipped and organized. They put up stiff opposition, and counterattacked with great effect. The Commonwealth and Free French forces, at first, were stopped cold. Ironically, it was the failure of Operation Battleaxe (June 15) in the Western desert that allowed reinforcements for this campaign from the Western Desert and a resumption of the Commonwealth offensive. After Damascus fell, Beirut was seriously threatened and with Indian 10th division troops (along with Habforce) moving on Aleppo and Homs to the North, the Vichy proposed an armistice to end the fighting.<br/><br/>The armistice was signed on July 14. However, this result was far from certain.

        "description": "In Antidote, you are a laboratory scientist working for a giant chemical research conglomerate. When a deadly toxin suddenly infects you and everyone in your lab, you must work quickly to share your research and discover the Antidote before it's too late.<br/><br/>In the game, players take turns deciding what action all other players take: either discard from their hand or trade research with other players. Eventually all your cards will run-out and you will be left with just one that you must &quot;drink&quot; and hope it's the Antidote. If this card is the true Antidote, you're cured and live to play again! If not... you die, but you can always try again!<br/><br/>Antidote has 6 core elements:<br/><br/><br/>     Deduction: Players &quot;live&quot; or &quot;die&quot; by deducing the one card type that has been removed from the game (similar to Clue). <br/>     Semi-Cooperative Gameplay: You live or die alone, but it may be impossible to deduce the Antidote without working with the other players. <br/>     Simultaneous action selection: Every turn involves every player. Whether it is making trades for valuable information or simultaneously declassifying your research, all players are constantly engaged. This makes the game experience more fulfilling and eliminates long-periods of &quot;down-time&quot; between turns.<br/>     Player-controlled game length: Players have sole control over the pace of the game. If you think you know the answer you can speed the game towards its conclusion. If not...well, don't hold your breath! No one is going to wait for you to figure it out! This element adds a feeling of tension and excitement.<br/>     Multiple levels of player interaction: Even a &quot;wink&quot; or a &quot;nod&quot; can have meaning in this game if you are trying to learn or pass information between players. At the same time, a blatant statement such as &quot;Blue formulas are toxic&quot; may have no meaning at all, but everyone will judge you by your actions (everyone can see the cards you choose to discard). <br/>     Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty what the Antidote is by the end of the game. This means the revealing of the Antidote is often a surprise.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Cost is a challenging economic board game that places players in the role of a company whose interest is in the asbestos industry around the world. Players compete to make their fortune by concentrating or diversifying in the various aspects of the industry such as mining, refining, and shipping. Whoever ends the game with the most money wins.<br/><br/>The game is played over four rounds, but it might end early due to health and safety regulations that shut down the industry by eliminating all areas in which they can act. In each round, players begin their turns by selecting a country in which to execute their actions. This selection triggers an event within it, in addition to having an effect on its economy.<br/><br/>Players then use a unique system to draft three actions at once for the round. These actions can be a mix of building mines, building refineries, gaining government subsidies, establishing railroads, and establishing ports. Once all players have executed their actions, they may convert their money (i.e., victory points) into specific country resources, with each country having its own conversion rate.<br/><br/>A player's industry then goes into motion with mines producing raw asbestos, refineries refining that asbestos, and railroads and ports transporting these goods around the world. Players may also have a chance to invest in their own companies to gain an edge. When players mine or refine asbestos, they must choose to either maximize profits for short-term gains or sacrifice their hard-won money to minimize deaths, thus sustaining the industry.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 982, a Viking jarl called Erik the Red sailed from the western coast of Iceland and discovered a new land. He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries.<br/><br/>Take the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong.<br/><br/>At first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game &ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction.<br/><br/>The main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile &ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources.<br/><br/>A tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile.<br/><br/>If you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially &ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? <br/>The game mechanics &ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead. As the others take it in to account when searching for partners for their deals.<br/><br/>",

At the start of each round, they roll these dice under a cup, then look at the results without telling anyone else what's there. The dice show the numbers 1-5 and a star, with a star representing all five of those numbers as well as a star. The start player for the round then makes a public bid as to what they think is showing under all players' dice cups, e.g., &quot;eight 1s&quot;, &quot;twelve 4s&quot;, or &quot;four stars&quot;. The next player in clockwise order must raise the bid (following certain rules laid out on the game board), or call the previous person because they don't think the dice under the cups support that bid.<br/><br/>Everyone then raises their cups and the result is revealed, with the last bidder or the caller losing dice based on the outcome. If you run out of dice, you're out of the game, and the last player who has dice wins.<br/><br/>Bluff Jubil&auml;umsausgabe follows the familiar gameplay of Bluff, but this 25th anniversary edition replaces six of the yellow dice with six orange dice, with each player starting with one orange die. This die counts double when determining the results of a bid, providing an extra challenge for those already familiar with the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Statis Pro baseball game includes individual pitcher and batter cards for an entire baseball season. A full 9-inning game generally takes 30 minutes or less to complete.<br/><br/>Begin by choosing teams, pitchers, and line-ups. In order to simulate a real season, each player card indicates which positions a player is allowed to play, and for how many games that player played at each position during a full season.<br/><br/>Each at-bat is simulated the same way. First, a Fast Action Card (FAC) is drawn to determine a PB number which is then compared to the PB rating on the pitcher's card; this determines if the pitcher&rsquo;s card or the batter&rsquo;s card is &quot;in control&quot;. Then a new FAC is drawn to generate a random number to determine the result from the player's card who was &quot;in control&quot;. Each of the 98 FAC has four results&mdash;two per side, one right-side up, one upside-down and also features special PB results to simulate clutch batting, clutch fielding, unusual plays (e.g. dropped third strike, ejections, etc.), and injuries.<br/><br/>If an out is made, an out chart appropriate to the runner situation (e.g. Bases Empty, Runner on Second, etc.) is consulted to determine the outcome by drawing an additional FAC (or two, if the out result has a chance of error to be checked).<br/><br/>Charts on the playing board support managerial choices such as sacrifice bunts, hit and runs, stolen base attempts, etc. For these, no PB number is determined; simply consult the FAC&rsquo;s random number and follow the chart&rsquo;s instructions which usually involves consulting players ratings appropriately (e.g. base runner&rsquo;s stolen base rating, catcher&rsquo;s throwing ability, etc.).<br/><br/>Production of the game was halted after the 1992 baseball season on account of a royalties dispute between Avalon Hill and MLB. While the Avalon Hill Statis Pro Baseball game is no longer in production, it is possible to make your own player cards using the Statis Pro Baseball card formulas provided with the game. Moreover, PDFs of fan-made seasons and teams can be found online either free or for purchase.<br/><br/>",

Who will take over the Infinite City?<br/><br/>Will you place the capital next to the port, claiming both as your own? Will you use the transit station to move another player&rsquo;s military base out of the way, or place your embassy to steal his temple? Will you try for a greater area under your control, or move to capture key buildings?<br/><br/>Infinite City is a standalone tile game in which players become the leaders of corporations building an ever-sprawling city, maneuvering to control the largest districts while holding on to the most valuable buildings.<br/><br/>Infinite City uses tiles to represent buildings, and colored pegs to represent control by players.  The tiles are mixed, five tiles are dealt to each player, and five tiles are placed face down in the shape of a cross at the center of the play area.  On their turns, players play a tile face up adjacent to one of the five starting tiles or a previously played tile, play one of their colored pegs on the tile, and follow the instructions on the tile.  These instructions may lead to playing additional tiles, drawing tiles, moving tiles previously played, turning face down tiles face up, taking tiles from opponents, preventing actions or even exchanging hands of tiles with other players.  When players finish their turns, if they have less than five tiles in their hands, they draw additional tiles so that they end their turn with at least five tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player places the last of his colored pegs, or the fifth Power Station tile is played.  Each player is awarded points for contiguous groups of at least three tiles controlled by him at a rate of one point per tile.  Some tiles have a point value number in the corner; players receive the number of points indicated for such tiles that they control.  Also, some tiles have silver rings; the player controlling the most of these receives one point per such tile.<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Gambit 7 has been separated from Wits & Wagers based on game rule differences and at the request of the designer and publisher. <br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Gambit 7 is a new kind of trivia game - you don't need to know the answer to win! In Gambit 7, all players simultaneously write their answer to the same question and place it face-up on the Betting Board. All questions have a numerical answer, so even players that don't know the subject matter at hand can make a guess!<br/><br/>Players then have a limited time to either bet on themselves or bet on another player's answers. The winning answer is the one that is closest to being correct, but no higher! Players earn points for either getting the winning answer or for betting on the player who does. The one with the most points after 7 rounds of questions is the winner!<br/><br/>Gambit categories include: Business &amp; Economy; Art &amp; Literature; Geography &amp; Nature; History &amp; Government; Pop Culture; Science; Sports &amp; Leisure; and Wild Card. The set of questions in Gambit 7 were designed to be culturally appropriate for each specific language version.<br/><br/>While Gambit 7 can be played with as few as 3 players, the more friends and family you gather, the more fun and excitement you will experience! With more than 7 players, simply split into teams of 2 or 3 and work together to answer the questions and decide how to bet.<br/><br/>A german mini edition was published in 2008 for promotional use under the name &quot;Gambit 7 Das mini Spiel&quot;. It contains 7 cards and a ruleset printed on a seperate card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "China experienced the greatest economic expansion in its history during the Ming dynasty (1368&ndash;1644). The silver trade between the Americas and Europe and onward to China had a profound effect on the world economy &ndash; it may be considered the beginning of a global economy.<br/><br/>In China, social mobility led to the growing of cities, especially in the lower Yangtze area, which was at that time responsible for the main production of wheat for the whole country. In addition to wheat and rice, other crops like tea, fruits, and sugarcane were grown on a large scale. Immigrating peasants changed their profession to become merchants and artisans. Many people from the countryside were employed in private or state run factories, producing commodities like paper, porcelain, refined sugar, or silk textiles.<br/><br/>Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy and was aided by the construction of canals, roads, and bridges by the Ming government. Ming China saw the rise of several merchant clans, who owned large amounts of wealth.<br/><br/>In Yinzi &mdash; &quot;y&iacute;nzi&quot; meaning &quot;silver&quot; &mdash; the players represent merchant clans developing parts of China in the late Ming period in the early 17th century along the last 200 km of the Yangtze river before it reaches the China Sea.<br/><br/>The players plant crops, sell goods to the rural or urban markets, develop raw materials, build and upgrade factories, and sell their goods to ships already waiting in the port. In order to reach the port, the players need to improve their river transport capabilities along the Yangtze.<br/><br/>",

Invoke minor creatures to flip over a tile or push a row, creating the correct patterns to summon more and more powerful ones.  Eventually, you'll build a horde of Servitors who can chain flips, pushes, and switches together; rearranging the entire grid to your whims.  Change the skies, summon a Great Old One, and win!  The game is won by acquiring 10 points first, which can be done by summoning many small creatures or going for Great Old Ones.  Creatures which give more points tend to require more complex constellations.  The night sky is represented by a 5x5 field of objects.  It can be manipulated by moving a row by one object (cycling through), flipping one object (both sides have different objects), and switching two neighboring objects. <br/><br/><br/>The game was released in German in October of 2008. Steve Jackson Games released the English version in August of 2009. <br/><br/><br/>",

The dice in the game represent the customers, with hex tiles representing the rides in your park. Employing a unique &ldquo;Dice-cascade&rdquo; mechanic once a customer has enjoyed a ride, their dice value is reduced, but they can still continue to enjoy more rides in the theme park until their value drops to 0 where they exit. This means the more efficiently you can move your dice around to activate the most rewarding rides, the more points and money you receive!<br/><br/>Dice Theme Park also features a card based turn initiative mechanic, decided by your special action role cards (with values 1-6), with players selecting two cards each turn. The lowest total will gain first choice of the customer dice draft and ride tiles that round. At the end of the round those cards will then be passed to the player on your left.<br/><br/>Dice Theme Park is more interactive and slightly more complex than Dice Hospital, so it&rsquo;s perfect for those looking for a more challenging experience with more ways to score and play, whilst still keeping that same engaging and satisfying feel every time it is played.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players add holy or unholy points on the souls in play based on how they use temptation, virtue, sin, intercession, holy relic, unholy relic, angel and devil cards. Earn enough holy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to heaven, earning the side of good victory points; earn enough unholy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to hell, earning the side of evil victory points. If a soul does not earn enough holy or unholy points and is reaped, it goes to purgatory where its victory points are not counted.<br/><br/>Guiding a soul to complete purity or complete darkness before death and final judgment adds a new archangel or prince of hell to a player's arsenal. Influence on souls can be spent for more powerful cards that have special abilities, and allow a player to gain souls more quickly.<br/><br/>Many strategic decisions impact play. Strategies include focusing on gaining more help from heaven or hell to increase your power, working to reap souls quickly from the start with little intervention from the angelic and demonic hordes, or balancing your play to ensure victory.<br/><br/>Sin, Intercession, and Relic cards can be purchased for beneficial effects at the cost of holy and unholy points. These help to make for deep gameplay and excellent risk-reward scenarios. Invest in these cards to strengthen your position.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "P'achakuna takes you on a journey in the heart of the Andes together with your most loyal friend &mdash; your llama. The game includes both black and white llamas, with you controlling one color and your opponent the other. White llamas move only through the green valleys, while black llamas scale the barren mountains. Whatever the color, however, you want to visit mountain villages to deliver the dye that they desire, ideally collecting dye for yourself along the way.<br/><br/>In P'achakuna, each player starts with one llama of their color in the center of the board in the white village, with a white dye loaded on its back. The board is composed of hexagonal tiles that are either half valley/half mountain, two-thirds valley/one-third mountain, or vice versa. The tiles are extremely thick so that you can grab the mountain section of the tile and pluck it from the board. Six villages sit on the perimeter of the game board, each corresponding to one of the primary or secondary colors. Each village has a random demand tile in it that shows two colors, one in high demand and one in low demand; neither of these colors can match the color of the village.<br/><br/>On a turn, you may first rotate one unoccupied tile; by paying two dye resources from your personal supply, you can rotate a second tile. You then must move each of your llamas at least one space, but you can move them further if you desire and if the terrain allows them to do this. You rotate tiles to create long paths of valley or mountain so that ideally your llamas can travel far with each move.<br/><br/>If you move a llama into a village, you trade the dye on that llama. If the dye you carry isn't in demand in that village, you simply trade that dye for the dye from the village, say, green for yellow. If the dye is in demand, then you add 1-2 dye of that delivered color to your personal supply (depending on whether the demand is low or high), then you place a dye matching the color of that village on your llama. If you collect a color in your personal supply and don't have it in your scoring track, you can place it in your scoring track. No matter what, you replace the demand tile in that village, making sure the color of that village isn't on the demand tile.<br/><br/>During a turn in a village, you can hand in four dye from your personal supply to acquire a new llama that is then placed in that village with a dye from that village on its back. Each llama moves on your turn, and you can have at most three llamas.<br/><br/>As soon as you have one dye of each of the seven colors on your scoring track, you win.<br/><br/>To hold the demand tiles, the game includes a handmade fabric bag from Bolivia and Peru, which supports the local community.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "535 is a Climbing/Shedding game for 2 to 6 Players. The game's deck is comprised of cards numbered 1-15, with cards of rank 6 and 10 missing. The deck contains multiple copies of each card, depending on player count (4 each at 2-4 players/5 each at 5+ players). In addition to a rank, each card has a point value, which depends on the rank&rsquo;s strength. The object of the game is for players to be the first to play all of their cards to the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player may play one, two, or three cards to a single, central meld. Playable meld-types are:<br/><br/>-Single: Any one card. (1 &lt; 7 &lt; 14)<br/>-Set: Any two or more cards of equal rank. (1,1,1 &lt; 14,14,14)<br/>-Run: Any two or more cards of consecutive rank. (1,2,3 &gt; 11,12,13)<br/><br/>On a turn, a player chooses to do one of the following actions:<br/><br/>-Overwrite: Play a higher ranked meld, which matches the meld-type and size of the central meld.<br/>-Add: Attach a card or cards to the central meld, making sets/runs longer.<br/>-Pass: A player who can not or chooses not to play into the central meld may pass. Once a player passes, they are out for the trick.<br/><br/>A trick ends once 1 of 4 things happens:<br/><br/>-All but one player passes. <br/>-A player adds the fourth card to an active set of a like-numbered meld (or fifth in a 5+ player game).<br/>-A player adds the fifth card of a run.<br/>-A player plays a meld that follows the &ldquo;Rule of 8&rsquo;s&rdquo; (See Below).<br/><br/>The last player to have played a card to the meld in any of these situations above clears the trick and leads the next. A lead player must always play one, two, or three cards and may never &quot;Pass&quot;.<br/><br/>Once one player has played their final card(s) to the table, the round ends immediately. The other players then score the points indicated on the cards left in their hands. Rounds are played until one player has 20 or more points, leaving the player(s) with the least points the winner(s).<br/><br/>Rule of 8&rsquo;s:<br/>All cards of rank 8 in the deck are worth the most points in the game. However, these cards have a special function. When a rank 8 card is played to a trick (ie. A single 8, a set of 8&rsquo;s, a run of either 7,8 or 7,8,9) the trick is immediately cleared and the player who played the &ldquo;Rule of 8&rsquo;s&rdquo; clears the trick and leads the next. The only time the Rule of 8&rsquo;s will not function is when an 8 is included in the opening meld of any trick.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While playing Extraordinary Adventures: Pirates, you become a pirate captain sailing three ships through the Caribbean in search of rich merchants to plunder and friendly ports in which to trade your booty for riches.<br/><br/>In more detail, you have one ship on each of the three &quot;tracks&quot;, i.e., pathways through the Caribbean Sea. On each turn, you play three cards from your hand to move your ships. Your cards have a basic movement number, and often a secondary action. You may use one or the other to move your ships down the track or gain special advantages.<br/><br/>Each of the three tracks winds through the Caribbean islands toward your ultimate goal: the Spanish Treasure Galleon at Trinidad. Along the way, there will be detours that lead to merchant ships that may be plundered, and towns that may be visited to cash in your plunder for treasure. Plundering merchant ships and visiting towns also allows you to recruit more crewmen (cards) for your crew (deck). The better your deck is, the faster that your ships are able to move, so deciding when to take detours for plunder and recruiting and when to sail on toward your ultimate goal is an important decision that every pirate captain must make.<br/><br/>The first pirate captain to reach the Treasure Galleon at the end of any track ends the game. Each pirate ship scores points based on what place they finished on each track, as well as for the treasures earned by selling plunder. The richest captain goes down in history as the Pirate King!<br/><br/>",

Each monster is only afraid of one toy that will banish it to the closet amongst the ten that are available to be found. If the players successfully send all the monsters to the closet before they can close the circle around the bed, they win! Otherwise, the monsters are declared victorious.<br/><br/>In game terms, face-down cards are placed on the table with tiles then placed around these cards. To start, a card is revealed that depicts a monster and the toy it's afraid of. In turn order, each player must now find the toy that scares off this monster, with the toy being hidden in the face-down tiles. If players make three mistakes when searching for this toy, a new monster appears with a different toy needed to scare it away. Once all the monsters are out, you have only three chances to win by getting rid of all the monsters.<br/><br/>The rules offer different difficulty levels to adapt to player experience and/or maturity, such as one tile that shuffles the other tiles around and one tile that instantly brings out a new monster.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players can play tiles corresponding to locations on the map. It's mandatory that these are next to tiles that already have an empire counter on them. The new location receives an empire counter depending on already present adjacent ones. Thus the four empires expand during play, as more and more tiles receive their empire counter. The size of the empires will vary from game to game.<br/><br/>Players also need to build galleys to control tiles or travel to locations and found a city there. Building and traveling must be paid for with appropriate cards. These are dealt each round, some may be kept and traded. Spend them to your best advantage.<br/><br/>At the end of the game players score points for controlling tiles. The amount of points depends on whether a city or galley controls the rectangle and how big the empire is to which the area belongs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Agents is a strategic card game that introduces a unique double-edged card mechanism into the undercover world of covert operations, subterfuge, secrecy and sabotage. Players must join their Agents into Factions, assign Missions and take their opponents down, to gather intel and win the most points.<br/><br/>Each Agent card features a &quot;command&quot; on one end of the card and &quot;points&quot; on the other end. The direction in which you place the card determines from which asset you benefit. If you choose to perform the command, one of your opponents scores the points; if you keep the points for yourself, an opponent gets to perform the command. With 25 different Agents, each with its own unique ability, Agents can be turned, killed, extracted and swapped &ndash; making the game ever flexible, variable, unpredictable and a test of forward planning and quick thinking. As you learn about each Agent's special abilities, discover how Agents work together or against each other, and weigh up the advantages of collecting points for yourself versus using the commands to further your goals and sabotage your opponent's strategies, the game becomes increasingly complex, dynamic and challenging.<br/><br/>Missions, played alongside Factions of Agents, provide interesting, strategic conditions which, if fulfilled, score you big points &ndash; but if you race ahead, you'll also become a target for attack. The better you're doing, the more under fire you'll be.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blood and Bridges is a complete stand-alone World at War module that depicts the struggle for control of the bridges in the Rhine River Valley. Fresh Guards units are spearheading the assault into Western Europe, bending defending NATO forces to their breaking point. It is up to forces of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), to stop the Soviet advance which, if successful could ultimately threaten Britain itself.<br/>This stand-alone expansion to the Award Winning World at War: Eisenbach Gap System, contains everything you need to play right out of the box. A new, fully updated and expanded rulebook covers the entire original World at War rules and adds new rules to expand the on-map action. Included are regulations for bridging units like Soviet MTU-55, improved positions and air power, which was a special scenario rule in Death of the First Panzer (An earlier add-on covering West German forces with an 11x17 map, 40 new scuff-resistant counters, and 6 new scenarios). Now the NATO forces will have improved positions to help them cope with the Soviet onslaught. Air power becomes an official game element, with rules and counters representing American A-10's, Soviet SU-25's, and British Tornado's. Birds that can deal out a massive amount of destruction on the battlefield, and look sexy doing it. At least as sexy as a cardboard chit can look. Also, expanded artillery rules, introduce Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), and electronic warfare.<br/>In addition a new table brings battlefield chaos effects to the game. War never goes as planned and great leaders must deal with adversity when it happens. So we thought, 'Let's shake things up a bit&quot;. In games with this option, if you draw the &quot;battlefield chaos&quot; counter, a roll is made to see what the gods of war have hefted upon you, your enemy, or both of you. Anything from bad weather, extra support missions, shell-shocked troops, or skillful battle plans, can come your way.<br/><br/>The war is raging on and now it is up to the British and their formidable array of weapons systems to blunt the Soviet spearhead. Chieftain and Challenger tanks, Striker ATGM vehicles, FV-432 APCs, Lynx attack helicopters, Tornado fighter-bombers and others clash headlong with top-of-the-line Soviet Guards units outfitted with T-80 and T-64 tanks, BMP-2 APCs, MTU-55 Bridge layers, SA-13s, Hind E attack helicopters, Su-25 ground attack aircraft and many more. There is only one mission here. Hold the bridges or see Soviet armor on Channel coast. Are you up to the task?<br/><br/>World at War: Blood and Bridges is the latest complete game in the World at War series. It features 352 counters (we just added an extra half sheet of admin counter goodness), a mounted 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map, 12 scenarios, two player-aid cards, dice, and a complete rules set.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Hearts and Minds: Vietnam 1965-1975 (Third Edition)&quot; is an uncomplicated approach to a very complicated conflict. Eight scenarios introduce players to U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia including a scenario after the US withdrew from Vietnam, a full campaign scenario as well as high solitaire capability. Players appreciate the ability to start in any year of the war they wish and fight to the end of any other year of the war. The game provides a comprehensive historical approach using mechanics that include guerrilla warfare, faction differentiation, political turmoil, and veteran advantages. This design has already been used as a successful teaching tool.<br/><br/>This is a card-driven, area-based design with low counter density and a much simplified combat system. Each scenario represents a year and players have the flexibility of starting in any year of the war and ending in any later year of the war. Players choose either the Allies (US, ARVN, Cambodian and Laotian) or Communist (NVA, VC, Cambodian and Laotian) Players engage in guerrilla warfare &ndash; VC units remain hidden until engaged. VC units may be simple units or reinforced units or simply false information. When determined to be false information, players roll on the Bush Events Table which involve events from discovering Chinese troops to the arrival of USO shows featuring John Wayne and Bob Hope.<br/><br/>This edition involves the use of three card decks, A red deck (communist), a blue deck (Allied) and a black deck (interchangeable). Prior to every game, half of the black deck is shuffled into each of the red and blue decks ensuring a different game every time. Cards indicate the amount of RPs (Resource Points) that may be spent or banked, a historic situation, and its game effects. Certain cards are year specific. Within each Red and Blue Deck are a number of Campaign cards that may be chosen by each player allowing increased abilities but only in a predetermined area.<br/><br/>The game does not ignore political ramifications. Card events cover mass protests in the U.S. and more significantly the instability of the South Vietnamese government. The Allied player controls more firepower but must walk a tightrope between U.S. and ARVN (South Vietnamese) casualties. Too many U.S. casualties leads to a rapid rise in Communist morale.  Too many ARVN casualties will result in a coup which has major strategic advantages for the Communist Player. While in Cambodia and Laos, the destruction of all government forces means the fall of those governments. Throughout the game both sides jockey for the &ldquo;Hearts and Minds&rdquo; in each province. Political Control determines the availability and expansion of VC influence.<br/><br/>Hearts and Minds, Third Edition offers players an easier to follow rulebook with simpler victory conditions. Also included: tested solitaire rules and a separate solitaire player aide; a premium mounted map that includes all of the charts necessary to play the game; full-sized poker quality card deck; standard playing dice and a new artistic approach to factional units.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/><br/>Complexity: Low to Medium (4 out of 10)<br/>Solitaire suitability: Medium to high  (7 out of 10)<br/>Time Scale: Each scenario represents one year. The campaign game covers 8-10 years.<br/>Map Scale: The Map is divided into provincial areas, indicating major cities and US major bases<br/>Unit Scale:  Units are abstract and represent US, ARVN, NVA, VC, Cambodian and Laotian<br/>Players: Two Player game (Solitaire friendly)<br/>Playing Time:  45 minutes or less per scenario<br/>Designer: John Poniske  <br/>Original Developer: Stan Hilinski<br/>Solitaire Developer: David Wessman<br/><br/>Components:<br/>24 page rule/scenario book<br/>Solitaire Player Aid<br/>Three Counter sheets (3/4&rdquo; Counters)<br/>22&rdquo; x 33&rdquo; Mounted Map<br/>80 Standard Playing Cards (27 Red/27 Blue/ 28 black)<br/>Two 6-sided dice (1 Red/1Blue)<br/>One box and lid set<br/><br/>-from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

When a player has all of their ducks eliminated they are out of the game.<br/><br/>The player's also have access to many special cards that allow the line to be manipulated. Results can be the movement of ducks, however Aim Tokens do not move and in this way a player an protect their ducks and threaten those of the opposition.<br/><br/>The game play is similar to Guillotine in the way that the line can be manipulated and the special effect cards on offer.<br/><br/>",

It would be...if any of you actually knew what you were doing. Would have been nice to have at least one experienced pilot on board, but now that you're here, you'll just have to figure it out as you go along.<br/><br/>In Noobs in Space, a team of three to five players must complete a series of tasks and challenges together, using what little knowledge you have. Not all hope is lost because each of you has a small part of the solution; you just need to figure out how to put it all together. While one player may know the task at hand but not have the resources to implement it, those resources may be shared among three other players. They, on the other hand, do not know what is necessary based on the information they have. Since players cannot show cards to each other, there must be a lot of clear communication and interaction by describing or reading out cards in order to gradually find out what should be done &mdash; and all of this must be done as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>The story leads through several levels, and each level consists of several tasks, so the whole game is an action-packed event from beginning to end.<br/><br/>",

The game further captures the mood of those stories and the feel of the planet.  The game uses a further refinement of the wrap-around mechanism used in Lunar Rails to simulate travel across a 3D  opposed to a 2D map.

Boże Igrzysko: MAGNACI, presents the history of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, from its heyday during the Union of Lublin (XVI century) until the collapse of the state (XVIII century). Players take on the roles of the magnates, who seek to develop the power of their families in the favorable time: the peak of the Polish and Lithuanian Union.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of cards that depicts celebrities of his family. Some of them are capable of great deeds and some will spoil any project with which they are entrusted &mdash; but with a good player's decisions, even those small souls could do a lot for his family.<br/><br/>During the game, players manage the deck of their characters to achieve, in competition with others, as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Republic. The fate of the country results from the sum of the activities of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players fall into a mutual fight for titles and advantages, the Republic will fall under the pressure of neighboring powers.<br/><br/>This game for 2-5 players with a game time not exceeding 90 minutes reimplements Martin Wallace's Boże Igrzysko from 2010, using the same principal title in Polish edition under an agreement with the author.<br/><br/>From the back of the game box:<br/><br/>The MAGNATES: A Game of Power is a strategic board game for 2-5 players which is fast and full of historical atmosphere and rich interactions. It takes you into the world of aristocratic intrigues and struggles for power which tore the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from its heyday during the Union of Lublin, until the Targowica Confederation and the fall of the Polish-Lithuanian state.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of magnates who seek to develop their own family's power in a moment favorable to fortune: the prime of the Union of Poland and Lithuania. The most eminent families fight for prestige and landed estates: the Lubomirski, the Potocki, the Radziwiłł, the Sapieha and the Zamoyski.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of cards depicting well-known personages from a given family. Some of these characters are outstanding people, capable of great deeds. But there are also less useful people, able to spoil any undertaking entrusted them... unless, thanks to the player's decisions, even those lesser ones will do much for the family.<br/><br/>During the game, players will manage their deck of characters so that, in competition with others, they can achieve as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Commonwealth. Players will clash during the creation of the state's internal policy, as well as in response to external threats and opportunities arising from the international situation. And so, as it happened in reality, the fate of the country will be the result of the sum of actions of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players lose themselves in a mutual fight for titles and advantage, the Commonwealth will collapse under the pressure of the neighboring powers.<br/><br/>In MAGNATES, players will face many dilemmas. The most prominent members of the family will ensure beneficial rights in the Sejm and prestigious positions in the Senate. Moreover, they comply with the Monarch's will easily, and thanks to them the family will gain estates and power. But how will a player handle the remaining challenges? Who will undertake an expedition to Livonia? Will the troops protecting the country against enemy invasion, in the absence of other candidates, be again led by incompetents (like &quot;peryna, latyna and dytyna&rdquo;)? Will there be enough determination to hasten to the relief of Vienna? Will the players succeed in saving the Homeland from partitioning?<br/><br/>Is your Family ready for a Game of Power?<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of trainee witches, such as Tiffany Aching and Petulia Gristle, learning their craft and dealing with all the problems, both petty and serious, that life on Discworld can throw at them. A subtle blend of headology, magic and, of course, the all-important cup of tea will see our heroines tackle everything from a sick pig to a full-blown invasion of elves. Each player tries to be better at everything than the others, while also cooperating to prevent crises from escalating.<br/><br/>Life can be tough for a young witch in Lancre. Fear not, however, as some of Terry Pratchett's most famous characters will be on hand to aid your quest. Along the way you'll meet Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick, as well as a rich supporting cast of familiar faces from the Discworld series. When things get really tough and you feel you are turning &quot;Black Aliss&quot;, you can always have a cup of tea with one of your fellow witches.<br/><br/>The Witches can be played competitively, cooperatively, or solo.<br/><br/>",

The object of the Imperial player is to destroy the Shield Generator at opposite end of the map to Imperial deployment.  The rebels' goal is to forestall Imperial victory until the &quot;Transports&quot; are away.  Setup is limited to certain areas of the map, thus setting up a very accurate scene to play from the film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot;  Troops, vehicle strength and damage are tracked on the map, using various counters.  One even gets to use Luke on the battlefield and his all important Force ability. Dice are used to determine combat attack and defense.  It's a hex based map, and the counters all have stands.  Low rules learning.  Random card powers throughout game (events.)  VERY little hidden from other player.<br/><br/>",

Displeased with the plain appearance of the pyramid in which his father was buried, Mido turns his attention to his own legacy. He wishes for his own resting place to better reflect his majesty and has decreed that 2-4 architects build pyramids encrusted with jewels: a pyramido. The architect who builds the most impressive pyramido will be appointed Vizier and enjoy wealth and power beyond imagination.<br/><br/>Pyramido is a tile-placement game in which each stage of the pyramid creates connections between them. Players take turns choosing from the available dominoes to create their pyramid. To maximize their points, players must match the jewel icons on the dominoes and place their markers of the same colors to activate the scoring areas. Each choice of domino and its positioning has a significant impact since the previous stages influence the score throughout the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each member of the Security Council shall have one vote.<br/>2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members.<br/><br/>In this negotiation game, each player represents one member of the UN Security Council and will both present and be presented with different proposals.<br/><br/>In each round, one player acts as the UN Secretary General, presents a proposal to the Council and presides over a negotiation period that lasts no more than five minutes. The proposal will affect five issues &ndash; military, currency, etc. &ndash; in various ways, and each player has a secret document for the round that tells him how a change in each issue will affect him. All players openly negotiate on what they need in terms of points and bribes in order to vote for that proposal.<br/><br/>After at most five minutes, the Secretary General closes negotiations by banging his wooden gavel, then players vote yes or no on the proposal. Any &quot;no&quot; vote kills the proposal, as in the United Nation's actual Security Council &ndash; but vetoing a proposal costs a player points, so he might prefer to look for deals that will enable him to say &quot;yes&quot;. The Secretary General scores a bonus when his proposal succeeds, so he and others who will benefit might be willing to negotiate to make the proposal sweet for all.<br/><br/>After each player has served as Secretary General once (twice in a three-player game), each player scores based on bribe money on hand, points scored from proposal cards, and how well the player fulfilled the secret agenda card he received at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

While the secular world of empires and politics plays out around you, your missionaries spread the Christian faith and convert areas of the map to your new religion. Each turn covers decades, and the flow of play will teach players about the expansion and doctrinal battles of early Christianity while you build institutions to educate, heal, and inspire the societies you touch.<br/><br/>Apostles and brilliant theologians will help you evangelize, but you will come to rely on the Roman/Byzantine state and Christian kingdoms to establish and defend the faith. Heresies and schisms in the Church will try to thwart your plans. Pressing against you are barbarian hordes, some of which you may convert; but the armies of Islam will emerge as the game changes from one of missionary outreach to one of self-preservation, as Christian communities hunker down for survival during the long Dark Ages. At the end, you will rise up in a blaze of glory as the Christian world finally fights back using Crusaders and the Spanish Reconquista to recover lost provinces!<br/><br/>Beginners and experienced gamers will find this an intriguing and very different sort of game. It&rsquo;s a war of ideas, but it&rsquo;s still a wargame, where managing scarce resources (including holy relics!) and making shrewd strategic decisions are the keys to victory.

The higher the statues are built up the volcano the more they score in one of the two scoring phases, but of course the closer they are build towards the crater the danger of being destroyed by volcanic eruption is higher as well.<br/><br/>By playing numbered chips (1-5) to the beach, you move a ship clockwise. The sector in which the ship is moved will be evaluated. If a player has placed a numbered chip into this sector, he may gain a card from this sector. Cards are required to build statues, buy bonus score cards or to influence the direction of the lava when the volcano finally errupts (two times in the game - right before an evaluation).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brikks can be viewed as tabletop Tetris, with each player trying to place falling blocks into their grid to score the most points.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player draws a different quadromino at the bottom of their individual game sheet. On a turn, the active player rolls two dice &mdash; a colored d6 and a numbered d4 &mdash; then optionally rolls both dice again. The two dice determine which specific quadromino &mdash; that is, which colored shape and in which orientation &mdash; all players must &quot;drop&quot; into their grid. To represent this, you draw an outline of the block at the bottom of your sheet as if you had dropped it in from the top, then X out the spaces covered by the quadromino.<br/><br/>If you cover a circle on the grid that's the same color as the quadromino just placed there, you collect two energy points. By spending one energy point on a turn, you can possibly &quot;rotate&quot; the quadromino to be placed depending on what dice were rolled; by spending five energy points, you can place exactly the quadromino you want, ignoring the result of the dice. As you collect energy, you might cover an X on the energy chart; if you do, you track these Xs on a separate &quot;extra point&quot; bar, with the points escalating for each X you collect. If you complete 2-4 lines through the placement of a single quadromino, you collect an additional 1-4 Xs for this extra point bar.<br/><br/>Each player has three bombs they can spend to blow up a block instead of placing it, but by doing so you give up endgame points.<br/><br/>As soon as you can no longer place a quadromino in your grid, your game is over. Once everyone has filled their grid to the top, tally your points. In addition to the extra points bar and any bombs unused, you score 1-5 points for each horizontal line that contains 8-10 Xs, with these line points doubling, or even quadrupling, as you go higher in the grid. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>&quot;Brikks&quot; also contains rules for a duel mode and a solitaire mode.<br/><br/>",

The result is a tense game of skill, bluffing, luck, and lethal brutality like you've never played before!<br/><br/>Brought to you by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Kaosball uses exciting card-based play mechanisms to put players in the role of a coach, managing their unique, game-altering team from scrimmage to sudden death period to outscore their opponents. Players need to balance scoring and killing their opponents, using powerful cheating effects all the while &ndash; as long as you have the money to pay off the ref. No two matches will play the same!<br/><br/>Kaosball includes multiple modes of play: traditional head-to-head, partnerships-based alliances, and &quot;Maximum Kaos&quot; three- or four-player mode; 30-60 exhibition games complete with a pregame draft for ringers and team upgrades; and league play with up to eight players and upgrades that stay in place from game to game, creating a unique sense of progression.<br/><br/>",

The ability to change orders will be reduced and it will be more difficult to &ldquo;recall&rdquo; formations, once launched. Initial planning will be an important feature, as befits a Napoleonic battle of such a scale.<br/><br/>In addition, &lsquo;fog of war&rsquo; has been further developed and will be part of the main rules. Players will share some of the uncertainty experienced by the actual commanders, as to what precisely they are facing.<br/><br/>Initial play tests have shown that Rising Eagles continues to provide a tense and exciting game play, with strategic battle planning assuming a greater significance than the &lsquo;slogging match&rsquo; of Waterloo.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are an explorer who has been traveling through space, looking for new planets for the Federation, and you have just discovered one not yet indexed! This is an opportunity to identify new creatures, discover rare resources, and fulfill intergalactic missions. This is the challenge you are facing: Earn the most victory points in order to make your exploration successful!<br/><br/>Big Monster is a &quot;smart drafting&quot; and tile-laying game that's played in two rounds. On a turn, each player (simultaneously) chooses a tile from their hand, places it face down in front of them, then immediately gives their remaining tiles to another player of their choice who hasn't already been given tiles. That is what's defined as &quot;smart drafting&quot;.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player owns 18 tiles in their exploration space. You earn victory points by finding monsters, completing crystals, and achieving missions. The player with most victory points at the end of the second round wins.<br/><br/>Big Monster can also be played in teams, and when doing so, the score of each team is the score of the team member with the fewest victory points.<br/><br/>Big Monster is also a two players game, and when doing so, you do not use &quot;smart draft&quot;. There is a special rule for 2 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fool's Gold takes place during the gold rush of 1849. Players are investors who send prospectors on a quest to find gold at various locations &mdash; in the mountains, in a forest, at a river, etc. &mdash; with each location having perils, gems, quantities of gold and bountiful supplies of silt. As players remove valuable gold cards from the location decks, silt becomes more prominent and gold harder to find.<br/><br/>Each player starts Fool's Gold with six coins and 2-4 prospectors, depending on the number of players. The game lasts five years (i.e., rounds), and at the start of each year, each player receives an additional coin and an additional prospector, giving you both more to spend and more on which to spend. Each year consists of two phases: the prospecting phase and the mining phase. During the prospecting phase, the start player rolls ten dice, then places the dice on the mines of the same number, with 6s being placed in the central camp. Each mine has a path to it starting with the numbered die, then spaces numbered 0-6. After placing dice on the mine paths, players take turns taking one of these actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a prospector on a mine path, paying the cost of the space you cover; whenever you pay coins, place them in front of your player screen.<br/>    Place a wild die on a mine path, paying 1 for each die already on the path.<br/>    Place a prospector in front of your screen to take back three coins.<br/>    Pass, place all of your remaining prospectors in reserve next to any mine or mines of your choice, then take back all coins and prospectors in front of your screen.<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has passed, the mining phase begins. Starting at mine #1, shuffle the mine deck, then draw a number of cards equal to the product of the number of prospectors and the number of dice at the mine. Foul weather forces fewer cards to be drawn, while false alarms might result in treasure being snatched away from everyone. Players then choose rewards from the mine in order of priority, which is determined by the number of prospectors each player has at a mine (include those in reserve) and their location on the path; players must redetermine priority after each action at a mine. The player actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a gold card from the mine.<br/>    Take a gem card from the mine, but only if you don't already have this gem.<br/>    Take two coins from the bank, which gives you additional funds for the rest of the game.<br/>    Lay down your prospector (removing it from priority) and wait for winter.<br/><br/><br/>Once all standing miners have been removed, roll the winter die and draw that many cards for winter. If any goods come up, those layabout prospectors finally get to profit; if not, tough cookies, sourdough! After five rounds, players compare their findings, losing points if they've failed to collect gold from each mine. In addition, each player must throw out all the gold from the mine where he found the most. Turns out it was so easy to find because it was fool's gold! Players then sum their nuggets and score 1-15 points for their gem collection. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Victory Denied: Crisis at Smolensk July-September, 1941, is a two-player game that recreates the intense mobile fighting between German and Soviet forces in the Smolensk-Oblast during the Summer of 1941.  By July of 1941, the German Army stood at the very door of Moscow.  The Soviet forces before them had been routed and the path to yet another great victory for the Wehrmacht was seemingly undefended.  But it was here that the Russian Army successfully rallied.  For the first time in this terrible war, the Germans faced an enemy that was implacable and resolute.  With victory so close, and with Germany closer to world domination than they would ever be before or since &ndash; the Russian line held &ndash; it was A Victory Denied.<br/><br/>Building on the enormous critical success of A Victory Lost: Crisis in Ukraine 1942-1943, A Victory Denied is a wargame that offers the same elegant simplicity of A Victory Lost: Crisis in Ukraine 1942-1943 but also covers the unique aspects of this great battle.  While the system remains the same, upgraded supply rules and command structure rules will be added to model how important these problems were in this battle &ndash; and air power and Stalin&rsquo;s Organs will make their first appearance in the system.  But what made A Victory Lost: Crisis in Ukraine 1942-1943 so special will still be in full force &ndash; easy rules, unpredictable chit pulls, wild game play, and the ability to play the game almost right out of the box.<br/><br/>International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 7 days<br/>Hex: 10 miles / 16 Km<br/>Units: Division &amp; Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page rules booklet<br/>Two Palyer Aid Cards (2-sided)<br/>Two dice (One 10-sided &amp; One 6-sided)<br/><br/>Solitaire rating: Excellent<br/>Complexity: Low<br/>Playing time: 4 hours<br/>Scenarios: 1<br/><br/>",

Have you or your family ever seen a spook, spectre, or ghost? If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then don't wait another minute. Pick up the phone and call the professionals!<br/><br/>Ghostbusters: The Board Game is an episodic adventure game for one to four players, who are charged with busting ghosts and sealing gates to the Spirit World. In the game, players choose one of the four Ghostbusters character figures &mdash; Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz &mdash; then select one of the game's pre-written scenarios, beginning a game session that lasts from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the chosen scenario(s) and degree of difficulty. Each of the Ghostbusters has unique traits and talents that can assist the entire team, with highly co-operative gameplay. As players gain experience from banishing spirits, the Ghostbusters level up, gaining new abilities that help them take on greater challenges. The team can also hop in the Ecto-1, the Ghostbusters' converted ambulance, to help them quickly move through the city.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters: The Board Game comes with more than forty plastic figures, including the four Ghostbusters, Slimer, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, Indulnas, and numerous Galloping Ghouls, Gruesome Twosomes and Boogaloo. The game board is created with double-sided modular pieces, increasing the game's replayability for scenarios and customization.<br/><br/>",

Become a character from 1001 Arabian Nights and build graceful minarets, dazzling gates and soaring cupolas to draw the eye of the sultan and carve your name in history. Players will carefully select the best building tiles to erect the most impressive structures, scoring points for following patterns and fulfilling secret objectives. Earn sapphires, and use them to secure the services of the mighty Djinn, whose aid will be invaluable in your quest to create the most stunning palace the city has ever seen.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/><br/>Players start out with a board, with a &quot;triangle&quot; of 3-tiles worth built, and have to expand that out to make the best (most VP-earning) palace. There are separate stacks of tiles for each layer of the palace, color coded (blue, red, green, and sky). Besides the color-coded levels, there are attributes that have to match up, like doorways and columns.<br/><br/>To get tiles, players reveal tiles from one pile and display them in front of the pile (up to 3 can be showing - the top of the pile is face up but can't be taken) and then choose a tile from any of the available tiles in any color. You try to choose a tile that will give you points and/or gems. The gems let you buy genies, which have special powers like building twice in one turn, or moving a tile you previously placed.<br/><br/>Players are limited by the edges of the starting board, including the bonus tiles (question marks). You have to have at least one tile beneath you to build, and you can't make a hole in the palace, so things are somewhat constrained. The tiles are two-sided and can be flipped if you need the mirror-image tile.<br/><br/>Each player board has attributes that score points, like windows or plants. You also have 2 hidden objectives/bonuses, which might be points for making a column of windows. The game ends when someone builds their fifth sky tile. The player that scores the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players are forced to make difficult trade-offs between expending resources in the Political Phase vs the Action Phase and attempting to influence one faction at the expense of others. Players utilize a shared deck of 66 Political Cards.<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, players use Action Cards to conduct operations (activating a space for combat or movement), take replacements, place reinforcements, make strategic moves, seize initiative in combat, gain diplomatic traction with the factions or implement special operations. Leaders have these capabilities including exploitation, reinforcing battles, withdrawing, counter-attacking and conducting multi-space attacks. Players are forced to make difficult decisions thwarting threats and capitalizing on opportunities. Each player has their own deck of 55 Action Cards. Additionally, a deck of 44 Leader Cards (for a combined total of 220 ToC Cards) provide historical details regarding the various personalities in the game.<br/><br/>During the Logistics Phase, players rebuild/repair units, determine if various factions withdraw from the combat, check for the effect of In-Fighting within the RED and WHITE camps, check for attrition, purchase political influence, buy leaders and check for victory.<br/><br/>",

The foliage that the light touched grew wild and fierce, and the wildlife grew larger and more fearsome. Life prospered in the vale.<br/><br/>From distant lands, members of many cultures converged, drawn by the mystery and allure of the red star and the verdant realm it created. They settled there, distancing themselves at first. The soil was hearty, perfect for crops; the rock was rich with mineral deposits begging to be mined, and the very land itself seemed eager to be shaped.<br/><br/>On warm summer nights, the velvet sky became streaked with the scarlet light of meteor showers. The settlers found that, under these lights, their crafting projects finished more quickly and with greater results! Before long, the people began to co-operate, sharing their wares and knowledge with one another.<br/><br/>Together under an evening meteor shower, they founded a shared township &mdash; one that valued knowledge and craft. The township was named Splendence after the valley that brought them all together.<br/><br/>In the centuries that followed, a red substance the people named material could be found after meteor showers. Artisans learned to craft using the substance, which lent magical qualities to their works. These works, called Artifice, were established which would catapult the township into an industrial revolution.<br/><br/>The Artisans of Splendent Vale is a cooperative adventure game set in a magical and unique land. As a troupe of artisans, you will explore the beauty of the Splendent Vale while honing your individual crafts. Overcome challenges during tactical action scenes played out on specialized grid maps, then experience individual interludes to build your story, separately from the group&rsquo;s tale.

        "description": "SEAL Team Flix is a fully co-operative or solo tactical dexterity game that pits 1-4 players against the forces of terrorism. Taking inspiration from several military-themed first-person shooter video games, SEAL Team Flix incorporates flicking, dice rolling, and character standees into an exciting, unique combination that will have the whole table standing up.<br/><br/>The game has two modes: campaign and skirmish. In campaign mode, players embark on an eight-mission non-linear adventure. Individual SEALs will get promoted several times over the course of the campaign...if they live. In skirmish mode, simply play one of the 17 missions as a standalone set-piece.<br/><br/>SEAL Team Flix is an objective-based game, with primary and secondary objectives which need to be resolved to successfully complete each mission. For example, in some missions, you must locate and acquire intelligence against the terrorist organization Gaia's Hope. In others, you must disarm time bombs or rescue hostages. While you are given intelligence at the beginning of each mission as to the number and nature of the objectives that need to be completed, every game will be different because you will never know where on the map they are until you physically locate them with your SEALs. The game's difficulty scales both with the number of SEALs playing as well as with three optional difficulty levels.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT ERRATA: Somehow the Sentry positions were left off the printed boards included in the game. You can see images of the correct Sentry Position placement on pages 6 and 10 in the rulebook, but you can also download the Sentry Errata PDFin the files section, which contains enlarged images of the maps and their sentry positions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In June 1520, at Balinghem, there met the young and glorious Kings of England and of France in a grand and splendid celebration of their mutual friendship and admiration. There were great feasts and opulent amusements, conspicuous expressions of deepest and sincerest piety, and fierce tournaments. Each King outshone the other in turn, so that the world might be astounded at the wealth and power of each kingdom. So many tents and raiments were made of precious cloth of gold, that the field is so named.<br/><br/>This game was created to commemorate the five hundredth anniversary of the world&rsquo;s most famous three-week  party, in which King Henry VIII of England, and Francis I of France, spent ridiculous amounts of money and resources to peacock at each other. Through smiles made of gritted teeth, the game&rsquo;s two players will express friendship: each action they take will give their opponent a tile that they might use to score. Scoring usually entails removing the tile from the game, so each player must take care to maximize their scoring opportunities while either denying them to their rival, or forcing their rival to score before they&rsquo;re ready. Once the game is underway, players are generally given only two options, and both of those options are usually painful - even and sometimes especially when they score you points.<br/><br/>A sort of subversion of the point salad paradigm, The Field of the Cloth of Gold harkens back to the feel of the classic German games of the 1990s: simple, elegant, austere, and politely vicious.<br/><br/>The second edition of the game, dubbed the &quot;503rd anniversary edition&quot;, includes a new jewel tile type.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The empire was organized as a pyramid-shaped hierarchy with the Sapa Inca as the supreme ruler, followed by the four Apus, who were followed by the Hahua Incas, etc. To play, you assume the role of one of the Apus (a leader of one of the four regions or &quot;Suyus&quot;). Your job is to increase your status in the eyes of the Sapa Inca by doing the best job of expanding and improving the empire. Each Apu begins with the manpower of their quadrant of the original empire. You build roads and conquer neighboring regions, thereby increasing the manpower and available resources. Apus are rewarded for each new region added to the empire, for improvements such as terraces, garrisons, cities, and temples, and for connecting road systems to all of the improvements throughout the empire.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    Inca Empire<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This classic SPI game from 1980 covers the economic and political landscape of Medieval Europe from 771 to 1467 on an area map.  Several scenarios allow players to do anything from a solitaire game during the Charlemagne's reign to the &quot;Grand Scenario&quot; that covers historical trends throughout the period.<br/><br/>Decision Games published a second edition in 2004, with a differently styled map.  It added optional expansion rules &amp; counters for Armies, Fleets, and Civilization Markers, along with additional Event Cards -- raising their number from 56 to 164.<br/><br/>At the start of each player's Round, Event Cards are drawn which change the strategic situation (such as Plague or Bounty) or benefit a player in various ways.  The descriptions of the Events contain a great deal of historical information, adding much interest to the game.<br/><br/>Each player may attempt to perform up to five &quot;Endeavors&quot; per 25-year long Turn.<br/><br/>There are six types of Endeavors:  Conquest, Pillage, Diplomacy, Defense, Fortification (including building Armies/Fleets) and Ruling. Additionally, moving Armies/Fleets and Taxation may always be performed.<br/><br/>Endeavor resolution is diceless; instead &quot;Year Cards&quot; which show an array of results for each type of Endeavor are drawn.  The card might also require a Leader Stature Check, which can change the player's Combat, Administration, and Diplomacy ratings.<br/><br/>Endeavor resolution is affected by the appropriate Leader rating, and the involved areas' language, religion, population, and Social State (which changes frequently).  Poor performance can lead to Unrest or Rebellion in an Area.<br/><br/>An area's Social State value rises and falls as a result of Events and Endeavors, and improving the Social State of your empire is an important object of play.<br/><br/>Optional rules add non-player Raiders and Magnates.<br/><br/>The Sword And The Stars is a galactic empire game based on the Empires Of The Middle Age game system.<br/><br/>",

Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.<br/><br/>Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.<br/><br/>Pocket Battles: Elves vs. Orcs is the second game in the series of &quot;Pocket Battles&quot;, after Pocket Battles: Celts vs. Romans.<br/><br/>The series is designed to have each army fully compatible with any other, so it will be possible, for example, to fight with orcs against Romans, or to have a mixed army of elves and Celts.<br/><br/>The basic rules of the game are fairly simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).<br/><br/>On your turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on your unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).<br/><br/>After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.<br/><br/>When one army has eliminated half of the other's original deployment value, that battle round concludes the game, and the player who has defeated the greatest total point-value of opposing units is the winner.<br/><br/>",

And, finally, either at death&rsquo;s door or at your wit&rsquo;s end, you will have to uproot evil itself from the darkest dungeon.<br/><br/>Darkest Dungeon is a fully cooperative dungeon crawl game in which players take on the role of adventurers. Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!<br/><br/>The game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough and face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.<br/><br/>For each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you&rsquo;ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.<br/><br/>",

Then they take 2 top buildings from the building card and place them on the 2 lands from the left.<br/><br/>Next, players take their screens and start divivding those 5 pieces of lands into 2 groups - a bigger and a smaller ones. In any ratio they want (3\\2, 1\\4 even 5\\0). And add 1 crystal to the smaller land.<br/><br/>When everyone is ready, the exchange begins.<br/>Players put the screens down allowing other players to see and choose a land that they have made.<br/><br/>Note: at the first turn players choose the lands from a neighbour from the left, at 2nd - from the right, and then again left and finally right. For the max interaction<br/><br/>When selection is made, players put a choice card reflecting their decidion of lands.<br/><br/>Then, players take the chosen lands from the neighbour from the left and join them to the remaining piece of their own.<br/><br/>Turn by turn, they build their domains, taking the most suitable lands to make their so-called new empire more profitable.<br/><br/>How to gain points?<br/>For every kind of terrain with the corresponding building placed on it or next to it. Then the number of lands multiply with the number of buildings for EACH type of lands.<br/>The crystals gained for choosing smaller lands also bring points - 3 points for each crystal.<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For generations, the fertile Hiddenlands were shared by the peoples of the Five Realms. The Elves, Mages, Dwarves, Halflings and Humans lived peacefully with each other, though they increasingly engaged in fierce competition for the prosperity and glory of their respective nations.<br/><br/>And so it was that when the divisiveness threatened to break the thousand-year peace, the Goblin Hordes from across the sea unleashed a devastating surprise attack, and the peoples of the Hiddenlands could not unify quickly enough to repel them. Remnants of each of the realms fled by ship, until they at last discovered a new, unoccupied land upon which they could begin building their civilizations anew. The old rivalries would remain, of course, but perhaps this time, their competition with each other would not welcome disaster. It was a time of hope, a time for exploration and construction, and a time of renewed competition in a new world they called Pandoria.<br/><br/>In the &quot;gamer's game&quot; Pandoria, players discover this new land by placing tiles, and they claim its territory and resources by placing their people. When a type of terrain is completely surrounded by other terrain, every worker on the borders of that terrain gains its resources. Although more than one civilization will usually benefit, each player tries to gain more than the others. Mining gold gives you income to buy cards that have two options: buildings and spells. Acquiring wood allows you to build that side of the card for permanent advantages, while mining crystals gives you the power to use the card for its one-time spell instead. Excess resources can be converted into prestige Points, and some buildings can generate more. When the new land has been fully explored (all tiles have been placed), the player with the most prestige is declared the most powerful nation of Pandoria and wins the game!<br/><br/>The game includes a streamlined beginner game, as well as expanded rules for the complete game that includes asymmetrical player powers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a medieval monk, you are charged with increasing the prestige of the abbey's collection of historical and sacred texts. By acquiring the resources for manuscript illustration and reproduction, your abbey produces and sells its valuable works, thereby bringing in finances necessary for maintaining a fine abbey. Will you succeed in making your abbey the most prestigious of all?<br/><br/>Biblios Dice is a revision of Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game, which is itself a dice version of Biblios (originally called Scripts and Scribes).<br/><br/>The object is to acquire gold and to collect resources &ndash; scrolls, manuscripts, pigments, quills, ink &ndash; to exchange for gold. It follows the same basic theme as Biblios, but with interesting changes due to the use of dice. As in Scripts and Scribes, players compete in five different categories, and the values of the categories change during the game. In addition, depending upon the dice roll, there may be many or few auctions during the game in which players auction their resources for gold or auction gold for resources.<br/><br/>Biblios Dice differs from its earlier version Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game in a few important ways. Regarding the production and components, Biblios Dice has much nicer artwork, the game board has been divided into separate boards, and the resource dice are etched. Regarding the rules, Biblios Dice has a few important changes.  The goal of the game is now to collect the most VPs, rather than gold. There is only one type of auction in this game, and the first and second place winners of the auction get dice (not winner take all). The auctions also do not happen as randomly, but can be predicted based upon the progress of the mule on the market board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Under the Lily Banners is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the Thirty Years War. This is the third volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series detailing 17th Century warfare, often known as the Dawn of Modern Warfare. This volume features the rise of the French Army after their entry into the Thirty Years War in 1635. Two of the greatest captains of French history - Louis de Bourbon, the Grand Cond&eacute; and Henri de la Tour, the vicomte de Turenne - take the field to set the stage for Le Grand Siecle - the Golden Age of France under Louis XIV, the Sun King.<br/><br/>After taking on the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War and the combined arms tactics of the Swedes and Imperials in Sweden Fights On, the Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series looks at the French, Spanish and Bavarian armies. The Spanish tercios face the superb French gendarmes. The stalwart Bavarians with their excellent cavalry and love of entrenchments battle the veteran Weimarian cavalry corps.<br/><br/>Armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player that can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include cavalry charges, cavalry pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The five battles in Under the Lily Banners are:<br/><br/>Rocroi 1643 - The debut of the young duc d'Enghien (later known as the Grand Cond&eacute;). The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War that broke the power of the Spanish tercios. The French faced a larger Spanish army but the energetic Enghien refused to quit when all seemed lost and snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/><br/>Freiburg 1644 - Enghien joined forces with Turenne facing the well entrenched Bavarians. The battle raged for over 3 days until the French were worn down. The French declared victory then bypassed the town. A very different style of battle than any other from the period due to the terrain, style of attack, and duration.<br/><br/>Mergentheim 1645 - The Bavarians surprised Turenne's army and inflicted a stinging blow. This is the smallest battle in the series and is included as a learning scenario.<br/><br/>Alerheim aka Second N&ouml;rdlingen 1645 - Turenne, reinforced by Enghien and German Allies from Hesse-Cassel, again faced the entrenched Bavarians. The Bavarians, reinforced by the Imperials, held two hills and the town. Enghien attacked the town and Turenne, at the head of the elite Weimarian cavalry corps, attacked the Bavarian right. The excellent cavalry commander for the Bavarians, Jean de Werth, saw Enghien's attack bog down in the town and attacked the French right, smashing it. The French were losing until the Bavarian commander, Franz von Mercy, fell and in the confusion, allowing Turenne to pull out a victory. The casualties were so heavy the French ended the campaign season three months early.<br/><br/>Lens 1648 - The resurgent Spanish under the Archduke Leopold brother of the Holy Roman Emperor pressed into Flanders to recapture the fortress of Lens. With domestic unrest and a military failure in Spain, the French seemed vulnerable. The Grand Cond&eacute; rushed to the rescue. The Spanish took the high ground, hoping Cond&eacute; would attack as he had at Alerheim. Instead, he turned and began to retire. A cavalry skirmish with the French rearguard escalated and drew both armies into the action piecemeal. The veteran Spanish tercios smashed the elite gardes fran&ccedil;aises, taking their colors as revenge for Rocroi. The French cavalry proved superior and drove off the Spanish horse, leaving the body of infantry isolated on the field where they surrendered en masse. This shattered the last hopes for the Habsburgs, ending their involvement in the Thirty Years War with a defeat.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 series rulebook<br/>1 playbook<br/>3 countersheets<br/>2 backprinted mapsheets (3 one map battles and 2 half-map battles)<br/>1 die<br/>Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>Nominee for the 2005 Charles S.

In Uruk: Cradle of Civilization, each player builds up a civilization on the Euphrates, consisting of settlements built around various inventions. Starting with something as simple as a &quot;mud hut&quot;, by the end each civilization will have several inventions, such as the mighty &quot;aqueduct&quot;. Along the way, each civilization tries to avoid disasters and receive blessings from Sumerian gods. There is no military component in this game, and players cannot directly attack each other.<br/><br/>Inventions are represented by cards, while resources are wooden cubes. Each player starts with a simple level 1 invention, and as the game progresses, more advanced inventions become available, up to level 4. Inventions in a tableau can generate resources, which can be used to build settlements, and each invention score points depending on what size settlement has been built on them. With three actions per turn, players must manage cards in their hand and in their tableau, as well as their resources. When a god or disaster appears, players bid to see who gets the reward, or avoids the loss. At the end of the fourth era, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Both players have only four pieces &ndash; chick, giraffe, elephant and lion &ndash; and they're trying to either catch the opponent's lion or move their own lion to the other side. The board is just 3&times;4 squares, so the game is rather short, aimed mostly at getting children interested in Shogi &ndash; but even if you're an adult, the game is enjoyable. As for how to play:<br/><br/><br/>     The giraffe moves like a rook, but moves only one space.<br/>     The elephant moves like a bishop, but moves only one space. (Interestingly, in Xiangqi and Tamerlane Chess, the elephant moves precisely two spaces diagonally.)<br/>     The chick is directly analogous to the pawn/soldier of Shogi, and is promoted to a full-grown chicken, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.<br/>     The lion is analogous to a king, except that he can win essentially by promoting, as long as it doesn't leave him in check.<br/>     Even on this 3&times;4 board, you are still able to drop in pieces that you captured from your opponent!<br/>     Unlike in Shogi, you can drop a chick for mate or have two chicks in a column.<br/><br/><br/>",

Prepare yourselves for the biggest dispute of black magic ever. The Vud&ugrave; tournament has just begun!<br/><br/>In Vud&ugrave;, the players act as the most wicked and malicious sorcerers of all time, and they want to use their curses and black magic to make the lives of their enemies impossible to prevail over them! Each turn, you roll five dice, collect your ingredients, then choose whether to take new cards, take new items, or cast a spell. Each spell has a powerful and tricky curse attached to it that forces your target to play in a specific way, for example, talking with his tongue out for the rest of the game, or using only a single hand, or running around the table each turn. Each curse grants you points when you cast it and many more points if your target forgets to obey it or becomes too exhausted to continue. Collect as many malediction points as you can to reach the final tile of the scoreboard before anyone else!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Gold, Gold, Gold &ndash; A Ton of Gold&quot; &ndash; this was the Seattle headline heard 'round the world announcing the discovery of great stores of gold in the Klondike. This was the beginning of an exodus of would-be prospectors dreaming of a better life, a chance to escape the toil caused by the financial recessions and bank failures of the 1890s. Gold rush hysteria was pulsing through the veins of the country and tens of thousands were willing to risk it all for the chance to have it all.<br/><br/>Lost Valley is a game about the Klondike stampede that rushed North and about the grueling journey that these would-be prospectors undertook, traversing Steep Mountain passes with heavy loads through severe weather and  with ever-dwindling resources.<br/><br/>During the course of the game, players must explore an ever-expanding lost valley in hopes of discovering a gold vein in a mountain, a virgin forest to provide timber, or a fishing spot along the river to provide food. The map will be different each time you play, so you never know what lurks around the corner. As you set out from the outfitters with everything you own strapped to your back, you must balance carefully the resources that you need. Of course you will need tools, dynamite and timber to extract mountain gold, but you'll need to make sure you have room for food, rifles and fishing poles to help you survive in the wilderness.<br/><br/>In addition to expanding the player count to 2-6 (from 3-4) and shortening the playing time, the second edition of Lost Valley rebalances the gold nugget distribution; provides a third path to victory; and (thanks to the included expansion modules) allows players to build canals, learn new abilities, and stake claims on gold mines.<br/><br/>Join the Stampede<br/><br/><br/>",

One morning the body of a young girl was found, as pale as a sheet of paper, dry and totally drained of blood.  Vampires are on the prowl!  Who is the monster who murders innocent during the night?  Before the truth will be discovered, more than one person may face unjust accusations thrown out by the devious servants of darkness.  Will the vampires be successfully caught before they endanger the entire society, or will the castle and city fall forever into darkness?<br/><br/>Three characters in the castle are vampires. A human investigator is trying to determine which three of nine characters he encounters are, in fact, monsters hiding in human form so that he can eliminate them. The head vampire, on the other hand, must bluff cleverly, present confusing clues, and trick the humans into attacking innocent citizens. By doing this, the vampire can kill the most important characters in the city or conquer the castle.<br/><br/>Vampire Empire is a two-player card game with a lot of bluffing and player interaction.  In this very thematic setting, each player possess a unique deck of cards granting different powers, and each player had different goals to win the game!<br/><br/>",

As one of many rival powers in the region, you now have the opportunity to alter the course of history and seize power for yourself. The ambitious Sultan sits in a golden palace, presiding over great works of architecture. The secretive Murshid works to covertly undermine the central authorities through an expansive network of agents.<br/><br/>The wandering tribes of the Nomad aim to sow discord in order to secure employment for their experienced mercenary citizenry. The ravaging forces of the Warlord sweep across the land, chasing after promises of plunder. And, in the face of chaos and uncertainty, the Caliph aims to preserve order through military might. Will you successfully navigate this web of rivalries and rise to prominence, or will you squabble with your lesser adversaries and fade into obscurity?<br/><br/>Crescent Moon is played over three years (or four years in the long game). Each year, players will take four actions which might be to deploy new armies, enlist mercenaries, build fortifications and settlements, conquer new land, expand their influence, and much more. Each character has a unique pool of abilities and available actions, which will shape their game, whether its the Sultan, who cannot raise their own army and must depend on mercenaries, or the Murshid, who can use their political influence to interfere in other characters' battles. Players can purchase potent power cards, representing ploys, wise advisors, and specialist units from a market shared between all players. At the end of each year, players score points according to their own unique character objectives, and at the end of the game, the player with most points wins.<br/><br/>Crescent Moon is an area control game for four or five players. Take on the role of one of five radically asymmetric characters, each with their own objectives to fulfil, unique actions to utilise, and game-changing special powers to employ. Build symbiotic relationships with your allies, undermine your rivals, and choose your friends and enemies wisely in this cut-throat game of power and politics.<br/><br/>",

Brave explorers and their families are sent to establish a new city in the largest and deepest stone hall of the Great Mountain. You and your friends will manage the construction of this new capital, which will be known as the great Gnomopolis!<br/><br/>Gnomopolis is a fast and strategic game in which you must combine city growth with specialization of its population. An almost endless combination of buildings and workers can create ingenious systems of actions and scoring mechanisms in a frantic race for the win. With a play time of nearly 45 minutes, one to four players must think wisely to build their own city and trade with neighbours.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns, during which each player draws three gnomes (gnome meeples) from a cup. Then they can use these gnomes to construct buildings or perform actions. Actions can be a combination of specializing adults, hiring more gnomes, earning gold coins, building mechanical golems or controlling the workforce in a district. As the city grows, more gnomes immigrate there. At the end of the game, players count their points from coins and any workers employed in buildings (be careful with unemployed gnomes!). The player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>",

The powers lead to surprising interactions between the players! Cards must also be played to a specific position on the table. Whenever a card is played, in most cases you pick up the card that was previously in its position, requiring you to plan your morning tea carefully!<br/><br/>The round ends when a player plays the &quot;Elevenses&quot; card. It's time for tea! The players compare the value of their cards. Points are awarded to the highest scoring morning teas. The game continues until a player has 7 or more points. She has served the finest morning teas of all and wins the game!<br/><br/>The six-card expansion Elevenses: The Special Guests is included in the game. With this expansion, each player is dealt one special guest card in secret at the start of each round. Each guest will come to your morning tea only if you serve certain things. If you play the right combination of morning tea cards, the guest arrives, you reveal the card, and your morning tea goes up in value!<br/><br/>Game #2 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A dark rift has opened, spewing monsters of the Abyss to lay siege to the Citadel of Modhelm! All hope lies on the mighty heroes who unite to defend its walls.<br/><br/>B-Sieged: Sons of the Abyss is a fully cooperative castle defense board game that combines exciting combat action with classic resource management. In this thrilling battle, 1 to 6 players control the mighty Heroes of Modhelm, who must endure the siege of the encroaching enemies and hold out long enough for the Messenger to return with a powerful magic artifact that will break the enemy forces.<br/><br/>During their turn, Heroes may take 3 actions. They can spend these actions to visit the various buildings inside the Citadel to get resources (such as Food, Gold, Special Abilities, and Cards), repair damaged buildings, trade cards, fight Enemies from the walls, or try to use the powerful catapult at the center of the Citadel. The Heroes must coordinate their actions well to share resources, gather vital supplies, and survive the siege.<br/><br/>After the Heroes have acted, it&rsquo;s the Monsters' turn. Each monster figure on the board will activate and perform their actions according to its rank. For 12 rounds that encompass the 4 seasons, the heroes must fight to keep the citadel safe. If the messenger can return in time with the magic artifact, the abyssal forces will be cast back into the fiery darkness.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, a surprise disruption may summon the Avatar of the Abyss itself! This behemoth marches inexorably towards the citadel. Stop it in time, or it&rsquo;ll shatter the defenses, and destroy the citadel!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Well, on the five peninsulas of Grog Island, they can invest their loot in rock-solid businesses, such as peg-leg shops, carpentries for figureheads, workshops for voodoo dolls, or the infamous &quot;Grog Hole&quot; pub.<br/><br/>The core of Grog Island is its unique auction mechanism, which uses five colored dice. The players use these dice and the pips on them to create and raise bids. While the winner of an auction can claim buildings on certain peninsulas, the players who have passed are also rewarded: Not only do they receive goods like grog bottles or treasure maps but they also visit merchant ships where they can trade these goods for money, parrots or treasure chests. The auction mechanism of Grog Island makes for tactical and interesting gameplay as in certain moments, passing can be almost as rewarding as winning an auction. Finding the right balance between bidding and backing out is the key to winning.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one player has claimed a certain number of buildings, then all players score the secret goal cards they received both at the start of and during the game. These cards may give points for majorities on peninsulas as well as for claiming certain types of buildings or collecting certain goods. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each turn the players places one of their 3 followers on a modular board.

By contacting demons players are awarded Demonic Attention. When a Demon has run out of attention, a Demon is conjured and players can now pay more resources to worship said Demon in order to get special abilities (Demonic Powers, Artifacts, Treasures).<br/><br/>Demonic Powers are worth Worship Points (WP). The player with the most most coins and WP from demonic abilities and pacts is the winner.<br/>When all demonic powers have been awarded to the players new special areas are uncovered where players can earn more Worship Points by exchanging cubes for Attention, or making Pacts with Demons.<br/><br/>Game ends when a player has 4 active Pacts with a Demon, or when a certain number of Pacts have been acquired by all players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In September of 1944, three Allied airborne divisions dropped up to 60 miles behind German lines in Holland to seize and hold a series of roads and bridges until British ground forces could break through the front lines to link up with the paratroopers- to create an open road to the heart of the Third Reich.  Until now, the tragic yet fascinating story of Market-Garden has not been simulated on a level that allows an appreciation of the entire campaign, without bogging down in endless detail.  In Hell's Highway, players trace the leaden movement of XXX Corps along its jammed highway, drop the gallant paratroopers on the key bridges, and launch the unexpected panzers against the grim Arnhem defenders. Three scenarios and numerous deployment options allow players to explore the battle with historical hindsight, or to experience first-hand the confusion of those bloody days.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Some say Anansi is a trickster, but he is a spider for sure and sometimes even a man. Let me tell you why he is also known as the &quot;Keeper of Stories&quot;: One day, Anansi decided to gather all stories and become the wisest of all. After many years, he finally had all the stories in the world, but poor Anansi did not feel any wiser. Eventually he realized that true wisdom is not achieved by keeping knowledge to yourself, so he decided to share his stories and inspire people with them &mdash; and believe it or not, that was how this game was made!<br/><br/>In the trick-taking card game Anansi, you have to be smart about which tricks you are trying to get. Each trick represents a story, but stories untold are worth only a little. If you can acquire followers &mdash; by playing a card not to the trick, but for its indicated number of followers &mdash; you can match up your followers with stories to inspire them, and inspiring all your followers should always be your goal because this grants you the trickster's favor and sweet bonus points.<br/><br/>Note that cards played to gain followers can affect the trump suit, which means that the trump can change several times in a game. It is up to you to adapt to the new situation!<br/><br/>Anansi is in the same game line as Spicy, with the game box and card backs being decorated with a special metallic print in purple. For such a rich and cultural theme, publisher HeidelB&Auml;R Games paired up with Nigerian artist Dayo Baiyegunhi and South African artist Emmanuel Mdlalose to create a unique and colorful look for the story world of Anansi.<br/><br/>",

After generations of hiding and struggle, humanity discovered that the frenzied leviathans can be restored. Climbers willing to take the risk must explore the wilds and work together to remove a series of binding crystals to heal the leviathans roaming the world.<br/><br/>In Leviathan Wilds, 1-4 players will confront these colossal beings, with each creature being depicted across the spread of a spiral-bound storybook that makes up the game's board. The book also forms the basis of a connected campaign mode built around the game's story, with each of twenty included scenarios estimated to last around 45 minutes. Tougher difficulty levels are also available for added replayability.<br/><br/>Each character's deck of multi-use cards is unique, allowing them to climb, jump, and glide around the board in different ways. The number of cards left in the slim deck represents their grip on the leviathan's body; if the deck runs out, the player loses their grip and begins to fall down the board until they're able to reach a rest space, which resets their deck. Moving onto rest spaces also provides a way to regain one's grip without falling. Other spaces reduce a character's health or grip or they increase blight, a status that reduces their overall hit points.<br/><br/>The leviathan has its own deck of cards, which triggers various effects at the beginning of a player's turn, from targeted attacks that reduce health to effects that move players between spaces or loosen their grip. As the game progresses, the leviathan gradually gains &quot;rage&quot;, which intensifies the effect of its event cards.<br/><br/>Players' characters can move around a square grid overlaid on the creature's body by spending action points &mdash; the number being determined by a card played at the start of their turn &mdash; and their remaining hand of ability cards to reach the crystals and reduce them to zero. Victory is achieved by reducing all crystals, which vary in strength, to zero.<br/><br/>",

Competing teams of human explorers use space stations spread throughout the universe as bases for discovering new worlds and befriending aliens to help them in their quest. Explorer teams are not only racing each other, but meteors are striking planets and threatening these new worlds as well. Will your team be able to reach a planet in time to use its resources and protect it from future meteor strikes?<br/><br/>Cosmic Run is a quick, push-your-luck, space race for 1-4 players. On a turn, a player rolls dice and must commit at least 1 of them to one of the various exploration tracks or to an alien card. Some of the tracks require multiple identical dice, with the most valuable tracks costing many identical dice. However, once a player commits a die, it cannot be moved. So players have to decide between a conservative approach (making sure and steady progress along less valuable tracks) or an aggressive approach (pushing one's luck to try to move up the highly valued tracks).<br/><br/>Players may opt to use their dice to befriend aliens, rather than explore, because the aliens provide special powers that can eventually help them move along their exploration tracks even faster.<br/><br/>The game may be played competitively or cooperatively.<br/><br/>",

Zauberberg, you want to move the sorcerers' apprentices down the mountain ahead of the witches &mdash; but you don't always know how the will-o'-the-wisps will make the figures move.<br/><br/>To set up, place supports on the game board to elevate the starting area, then place six sorcerers' apprentices in the back row and four witches on their designated starting spaces. Add the five colored will-o'-the-wisp marbles to the bag.<br/><br/>On a turn, draw a will-o'-the-wisp, then place it at the top of one of the six starting channels and let it go. If the will-o'-the-wisp hits a figure, the ball will stop. Pick up this figure and move it to the next open colored space on the winding path that matches the color of the will-o'-the-wisp. If you're moving a sorcerers' apprentice, you might want to do it quickly because if the will-o'-the-wisp hits that same figure, you can move it once again! Don't rush moving the witches, though, since you want them to move as little as possible. If a will-o'-the-wisp doesn't hit any figures, then you must move a witch of your choice to the next matching colored space. Once all five will-o'-the-wisps have been drawn, return them to the bag and start again.<br/><br/>If you manage to move four sorcerers' apprentices to the bottom of the mountain before three witches get there, you win! You can adjust the difficulty of the game by requiring more sorcerers' apprentices or fewer witches or both. Alternatively, you can play the game competitively, with each player or team trying to get their group of four figures down the mountain first.<br/><br/>[Admin note: Magic Mountain is listed for 2-6 players, whereas Zauberberg is listed for 1-4 players, but the gameplay seems identical in both releases.]<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Time to enter a dungeon &mdash; a dungeon composed of dice! &mdash; to kill monsters and score as much as possible.<br/><br/>In Dungeon Academy, each player has a piece of paper that shows four dungeons, with each dungeon being a 4x4 grid. The game lasts four rounds, and in each round you will go through one of these dungeons. Each player also has a character card that shows some amount of life (red) and mana (blue) along with a special power.<br/><br/>What's actually in a dungeon is determined by dice that you roll at the start of the round. You roll sixteen dice, then let them settle in a 4x4 grid. The dice show red and blue monsters in both small and large sizes, as well as blue potions and red strength. You decide where to enter the dice dungeon and which dice to pass through in a continuous line that can change directions only orthogonally, and you draw this corresponding line on your personal grid until you exit at some other point of the dungeon without crossing over your line. You then claim the lowest available number card, with the number of cards matching the number of players.<br/><br/>Once everyone has finished drawing a line through the dungeon, you trace out that path step by step, removing life (1 or 2) to defeat red monsters (small or large) and mana (1 or 2) to defeat blue monsters (small or large). You place new tokens on your character as you pass through potions and strength spaces. Once you're through the grid, you score points for the monsters you defeated, and you choose one of four quests on your sheet for bonus points. (In the second round, you choose one of the three remaining quests, so your choices diminish over time.) In player order based on your number card, you take one of the available treasures, which provide points and powers. Your life and mana levels carry over into the next round.<br/><br/>In the second and third rounds, you replace one of the dice with a labyrinth die that can be passed through only in certain directions, and in the fourth round another die is replaced with the big boss die, giving you something giant to take on before ending the game and tallying your final score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The route-building game genre can be counted as the greatest passion of English game designer and history teacher Martin Wallace. And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything &ndash; from the rules to the game play &ndash; is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?<br/><br/>The game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements (ranging from cities to tiny villages) with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.<br/><br/>Building streets is very simple. One a player&rsquo;s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don&rsquo;t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can&rsquo;t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>Once a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn&rsquo;t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn (where he will also get another six gold to play with again). Players aren&rsquo;t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can&rsquo;t save forever.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player can&rsquo;t build any more roads or doesn&rsquo;t have any trade markers left.<br/><br/>Scoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn&rsquo;t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.<br/><br/>La Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it&rsquo;s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It&rsquo;s every player&rsquo;s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves &ndash; but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.<br/><br/>[Text is from a preview by Spielbox]<br/><br/>",

As the world crumbles, the Dark One will favor only a single unholy mass to be his Chosen in the vastness of eternity following the cataclysm. All others will be obliterated by his depraved will. Through bloodshed on the field of battle, divination of the unholiest arcana, and initiation of powerful cultists, you will build your cult and earn your rightful place.<br/><br/>Eschaton is a strategy game driven by a deck-building mechanic. All players begin with the same basic cult (deck) and an equal presence on the realm map. As the game progresses, each player utilizes the evil Influence of their existing Cultist cards to initiate new Cultists into their deck as they seek to earn the most Points of Favor from the Dark One. These Cultists carry different specialties: some are masters at arms, others strong wielders of arcane magics, and others provide even greater Influence to recruit stronger members.<br/><br/>",

Roll steel balls down your slide in order to knock the wooden ball in the central arena into your opponents' goal. Players compete in teams of two, with each team trying to protect one goal between them. (If you play individually, you will likely need to alternate between slides as it's difficult to roll balls down both slides at once.)<br/><br/>If you run out of steel balls, then you're at the opponents' mercy until they shoot, which will likely land a steel ball on your side of the board. If you knock the wooden ball into the opponents' goal, you score a point, then the next round begins with the steel balls remaining on the half of the board where they're currently located. The first team to score five points wins!<br/><br/>BONK features the same gameplay as Rollet but the games have important differences that affect play (and their prices):<br/><br/><br/>    The BONK game board is smaller, so gameplay tends to be faster.<br/>    The BONK game board is made from a single piece of curved wood whereas Rollet is made from two; this difference affects the curve of the game board and therefore the movement of the balls.<br/>    The slides in BONK are plastic whereas Rollet uses wooden slides.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "IOTA is a card game in which players score points by adding cards to a grid. The deck consists of 64 regular cards and two wild cards; each of the 64 cards contains three properties &ndash; color, shape and number &ndash; with each property coming in four different types. The two wild cards are identical and can be played in place of any other specific single card. They can also be recycled by a player who can replace a wild card with a card that works in that position.<br/><br/>To set up the game, each player is dealt a hand of four cards and one card &ndash; the &quot;starter&quot; &ndash; is placed face-up on the table. The remaining cards form a draw deck.<br/><br/>On a turn you can add 1-4 cards connected to the grid established by the starter card. All cards must be placed in the same line. A line consists of 2, 3 or 4 cards in a row in which each individual property (color, shape and number) is either the same on each card or different on each card. You can also choose to pass and place some, none or all of your cards on the bottom of the draw pile and take new ones.<br/><br/>Maximum line length is four cards. Cards needn't be placed right next to each other as long as they are in the same line, and some spaces on the grid will be impossible to fill.<br/><br/>To score a turn, add up the face values of cards in lines either created or extended on that turn. If any of those cards are part of two lines, they're counted twice. If on a turn a player completes a line that is four cards long, all points for the entire turn are doubled. Double again for any additional four card lines created. Double again if you play all four cards on a single turn. A four-card line is called a lot.<br/><br/>The game ends when the draw pile is depleted and one player plays his last card. Double points for that turn. The game is over. High score wins.<br/><br/>",

Can your guild sweep through its districts and gain power through recruiting influential citizens and acquiring valuable relics?<br/><br/>The revised edition of Arcana is a card game of recruitment and resource gathering for 2-4 crafty leaders. Command a guild of loyal agents during a series of district encounters against your opponents. Score the most prominent citizens, advantageous locations, and valuable treasures through bribery and power struggles. Collect the highest amount of victory points to become the master guild of Cadwallon!<br/><br/>This vibrant game creates a fantastical atmosphere for players to enjoy while they attempt to best their opponents through strategic card play. Make your guild the most influential by winning Stake cards and strengthening your deck with impressive Personalities, advantageous Locations, or tempting Relics to use in bribery.<br/><br/>The revised edition of Arcana introduces two new guilds to choose from, the Guild of Fortune-tellers and the Guild of Architects, as well a variety of optional rules that players can utilize to enhance their experience. Players can customize their guild, fulfill objectives, recruit Militia, invoke the ability of their Guild Masters, affect game play through random events, or optimize tactical strategy through card discards. Which variant will you use in your game?<br/><br/>Summary of Play<br/><br/>Arcana is played over a series of rounds that are comprised of two phases, the Intrigue phase and the Resolution phase. Send Agents from your unique guild deck to any of Cadwallon&rsquo;s districts to claim control of Stake cards: Personalities, Locations, and Relics, all of which award victory points.<br/><br/>During these district encounters players gain control of Stake cards by playing their Agent cards. Stake cards are won through meeting or exceeding the card&rsquo;s main arcanum: either Military, Political, Spiritual, or Financial. Whichever Agent has the highest matching arcanum type wins the current revealed Stake card in that district.<br/><br/>Of course if the Stake card you are after is a Personality card you can choose to bribe them with a Relic Card instead, immediately ending the phase and wresting the victory points from your opponents should you succeed.<br/><br/>Players can increase the mystery of the final outcome through bluffing. Players control two friendly distracts (piles of Stake cards) in which they can place their Agents facedown. Will your opponent chance opposing you when he is uncertain of your arcanum value?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sail the Seven Seas. Plunder the treasure. Make your crew walk the plank.<br/><br/>Munchkin Booty brings the greatest gold-grabbers in history &ndash; pirates! &ndash; to the world of Munchkin. Use your Silver Long Johns to beat the Lobster Mobster, drink your Demon Rum to fight off the Viking Kittens, and defend yourself with the Cutlass (or Cutlad, for the gents) against the Prince of Whales. But watch out for Sharks!<br/><br/>Plunder the seven seas as a Pirate, Naval Officer, or Merchant. Taunt your foes with your horrible Accent: British, Spanish, Dutch, or French. Equip your Half-Galleon with a Crow's Nest and Figurehead. But above all...level up!<br/><br/>Munchkin Booty is a standalone card game that's compatible with the original Munchkin and other titles in the same universe of games.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Booty from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Booty 2: Jump the Shark.<br/><br/>",

Over the course of the game, you will perform actions &mdash; and follow the actions of other players &mdash; to produce units, build fortifications, maneuver around the map, and spend your followers to climb the ritual track. Throughout the game, a haunting Cathedral will grow in the center of the board, and once it is completed, you will face &mdash; and gain the ability to control! &mdash; the physical manifestations of nightmares that are released upon the world. Nightmare Cathedral is a game of both strategy and tactics, where finding clever ways to follow your objectives and combining different strategies is the ultimate route to victory.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of Action cards. These Action cards display various effects that may be activated either on that player's own turn, or as a reaction when other players perform that action. When you are the Active Player, you will move your Dreamer to a Day space that is not adjacent to its current Night space and perform the Action associated with that Day space, as outlined on your own Action card.<br/>Inactive Players may react to your chosen Day Action.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two stages. During the first stage, the titular Nightmare Cathedral is built, piece by piece, as the game progresses. Once the final Cathedral piece is placed on the main board, the Nightmare Cathedral is finished, at which point the game transitions to the second stage. From this moment on, Nightmares, powerful beings channeling the presence of the completed Cathedral, enter the game board, Devouring Units in their path. However, as a player, you may also take actions to control a Nightmare, Commanding it to do your bidding.<br/><br/>The game end is triggered in one of the following ways:<br/><br/><br/>     The Time marker reaches a certain space on the Time track.<br/>     A single player reaches the final step of the Ritual track.<br/>     A certain number of Units have been devoured.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;If I have any worth, it is to live my life for God so as to teach these peoples.&rdquo; - St. Patrick<br/><br/>Legend has it that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland. True, there are no snakes anywhere on the island- but there have been none since before the last Ice Age! The legend is actually an allegory about his successes in converting Ireland to Christianity.<br/><br/>Banish the Snakes is a cooperative game that simulates Ireland in the 5th century, while the Roman Empire was collapsing in the west and Ireland was turning to the Christian religion. Players represent Saints- Patrick and others (up to six of you) who set out to convert the pagans on the island. You must work as a team to convert the people of Ireland before the barbarians completely overwhelm Britain- if you fail, the Irish will not be able to save Civilization in the following centuries!<br/><br/>The game board shows a map of Ireland in the 5th century, with four Provinces-the same as today- but no counties yet. Wooden tiles represent the People, Druids, Chiefs, and Kings, and of course the High King at Tara. It is your job to break into the interrelated influences between these groups of people and get your new ideas accepted.<br/><br/>Each turn a card is drawn, throwing new challenges at your team. The severity of the event is determined by the previous card, and so no two games can ever play the same. The cards introduce events and ideas of the time, new saints, and historic figures- like Neil of the Nine Hostages.<br/><br/>There is a diagram of Great Britain to keep track of the steady decline of Roman civilization in Great Britain. As different parts of Britain succumb to the barbarians, more and more difficult challenges are added to the deck, until finally Britain is completely overwhelmed, cutting off Ireland from the continent and ending the game.<br/><br/>If you succeed in your endeavor, Christianity will thrive in Ireland, while paganism overruns Western Europe. The arts, writing, literature and history will flourish on the Emerald Isle! Soon, Irish missionaries will bring these civilizing attributes back to Great Britain and mainland Europe- as Thomas Cahill says in his book, the Irish will save Civilization.<br/><br/>But if you fail&hellip;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Speeding through space, Burke's Gambit is a rugged company freighter on an extremely important mission, with its seasoned crew being tasked with finding powerful alien technology. What the crew finds instead is something they never expected: a dangerous parasitic organism has somehow made its way into the ship and inside the body of one of the crew members!<br/><br/>Just as the bio-organism contamination alarm goes off, one of the crew members seizes the chaotic moment and sabotages the freighter's engines. The ship, its crew, and the parasitic organism are all on a collision course with planet Earth, where further contamination of the world's population awaits.<br/><br/>Which of the crew are dedicated company personnel wanting the alien organism to reach Earth? Which are just crew wanting to identify the infected crew member? Most importantly, which member of the crew is infected?! Join the crew of Burke's Gambit on a wild space adventure with hidden affiliations and a hidden infected player.<br/><br/>In Burke's Gambit, players take on specific roles of Captain, Marine, Comms Officer and more as they take turns and roll a die. The possibilities of the die include damaging another player, healing themselves, looking at a crew affiliation card, or even scanning a player's diagnostic card. But if you roll an engine power up, you hasten the ship's arrival to Earth. When Burke's Gambit reaches Earth, a vote must be held to eject someone from the airlock (assuming anyone's left)!<br/><br/>",

They compete against each other as well as the game-controlled, mustachioed Dick Dastardly and his wheezy pup Muttley.<br/><br/>Races are simple, yet strategic, as players place cards indicating the terrain tiles to which their racer will move, with the last card played indicating where Dastardly and Muttley will end up. However, it wouldn't be wacky without a little trouble standing in the way. Racers need to dodge or negate traps set by Dastardly as he attempts to stay ahead of the pack. Racers can choose between single races lasting 10-15 minutes or the Championship mode, which offers unique rulesets changing from race-to-race before a winner is named.<br/><br/>Wacky Races: The Board Game will be released in both a regular and a deluxe edition, with the deluxe edition including pre-painted miniatures, while the regular edition will have one-color miniatures.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Both of these feelings come together in D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, with players reacting to cards as they pass to grab repeated objects.<br/><br/>In more detail, the 36 object tiles are spread out around the deck of cards. These objects are each pictured on cards in the deck exactly twice. The cards in the deck are revealed one by one, and if you think that an object on a card has appeared previously, then you can grab the corresponding object tile and place it in front of you. Are you sure of what you saw? You better hope so because if a newly revealed card matches an object tile lying in front of you &mdash; and an opponent spots that tile in time and identifies your false memory &mdash; then you're out of the rest of the round.<br/><br/>Once you finish going through the deck, players score points for the items they collected. A total of three rounds are played, and with each subsequent round players might find it harder to remember exactly what they've seen. Was the object shown before, or am I thinking of the previous round? Whoever collects the most points after three rounds wins!<br/><br/>",

Each step toward the castle is identified by a color and a shape. Players hold cards in their hands with cute defenders who also have a color and shape. When a card is played that matches the location of the monster, that monster is captured and thrown in the dungeon.

Each player starts with a lord, a castle and some troops in one of the villages.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, check to see whether one or more players have won, with shared wins being possible through alliances created by marriage. Winning solo is tough, so players need to negotiate, make deals and form alliances. To do this, players use their three embassy pawns; by spending a pawn, a player can have a three-minute-long private conversation with one or more other players to make whatever deals they wish. You have only three pawns, so plan well for these talks!<br/><br/>Players draw cards each round: character cards that can bring new lords into play and event cards such as good harvests, good weather and taxes. They pay the costs to play cards, with some cards being playable at any time to upset current events with a surprise assassination or underground invasion. Players then receive income, with which they can buy troops and buildings, and move lords and troops among villages, with troops never being able to travel without a lord. If troops from more than one player end up in the same village, they battle until one side is eliminated or forced to flee.<br/><br/>If a player controls all villages in a fief and has at least one castle there, he can purchase the title of the fief and assign it to a lord, with the title being passed to an heir if the lord subsequently dies. Players also try to secure the titles of king and pope, which provide benefits of their own, as well as points. Each title of fief, king or pope is worth a point, and the first player to collect three points wins. Two players win if they are allied and have a total of four points.<br/><br/>The 2011 version of Fief has vastly revised rules with new materials and set-ups for shorter game play in addition to the long game.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Fief<br/>    Fief 2<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sixth Fleet is a simulation game of near-future combat for control of the Mediterranean Basin.  As commander of the U.S. or Soviet fleet and respective allies, you must form your ships into Task Forces  and attempt to cripple the enemy&rsquo;s capital ships and submarines.  Your limited air assets must be carefully assigned to defensive and offensive missions.  Commando, parachute and amphibious assault units stand at the ready to capture vital objectives.  Most important, you must protect your supply and replenishment ships, or your fleet will be unable to maintain combat momentum.  Sixth Fleet is a comprehensive simulation of the myriad elements involved in future naval confrontation.<br/><br/>Each 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.<br/>Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.<br/>Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.<br/>About 14 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenarios).<br/><br/>Part of Victory Games Fleet Series.<br/><br/>",

One player flips over the top card, which depicts colored objects &ndash; trains, birds, cups, etc. &ndash; stacked vertically or horizontally, then everyone tries to recreate this colored sequence with her own set of cups. The first player to do slams the bell, revels in the soul-brightening &quot;ding&quot;, then (if correct), claims the card.

The battle robots are gathered in the arena, and the crowd is screaming for some laser-blasting action in this title match. The operators are starting up their control hardware, and we expect nothing but a whole new level of cybernetic devastation. In the end, there will be only one operator to rule the arena... LET THE BATTLE BEGIN!<br/><br/>In VOLT, each player takes the role of an operator controlling one robot to challenge other players. By &quot;programming&quot; three steps ahead, players try to anticipate the moves of other robots, aim to destroy them, or try to control spaces in the arena that get them victory points. VOLT includes an easy-to-begin training guide but still leaves experienced players with plenty of different modules to make their robot battles even more exciting and merciless.<br/><br/>Plan your next steps ahead by quickly grabbing a starting number in order for your robot to run or shoot at just the right moment later on. Push the other robots into pits or shoot them away with your lasers to gain victory points. Sounds simple &ndash; it is simple, well, at least the rules. But destroying the others without taking damage yourself is quite the hefty challenge. Fortunately, destroyed robots don't have to wait long for their next foray into the ring. They reboot in the next round.<br/><br/>VOLT&nbsp;is a completely revised and extended edition of Emerson Matsuuchi's game&nbsp;VOLT: Robot Battle Arena that also includes AI rules for a game with 2-3 players and a Championship mode.<br/><br/>",

Players may attempt to trip up another player's story by wagering a token (&quot;But the Prussian Army had dissolved by that time, m'lord, so you could not have possibly fought it single-handedly&quot;), whereas the storyteller must counter with another token (and an excuse) or swallow their pride and incorporate it into their story (with another excuse). There are also a few, minor details, mostly used to get boring storytellers to stop. The game is won after each player has told one story. Each player, in turn, gives *all* their tokens to another player they believe has told the best story--so collecting the most tokens doesn't make you the winner, it makes you be able to choose the winner.

When a stack grows over five pieces, pieces from the bottom of the stack are removed to bring the stack back down to five.  Pieces of a player's own color that are taken by that player are reserved to re-enter the game at a later time; pieces of the opponent's color are kept as captured.  Reserved pieces can be entered on a turn in any space on the board in place of making a move of pieces; strategic use of reserved pieces can make the game by utilizing them to capture stacks controlled by opponent(s).<br/><br/>Sackson includes the game In his 1969 book, A Gamut of Games.  The book  makes a reference to the Whitman Publishing  Company production of 1965, along with reporting that the two-handed version was first described in the October 1963 issue of Scientific American Magazine.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of two main phases: The summer phase and the winter phase. The aim of the game is to collect as many tiles as possible. Players have two movement points per turn and are only allowed to move to untaken tiles. When a player leaves a tile he gets to take it and place it in front of him. Food and artifacts are kept face down, but weapons and mammoths are kept face up. Whoever hunts down the biggest mammoth in the summer phase will start the winter phase.<br/><br/>Players also have to visit the four winter camps during the summer to store supplies for the upcoming winter. If a player is not able to visit all four camps during summer, he will have fewer hunters in the winter phase.<br/><br/>There are a lot of different tiles:<br/>- Food tiles score 1 to 3 points at the end of the game, depending on the type of food.<br/>- Rare and valuable artifact tiles increase in value depending on the number of identical tiles you collected.<br/>- Weapons are used to hunt down mighty mammoths.<br/>- Path-tiles remain on the board and guarantee a minimum amount of maneuverability.<br/>- Caves are connected with each other and may be used to cover big distances while moving.<br/><br/>This game is based on the same prototype as Zombiegeddon.<br/><br/>",

But the central hill only supports a certain number of goats with food.<br/><br/>Every card has a number from 1 to 50 and from 1 to 5 goat's heads printed on it. At the start of the game, every player receives eight cards, and eight tricks are played in one game. There are also hill cards which have each two quarters of an island with a number between 1 and 8 written on it.<br/><br/>The player who played the highest-numbered card wins the trick and is first player for the next. However, during the first four tricks, the player who played the lowest-numbered card, adds a part of the central hill to the middle of the table, marking it with the wooden goat. After the first four tricks, the players know how many goats the central hill supports. This represents the goal limit.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player who collected the most goat's heads without going over the limit dictated by the central hill. A proven strategy is to spam your opponents with the goats that you probably won't need.<br/><br/>A variant of the game consists of playing a number of rounds equal to the number of players, and totaling the points.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>- 50 playing cards<br/>- 12 hill cards<br/>- 1 wooden goat<br/>- 1 rule book<br/><br/>",

After placing a tile, a player can occupy a room on that tile with one of his three archeologists as long as no other room of the same color is already occupied in that chain. When the chain is closed &mdash; that is, when the chain has no &quot;loose ends&quot; that can be expanded upon &mdash; any archeologists in that chain's room return to their players, and players score 1 point for each archeologist they receive. The game ends when somebody reaches 15 points, and the player who has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Compass games website:)<br/><br/>In November 1700, King Carlos II of Spain died without an heir. The long-standing feud between the Bourbons and Habsburgs erupted once again as both sides pressed their claim to the throne. &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; is a two-player Card-Driven wargame that elegantly recreates this epic struggle using a point-to-point map and a single deck of 55 cards. Action cards are used to activate armies for movement and siege, while event cards bring historical and special events into play that can swing the tide of fortune when least expected. Each turn represents one year, each corps represents 10,000 men of all arms and each leader represents a major commander and his staff.<br/><br/>The game features an easy and intuitive battle system that highlights a unique aspect of this war: team-based battle command, perhaps the most famous example being the extraordinary success achieved by the partnership of two of the war&rsquo;s most prominent commanders, the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Bourbon cause has talented leaders as well, notably Marshals Villars, Vendome and Berwick. These and other leaders are rated for Tactical and Command capabilities and they significantly influence the course of events.<br/><br/>The map stresses the importance of fortresses in a war that was probably the high-point of formal siege warfare. Fortresses in this era rarely held out against a besieger that had the necessary time and manpower to conduct a proper siege, and the game neatly recreates this with a simple siege table that leaves room for unusually stout defenses or quick collapses.<br/><br/>Victory points are gained or lost by the Alliance player and game victory comes either through automatic victory or based on final VPs after the 1713 turn.<br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)<br/><br/>&quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; is a two player Card-Driven wargame depicting the &quot;War of the Spanish Succession&quot;. The war was fought primarily to determine the fate of the Spanish throne and its dominions but also represented a continuing struggle for political, religious and economic dominance. One player represents the interests of the French claimant, Philip V (the Bourbons), while the other player represents the interests of the Austrian claimant, Charles III (the Alliance).<br/><br/>Each turn is one year. Each unit represents approximately 10,000 men of all arms. Leader counters represent the named personality and his staff.<br/><br/>24 pages of rulebook including extended example of play and designer's notes.<br/><br/>",

Instead the commodities are displayed on the board in a number of &quot;nomad camps.&quot;  If your move brings you to a camp, you must present a gift to the camp -- then you can trade your cards for any cards in the camp.  You can also buy goods from the deck at &quot;oasis&quot; squares.  Once you've amassed a number of a particular commodity, you head for the city where that commodity is bought.  There are a few other details to complicate matters, but basically everyone repeats this process until someone has the 500 cash in hand to win the game.

Each player starts with five camels in their color (or six in an introductory game), and the game board is seeded with eight goods on the spaces numbered 1-8, with demand markers placed on the goods at spaces 1, 2, 7 and 8. The first player in the game takes one action, the second player two, and so on until someone takes four actions, after which each player can take up to four actions on their turn. Actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Place or move an unladen camel of your color into an empty space: 1 action<br/>    Place or move an unladen camel of your color into an occupied space: 2 actions<br/>    Pick up a good and place it on the camel in that space: 1 action; if any demand markers are on this space, you keep them.<br/>    Move a good along a chain of your camels, ending with it on top of one of your unladen camels: 1 action<br/>    Steal a good from on top of an opponent's laden camel, placing it under one of your camels in the same space: 1 action and a theft marker; if you have no theft markers, you can't do this.<br/><br/><br/>If you move a good to a camel located in the city that wants that good (as indicated by color), then you remove that good from the board and keep it. As soon as four goods have been picked up (not necessarily delivered), pause the game and place a demand marker on each good still on the board; in addition, refill the empty numbered spots with a good from the bag.<br/><br/>Once the final four goods have been drawn from the bag, the game ends immediately following the next delivery. Players score points based upon what they've collected: Rare goods (of which there are three each of four types) are worth 6 points each; common goods (nine each of four types) are worth 3 points each; and each demand marker is worth 1 point.

        "description": "&quot;The world is drowning. When The Everrain began, no alarms were rung; no calls to action were cried. But as the weeks became months, and the months flowed into years, it became apparent that the rain would not stop. It&rsquo;s been 5 years now, and the rain has not ceased for a minute in that time. Lands and places have begun to disappear beneath the waves, and before long the rising tides will take us all. We must do something, or a watery grave will be the fate of everything to grace the land. At first we knew not of the cause of The Everrain, but it has since become painfully apparent that the Old Gods of the ocean have awoken, and they are angry. For too long the people and creatures of the earth have prospered, and the Old Gods have arisen to usher in a new age of the Sea. We must do something, before all is lost to the rising tides. Assemble your crew, brave hero, and find a way to grant the Gods peace and return them to their slumber.  Stop The Everrain&hellip; or drown in the flood of the new world.&quot;<br/><br/>The Everrain is a cooperative exploration game where players must each assemble their own motley crew of spirited mariners and take to the dark seas of a world drowning under the curtain of an endless and oppressive storm that threatens to drown the world. The ancient Old Ones of the sea have awoken and begun to reshape the world in their image, and unless something is done all will drown in the rising tides. Players must explore this dark and foreboding world, completing quests, expanding their crew, upgrading their ship and investigating the source of the Everrain before it is too late.<br/><br/>Starting from humble beginnings, each player must traverse the seas of the Everrain to discover new places. The board is randomly generated from modular tiles, leading to a completely unique setup each time the game is played.<br/><br/>Each player begins with their own ship and a skeleton crew, but more experienced crew can be found in the darkly lit taverns of port towns, saved from shipwrecks and even be rewarded for completing quests. The game is progressed by completing quests which can trigger important plot points, but players must be wary as the Old God&rsquo;s minions also seek to advance their own agendas. Combat can take place from ship to ship and even aboard a player&rsquo;s vessel, so each crew member must be ready for almost anything!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each round, each player receives one of the eight silhouettes (which are numbered 2-8 with one blank), while three silhouettes are placed in the center of the table as suspects and the final silhouette is dubbed the victim. (With three players, the #2 is removed from the game.) You have to determine which suspect is the culprit, either to accuse him or to lure the other players into accusing someone who's innocent!<br/><br/>All players secretly look at their silhouettes, then pass them right, then look at the new silhouette they received. The first player of the round secretly looks at two of the three suspects, optionally swapping the victim for one of these suspects. This player then places a colored accusation marker below one of the suspects. The next player looks at the two suspects not just marked with an accusation marker, then places a colored accusation marker of their own, covering any markers already beneath that suspect. This continues until all four players have placed an accusation marker, with each player not being allowed to look at the suspect just accused.<br/><br/>The round ends, and players reveal the suspects. Who's the culprit? The suspect bearing the highest number &ndash; except if the #5 is among the suspects, in which case the suspect with the lowest number is guilty. (The suspect with no number is always innocent.) Anyone who has accused the correct suspect receives their accusation marker back. Any markers incorrectly placed are flipped colored-side down and given to the player who owns the marker on top of the stack. The first player token rotates clockwise, then a new round begins.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn if a player has eight or more tokens &mdash; or has no tokens &mdash; then the game ends, and that player loses.<br/><br/>Earlier editions of In a Grove supported 3-4 players, while the 2021 edition contains slight changes to the rules and components to allow for play with 2-5 people.<br/><br/>",

During each game, players embark on tricky and mighty quests into ever-changing dangerous caves and dungeons swarmed with monsters and terrible creatures that try to slaughter them, while heroes try to gain treasures as well as better equipment in order to complete the missions.<br/><br/>Since hordes of monsters repeatedly cross the path of our heroes, bloody clashes are inevitable in order to achieve victory! That is why Super Fantasy uses a simple yet unique dice-based system. Players have a pool of six dice to roll that they manage according to the action they want to perform (such as movement, attack, etc.) and its effectiveness. Each face of the dice shows either a 1, 2 or the Special Power symbol and the sum of the results shown represents the effectiveness of the action performed by the heroes. Every time the Special Power symbol occurs, the hero can choose to charge one of his abilities; once fully charged, the hero can unleash its power against the enemies!<br/><br/>Super Fantasy features double-sided modular board pieces for creating countless scenarios combinations, six mighty heroes and three unique and powerful abilities for each hero, throwing players into a fast-paced world in which anything can happen!<br/><br/>",

Some describe it as an inversion of Liar's Dice.<br/><br/>Wearing their decorative feathers, Indian tribes gather regularly for Pow Wows to talk, celebrate and dance.  There are also competitions for determining who is the bravest, the strongest, or the cleverest.  Join the Pow Wow!<br/><br/>Each player gathers around and draws a random feather card.  Each places it, without looking at its face value, upon their forehead affixing it on their headbands.  You see everyone's feather cards except your own.  Now the bidding and bluffing and the guessing begins...  On your turn, you can either challenge the previous player's bid or increase that bid.  When a challenge inevitably occurs, everyone takes off their feather cards and totals up the values to determine whether the bidder or the challenger has lost.  Whoever loses gets a buzzard affixed to his/her forehead and whoever gets three buzzards is out of the game.  The cleverest of this Pow Wow is the last person not kicked out of the game.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Coyote<br/><br/><br/>",

A battle so ferocious, that the villagers fearing for their lives, acquire the help of a powerful Wizard, who casts a spell over the Dragon Lords to keep them imprisoned in a circle of combat and to be freed only at the battle&rsquo;s end. Their struggle continues to this very day, even though the Princess and their fateful story have long passed into legend.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rod Hockey is a relatively inexpensive representation of the dome-style hockey games found in many arcade halls.<br/><br/>Using steel rods, plastic or metal hockey players slide along defined track segments.  There are five players and one goalie per side, just like real hockey.  Players simultaneously turn and move their five metal rods to shoot the puck and pass.  Games can be played using a timer or to a set number of points.<br/><br/>Many different versions of this game have been published over the last 50+ years.<br/><br/>Steel rods with metal gears were used before plastic ones, the plastic gear system was quickly abandoned as gears would not last. From there a curved spring was used (ImageID: 427829) from rod to player holding slider. This worked well for durability. This changed the game though considerably, as there was a bit of spring action in shooting. Slap shots were less powerful, but wrist shots worked better. Many different ice layouts were made for rod and player movement within the defined track segments. Swiveled tracks made players look like they were skating down the ice. This changed play and tactics for each game, it was considered having home ice advantage, as you were used to your game surface design. You knew how the puck bounced off the boards and where to exploit the best scoring chances. Various pucks were used, heavier ones worked better with the gear system, lighter ones worked better with the spring system. The puck with the steel ball in center moved the fastest and was most popular for the avid player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Momiji, you attempt to fulfill objectives by collecting the most valuable autumn leaves from the Imperial Garden in ancient Japan.<br/><br/>You start with a hand of six leaf cards and a series of three landscape powers that combine to form a unique panorama. (For the first game, landscapes are assigned, but they can be drafted in subsequent games.) Leaf cards come in 4-6 types depending on the number of players, with values of 0-3 in each type. Start with four random cards in the central playing area, sorted by type. Place 4-6 randomly chosen objective tokens in the center of play; sample objectives are collecting the most 0s, having the most cards of a specific type, or having the highest sum of visible cards at game's end.<br/><br/>On your turn, choose one of these three options:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect leaf cards: Take all the leaves of one type from the central display and add them to your hand; if you wish, pay one acorn token to reveal four new leaf cards prior to choosing a type.<br/>     Play leaf cards: Place 1-2 leaf cards of the same type or two or more cards of different types in your player area. Each type is placed in its own pile, with 0 being the first card you can play of a type; each subsequent card must the same number or at most one larger. Once you play a 3 on a pile, cover that pile with a torii token as that pile is now closed for you. If you play different types, then after playing, each pair of adjacent topmost cards in your area; if both cards show an acorn on the adjacent corners, you take two acorn tokens from the reserve.<br/>     Activate a objective token: Pay three acorn tokens to place an objective token in your player area. This activates the objective, and anyone might score for it at game's end.<br/><br/><br/>Once during a turn, you can discard two cards from your hand for one acorn token or spend an acorn to use a landscape power or do both of these actions. You can use each landscape power at most once during a game.<br/><br/>When the leaf card deck is empty or after 4-6 leaf piles are closed with a torii token, the game ends. For each pile of leaves, you score points equal to the value of the topmost card multiplied by the number of cards in the pile. Remaining acorn tokens are worth 1 point each. For each activated objective, you see who best meets the condition and therefore scores points; if the player holding the token scores, they receive 10 points, whereas anyone else who scores that objective receives 3 points. Each player scores in case of a tie. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A boardgame based on a computer game (instead of the other way around) and designed by Klaus Teuber, Anno 1503 views the era of colonization strictly from the home country perspective. Two to four players send ships to explore islands scattered about a 5 x 12 square ocean (the more players, the  more islands). The settlement of the new lands is, however, strictly abstract.<br/><br/>Each player's turn begins with the roll of one 6-sided die. A &quot;6&quot; is a random event (pirates, fire or good fortune - bad twice as often as lucky, and most likely to damage players who are doing well). On other results, each player gains a commodity from one of his five workshops. The player who rolled may then buy commodities from the bank, sell them to his colonists for gold (no trading among players), or use them in various combinations to recruit new colonists, promote existing ones, or build ships. After that, ships can sail for the unknown lands.<br/><br/>Each island bears on its hidden side an outpost, a treasure or a trade agreement. After being discovered, these items are brought back to the home country (and the ship is removed from play, requiring the player to build a new one in order to keep searching). Outposts increase the productivity of workshops. Treasure yields either gold or free colonist promotions. Trade agreements reduce the gold needed to buy commodities from the bank.<br/><br/>Besides being useful in these ways, outposts, gold and agreements are among the game's victory conditions. A player wins by being to first to attain three out of five objectives, namely, four outposts, 30 gold, three trade agreements, three colonists promoted to the top rank of &quot;merchant&quot; and the construction of four public buildings. The buildings (8 types, each bringing some advantage) cost nothing but don't become available until a player has recruited at least four colonists. After that, each new colonist adds a building (unless they've been preempted by other players; there aren't enough for everyone).<br/><br/>Overall, the game falls squarely into the &quot;simultaneous solitaire&quot; category. Except in the race for islands, the players scarcely interact at all. They do, however, have a great many choices to make in the course of play.<br/><br/>",

Not long ago they lived among us and they used their cunning magic to look like us humans.<br/>They lived with their cattle in the mountains. Their caves were beautiful and luxurious with a lot of silver, gold, gems, and a table full of delicious food. In Sweden, there is an expression for this &ldquo;Rich as a troll&rdquo;.<br/>Trolls were not evil if you didn&rsquo;t treat them badly, they could even be helpful to those who treated them well. But they often played tricks on humans. Their magic power (trollkraft) could distort the vision of humans so the troll looked like a human, an animal, a log, and a stone and even become invisible. But they also had some weaknesses. They couldn&rsquo;t stand the sounds of church bells or steel, not to mention the sight of sun.<br/><br/>Trolls &amp; Princesses is a &ldquo;worker movement&rdquo; game. You play as one of four troll clans and to get the mountains king&rsquo;s favour, you try to impress him. The players get favour (in the form of victory points) when they do what trolls usually do: swap changelings, &ldquo;hire&rdquo; humans, tear down church bells, kidnap princesses, build their cave, and use troll magic. To succeed, the players must collect resources and move around their trolls to do different actions. The player with the most victory points at the end can crown himself the ultimate troll clan leader.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

While the color and number arrangement is the same on all player boards, the starting point differs on each board. (The second edition of Tr&auml;xx includes a pad of individual score sheets instead of erasable boards.)<br/><br/>To play, shuffle the deck of fifteen cards, then reveal the top card, which will show four or five colored hexagons. Playing at the same time, each player takes an erasable pen and draws a path on their game board &mdash; with this path starting at or at least passing through the starting point on their board &mdash; that covers up to as many hexagons as were revealed, with the colors of the hexagons in your path matching those shown on the card. Thus, if the card shows two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow, then your path can cover at most two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow.<br/><br/>Once all players have drawn their path, reveal the next card, continuing the path in either direction and covering only as many hexagons of the proper colors as is shown on that card. A path cannot cross itself.<br/><br/>When your path crosses a number, call out that number. If you're the first one to reach it, you'll score that many points at game end; if others have reached it first, you score half this many points, rounded up. Once you've finished all fifteen cards, the game ends and you lose one point for each space not covered. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Towers of Arkhanos is a dice drafting, tower building game for 2 to 4 players. Fast and fun family game that plays in about 20 to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVES<br/><br/>In The Towers of Arkhanos, players must jointly build arcane towers to channel the power of past civilizations. For this, your master and apprentices must use magic stones (dice) and apply abilities written in the book of magic, acquiring prestige and becoming the magician with incredible reputation in the kingdom.<br/><br/>The player will control one of the magic schools(different colors) from the realms of Drunagor and try and build the magic towers in order to gain more prestige points to be appointed the greatest wizard of the realm.<br/><br/>END GAME:<br/><br/>The match ends at the end of the 8th round (2-4 players) or the 9th round (3players). At that point, incomplete towers will also earn points. Thus, players who have meeples allocated on any of the towers (regardless of whether they are external or central) receive the following score:<br/>1st place in arcane influence: 3 points of prestige;<br/>2nd place in arcane influence: 2 points of prestige;<br/>Draw in arcane influence: 1 point of prestige.<br/><br/>In addition, each meeple in the players magic book will also yield 1 prestige point. Add up the prestige points of each player and the one with the most prestige points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Will you take the wizard's robe and accept the challenge or be forgotten by the magic high council of the realm?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Procyon is a star 11 light-years from Earth, visible in our skies as the brightest star in the Canis Minor constellation. Since the system contains the remains of a collapsed star it was bound to be rich in heavy elements, ripe for industrialization. It was thus no surprise, that in 2104 this was one of the first extrasolar systems to be colonized. The surprise came 3 years later, when an ancient artefact belonging to a clearly alien civilization was discovered under the settlement. The observatories picked up the unmistakable tachyon radiation of a fleet slowing down from faster-than-light approaching the system - preparing for the worst case scenario, the UN dispatched its entire Armada to relieve the minimal defenses the settlement holds, while their scientists worked hard to decipher the alien communications, and understand their newfound enemy whose name was revealed to be the Aethyn.<br/><br/>Defence of Procyon III is a highly asymmetric game of four players in two teams: one player takes charge of the Alien space navy, one the Alien ground force, while the other team of the Human space navy admiral and the ground forces' commander stands in their way. The space board uses a hex board, while the ground board is a point-to-point network of locations. The game is played over 12 turns, using card driven, low luck mechanisms that quickly unfold into a fast paced game of combat strategy - presented with countless high quality miniatures in a rich, thematic world. The two commanders of a side will have to work together closely to make sure there are no weaknesses for the enemy to exploit, yet their different mechanisms and different theaters will ensure each player is comfortably occupied with their own responsibilities - avoiding the alpha player issue common in team games.<br/><br/>The game also comes with an automated opponent that takes charge of one of the side. One or two players can play cooperatively against the opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Starting with a stack of 6 random Numbsters (plus the Mouth card) you&rsquo;ll need to eat, move, and manipulate your way to victory. If you can get down to just one Numbster and the Mouth remaining in your hand, you win!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Each turn, draw a new Numbster into your hand, placing it at the top of the stack.<br/><br/>Next, you may move one card to a different position in the stack OR swap any two cards&rsquo; positions.<br/><br/>Lastly, it&rsquo;s feeding time: one Numbster must eat another one.<br/><br/>Typically, this requires two sequential Numbsters (for example, 16 and 17) separated only by the Mouth card. The smaller Numbster in the sequence can eat the bigger one, discarding it and starting a new turn.<br/><br/>Of course, these Numbsters are odd creatures. Each one has an optional special ability that changes how the other Numbsters eat, allowing for powerful plays and big bites!<br/><br/>The ability on the top Numbster in the stack is considered active while showing; when it&rsquo;s used, that Numbster slides to the bottom of the stack. But be careful &ndash; if at any point the Mouth card reaches the top of the stack, it triggers its game-ending special ability&hellip;and eats YOU!<br/><br/>",

You want to leave a legacy, with your name living far into the future. Make strategic relationships, well-timed investments, and marvelous heirlooms to leave a lasting mark.  Most importantly, identify the ideal successors to carry your reputation and fame across multiple centuries. This strategic, action-selection, economic game challenges you to navigate events of the past, present, and future to cement your legacy. What kind of legacy will you create?  How will YOU be remembered?<br/><br/>Legacies is unique in its integration of primary mechanisms including: multi-use cards, market manipulation, area control/worker placement, variable round-ends, variable player powers, and variable scoring.  Many paths exist to build your fame, but it would be foolish to focus only on your own heirlooms and industries as that path will likely benefit your opponents more than it will benefit you.<br/><br/>The player cards and entire board evolve throughout the game highlighting inflation, and more importantly, showcasing the visual progression from the 19th century into the 20th and eventually the 21st century creating an effect that carries the player through a journey that truly feels as if it spans 300 years in just a couple of hours of game-play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

(The game board is double-sided, with different values on each side.) The numbers come in five colors, and players start the game by drawing two tokens (also in five colors) from a bag and placing them on a rack, thereby hiding the color of the tokens from other players.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can either (1) play as many tokens as they want in a continuous chain, with the first token being placed next to an occupied space or the center space, then drawing one token from the bag or (2) drawing two tokens and placing none on the board. A player can hold at most five tokens on their rack.<br/><br/>When a player places tokens, the color of the token must match the space being covered; immediately score the points shown on this space. A player can choose to place a non-matching token face down on a space in order to reach another space, but they score no points for the face-down token. Alternatively, a player can play multiple tokens of the same color on a matching space and score the listed number of points for each token placed.<br/><br/>The game board has a number of dark grey spaces on it. The game ends at the end of the round in which all of these spaces are occupied or a player cannot draw enough tokens to complete their turn. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

The player controls the leadership of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and, peripherally, the German Central Staff who assumes greater and greater control over their ally. The Austro-Hungarians have unique challenges as they try to survive the onslaught of the &ldquo;Russian Steamroller&rdquo; and try to conquer the Serbs in the South. The mission will be complicated by the perseverance of those enemies; the difficulties with new fronts in Romania, the Balkans, and the Italian border; and the difficulty of keeping the Empire's restive nationalities from revolting from Hapsburg Rule.<br/><br/>The war started poorly for the Austro-Hungarians, with major Russian advances in the East and no progress against the Serbians. As time went on and the Austro-Hungarians bounced from one crisis to another, the Germans started to take more control as the price for their aid. In the end, the war was too much for the disparate nationalities of Austria-Hungary to take, and when it became clear that the Central Powers could not win the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated.<br/><br/>Can you succeed in keeping the Hapsburg Monarchy intact? Play Hapsburg Eclipse and find out!<br/><br/>Hapsburg Eclipse has a sister game titled Ottoman Sunset, depicting the struggle of their Central Powers ally, the Ottoman Empire. If in possession of both games, a Combined Game is playable, either as a two player co-op game or as a large two-front solitaire game.

Over the centuries, many of the Wells have fallen Dark, but if the players can find and unseal the remaining Light Wells they prevent Xulth&ucirc;l from gaining substance and win the game. If Xulth&ucirc;l&rsquo;s Shadows, however, manage to defile a single Light Well, the demon will gain a body and enter the Realm. If this happens, the players must defeat Xulth&ucirc;l in battle to save the Realm.<br/><br/>Players control avatars, heroic champions imbued with unique masteries over Light. Each turn, the players move through the Realm, confronting their fate, battling creatures with deadly abilities, and engaging the services of cities and mystics in order to gather the potions, treasure, and soulshards they will need to defeat the stronghold Guardians and unseal the Wells they protect. The Light or Dark nature of each Well is revealed only when its Guardian is defeated.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Xulth&ucirc;l&rsquo;s Shadows are thickening in the Shadow Realm and will enter the game at random times in random locations, seeking the one Well that will bring about the entrance of their master.<br/><br/>",

Each player also has three secret targets they must eliminate, without being discovered. The players have two actions each turn from the following choices: move any character anywhere on the board, eliminate a character (different ways of doing this), or make an identity check by the police. The trick is that when a character is eliminated, nobody says by whom or how! You must apply yourself in blending your true hitman in a crowd of possible suspects, or guess which character is the hitman of the other players.<br/><br/>As time goes by in 10' to Kill, you will feel pressure and suspicion weigh on your shoulders. Ten minutes is a short time, but it can sometimes be very long when all eyes are on you! You'll have to bluff and use discretion to eliminate your targets...and maybe the competitor's hitman!<br/><br/>Are you ready to become the most prestigious hitman?<br/><br/>",

Despite simple rules each game quickly develops into an exciting challenge. The goal of two players or two teams is to be the first to bring their own balls home.  But that is easier said than done, because only strong team play and forethoughted, flexible tactics pave the way to success.  Perceive the plans of the opposing team and cancel them.  But caution is required:  it can happen that you must lose ground, although you do not want to.  Finally, heavenly creatures interfere during play.  A powerful warrior may step on the board and rearrange the balance of power.  An angel may appear to rescue someone from great emergency - but whom?<br/><br/>TAC is suitable both for fast, fun games and for tense, strategic, but friendly games.  Each game develops differently from the last and guarantees timeless fun.<br/><br/><br/>See 6-TACVery similar to the traditional games DOG, Super Tock 4, Super Tock 6, Tock 6 and Super Tock 8<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late Middle Ages, trade flourished in Europe. Economic groups like the Hanseatic League, the Welser and Fugger families, and merchants from Northern Italy established trading posts and factories in all of the important cities throughout Europe. These businesses provided the population with goods of all kinds, such as fur from the north, cloth from Flanders, wine from the south, and spices from India. The most important commodity of all was salt. In the Middle Ages salt was highly prized it was used to preserve food.<br/><br/>In Catan Histories: Merchants of Europe, you are a powerful merchant! Start your trading posts in three cities. Recruit new merchants and send them to distant cities to establish trading posts and expand your interests. The more trading posts you have, the more commodities are at your disposal which you can sell profitably in foreign cities. To ensure that your commodities arrive safely at their destination, you must open up trade routes and equip caravans. You win the game if you are the first to deliver all of your commodities to foreign cities.<br/><br/>Catan Histories: Merchants of Europe is a twist on the 2010 release Settlers of America: Trails to Rails from designer Klaus Teuber and publisher Mayfair Games. Game play is similar in both games: Players start with three locations on the game board, collect resources depending on a die roll, spend resources to move and build, and branch out to new locations with a long-term goal of delivering goods to opponents' cities. The first player to deliver all of his goods wins the game.<br/><br/>Instead of being played on a fixed game board showing a Catan-ified map of the United States, Die Siedler von Catan: Aufbruch der H&auml;ndler is set on a Catan-ified map of Europe &ndash; which isn't a surprise given that Kosmos is a European publisher. Instead of moving from east to west to mimic the settling of the U.S. by Europeans, players start in the middle of Europe, namely Germany.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In all the spectacle of war there has seldom been a sight the equal of British General Burgoyne's campaign of 1777. The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.<br/><br/>The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.<br/><br/>The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;<br/><br/>It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?<br/><br/>As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?<br/><br/>These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Catherine: The Cities of the Tsarina takes 2-4 players to the Tsarist Empire of 1762 to win the Tsarina's favor with the help of an innovative card mechanism. As is so often the case, different strategies can lead to different goals: Do you devote yourself to the development of the fine arts or trade, or do you perhaps prefer to secure arms and thus perpetuate the empire? With each card you hold, you must decide whether to gain the resources and use the action on that card or whether to throw it away to activate another action.<br/><br/>To start the game, choose three of the six project cards in your hand and place them in your action row. At the top of each project card is a list of three cities or an assortment of cannons, books, and goods; at the bottom of each project card is an action and (in most cases) a bonus.<br/><br/>The game lasts three decades, with each decade lasting four rounds. Players play simultaneously during each round. At the start of a round, draw two cards, then play one card in your action row and another card in your activation row &mdash; located below your action row &mdash; under any project card in your action row that has not been activated. If the activation card matches the color of the action card above it, you carry out that action, whether it's placing a residence on the map, gaining cards, exchanging cards for points or a favor, gaining favor by having cannons or books, etc. If you carried out the action and the card has a bonus, you then get that bonus once. If the activation card doesn't match in color or you choose not to do the action, you draw a project card as compensation.<br/><br/>If you would ever draw cards over your hand limit, you instead gain 1 point for each such card. If you would gain favor over the maximum, you instead gain 1 point.<br/><br/>After four rounds, an interim scoring takes place, with players comparing cannons and books in their action row, then gaining points for residences and their placement on the favor track. Players then discard all cards in their activation row, along with the cards above them that were activated, then draw two new cards. After the third interim scoring, players score points for cards in hand, their largest group of contiguous residences, and how well they've completed the order card they received at the start of play. To complete orders, you need goods from cities, which means you need to place residences in those cities, which means you need to activate the right cards and collect lots of books.<br/><br/>Whatever you do, do your best to make Catherine proud!<br/><br/>",

Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.<br/><br/>Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.<br/><br/>Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.<br/><br/>About 15 scenarios are included which range from about 90 minutes to 3 or 4 hours.

        "description": "To set up Auf Teufel komm raus, place 48 black coal pieces face down on the &quot;infernal&quot; fireplace in the middle of the game board. On their rear sides, these pieces show values between 10 and 100, with a devil appearing on nine pieces.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player reveals coal pieces one by one, ideally without revealing a devil &ndash; but before he starts doing this, all players make a bet about the total value that the next player will gain. To do so, all players take poker chips into their closed fists, with the wager being the minimum amount that the active player has to reach in order for the bid to pay off. Thus, making a high value bet automatically increases the risk of losing that wager. If the active player reveals a devil, he loses all the coals he gained that turn, so while he wants to claim as much as possible, pressing his luck could cost him everything &ndash; not to mention possibly making his opponents rich as well if their high bids pay off.<br/><br/>The &quot;scoring track&quot; around the board shows whether a player has exactly 200, exactly 300, and so on, or falls somewhere in between two of those numbers, but NOT the exact amount that the players hold. Whoever manages to increase his total wealth from the starting amount of 200 to over 1,600 wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The kingdom is shattered, its towns are divided, and its people are distrusting.  The newly crowned ruler, El Cascadero, seeks to reunite the land, but he can&rsquo;t do it alone. Thus, he appoints four ministers to visit the people and restore civil harmony. While the ministers are obligated to bring prosperity to the entire land, each of them also has one dedicated responsibility: Farming, Crafting, Mining, and Markets.  El Cascadero also records in his book the successes of his ministers&hellip;<br/><br/>Cascadero is the next epic tile placement strategy game from acclaimed designer Reiner Knizia.  Ministers visit towns by placing their envoys adjacent to them; but towns are distrusting of single envoys, so newly placed envoys will only trigger town scoring when they are part of an established group or carry an official seal from El Cascadero himself. Towns with Royal Messengers at them or a history of envoy visits are even more valuable, as they willingly collaborate for even greater successes.<br/><br/>Players must decide between two competing strategies: build long chains of their envoys to achieve synergies and objectives, or establish smaller, separate groups of envoys to trigger timely town scoring. Both will award victory points, yet your victory points will mean nothing if you don&rsquo;t also reach the end of your appointed success column.<br/><br/>By triggering town scoring, you&rsquo;ll advance along that town&rsquo;s matching success column, gaining bonuses as you pass over them.  Bonuses include earning victory points, advancing further on any success column, claiming an official seal, repositioning an envoy, or even acquiring an additional turn. Through careful timing and clever plans, players can trigger a cascading combo of exciting bonuses that swing momentum in their favor.<br/><br/>Cascadero provides a wealth of replayability through emergent player interaction, variable board and tile setups, and an advanced player mode featuring traveling heralds.  Yet the game will always end in one of two ways: when one player reaches fifty victory points or must place a tile but has no tiles left.  The players who reached the end of their appointed success column qualify for victory, and whoever among them has the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each game the variables change: cards, player interactions, stories, strategies and threats. While the game has a strong pulp influence, its roots stem from Cold War studies. We have expanded upon this research to arrive at our game&rsquo;s premise: What would happen after a nuclear and biological apocalypse?<br/><br/>Our answer is Fallen Land. As a player, you are the leader of a unique faction of survivors competing for primacy in the ruinous aftermath of post-apocalyptic America. You must manage and enhance your town, protect your citizens and secure resources. You will also have to make and break treaties to endure, amidst a myriad of bribery and betrayal by the other players. But that is just where the adventure begins! You must also direct your agents (a party of characters), to explore the rugged landscape, establish your territory and solidify your agenda.<br/><br/>Game play is comprised of Turns. Each represents one month and is divided into Phases and Sub-Phases.

End Turn Phase *<br/>    1.) Adjust Turn Marker.<br/>    2.) Pass the First Player Sheet.<br/><br/><br/>    Resolve an Action Card in each Phase or Sub-Phase as directed by the card.<br/><br/><br/>A player's town is simulated by a Town Play Mat. Players organize their owned Resources, inventory, Party Characters, excess Characters and movement bonuses here. In addition, Town Play Mats can be upgraded three different ways: Town Defense Chips, Town Technologies and Action Cards. The first two upgrades are available for purchase during the Town Business Phase. However, Action Cards are dealt at the beginning of each Turn and are also drawn as a reward.<br/><br/>    Players also manage their Party consisting of five Character Cards. Characters may be equipped with gear (Spoils Cards), to increase their Base Skills. A party can move around the map, draw Encounter and Mission cards (stories) which contain Skill Checks (challenges) and even attack another player's Party in PVP. Dice are rolled for these many &quot;deeds&quot; to determine the outcome. <br/> There are seven decks of cards. These are drawn and played throughout the game. Some are stories, such as Encounter and Mission Cards, Characters are a Faction's agents, and Spoils are equipment/vehicle/gear. Lastly, Action Cards modify the story and/or game play.<br/><br/>To win, one of two Victory Conditions is necessary, either 20 Prestige or 80 Town Health. Prestige represents your reputation as a leader, while Town Health represents your town&rsquo;s prosperity and number of its citizens. Both conditions are marked on their respective Victory Tracks bordering the map.<br/><br/>Adventure and intrigue await!  We hope you have the opportunity to play Fallen Land and that you enjoy playing it as much as we have enjoyed creating it for you.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Timeline: Classic is a card game played using 55 cards. While other versions of Timeline are focused on certain elements (events, inventions, discoveries, etc.), Timeline Classic is a highly engaging version that encompasses multiple themes in one convenient package. Was the pencil invented before Washington crossed the Delaware? Each card depicts an invention on both sides, with the year in which that invention was created on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: Classic can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>",

Team members sit beside each other playing opposite colors. Each player plays his opponent as in standard chess, except that whenever a piece is captured, it is given to the teammate. The teammate can then decide to play a normal move, or place the captured piece on any unoccupied square of the board (exception: pawns cannot be placed on the 1st or 8th rank). Team members have to work together and against the clock to win. The first person to lose by checkmate or time loses for his or her team, thus ending both games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game play in Heul doch! Mau Mau is simple, but it may bring you to tears all the same when you give points away to other players.<br/><br/>The game consists of 98 cards, with 1-7 each appearing twice in seven colors. Each player starts with a random card face up in front of them as a personal discard pile as well as a hand of four cards. On a turn, you must play one card from your hand following the familiar game play rules of matching the color or number. Ideally you want to play on your own pile, but if the card you would play matches the top card of your left- or right-hand neighbor's discard pile, then you must play it there instead!<br/><br/>Maybe you can choose a card in hand that matches only your top card? If you have no valid play or don't want to give points away to someone else, you can play the card face down on your stack, showing the weepy onion on the card back. On your next turn, you can play any card you like on your pile &mdash; except if it matches a neighbor's top card, of course, in which case you must give it away. (You can't play on a neighbor's onion card.)<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been played, everyone scores for the cards in their pile &mdash; but first they must count the number of onion cards in their pile. However many onions they have, they must remove all matching number cards prior to scoring. If you have four onions, for example, you must discard all 4s &mdash; and this is bad since all cards score points equal to their value. If you have ten onions, then you first discard all 7s, then all 3s. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>Heul doch! Mau Mau includes twelve special action cards that can be used to twist up game play when played instead of a number card:<br/><br/><br/>    Catapult: All players with the highest number on their pile discard those cards to the center of the table.<br/>    Beach towel: Exchange your top card (whether onion or number) with the top card of another player's pile.<br/>    Merry-go-round: Decide whether all players pass their topmost card to the player on their left or right.<br/>    Werewolf: All players must flip their top card from number to onion or vice versa.<br/><br/><br/>",

He was the ultimate mounted armored warrior of the ancient world, trained in both shock and missile combat.<br/><br/>Cataphract portrays the development of the art of war wrought by the early Byzantine Empire, during the reign of Emperor Justinian, under his great Generals, Belisarius and Narses. During this period the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, for a brief period of time, re-captured a large portion of what was formerly the Western Roman Empire. Although successful in its attempts to reconquer Italy and North Africa, the Byzantine Empire's resources were insufficient to hold on to its gains.<br/><br/>Cataphract covers all the major battles that defined this Early Medieval era. To place these battles in their proper historical context, the Campaign Game, Justinian, is enclosed, which covers the quest to reconquer the Roman Empire under one ruler.<br/><br/>Thus, Cataphract contains the decisive battles of the era; a Campaign Game; plus a special bonus Viking raid scenario; and the land/naval leaders for an upcoming series of C3i Magazine Modules covering the Peloponnesian War. The second edition of Cataphract add to the six Early Medieval battles of the first edition, the Ancient Battles of the Utus River (447 CE) and the Catalaunian Fields (451 CE) from the original Attila: Scourge of God Module.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Within a few weeks, the Admiral Graf Spee sinks nine freight ships and sends almost 50,000 gross register tons to the seabed. The gigantic loss puts the army command in London Whitehall under pressure.

If you increase your assets, you can build a building and use that building to acquire resources and victory points more quickly.<br/><br/>The more buildings players construct, the more actions that become available on future turns. On a turn, players take one of two actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Production: Choose a resource card or building card in the production action area, and gain the item shown on it; or,<br/>     Trade: Discard resource cards from your hand to acquire resource or building cards of the same value or less from the available cards.<br/><br/><br/>In addition, players can use the effects of each building they own once per turn (including on the turn during which they were acquired). An example of a building effect is: exchanging a thread card in hand for cloth available in the play area. Chain together cards, buildings, and actions to create more victory points.

Each faction has its own deck of cards, buildings, upgrades, attacks, special powers, and a screen behind which a player will play cards. Your opponents do not know what you are building. When a player lays down an attack card, he chooses an opponent, the players drop their screens, and they battle for control of the Frontier, i.e. the center of the table. Whoever controls the Frontier scores points and also has the ability to attack player bases directly. Eliminate your opponent to win instantly, or have the most points when the game ends.<br/><br/>",

A distinctive feature of this game is the multi-part board - there are four boards laid on top of each other, each with holes in it leading 'down' to the next level.  Players move their moles to those holes and, when one board is 'complete' (i.e., all holes occupied), the board, and any moles remaining on it, are removed from play.  Players continue working their way down from level to level, each board having fewer holes than the previous, until they reach the final level, which has only one hole leading to The Golden Shovel.  A simple race-to-the-finish game with fun, colorful playing pieces, just as much fun with or without the kids!<br/><br/>This game is actually a mild re-working of Inner Circle, also called Top Star, by Virginia Charves.

The adventurers collect equipment, interact and utilize their environment, fight monsters, and immerse themselves in the rich narrative elements.<br/><br/>The complete story is broken down into different scenarios that represent a self-contained game. All of these scenarios contain chapters, each with its own narration and specifics. The objective of the game is to progress through the tale and face the endgame at the finale of each scenario.<br/><br/>The main goal behind Machina Arcana is to provide players with a chilling game that can never be played the same way, mechanisms that enable varying strategies and approaches, and an extensive framework that combines everything smoothly. The game scales by default; there is no need for special conditions based on the player count. As the story progresses, so does your gear. But beware! If you are too slow, horror might very well prevail and devour you whole...<br/><br/>",

Claiming the Ebon Citadel, he surrounded himself with fiends, lackeys, and fellow creatures of the dark, forming his Thirsting Court. For a time peace reigned. Then came the Shyish Necroquake, and the Wolf found himself infused with dark power.<br/><br/>Sallying forth from his castle, Radukar and his court embarked on a murderous rampage. Some were deemed worthy of the Blood Kiss and were turned into vampires themselves &ndash; countless others were left as corpses strewn across the streets. The city now stands on the precipice of total doom. Are there any that would risk their lives and their very souls to save it?<br/><br/>In Warhammer Quest: Cursed City, you and your friends take on the role of a group of adventurers trying to lift the curse that has befallen the city of Ulfenkarn. Undead creatures stalk the streets.<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of eight heroes to play. The heroes come with their own, distinctly sculpted miniatures and background story.<br/><br/>Warhammer Quest: Cursed City is a campaign game in which the players must overcome a series of missions. With each mission, you will learn more about the curse and your nemesis.<br/><br/>Players roll dice at the beginning of their turn that they can turn into specific actions of the hero that they're playing. Only by working together and balancing their strengths and skills can the heroes hope to survive.<br/><br/>The game comes with 60 new miniatures, rulebooks, cards, tokens and more.<br/><br/>The miniatures include:<br/><br/>8 Heroes:<br/>- Jelson Darrock, Witch Hunter<br/>- Qulathis the Exile, Vampire Hunter<br/>- Emelda Braskov, General<br/>- Dagnai Holdenstock, Kharadron entrepreneur<br/>- Glaurio ven Alten III, Duelist<br/>- Cleona Zeitengale, Missionary<br/>- Octen Glimscry, Necromancer<br/>- Brutogg Corpse-Eater, Ogor Mercenary<br/><br/>5 Overlords:<br/>- Gorslav the Gravekeeper<br/>- Watch Captain Hagrim<br/>- Torgillis the Chamberlain<br/>- Vrykos Blood-born<br/>- Radukar the Wolf<br/><br/>38 Additional Adversaries:<br/>6 Dire Bat Swarms<br/>6 Corpse Rat Swarms<br/>2 Kosargi Nightguard Ogor<br/>10 Ulfenwatch Skeleton Warriors<br/>10 Deadwalker Zombies<br/>1 Vargskyr Vampire<br/>3 Vyrkos Blood-born Vampires<br/><br/>10 Mysterious Object Marker Miniatures<br/><br/>",

You will be the patron to various different musicians, and in return, you will gain ownership to their works.<br/><br/>Players will take turns taking donation cubes from 6 different musicians. Donation cubes are taken from a career track, which will reveal spaces that change the current reputation of each musician. Each space on the track also represents their remaining life and will die when all cubes are removed.<br/><br/>Then the player who is currently the major patron to each musician will discard donation cubes to acquire a Composition tile from him. Every musician will have a different method of scoring for their Composition tiles. Then adjust the Popularity Ranking of all 6 musicians according to their relative reputation.<br/><br/>At the final phase of each round, players will blindly donate money to the Royal Concert, and the combined total will decide which musicians are invited to perform. A successful concert will earn money for the patrons of the performers, which is the main source of income.<br/><br/>Can you become the most prosperous patron during the age of musicians? Will you work them to death and hold on to their final masterpiece? Or will you have to sell your belongings to provide for their talents? Enjoy showing off your wealth in the slightly historical game of Symphony No.9.at time.<br/><br/>",

As the chief of your clan, it's up to you to guide your prehistoric people through the valley: Take advantage of the environment, pick and hunt for food, discover big and safe caverns for the upcoming winter, gather your tribe and discover the valley!<br/><br/>Sapiens is a short and easy-to-learn tile-placement game that can prove much deeper than it seems for gamers. Each player has a personal game board that represents the valley on which they will play tiles to determine the journey of their tribe through several prehistoric life scenes. Their aim is to gather food points on the plains and in the forests of the valley and to get shelter points for reaching caves in the mountains. A player's turn consists of two steps:<br/><br/><br/>    Connect one new tile from the four in his personal pool to the tiles already in play on his board, with connected scenes needing to match. These placements earn food points when a connection is made, earns shelter points when a cave is reached, and sometimes provides a special ability based on the connected scenes.<br/>    Choose a new tile from the five available in a common pool to re-fill his personal pool to four tiles.<br/><br/><br/>Sapiens relies on instinctive domino-like mechanisms that are improved by interesting twists:<br/><br/><br/>     Laying tiles on personal (modular) game boards brings a bit of a puzzle feel to the game.<br/>     Having two separate scores &mdash; food and shelter &mdash; and knowing that only their lower one matters when determining who wins confronts players with interesting needs and dilemmas.<br/>     Including special powers linked to the eight different scenes represented on the tiles brings a lot of interaction and choices.<br/><br/><br/>",

Don't be a Jerry.<br/><br/>Rick has locked the family inside their house. Why? Because the family has grown. Parasites masquerading as family and close friends have infiltrated and have inserted pleasant memories into everyone's minds to make them think they're real &mdash; and more keep coming! You must figure out which of these new, zany characters are real and which ones are parasites that need to be exterminated.  Think you've got what it takes to save the world?<br/><br/>The game features a basic fully cooperative mode and an advanced mode, where there are two teams.<br/>In the advanced mode, players will be dealt a hidden role as either Real or a Parasite. The Parasite players must try to keep at least one parasite alive in the end (keeping yourself alive is the easiest way to do this). The Real players must root out the Parasites to win.<br/>Now you can shoot the other players! But if you accidentally shoot a Real player, there are consequences...<br/>There is no player elimination, however. A player's secret identity might change, though.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of the several statistically-based sports simulations produced by the Strat-O-Matic Game Company.  The game consists of player cards and team defensive cards that accurately reproduce play outcomes and player, team, and league statistics of the National Football League for the season on which the cards are based.  Play progresses with the gamer on offense calling his play (run or pass, where the play is directed, the ball carrier or primary receiver, etc.) and the gamer on defense setting a defensive configuration (blitzes, double coverage of receivers, stacking the line, etc.).  In the cards and dice version, three dice are then rolled, with one die determining whether the play result comes from the offensive or defensive cards and the other two determining the result from the speciifed card.  Play takes place on a game board that resembles a football field, and the gamers keep track of the ball position, the down, and the time remaining in the quarter being played.  Penalties and injuries are part of the game.  Gamers play from the perspective of a head coach and/or general manager.<br/><br/>The game also comes in a computer version that automatically determines play outcomes and compiles and reports player, team and league statistics.  The computer version grapically portrays the plays using X's and O's to depict player movement.  The computer version also features a sophisticated computer coach that faciltates solitaire play.<br/><br/>Each year the Strat-O-Matic Game Company issues a new set of player and team cards (or computer disk) based upon the most recent NFL season.  The company also issues from time to time sets of players and teams from past seasons.<br/><br/>",

Every day you spend long hours in the monastery copying books, praying, and performing tasks. Through hard work and prayer, earn the abbot&rsquo;s trust and display your dedication to the pious life.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score the most piety points.  The game consists of 8 days (i.e., rounds). In the first 4 days, players simultaneously roll their own dice (that show various book types, abbot influence and travel points) and may do so up to 3 times. After each roll, the players have 3 options: (1) to keep the dice as shown, (2) to reroll exactly one die or (3) to roll all the dice.<br/><br/>Most of the dice are resource dice showing books monks are copying, but there are also abbot influence dice (abbot influences is accrued in the first half, but spent in the second half of the game), and a travel die (allowing a player's novice to go out into towns to do good works and find more books).<br/><br/>In the last 4 rounds, players use their abbot influence to bid for a priority of tasks.<br/><br/>This is a rare (if not unique) &quot;roll + write&quot; game that includes auctions and, unlike many roll + write game; it is highly interactive.<br/><br/>After 8 days, the game ends and the players calculate scores.  As in the original Biblios, the relative value of books changes during the game, so players are unsure of which books will be most valuable until the end of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Baltic Gap: Summer 1944&quot;, depicts the Soviet drive into Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania during the summer of 1944. As the game begins, the defense of Vitebsk, a Byelorussian fortified city located just a few hexes beyond the southeast corner of the playing surface, has just collapsed. 1st Baltic Front is advancing westward through the shredded German line, and will soon threaten all of Army Group North with encirclement. Finally, after four months of fierce battle, the Red Army will win the great prize of this campaign, Riga, and pocket the enemy in the Courland region of Latvia.<br/><br/>Baltic Gap allows players to explore this interesting campaign from a variety of historical and hypothetical vantage points. Long campaign games can be enjoyed by up to five players. Several short scenarios are also provided, and these work best with a single player per side.<br/><br/>Baltic Gap is the 11th wargame in the award winning Operational Combat System (&ldquo;OCS&rdquo;). It stays true to the ground breaking earlier games in the system that allow players a deeper glimpse into why the skills and behaviors of the two sides were so very different. Here in 1944, we find a much more developed Russian army (much more advanced than the one shown in the 2007 CSR Award winning game Case Blue) facing a still potent German Wehrmacht. The Germans will need to fight their forces with great skill to avoid getting swamped by their tough adversary.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3 to 4 days<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8.0 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory: <br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; Full Color Game Maps <br/>Five countersheets (1,400 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS Rulebook <br/>One 48-page Baltic Gap specific Rulebook <br/>Two 4-page OCS Charts and Tables Booklets <br/>2 6-sided dice<br/><br/>",

Very few people can withstand the hardships of the lonesome life a shepherd of giant silkworms leads. It is a solitary existence that requires great dedication and strength of character to bear the pressures that stem from competing with the few other shepherds who fight over the scarce but desirable feeding grounds, while keeping the fearsome ookamy at bay.<br/><br/>Silk is a gateway game into area control and worker placement systems. Players have to move their silkworms to the optimal spaces so they can feed on the best grass available, while pushing the other players' pieces into less desirable feeding grounds. In this game, players roll dice in order to determine which actions they are allowed to perform during their turn. There are six types of actions available: breeding more silkworms, moving the shepherd or their mastiff, building fences or farms, moving the ookami monster around the board, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; getting your silkworms to feed. When silkworms feed, they generate a number of silk points, depending on the type of terrain they are standing on at that moment. These points can be used to modify the outcome of a dice roll, all while keeping in mind that the player with the most silk points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two spice dealers share a storehouse with a number of hungry rats, who want to put them out of business.  The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats.<br/><br/><br/>Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht's Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu, which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke, also published by Queen. The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set.<br/><br/>All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot, the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout.<br/><br/>The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours.<br/><br/>The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose.<br/><br/>When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts.<br/><br/>The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table.<br/><br/>Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds.<br/><br/>Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen's line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.<br/><br/>",

Then position them in the best spots to create a charming photo worthy of the best photographer of Loco Momo!<br/><br/>Loco Momo is a competitive game featuring drafting, tile placement, and set collection elements, falling under the broader mechanic of &ldquo;tile drafting.&rdquo; Players first choose an animal tile, and based on its unique movement, the animal moves to a different clearing, potentially allowing you to take even more animals of the same background color. Players then place your newly obtained tiles on your scoring board, which scores points based on specific arrangements (e.g., number of identical/different animals in a row, matching animals vertically, linking background colors, etc.). Like any good drafting game, take which benefits you most, but maybe keep an eye on what others may need! But distinguishing itself from others in the genre, Loco Momo offers an approachable theme and (family) friendlier atmosphere as the scoring system removes some of the bite of &ldquo;hate/spite&rdquo; drafting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are the rich owner of a large field near New York where health needs are more important. Your goal is to build the most efficient hospital in three dimensions in order to get the most popularity. You will manage the construction of the building from scratch as well as the installation of new services and the recruitment of the best doctors, nurses and administrative staff that align with the arrival of new patients. You will also be attentive to the well-being of patients and not forget that time is also money when competing with neighboring hospitals...<br/><br/>Each turn in Clinic, players take three actions &mdash; building in different modules; hosting patients; hiring doctors, nurses and staff &mdash; by playing one card. Each cube that enters the clinic comes with a car that needs to be parked, leaving less space for the hospital being constructed! During the game, you'll move patients, doctors, nurses, and staff in the 3D structure as efficiently as you can in order to save time, with doctors and nurses tending to patients as long as their colors (indicating both training and illness) match. By taking care of patients you receive money, which lets you pay fees, salaries and maintenance as well as buy popularity points.<br/><br/>During an administrative phase, uncared for patients grow sicker, new patients enter the pre-admission room, doctors become less knowledgable about the diseases they face, and new doctors and nurses become available from their schools. In the end, the player with the most popularity points and least time spent during the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once upon a time, Hungry Monkey searched for his lost breakfast bean in the jungle. He asked the other animals for help, from Swift Sparrow to King Tiger, but they all ignored his pleas. Until Tiny Ant climbed into Tiger's ear and ordered him to help. King Tiger was scared by the voice in his ear. He commanded all animals to look for the bean, and no one dared to refuse. Eventually, Swift Sparrow found the bean, and Hungry Monkey was finally happy.<br/><br/>Hungry Monkey is a card game where the goal is to get rid of your hand cards and collect beans. You have animal cards both in hand and in a face-down row. You must be the first to play all your cards, first from your hand and then from your card row.<br/><br/>You have to play cards with the same or a higher number. You can trigger an effect with a powerful animal.<br/><br/>If you want to play multiple games you keep track of the scoring with Bean cards. The player with the most beans at the end of the last game wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On August 9, 1806, Frederick William of Prussia, in reaction to the recent creation of the Confederation of the Rhine by Napoleon, decreed the order of mobilization. War becomes unavoidable. <br/><br/>The Prussian army concentrates on Erfurt without waiting for the troops of its Russian ally. Outrunning his opponents, Napoleon enters Saxony with the Grand Army on October 7, 1806 and heads for Berlin.<br/><br/>A week later the Prussians, defeated at Jena and Auerstedt, retreat North. The pursuit led by the Murat cavalry can begin... <br/><br/>When the game meets history:<br/><br/>&quot;Napoleon 1806&quot; is a wargame at the crossroads of history and simulation, the culmination of two history and wargame enthusiasts, Denis Sauvage and Julien Busson, who wished to share this passion with you. <br/>With Napoleon 1806, in 1 to 2 hours, two players will relive the clashes between Prussian and French at the heart of the imperial conquests of Napoleon the 1st, which culminated in the battles of Auerstaedt and Jena.<br/><br/>Napoleon 1806 is intended for wargaming seasoned grognards as well as for young conscripts who want to try a new playful sensation. Strategy, anticipation and decision are the engines of the Napoleon 1806 game system.<br/><br/>The rules of Napoleon 1806 are divided into three parts and can be learnt in fifteen minutes. The first one, called &quot;Rules of the Conscript&quot;, allows to acquire all the notions of the game easily. The second, &quot;Rules of the Grognard&quot;, brings more finesse including &quot;fog of war&quot;. The last, &quot;Rules of the Marshal&quot;, allows to play Napoleon 1806 in competition.<br/><br/>Will you meet the challenge of doing as well as the Emperor Napoleon or will you succeed in thwarting his plans at the head of the Prussian forces?<br/><br/>How to play Napoleon 1806:<br/><br/>A game of Napoleon 1806 is played in 7 turns, each representing two days of campaign. Players alternate operations with their army corps. Fatigue and losses accumulate until the breaking point of one of the two armies causing the defeat of a player.<br/><br/>The game is based on cards to perform moves and combats. Even if luck is present, strategy is key to victory. Moving your army corps on different approach paths to facilitate maneuvers, managing the fatigue of your men generated by marching and fighting, concentrating your forces in order to win the decisive battle; these are the challenges you will face.<br/><br/>The French troops are more numerous and more experienced than those of their opponent, but time is short before the arrival of the Russian reinforcements, and the Prussian army is not to be underestimated! The French player to win will have to master the art of attacking and speed of action. The Prussian player, although defensive, will have to seize the opportunities presented to him to counter-attack and surprise his opponent. As the game is fast, each player will have the opportunity to take charge of the fate of both armies in one evening.<br/><br/>",

After its Steam and Xbox One releases, SUPERHOT is taking its unique game mechanisms to the world of tabletop games.<br/><br/>In the micro deck-building SUPERHOT Card Game, based on Agent Decker, you use abilities and items to deal with increasing threats.

        "description": "Information from publishers game page<br/><br/>Operation Chastise: the Dambuster Raid<br/><br/>On the night of May 16, 1943, nineteen Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron took off from their base near Lincoln in Great Britain and headed for the heart of German industry in the Ruhr. The squadron&rsquo;s task was to destroy the dams that controlled the reservoirs feeding Germany&rsquo;s war engine. In the words of aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis, the mastermind behind the operation, &ldquo;power is dependant on the supply of natural stores of energy such as coal, oil and water.... If their destruction or paralysis can be accomplished THEY OFFER A MEANS OF RENDERING THE ENEMY UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF CONTINUING TO PROSECUTE THE WAR.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Lancasters had been modified to carry a most unusual ordnance codenamed Upkeep. It looked more like a petrol barrel than an explosive device, but the painstakingly engineered and tested outer layer cushioned a volatile mine designed by Wallis to bounce over torpedo nets and kiss the lip of the dam, its backspin carefully devised to hug the dam rather than ricochet on impact. Upkeep was supposed to plunge down along the wall like a depth-charge, detonating halfway down. The concussion would crack the structure, and the water&rsquo;s mass held back by the dam would push open the crack, creating a breach in the wall. The dam would be destroyed.<br/><br/>Eight of the Lancasters would not return that night, but the two primary targets of the M&ouml;hne and Eder dams were breached, letting loose a combined torrent that measured nearly half a million tons of water and taking the lives of over 1200 German civilians and military personnel. Measured in civilian casualties, it was the most lethal night of the bombing campaign thus far, although later missions would dwarf its casualty list. Measured in terms of industrial disruption, the raid cut the region&rsquo;s electrical power for several hours and severely reduced its water reservoir. It was not a decisive blow, but it was successful nonetheless. Had at least one other dam been breached, it could have been devastating. This is your challenge: can you match 617&rsquo;s success? Can you surpass it?<br/><br/>The Game <br/>In Enemy Coast Ahead: The Dambuster Raid, you command a newly formed squadron assigned the task of breaching the dams in the Ruhr Valley.  Not only are you presented with a variety of decisions, you play the invisible hand of fate as your crews endure the hazards of a dangerous night raid. Play the campaign and you get to organize and train the squadron, or play the historical scenarios.<br/><br/>Players <br/>Play solitaire and you do it all. Play with teammates and one of you is the squadron commander giving orders to subordinates. The squadron commander wins if the dams are breached, while subordinates compete to accomplish their orders with the least casualties to the men and machines assigned to them. Only one subordinate will win. Of course, if the dams are not breached, you all lose.<br/><br/>Scale &amp; Detail <br/>Each Lancaster is represented by its own 1&rdquo; counter. Each bomber will carry two or three 5/8&rdquo; markers representing aircrew, ordnance and possibly an elite crewman. All the men awarded decorations before or during the raid are represented in this game by their own marker, each imparting a unique characteristic to its crew.  Even the squadron commander&rsquo;s dog gets his own marker!<br/><br/>Ground crew are also featured in the campaign game, represented by markers rated for a variety of tasks. You will have to requisition and manage your Erks effectively while maintaining security. That&rsquo;s not so easy. You may find it necessary to transfer the local barmaid or take the drastic measure of transferring 54 squadron out of Scampton airbase, or even quarantining the base altogether.<br/><br/>Reconnaissance is crucial. In the campaign game you will need to survey the defenses of the dams and the routes to them, but too much recon and you risk tipping off the enemy.  But how much is too much? You will have to target the right dams or the right combination of dams, to get the job done. M&ouml;hne and Eder are the juiciest targets, but what if they are well defended? Do you risk it, or go for the other dams hoping to breach enough of them to achieve your goal?<br/><br/>Training is vital. In the campaign game you will requisition and then train your crew to fly at exceptionally low altitude, maintain a steady speed, locate the target in the dead of night, and release ordnance at precisely the right distance from the lip of the dam. You will only have just so much time to prepare your squadron. You might have to decide what is more important: learning to maintain the right altitude and speed while preparing to release ordnance, or the ability to find the dam? If your men don&rsquo;t master these skills quickly you may have to favor one over the other. You can always impose extra training, but push your men too hard and they become fatigued, perhaps even damaging their bomber in training or worse, crashing it. And if you don&rsquo;t push them enough you may run out of time. The moon will be right only for so long and the reservoirs are slowly rising. Once full, the Germans will open the valves and release the water, making them that much harder to breach. The clock is ticking.<br/><br/>The game board is organized into three sections, the Mission Planning Blotter, the Flight Map (from Scampton to the Ruhr), and the Target Maps. The first scenarios use only the Target Maps, while larger scenarios will use them as well as the Flight Map. Only the campaign game takes full advantage of the Planning Mission Blotter, allowing you to organize and train your squadron, assign tasks to ground crew, and modify the Lancasters for this unique raid.  The Lancasters were modified in a number of ways for Operation Chastise:<br/><br/><br/>     top-turret and armor were removed to compensate for the weight of the bouncing bomb (yes, those bombers were sitting ducks for Nightfighters).<br/>     VHF radio sets were installed to allow better command and control while over the target (they were standard in fighters but this was the first time a bomber&rsquo;s cockpit was fitted with them).<br/>    Dann bombsight. pair of Aldis spotlights rigged to judge the bomber&rsquo;s altitude over the reservoir.<br/><br/><br/>The Target Maps are intended to portray (and analyze) four key elements in a bomber&rsquo;s attack: altitude, speed, distance from the dam, and the angle of approach to the face of the dam&rsquo;s wall. During an attack you will strive for the perfect angle, the ideal speed and altitude, adjusting one or more of these before releasing Upkeep at just the right distance from the dam (&ldquo;Upkeep&rdquo; was the codename for the bouncing bomb). You may choose to pull-up rather than release ordnance, circling around for another run, because finding that sweet spot is tricky and each Lancaster has only one bomb to drop. You&rsquo;ve got to make it count.<br/><br/>Campaign Game<br/>The full campaign game begins with the forming of the squadron weeks before the raid. The player assumes the role of squadron leader or one of his subordinates in team play, requisitioning bombers, ground crew, and aircrew. He must train the aircrews and results are variable. Veterans tend to get more out of training than less experienced crews, but there is always the possibility of damaging and even crashing bombers, and losing or exhausting crews in training. As Air Vice Marshal Cochrane explained to 617&rsquo;s Wing Commander: &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s a lot of urgency in this, because you haven&rsquo;t got long to train. Training will be the important thing, so get going right away.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the player may order recon missions along the flight path and over the dams, garnering information that will help him devise a target list. There are 7 dams that can be attacked, but it is unlikely the player will have the resources to hit them all (there&rsquo;s nothing stopping him from trying). Before launching the attack the player would like to know which dams are defended by flak, searchlights and balloons, and how high the reservoir is (the higher the better, but too high and the Germans may soon open the valves and reduce the water-level, so timing is crucial). Too much recon can tip off the Germans, however, which means that the fog of war is a very important aspect of the design.  The player won't know if security has been compromised until the flight is already underway. As Wing Commander Gibson explained to the men of 617 squadron: &ldquo;When the other boys ask you what you&rsquo;re doing, just tell them to mind their own business, because of all things in this game, security is the greatest factor.&rdquo;<br/><br/>All this planning and preparation ends when the player decides his squadron is ready and he launches the raid. The player then organizes his squadron into waves, assigning aircrew to Lancasters, arming them with ordnance, and assigning primary and secondary targets, and wave leaders. Once launched, bombers are likely to encounter hazards along the flight path -- flak and searchlights of course, but also utility poles and trees. Historically, 617 squadron flew low enough to hit sea waves and electrical cables (the player may choose to fly high, but that risks encountering nightfighters, an even more lethal threat). Along the route bombers might experience engine trouble or lose their way. Navigation training pays off during the flight turns (each turn represents one hour of historical time).<br/><br/>Upon reaching and acquiring the target, the player uses target maps to play attack turns, each representing approximately 8 minutes of historical time. Here each bomber has to negotiate the dam's immediate terrain and defenses (if any -- recon missions might have revealed that some dams are undefended, making them prime targets, but if security has been compromised the player may discover that the Germans have added defenses). There is an approach sequence where the player must resolve the attack of each bomber on the target map, striving for the perfect speed and altitude, hopefully releasing the bouncing mine at precisely the right distance from the dam. There is the possibility of being jumped by nightfighters if the attack is prolonged, motivating the player to get the job done promptly.<br/><br/>And finally, the player resolves the fate of returning bombers as well as those that lost their way, and then conducts a morning-after recon mission verifying the damage he inflicted on the dams.  A dam that was only damaged may have weakened and breached by morning, or conversely, the reports of your exuberant bomber crews may prove to have been exaggerated.<br/><br/>The Scenarios <br/>The game is also presented in nine scenarios, each isolating a particular aspect of Operation Chastise. In fact, the rules are organized in program-fashion, the first section explains the attack rules. The first few scenarios can thus be played after just reading those rules. The first scenario, for example, treats the action over the M&ouml;hne reservoir, while subsequent scenarios incorporate more of the mission (and more rules) until the player is ready to undertake the campaign game encompassing the entire operation from training to bombing and return.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dance of Ibexes, which was first released as Tanz der Hornochsen! (&quot;Dance of the Horned Oxen&quot;) challenges players to place their ibexes/cows on the game board without being pushed over the edge.<br/><br/>Players start with a random assortment of numbered tiles in hand. The game board depicts multiple rows that will hold tiles, with the rows being of varying lengths and with symbols in some spaces. Draw four tiles at random, and place one in the leftmost space of each of the first four rows.<br/><br/>Each round, each player selects and reveals a tile at the same time. Tiles are placed on the board in order, from lowest to highest, and which row a tile is placed in is determined according to these rules:<br/><br/><br/>    Lowest number: If the played tile's number is lower than that of the end tile of all four rows, place this tile at the end of the row with the highest number.<br/>    Increasing number value: The number on the tile must be higher than the number on the tile that is currently the last tile in that row, but...<br/>    Smallest difference: The tile must be placed at the end of the row where there will be the smallest difference between it and the tile currently at the end of that row. All four active rows must be examined to determine which has the smallest difference.<br/><br/><br/>When a player places a tile on a negative space/cowpie, they score that many points, moving their pawn that many spaces on the score track. (If any of the active rows has an uncovered &quot;Happy Cow&quot; space, the player loses points instead of gaining them.)<br/><br/>When a player places a tile on the final space at the end of a row, that row is completed, and the player must execute the following actions in order:<br/><br/><br/>    Score penalty points as shown on the final space by moving their pawn on the score track.<br/>    Move the just-played tile to the first space of the next unoccupied row.<br/>    Remove the remaining tiles from the completed row. Choose one or two to keep behind their player screen, then place the remaining tiles in the box or off to the side as they will not be used for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/><br/>At the start of a round, players can purchase 1-3 random tiles from the supply at a cost of 1 point per tile. (If someone plays their final tile in a round, they immediately draw six tiles for free.) A player can have at most nine tiles on hand. If a double play space is uncovered in an active row, then players must play and reveal two tiles. Twice during the game, when a player passes a specified point on the score track, in the next round players reveal their tile choices face up in order from fewest points to most points.<br/><br/>When a player reaches the end of the score track or no tiles remain to be purchased, finish the round, then the player with the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Participate in the construction of the Tholos of Delphi, the temple that marks the center of the universe marked by Zeus and built inside the Sanctuary of Athena Pronaia. As a builder, face your opponent in a duel and achieve the greatest influence within its sacred construction. May the gods be propitious to you!<br/><br/>Tholos is a game of majorities for two players with high interaction. On a turn, you take one of two actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Take stones of one color from the quarry into your workshop, with each workshop holding at most three stones. You can take up to three stones of your color (black/white), up to two neutral stones (gray), or one stone of your opponent (white/black).<br/>    Play any stone from your workshop onto the game board. The board has seven locations, each with a unique power, and each location can have a column of at most five stones. If you place a stone of your color in a location, then you take the special action associated with that location, e.g., moving the top stone of a column to another location, moving a stone from the opponent's workshop to your workshop, placing a second stone from your workshop, or returning a played stone to the quarry.<br/><br/><br/>When all seven columns have five stones on them, the game ends and players receive points for each column where they have more stones than the opponent &mdash; but this isn't necessarily a good thing. When you score a column, you receive 1 point for each stone of your color, 3 points for each stone of the opposing color, and -2 points for each neutral stone. each column awards points to the player who has the most stones of their color in that column.<br/><br/>In the advanced mode of Tholos, you place one or more ornament tiles on the game board, each in a different location. Each ornament tile has a power that changes the rules of the game, such as activating the power of a location with gray stones, awarding a column to the player with fewer stones than the opponent, or raising the maximum number of stones in the location's column to seven.<br/><br/>",

The landscape bristles with three divine energies. Every player action alters the balance of power among those energies, and thus the players collectively determine Lagoon&rsquo;s destiny. One divine energy shall inherit Lagoon, and the player who best served it wins!<br/><br/>The world is built using hexagonal tiles, and a new tile is drawn from a bag each time a druid explores a site. Site tiles are double-sided, and each side represents a different mystical site offering a unique magical power to the druids. Each site is also enchanted with one of three divine energies: Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin. Since the two sides of a site tile are always linked to different energies, every site explored presents a choice of which energy to advance over the other two, as well as what magic will be put into the world for use by the druids. Players also strategically deploy their druids to unravel sites aligned with an energy they choose to oppose, removing such sites from the world and tipping the balance of power towards the other two energies.<br/><br/>The energy with the most sites in play at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny, and the player who most supported that dominant energy is the winner. Support is tracked in two ways. First, whenever exploring a site and expanding an energy's reach in Lagoon, the exploring player gains a divine seed token matching the explored site's energy. These seeds can be spent in various ways over the course of the game, but any seeds of the dominant energy remaining in a player's supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it is removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With Japan torn by war for decades, Oda Nobunaga, the first unifier, succumbs to the blows of his own vassal, Akechi Mitsuhide, in 1582. This event is an opportunity for Hashiba Hideyoshi, who defeats Akechi at the Battle of Yamazaki.<br/><br/>Hashiba Hideyoshi must then confront Tokugawa Ieyasu, another vassal of Oda at the Battle of Nagakute. Hideyoshi then becomes the second unifier of Japan under the name of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.<br/><br/>Bound to the status quo, Tokugawa Ieyasu awaits Hideyoshi's death before returning to the pursuit of his ambition. His accession to power is decided in the gigantic battle of Sekigahara. He will force the heir to Hideyoshi to commit suicide at the end of the siege of Osaka. This time, the unification of the country is final, and Tokugawa's heirs will lead Japan for 250 years.<br/><br/>Tenkatoitsu is the sequel of Kawanakajima 1561. Tenkatoitsu means &quot;Unity under the Sky&quot;. That was the name given to the era during which one Clan was victorious over the others, which in turn led to the end of the war (Sengoku Jidai).<br/><br/>Tenkatoitsu simulates 3 battles of the end of Sengoku Jidai: Yamazaki (1582), Nagakute (1584) and Sekigahara (1600).<br/><br/>The game emphasizes orders assigned to each army's Clans as much as the inertia of the battle. A game turn is divided in activation phases drawn from a recipient containing Clan chits and obligatory chits (for combat, movement, etc.). The game system is also remarkable for the battle plans that each players may choose before starting the engagement.<br/><br/>Sieges played a key role in the battle of Yamazaki, and as such have their own specific set of rules.<br/><br/>Players scores victory Points by destroying enemy units or controlling key locations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Establish the most powerful and prestigious family dynasty through marriage alliances, warfare and intrigue in feudal Europe.<br/><br/>Among Nobles is a card game where players establish and expand a family dynasty in feudal Europe. Each player starts with a married couple, the ancestral lord and his lady. Throughout the game new family members are added through birth and marriage. Three generational changes occur where the oldest generation perishes due to old age.<br/><br/>The players take turns activating one of their characters or couples. An activation lets you pick a series of actions in a horizonal row on the character. Since a wife&rsquo;s actions are added to her husband&rsquo;s, activating couples can be more efficient than activating single characters.<br/><br/>Players advance their influence in the game by waging war, earning gold and expanding their family. As the game progresses, more powerful nobles come into play. Red nobles are commanders: strong on warfare actions. Blue nobles are devout: strong on piety actions. Yellow nobles are tradesmen: strong on commerce actions. Green nobles are negotiators with special abilities or intrigue actions.<br/><br/>Gold is used to buy extra actions, pay for wedding feasts, muster armies and pay for the education and finer upbringing of male heirs. Armies are used to wage war, bringing riches and prestige back from distant provinces. Prestige points are a measure of your influence on society. The player with the most prestige points at the end wins the game.<br/><br/>While most daughters get married off to other families, the sons continue your family&rsquo;s bloodline. Games can be won and lost because of the right or wrong marriages.<br/><br/>",

After the overwhelming victory of Xerxes&rsquo; army at Thermopylae, the Greeks return to their country and continue the hard work at the islands.

Build statues in honor of the Gods or finish one of the various temples on the island. All this work needs a lot of marble, which can be found in the many quarries. Houses next to a quarry can mine marble, but some quarries produce more marble than others.<br/><br/>Each round in Hellas players choose an action in the display. When choosing to build a house, palace or square on the island, all others can perform that action, too. Deciding to mine marble (to get more money) will also help other players because they'll earn money too through their houses next to mines. Building pillars in temples or raising a statue are the only type of actions you'll perform by yourself, but at the end of the game all players might score points because of your work.<br/><br/>Strategically build your settlements on the island to gain the most profit from quarries. Timing is crucial: most of your chosen actions can also be immediately performed by all other players. Think ahead to outsmart your opponents and score the most points with your cities.<br/><br/>",

Impish as they are, they're really organized when it comes to forming groups for games. Recruit your team carefully, but not too slowly!<br/><br/>Pick-a-Dog (first published as Formissimo) features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Pig, with the only difference being that dog noses in one game are replaced with piggie snouts in the other. An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined they support up to eight players.<br/><br/>To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, light/dark, one/two arms, with/without sunglasses, and with/without popcorn. (As noted above, combining the two games adds a sixth attribute: pig/dog nose.) Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.<br/><br/>Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot;. The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card (two cards when playing with 6-8). If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.<br/><br/>Whoever has collected the most cards when the game ends wins!<br/><br/>",

From its rise in the ninth century to its decline and fall in the eighteenth, players take part in the golden age that built the city that once was the Queen of the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>Each player controls a patrician household, vying for power against other influential families. To gain clout and fortune (i.e., victory points), families extend their Influence outside the city, sending representatives to foreign markets. As their authority spreads, the power of Venice increases accordingly, and distant towns and ports fall under the sway of the Serenissima. In the meantime, players compete inside the city for the coveted title of Doge, the head of the government, spending resources and Ducati (money) to gain popularity.<br/><br/>But the hegemony of Venice over the Mediterranean is threatened by many enemies. The Republic faces the rise of competing powers, such as the rival seafaring Republic of Genoa and the Crown of Aragon to the west, or the Eastern Roman Empire and then the Turks to the east. Century after century, players will take part in the struggle that will see the rise and fall of the Republic of Venice.<br/><br/>Venetia is played across three epochs: Rise, Apogee and Struggle. A Power track on the board is used to record the passage of time. Venice starts the game in its Rise, and the game ends when the Struggle epoch is completed. Players score VPs at the end of every epoch, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1992, GMT released Rise of the Luftwaffe, the first Down in Flames WWII air combat card game. That game covered the early part of the War in Europe, from 1939 to early 1942. It was followed a few years later by the Eighth Air Force expansion module, which added aircraft and campaigns for the latter part of the war.<br/><br/>Since then there have been two more games (Corsairs and Hellcats, Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942), two packs of additional aircraft (Down in Flames Squadron Pack 1: Fighters, Down in Flames Squadron Pack 2: Bombers), and a large number of C3i modules for the series. However, the original two games have been long out of print. GMT has considered a number of options to address that, from straight reprints to a base game/campaign module arrangement. Finally, though, the company has decided to P500 an entire new game covering the war in the ETO (European Theatre of Operations) from 1940-1944.<br/><br/>Wild Blue Yonder is a true deluxe Down in Flames product. It contains a dozen full campaigns, over 200 aircraft cards, plus all of the necessary targets, resource sheets, and play aids needed for play. All of this is packaged in a large box similar to the ones for the Combat Commander games.<br/><br/>Many of the campaigns are on the same subjects as those in Rise of the Luftwaffe, 8th Air Force and various C3i modules. However, they are not simple reprints of those campaigns. Wild Blue Yonder contains three different types of campaigns: Land Campaigns, Progressive Campaigns, and Operations (The Schweinfurt Raids, for example). The first type is the familiar &ldquo;standard&rdquo; DiF campaign to which players of the system are accustomed. Progressive Campaigns give both players a fixed &ldquo;order of battle&rdquo; along with reinforcements and replacements they will have to use throughout the campaign. This reflects the more attritional nature of these air campaigns.  The game also includes one solitaire campaign for players who don&rsquo;t have an opponent available.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Risk Express, part of the Hasbro Express Line, is a quick-playing game of conquest. Fourteen disks are laid out at the start of the game, each showing one or more countries and the symbols required to conquer these countries, with the symbols being separated into battle lines. Each card belongs to a continent, with some continents having only a single card and some having up to four cards.<br/><br/>A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show artillery, cavalry, general, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.<br/><br/>Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional general line in the process. If a player owns all the cards of one continent, however, those cards are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these cards are now worth more points because you've united the continent under one ruler (you).<br/><br/>When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Trade in spices, silks, gems, iron, and grain can bring great wealth... if you can bend the market to your will. Buy goods as they enter the city docks and sell them to the tradesmen who need them. Increase your profits by buying shares of the shops that use the goods in which you trade. Gain gold and prestige by fulfilling the orders of the Guild Hall craftsmen.<br/><br/>But Venice is a city of fickle demands and mercurial politics. Spend your ducats wisely and look for help from powerful people such as the Guildmaster, the Harbormaster, the Tax Collector... or perhaps a Thief. Even the humble Gondolieri have powerful connections in Venice. In the end, the most important thing to remember is the simple rule of commerce... buy low and sell high!

        "description": "The Settlers of Zarahemla is a re-implementation of CATAN themed around The Book of Mormon. Players try to contribute the most to the land of Zarahemla by building settlements, cities, roads, and helping construct the temple. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards) - wood, grain, brick, water, or stone - to build up their civilizations to get to 12 victory points and win the game.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to Settlers of Catan, but players can add a stone to the temple by paying one brick and one stone.  The player who contributes the most stones gains 2 extra victory points.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone collecting any resource cards based on the roll and position of settlements (or upgraded cities) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), from having made the biggest contribution to building the Zarahemla temple, and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 12 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.<br/><br/>Rather than having individual hexes like CATAN the game has five separate strips of hexes. These are double sided so it is still possible to construct different board configurations.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>The Settlers of Zarahemla Mini-Expansion (2003)<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warfighter is a card game for 1 to 6 players. You play cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete World War II squad-level combat missions.<br/><br/>The core game gives you a full team of US Marines and a full set of Japanese Hostiles. Each Expansion then adds to these sets. This includes the soldiers, weapons, equipment, and tactics used by each of those nations. Everything you need to create your own unique squad of soldiers!<br/><br/>At the start of each mission, you each select one or more Player Soldiers, equip them with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit. You then fight your way through hostile territory and engage enemy soldiers, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective. Every mission is a stand-alone game. You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>Warfighter uses a new combat system that takes into account the fire mode you select for your weapon, range to the target, running out of ammo, suppression fire, and cover - all in the same dice roll! This system creates an incredibly deep narrative with every attack. As you eliminate soldiers, you gain experience to Upgun your Action cards, play Support cards, and activate special Skills.<br/><br/>The contents of this set includes:<br/><br/><br/>     280 cards comprising:<br/>         6 USMC Player Soldiers / 6 Non-Player Soldiers / 5 Squad Soldiers<br/>         9 Missions / 15 Objectives / 18 Locations<br/>         15 Weapons / 6 Gear<br/>         29 Skills<br/>         95 Action / 17 Location Markers<br/>         50 Japanese Hostiles / 9 Events<br/>    <br/>     5 counter sheets with 430 counters<br/>     d6 and d10 dice<br/>     Mounted display board<br/>     9 Campaign sheets<br/>     Warfighter Rulebook<br/><br/><br/>The initial print-run from the Kickstarter also included 65 customized Soldier cards as part of KS pledge levels, in addition to 27 errata cards for Warfighter WWII Europe and 16 extra WWII Pacific cards.<br/><br/>Soldier Types<br/>There are 3 levels of Soldiers in Warfighter: Player Soldiers, Non-Player Soldiers, and Squad Soldiers. If you think about it from a movie point of view...<br/><br/>Player Soldiers are the stars of the movie. You get to see all their details and really get to know them. They get Health, a hand of Action cards, Skills, detailed Weapon cards. These are the guys you know up-close and personal.<br/><br/>Non-Player Soldiers have a cost and you purchase them at the start of a Mission as you would a Player Soldier. The NPSs don't hold a hand of Action cards. They have Weapons, Equipment, and Skills, and you use them as normal. They also have a number of Actions per turn based on their current Health. Instead of relying on Action cards for defense, they use the same Cover rules as the Hostiles.<br/><br/>This makes them much easier to run, and allows you to easily expand your squad.<br/><br/>Squad Soldiers are the guys standing in the background.<br/><br/>Their soldier cards include all their game info. They do not use other cards or Action cards. These Soldiers make it very easy to command an entire squad with a single player. They are also a great way to get new players into the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Test your mettle in three campaigns spanning World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Battle ashore in the blazing heat of Peleliu in September 1944 to discover the Japanese have changed their strategy and you are forced to dig them out of the coral ridges.  Flares reveal waves of Chinese pouring over the rugged mountains of the Chosin Reservoir, Korea, in sub zero weather in November 1950. Fight house to house in Hue City, Vietnam in February 1968. These three campaigns live on in the legends and history of the United States Marine Corps.<br/><br/>Fields of Fire is a solitaire game system that gives players the challenge of commanding a rifle company between World War II and Present Day. The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based. There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single playing is a mission and several missions from an historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 &ndash; 2 hours.<br/><br/>This volume of Fields of Fire  is based on three actual campaigns experienced by units of the 5th Marines of the 1st Marine Division &quot;Blue Diamond&quot; in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam and is the second volume of the Fields of Fire series.<br/><br/>",

The players find out which kind of walls are in certain directions by pressing one of four &quot;arrow buttons&quot; of a &quot;compass&quot; device with a built-in AI (to ensure that each game will have a different house). Walls come in four types: One that allows all animals to pass through, one with a mousehole that allows only mice through, one with a hole in the top that only hares can jump through, and one that's solid and impassable. The players build those walls, creating step-by-step a 3D-labyrinth. The goal of this first phase is to find the &quot;magic doors&quot;, which can be opened only if there is an animal on each side.<br/><br/>Once the players find the magic doors, the ghost &quot;Hubi&quot; appears. The device gives hints to the players, allowing them to deduce where Hubi is so that ideally they can eventually chase it out of the house.<br/><br/>Schnappt Hubi! includes three difficulty levels, with a &quot;timer&quot; running in the hardest level that ends the game after a certain number of moves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cosmic Eidex is an intriguing little trick-taking game for 3 players. The deck consists of 36 cards, 6 thru Ace, in four suits: Hearts (red), Lizard (green), Raven (black) and Stars (yellow). The Cosmic characters are the heart of the game, providing each player with a special Cosmic power. Each player draws one randomly at game start.<br/><br/>In Cosmic Eidex, the idea is to take either the most points or the least points (designated by the trump and rank of the cards that you take each hand), to earn a victory point. If in a hand, one player exceeds 100 card points, then the other two players get 1 victory point each. If one player takes all of the tricks, she receives 2 victory points. Seven victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Cosmic Eidex is a mutation of the ages-old Swiss trick-taking card game Jass. Like Skat, the traditional German trick-taking card game, it is a three-player game.<br/><br/>The Cosmic-like powers each player is given are relatively weak. Most allow the player to break one of the rules once per game (before, during or after), some can be used multiple times. You don&rsquo;t need to know every characters' powers, just the powers of the three characters used in the current game. There are as many character/power possibilities as there are cards, but wise card play usually outweighs their influence.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a faction of revolutionaries&mdash;Workers, Students, Neighbors, or Prisoners&mdash;fighting against the State in the streets of a city that change with each game. Build barricades, clash with riot cops, occupy districts, loot shopping centers, and liberate the city before time runs out and the military arrives! Bloc by Bloc features hidden agendas, deep strategy, area control, asymmetrical player abilities, and a special method for randomly generating billions of unique city layouts. Bloc by Bloc 2nd edition features brand new art, streamlined gameplay, improved components and new objectives for the insurrection!<br/><br/>The game lasts up to 10 rounds. Each round is 1 night and each night has 2 phases. During the Nighttime phase, each player takes a turn: 3-5 actions followed by a police response that is controlled by the Police Ops deck and the level of Police Morale. Each player starts with 2 blocs in the city and can add more throughout the game. On a player's turn, they roll dice and take one action (such as looting, occupying, attacking, or barricading) for each die rolled with 1+ of their blocs. Players may use loot cards to enhance their actions. After all factions have taken their turns, the Sunrise phase begins, which is when police go on the attack and factions have a chance to liberate districts.<br/><br/>The police and the State are the common enemies of all factions. Factions must build occupations in all of their own districts for the social insurrection to be successful. However, each faction also has its own secret agenda with a set of specific tasks that faction must complete in order to win the game. The majority of factions will have Social Agendas and they must cooperate to win the game together. But some factions may have Vanguardist or Nihilist Agendas that secretly pit them against the social insurrection. These factions can only win the game alone!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Sherlock 13, first published as Holmes 13, the players take the role of a detective, trying to unmask the famous thief Arsene Lupin, who is among them in disguise.<br/><br/>The game consists of 13 character cards, with 2 to 3 characteristics each. Each characteristic is shared by 3 to 5 characters. The cards are shuffled and one is drawn and put aside. This card represents the disguise chosen by Arsene Lupin. The other cards are distributed evenly among the players. The players now tally the total of characteristics they have on their cards (e.g. 2 detectives, 1 female, 0 genius etc) and note them for later use.<br/><br/>Players now take turns, asking a question to gather new evidence:<br/><br/>a.) To all players: &quot;Who has (at least one) of (this characteristic)?<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>b.) To one player: &quot;How many of (this characteristic) do you have?<br/><br/>Using these clues the players try to figure out which disguise Arsene has chosen (i.e. which card is missing). Instead of a question, a player may announce which character he suspects to be Arsene in disguise. That player then secretly checks the hidden card. If the suspicion was correct, this player wins the game, otherwise the player is eliminated and the other players continue.<br/><br/>",

When a player manages to get his Trooper into the Hive location and play three gas can cards to fuel his Flamethrower, he wins the game for the humans.<br/><br/>However, one of the players is a Host. He must keep this identity secret, infecting as many team members as possible to gain allies and prevent the humans from completing their mission. Only players who carefully watch the behavior of team members and find a good balance between cooperation and paranoia will stand a chance against the infected players and roaming parasites.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique exponential traitor-system and combines tactical play with a compelling psychological mindgame amongst players.<br/><br/>Panic Station is a game of growing paranoia in which no one can truly trust anyone. Can you maintain your sanity and destroy the source of this evil?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guards of Atlantis: Tabletop MOBA is a competitive team-based board game inspired by computer games of the MOBA genre. In the game, each player controls a single hero and uses a hand of cards to move him around the game board, employ special abilities, and attack enemies. Defeating enemy minions earns you coins, which are used to buy levels and upgrade your hero. Your goal is to help your &quot;minions&quot; &mdash; units that are not directly controlled by the players &mdash; reach the enemy base and capture it.<br/><br/>Even though Guards of Atlantis can be played with just two players, it's more fun when two teams of players face one another as the game encourages teamwork and tactical play.<br/><br/>Before the game, every player chooses a hero character to play. Each hero has five cards at the start of the game, with an additional thirteen upgraded versions from which to choose when your hero gains a level. Each card is unique and can be used for a variety of different actions. The character roles are not preset and can evolve on the battlefield to better suit your strategy and counter the opponent's choices. There are no dice to roll, but playing the right card at the right moment is crucial.<br/><br/>The game begins with players placing their heroes and minions at predefined spots of the game board. The game is split into rounds, with each round consisting of up to four turns. Every player gets to play one card and resolve one action each turn. The cards are played face down, then revealed and resolved in order of initiative values indicated on the cards.<br/><br/>If at any point a team loses all of their minions in the area, the lane is &quot;pushed&quot;, with all minions on the board moving one area closer to the opponent's base. The game continues, with each team trying to help their minions to move to the enemy base. The first team do this wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ukraine is in turmoil: embroiled in a civil war which has lasted for years and the situation seems further from resolution with each year that passes. Clandestine support from both Russia and the West fuels the war and keeps any hope of peace at bay. In the meantime, the civil war in Syria and the fight against Islamic extremism gathers steam. NATO and Russia stare each other down in a &quot;coopetittion&quot; in the region, and tensions rise meteorically as not so &quot;friendly&quot; fire incidents occur. The West tightens sanctions against Russia and ratchets up its rhetoric; Russia, meanwhile, attempting to regain a place in global power politics, responds with sanctions of its own against Turkey and starts low-level cyber warfare and &quot;little green men&quot; incidents in the Baltics. Tempers flare across the world, Turkey shoots down another Russian plane while Russian SAM batteries shoot down a Turkish F-16 in retaliation. Russia declares enough is enough, decides on war with NATO, and invades the Baltics and Poland. Belarus, knowing where it's bread is buttered, joins in.  Some NATO nations rush to the rescue while others debate the issue. Once again, Europe trembles to the rumble of tank treads and marching boots&hellip;<br/><br/>Next War: Poland, the fourth volume in GMT's Next War Series. This game moves the action from Asia to Europe and allows players to fight a near future war in Poland as the Russians and their allies invade and NATO responds.<br/><br/>Only a portion of Poland is shown as Ukraine is assumed to be in the midst of a grinding civil war. The Russians are not the behemoth of the Cold War, but they possess good material and a much better trained army. The Baltics may fall quickly, although their forces may put up some resistance and make an appearance as reinforcements, and the front quickly establishes itself in eastern Poland as the Russian 6th and 20th Armies push forward while NATO rushes forces into the area spearheaded by the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and followed up by whatever nation's troops respond to the Article 5 declaration. The question is, can NATO stop the Russians or will Poland be overrun?<br/><br/>Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Play is similar to magic - draw a card, play cards, tap resources and build. Players play resources which they tap to build their units. Once built, units attack the opponents units, resources, or deck. Each point of damage to the deck scraps a card from it. Once a player's deck runs out of cards, he loses the game.<br/><br/>There were several expansion sets including: Mechwarrior, Counterstrike, Mercenaries, Arsenal, Commanders &amp; Crusade.<br/><br/>A compendium of the entire card set is downloadable here: Battletech Card List.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At Any Cost: Metz 1870 is a game simulating the situation west of the Metz fortress during those few days of August 1870. The game is designed to be a playable, two-player brigade-scale game that allows players to experience the unique tactical warfare matchups that characterized fighting during the Franco-Prussian War.<br/><br/>This era, though generally overlooked in the gaming industry, is a fascinating study in Napoleonic tactics (and uniforms) slamming head-on into modern killing technology. The Prussian military juggernaut is armed with the new steel Krupp breach-loading artillery pieces that far outclassed the French guns. Prussian doctrine, adapted to the lessons learned during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, allowed junior officers to exercise initiative and aggressiveness. The French army, meanwhile, was armed with the modern and deadly Chassepot rifle, a firearm so advanced that many argue its deployment alone should have won the war for the French. In addition, the French army was now equipped with their ultimate secret weapon - the Mitrailleuse, which was the first machinegun used en masse. Moreover, the game system makes clear that the French soldier, despite misconceptions to the contrary, fought valiantly during these battles. By all rights, they could have &ndash; and should have &ndash; won many of these engagements. But leadership, morale and tenacity won the day for the Prussians.<br/><br/>All these factors are seamlessly embedded into the At Any Cost game system and players will be challenged to utilize their advantages and minimize their disadvantages throughout the game. Will YOU as the Prussian player be able to withstand an early severe numerical disadvantage and use the brave audacity of the Prussian soldier and artilleryman to win the day? Can YOU as the French player overcome the lethargic and uninspired command structure of the Army of the Rhine and allow your tough and well-equipped infantry to fight unhindered?<br/><br/>At Any Cost: Metz 1870 also features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the current situation. Unlike traditional chit-pull mechanisms, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.<br/><br/>UNITS<br/><br/>All brigades and artillery groups of both the French Army of the Rhine and the Prussian First and Second Armies that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each Strength Point equals 600 infantrymen, 450 cavalry troopers, 3 heavy artillery pieces or 4 light artillery pieces. In addition, units have a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience plus a Movement Allowance.<br/><br/>SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS<br/><br/>Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a two-D10 dice mechanic. Two differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The first (colored) die generates an initial result and the second (white) die simultaneously informs the players of any physical casualties suffered by the unit and any morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire. The assault combat system uses a differential mechanism and results in a more dynamic combat outcome.<br/><br/>Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, March or Regroup. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.<br/><br/>Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for both players. It features three different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:<br/><br/>Activation Chits = these activate all units of the listed Corps or Cavalry Division. In some scenarios, Activation chits for the French player are fed into the game piece-meal to represent the slow reaction time of the French command structure. But the French player does have some options to speed up this process (see below). <br/>CIC Chits = these are special Activation Chits. The Prussian player has a Chief-of-Staff chit and the French player has a Commander-in-Chief chit. These chits allow players to select any one Division (for the Prussian player) or any one Brigade (for the French player) for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate units twice in the turn. <br/>Event Chits = there are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of a turn, players select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are then placed into the cup with the pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they initially chose.<br/><br/>Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all of which are different) and a Command (or Common) Event side. The Unique Event is tactical in nature and has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Event examples are Auftragstaktik, Krupp&rsquo;s Guns, Beaten Zone, Moulin a&rsquo; Cafe and Battlefield Conditions. The Command (Common) Event side is used for more strategic options. The Prussian player may attempt to speed up his reinforcements and/or change their arrival location and to curtail the effects of the Prussian Aggressive Tactics Event that the French player may play against him. The French player can use his Command Events to hasten his Activation chit availability and to attempt to cancel the effects of the crippling Bazaine&rsquo;s Malaise Event.<br/><br/>Prussian Strategic Movement: In order to add player input into the strategic off-map movement of the approaching Prussian forces, some scenarios offer the opportunity to use the unique hidden Prussian Strategic Movement system. This involves the Prussian player openly moving units on a special point-to-point map whose results, nevertheless, are hidden from the French player. This will vary where and when the Prussian forces arrive on the map. However, the system is set up so that even the Prussian player cannot be assured of the arrival time or the content of his forces. There will be a solitaire friendly version of this feature, as well.<br/><br/>MAP<br/><br/>The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire west of Metz. Each hex equal approximately 500 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, towns, quarries etc.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/><br/>The game includes six scenarios:<br/><br/>The Afternoon Crisis - a small, limited battle depicting the French advance across the Fond de la Cove on August 16th, 1870. This scenario serves as a teaching experience for new players. <br/>Twilight Of The Guards &ndash; a small, limited battle depicting the fighting around St. Privat on August 16th, which at one point resulted in 6,000 Prussian Guardsmen casualties being inflicted in 15 minutes! This scenario serves as a teaching experience for new players. <br/>The Battle of Mars-La-Tour &ndash; the whole battle beginning at 8:00 am and continuing the entire day. There are two variations offered &ndash; historical and free-setup deployments. There are also options for a historical reinforcements schedule or a variable schedule utilizing the Prussian Strategic Movement system. <br/>The Battle of Gravelotte-St. Privat &ndash; &ndash; the entire day-long battle. There are two variations offered &ndash; historical and free-setup deployments. There are also options for a historical reinforcements schedule or a variable schedule utilizing the Prussian Strategic Movement system. <br/>Campaign Scenario #1 &ndash; the game begins with the Mars-La-Tour scenario but continues past the first day until the campaign victory conditions are achieved.  <br/>Campaign Scenario #2 &ndash; the game begins on August 15th and the French player must march the entire Army of the Rhine across the map to escape to Verdun or, as a secondary option, protect the army from destruction. The Prussian army&rsquo;s movement is done entirely via the Prussian Strategic Movement system until they enter the game map. This scenario gives players the option to shape an entirely new campaign.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>1 &ndash; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map<br/>2 &ndash; 9/16&rdquo; countersheets<br/>1 &ndash; Rulebook<br/>1 &ndash; Playbook (Scenarios, Historical Notes and Examples of Play)<br/>1 &ndash; Game Tracks Card<br/>1 &ndash; Prussian Strategic Movement Card<br/>4 &ndash; Player Aids (2 Prussian and 2 French) <br/>4 &ndash; Ten-Sided Dice (1 Blue, 1 Red and 2 White)<br/><br/>",

The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.<br/><br/>Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).<br/><br/>Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.<br/><br/>Runebound is playable solo and the first edition was updated with a 2nd Edition in 2005 (only 1 year after its release).<br/><br/>Runebound 1st Edition is different from 2nd Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by two 10-sided dice in the 2nd edition, which helped to better balance the luck factor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nightfighter Ace, Air Defense Over Germany, 1943-44 is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a German Nightfighter during World War II. Each turn consists of several days, during which a combat mission will be flown from one of many bases in Europe, attempting to intercept incoming British Bombers. Nightfighter Ace is based on the popular, action-packed Hunters game system by Gregory M. Smith with a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion and receive awards.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a German Nightfighter pilot and rack up kills. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request a transfer to other nightfighter bases in an attempt to get &quot;closer to the action&quot; or request a newer type of nightfighter. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player's eventual goal &ndash; to become the top nightfighter ace of the war.<br/><br/>The system is packed with rich technical detail but without the complexity to capture the key historical facets of the night bombing campaign over Germany. In terms of nightfighters alone, there are 32 nightfighter models available to pilot. The families of nightfighters include:<br/><br/>        Bf110 (10 aircraft)<br/>        Ju88 (5 aircraft)<br/>        Do 215/217 (6 aircraft)<br/>        He219 (10 aircraft)<br/>        Ta154 (1 aircraft)<br/><br/><br/>For each nightfighter, you will be tracking the date of availability, speed, area of operations based on originating base, individual weapon systems, electronic systems, damage, and crew status.<br/><br/>Nightfighters can be assigned to one of seven possible major geographic base &ldquo;groups&rdquo; as follows:<br/><br/>        Dutch: Melsbroek, Schipol, Deelen, St. Trond, Twenthe, Leeuwarden, Venlo, Gilze-Rijen<br/>        Bremen: Vechta, Schleswig-Holstein, Stade, Grove<br/>        French: Florennes, Dijon, Juvincourt<br/>        Berlin: Stendal, Parchim, Werneuchen<br/>        Munich: Schleissheim, Neubiberg<br/>        Műnster: Műnster<br/>        Frankfurt: Mainz, Rhein-Main<br/><br/><br/>Besides the focus on hardware, the soft aspects of the war are also faithfully rendered for each pilot and crew. For example, air crew is characterized by various major and minor skills, including numerous Pilot skills, Funker (Radio Operator) skills, Bordmech. (Flight Engineer) skills, Bordschuetze (Rear Gunner) skills, and Prestige Level. The emphasis on various skills and benefits to gaining experience creates even a stronger narrative when compared to the Hunters game system, which helps weave a tense and dramatic narrative during play. One major change in Nightfighter Ace over Hunters is the ability to choose your crew improvements instead of randomly rolling for them. As these greatly impact on your combat capability (and survival), it is a major decision you must make.<br/><br/>Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot and crew along with your nightfighter assignment, play proceeds by checking for incoming raid information while checking for weather prior to take off (as the sortie may be cancelled). One must also check for random electronic failure. Following successful take off, play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the British bombers. One is not immune to Spoof raids, in which case German ground control is deceived, causing you to burn precious time and fuel flying the wrong direction. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a new nightfighter, or request a change of base. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until July 1944 should you make it through unscathed.<br/><br/>This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters or Silent Victory designed by Gregory M. Smith (published by Consim Press). The game system lends itself very well to capturing the tense air defense over Germany. While Nightfighter Ace is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions.<br/> Product Information:<br/><br/>        Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>        Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10<br/>        Time Scale: 3-4 days per Turn<br/>        Map Scale: Abstract<br/>        Unit Scale: individual aircraft, individual weapon systems, individual electronic systems, specific crew members, and ammo rounds<br/>        Players: one (with option for two or more)<br/>        Playing Time: two to three hours<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Components:<br/><br/>        One Countersheet of 9/16&Prime; unit-counters<br/>        Sixteen Aircraft Display Mats 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime; (double-sided, 32 total)<br/>        Four Player Aid Cards 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;<br/>        One Combat Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;<br/>        One Bomber Target Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;<br/>        One Pilot Awards Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;<br/>        One Air Operations Display Mat 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo;<br/>        Forty Ace Pilot Cards<br/>        Sixty Combat Cards<br/>        Rules Booklet featuring extensive Historical Background<br/>        One Logsheet 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;<br/>        Two 6-sided and one 10-sided die<br/>        Box and Lid<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Amun-Re: The Card Game is a card-based version of Amun-Re, and the auction at the heart of that game is still present in this design, with the results of those auctions driving the rest of the action.<br/><br/>In more detail, Amun-Re: The Card Game lasts three rounds, with three auctions in each round, followed by other actions, then a scoring. Each player starts the game with money cards valued 0-8, and at the start of the game, everyone chooses money cards that sum to 14 (with the 0 being included) and lays those cards face up on the table. Province cards equal to the number of players are revealed, and players take turns bidding on provinces by placing exactly one money card next to one province, outbidding an opponent if someone else has already bid there; if you're outbid, you take back your money card, then bid again on your next turn. Eventually everyone will have bid on separate provinces, after which you discard the non-0 bids, then lay out new province cards and run through two more rounds of bidding.<br/><br/>Province cards show different numbers of pyramids, ankhs, and fields, with a caravan possibly being visible as well. Whoever has the most ankhs visible is Pharaoh, going first in each action with ties broken from the Pharaoh going clockwise.<br/><br/>After three rounds of auctions, players will have some amount of money (possibly only the 0) still in hand. Everyone simultaneously makes an offering of gold, and the sum of the offerings determines how much the Nile floods, which determines how much money players will earn from fields. If the sum is 10 or less, players with caravans receive 10 gold per caravan. Whoever offers the most gold receives three pyramids to place on their province cards, with others receiving two and one pyramids.<br/><br/>In player order, players determine their income level, then spend gold to build pyramids on their cards (distributing them as equally as possible), then they take money cards into their hand to account for any income not spent. They then score points for sets of pyramids, for having nine or more fields, and for having the most ankhs.<br/><br/>The second and third rounds of the game play out similarly, except that when you claim cards following the auction, you place these province cards on top of your previous province cards so that only the imprinted and acquired pyramids are visible. Everything else is buried in the sands. You score again at the end of each of these rounds, then the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

In this respect, the game is a reverse tower defense game, as players sail the perimeter trying to push back and contain the oil, remove dice from the water and save the sea life.<br/><br/>Communal resource cards are chosen by the team before the game begins and are then powered for use by either removing 3 oil dice from the game or saving a full set of 6 marine creatures.<br/><br/>Weather dice complicate matters adding new challenges for the round that restrict movement, drop more dice or increase the cost of operations.<br/><br/>It takes coordination and teamwork to win, as new oil dice are dropped at the beginning of every turn and the number of oil dice dropped increases over the course of the game.<br/><br/>If the team can accomplish all three objectives on their WIN Condition card and remedy any potential losing conditions on the board by the end of a given turn - they win. Otherwise the game will end when the 60 dice from the bag are exhausted or they are unable to correct one of the three losing conditions.<br/><br/>Contain the Oil. Save the Sea Life.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Using only the raw materials provided by some dubious &quot;Suppliers to the Anatomical Trade&quot;, harnessed lightning, and the services of a motley crew of unattractive servants, in It's Alive! you race to collect the eight body parts needed to create your monster and bring it to life. Unfortunately, the local peasants are particularly clumsy and tend to die in freak farming accidents, so the dubious gentlemen rarely find a whole cadaver in sufficiently good condition. Instead, they offer the parts they have managed to salvage. Each turn, you may buy the offered part, sell it to an anatomist for a meager profit, or auction it, trying to get a better deal or rip off your opponents. You might be lucky and get a coffin with a weakling clerk's cadaver in it, which can be used in lieu of any strapping villager's body part, or your involvement in the macabre trade might invoke the villagers' wrath.<br/><br/>Reimplements (and reimplemented by)<br/><br/><br/>    The Menorah Game<br/><br/><br/>",

They learned of the existence of a global terrorist organization known only as VENOM.  This group was  responsible not only for every act of terror in the past two decades, but they were also the ones who brought about the start of World War III.<br/><br/>Their only goal is that of world domination, and armed with this knowledge the UN enacted Project Freedom.  Their chosen general, Abraham Steele, would be in charge of recruiting an elite task force whose only goal would be to stop VENOM once and for all.<br/><br/>Venom Assault is a Cooperative Deck Building game with Dice based combat for 1-5 players.  Players will use their turns to recruit new Freedom Squadron Soldiers and Vehicles into their hands that they will use to challenge one of the seven VENOM leaders on the board.  Each card will have set abilities that can help bring about victory, but VENOM can also call upon their own troops to help them out as well.<br/><br/>Each game will be played using one of ten missions in the base game, which will tell players what goals they need to accomplish to win the game. However VENOM is not going to be idle and if the players are not careful and quick, they may find they have lost to their devious foes while they weren't looking.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gwent is a standalone card game included inside the Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt videogame by CD Projekt Red. It was available as a physical copy with the Xbox One Collector's Edition of the video game (Northern Realms and Nilfgaardian Empire factions), in &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;physical expansion for PC/PS4 (Scoia'Tel and Monsters factions) and with the purchase of the Season Pass giving you the opportunity to ask for redeem code to buy both limited editions versions on CD Projekt Red merchandising store.<br/><br/>Gwent has two players simulating a war between two of four factions: Northern Realms, Scoia'Tael, Monsters, or Nilfgaardian Empire. Players take turns adding strength to the battlefield until both players pass. The highest strength on the battlefield wins the round and matches are played best of three, with little to no card drawing in between rounds. Special cards may also be played to reduce the effect of certain unit types. Gwent also features various once-per-game leader abilities and deck building rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kaivai, by the Ostertag brothers, is a board game about a dynamically-growing island region and the various uses of the islands. The title is Polynesian and means &quot;Water eaters&quot;.<br/>The game is about catching fish to trade for shells and points. The shell money is used to build up the islands, in order to gain more points. At the start of the game the players bid for turn order. The highest bidder goes first and may move his ships - but must pay dearly for new islands. Those who bid less get to pay less for the islands, but don&rsquo;t get to move as much. The players can choose from six different player actions. When a player chooses an action for the first time, it&rsquo;s free. But if it&rsquo;s chosen a second time, it must be paid for and the payment increases each subsequent time that action is chosen. At the start of the next round, the value of the shells is reduced and the fish come closer to rotting. After 8 rounds comes the final scoring, in which the portions of the islands controlled by the players are counted.<br/>(Spielbox)<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Kaivai Expansion<br/><br/><br/>",

Use your characters' unique abilities to gain points and achieve victory!<br/><br/>Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative &quot;cooldown&quot; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for all four game scenarios.<br/><br/>Funkoverse Strategy Game: DC Comics 101 is a standalone game that includes the characters Robin and Catwoman. This set may be combined with others, giving you the ability to assemble the team you want!<br/><br/>",

They must keep all 1s that they roll, but they can choose to reroll all non-1 dice twice. After the second roll, all players can use the rolled dice to fill one or more of the dice on their sheet &mdash; but only if the die of the matching color shows a value equal to or less than what's on the score sheet.<br/><br/>For example, if your row shows a yellow 6, blue 5, white 4, etc., and you or the active player rolls yellow 3, blue 6, white 4, etc., you can choose to write &quot;3&quot; in the yellow space (earning yourself 3 points at the end of the game), but you may choose not to since you could score up to 6 points for that space. You can't write anything in blue since the die is higher than the number shown. You definitely want to write 4 in the white space since 4 is the most points you can score there. What's more, since you had an exact hit, you &quot;x&quot; the box as well, and you score bonus points in a row for the number of &quot;x&quot;s that you have.<br/><br/>If you can't or don't want to fill in a number, you must cross out the leftmost space in your current row, earning no points for this space. As soon as all spaces in a row are filled or crossed off, you start the next row with the next roll of the dice. The game ends the turn that someone completes the fifth row, after which everyone tallies their points to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players get 7 chits with +/- values on them, 5 of which they may use to secretly vote for the bands they want to support. Players are awarded points at the end of a round if one of their bands is in the top 6 slots. Players also have 2 special chits that either award extra points if played on a band that jumps to #1, or add/deduct points based on how far up (or down) a band moves from its original position. Some bands in the last 4 slots are removed at the end of a round depending on their original board position, and the top 3 are removed (one-hit wonders) once a player's score reaches the 30 and 50 point mark. The game ends once a player reaches 70 points total. Very nice artwork and goofy band names (as only the Germans can do it) are complemented by one of the cooler game components ever; a wooden &quot;CD Player&quot; that the DJ (dealer) uses to tally up the votes.<br/><br/>Please be aware that, although this was formerly listed as a family game, a few of the band names contain adult language.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     BrettspielWelt (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>",

Players are the most powerful leaders in the world working alongside up to nine others to build a starship. Time is short! The goal? Build and be on a starship that escapes a dying world &mdash; or betray everyone to ensure your own survival. No seats on the starship are guaranteed. We're Doomed! is a quick, timed, panic-inducing game of international collaboration, retaliation, diplomacy, conspiracy, and blowing each other up for fun!<br/><br/>It is not the 11th hour. It is the final hour. Do we have time? How many seats will be available? Who will get a seat? Will the ship even get completed? During the Action Phase, players take one action in turn order to produce or steal either Resource or Influence tokens. Resource tokens are used to build the escape ship. The bigger the ship, the more players can escape to victory at the end of the game. Influence tokens determine who boards the ship first at the end of the game. Each civilization is better at one of the standard actions.<br/><br/>During the Contribution Phase, there is no turn structure. Players can negotiate as they pledge their Resources to building the escape ship by contributing Resource tokens. The player who contributes the most Resources is awarded 1 Influence and gets to draw the event card for that round. Each card is one of one hundred unique and ruthless event cards that change the game drastically &mdash; introducing new restrictions, secret missions, ethical dilemmas, physical challenges, robots, aliens, lizard-people and more. The player who drew the event card then takes an action, starting the next Action Phase. The game continues in this fashion (actions, contributions, event) until time is out!<br/><br/>After 15 minutes, play stops. Time to board the starship. Who gets in first? The players with the most Influence board the ship first. Once full, the ship launches and the remaining players are left behind to die. Beware! Resources can also be used to nuke a player, completely eliminating them from the game, so watch the other players&rsquo; Resource token stockpiles!<br/><br/>Witness humanity at its worst and finally come to terms with the truth you have known all along &mdash; we're doomed!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once more, conflict rages across the world of Aerim. You are one of the Eternals, a group of immortals forever waging war from the shadows. Call forth your champions to battle against those of your timeless foes. Harness the legacy of each champion's deeds as they echo across time to empower the next. For the Champions of Aerim, this cycle continues, as it always has and always will. For the Eternals, there is only...strife.<br/><br/>Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.<br/><br/>Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.<br/><br/>Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple racing game where speed and movement is decided by the driver and not the dice. Only when exceeding safety speeds on the bends are dice used to decide the penalty incurred.<br/><br/>The players use &quot;dashboards&quot;, cardboard cutouts resembling dashboards, complete with a speedometer and tire and brake wear gauges.  Maximum acceleration is fixed, tire and brake wear may happen as a result of cornering too quickly&mdash;then there are the dreaded spinouts.  A few tight spots exist, so blocking is also an effective tactic.<br/>Tactic cards (you get 5 for the entire race) put a few aces up your sleeve.  They can give you an extra burst of speed or of cornering ability.<br/><br/>Pit stops will get you fresh brakes and tires but you must reach them by exact count&mdash;otherwise you're forced into another lap.  Also, pit cards throw a monkeywrench in&mdash;usually you'll lose a turn, but now and then you'll get extra fast service, a burst of speed in coming out of the pit, or special brakes good for one extra corner.<br/><br/>The race runs for up to 10 laps; the player furthest past the finish line when all players have had the same number of turns wins.<br/>The game's simplicity makes it accessible to younger players, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults.<br/><br/>",

As the King&rsquo;s Minister, your Sovereign has given you the mission to welcome and accompany these princes and princesses who will present themselves at the gates of the city. Every development added to the city made by your guests increases your prestige.<br/><br/>Online play<br/><br/><br/>    Jeux sur un Plateau (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/>40 Monument Figures: 8 for each of the 5 civilizations (Mayan, Persian, Egyptian, Greek and Chinese)<br/>4 Wonder Figures<br/>5 Minister Figures: 1 of each color (used for Score Track)<br/>200 Prince Tokens: 40 of each color<br/>40 Bases: 8 of each color<br/>10 Privilege tokens: 2 of each color<br/>40 Guest tokens: 2 per civilization for each of the four islands on the board<br/>50 Action Cards: 10 for each civilization<br/>5 Rule Summary Cards: 1 per player<br/>1 Bag<br/><br/>Basic Game play:<br/><br/>Turn order (after the first player) is derived from who has the highest score on the perimtere score track yet has not had a turn. Each game turn is broken down into three phases:<br/>Phase 1: Welcoming the Princes<br/>Phase 2: Development of the City<br/>Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points<br/><br/>Phase 1: Welcoming the Princes<br/><br/>In the first phase, Guest tokens are placed on the board near ship icons but corresponding to the symbol on each token. These guest tokens are then replaced with Prince tokens that is their own color, or of the same civilization as the chosen Guest or in any District of the island indicated by the Guest or any combination of these. This is repeated three times until all Guest tokens have been removed from the board. While this is happening, players may Build a Wonder or Take Control of a District.<br/><br/>At any point during their turn, if a player has one prince of each of the 5 civilizations on one island (regardless of which Districts they are in), he may immediately construct a Wonder and receives 6 Prestige Points. There may only be one Wonder per island and a player does not have to construct Wonders.<br/><br/>At any point during their turn, if a player possesses 3 princes of the same civilization in the same District, and that District is not already controlled by another player, he may decide to take control of the District by placing a Monument on that District. There can only be one Monument per District, and this space, once acquired, cannot be retaken. For taking control of a District the player gains Prestige Points during Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points. Also, if the District belongs to an island where a Wonder has been constructed, the owner of the Wonder immediately scores the number of Prestige Points indicated on the District.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Development of the City<br/><br/>Each player receives 5 Action cards and discards based on their score in the score track. The person in the lead discards two cards, the last player doesn't discard any and all other players discard one. Four types of actions are possible and occur multiple times in a player's turn:<br/><br/>1) Move one or two princes:<br/><br/>If a player decides to move two princes with a single action card, these two princes must be within the same District and make the same movement.<br/><br/>LAND MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization to an adjacent District (Districts are separated by alleys or bridges).<br/><br/>SEA MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization from one maritime District (showing a ship) to another maritime District. These two Districts must be in the same maritime sector or in two adjacent maritime sectors. (The division of the maritime sectors is indicated by the dotted lines originating from the 3 lighthouses of the city).<br/><br/>2) Add a prince:<br/><br/>By discarding an Action Card, a player may place a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization.<br/><br/>3) Remove a Prince:<br/><br/>If the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. Th e player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.<br/><br/>or 4) Influence the King (altering the Prestige Scale):<br/><br/>If the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. The player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.<br/><br/>The value of each civilization, indicated on the Prestige Scale, determines the point value of the districts controlled by each player at the end of the turn. By discarding an Action Card, a player may increase the value of a civilization by 1. The Value figure of the civilization changes places with the figure directly above it. With two Action cards, a player may reduce the value of a civilization to 1. All the other figures are moved up accordingly. At the end of their turn a player can only have a maximum of 5 Action Cards.<br/><br/>Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points<br/><br/>Once all the players have carried out their actions, the points for the round are calculated. Each player, in turn order, gains points for each District that they control. The value of each civilization is indicated on the Prestige Scale. The players&rsquo; Minister figures are moved up the Score Track.<br/><br/>If one or more players have reached at least 50 Prestige Points at the end of this phase, the game ends. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

When your hero completes quests, defeats baddies, and takes all the credit, they also earn loot, which you get the great honor of carrying!<br/><br/>Squire for Hire is an 18-card, tile-laying inventory management game for 1-2 players that takes about 15-20 min to play. Players compete to get the highest scoring bag of items for their hero by the end of the story deck.<br/><br/>Each player takes on the role of a random squire card, taking turns completing story cards and adding loot to their bag for points. You can complete story cards one of two ways: 1) having enough item value (the combined number of spaces an item type takes up in your bag) or 2) using an item (covering up an item in your bag with a new loot card). If you can complete a story card, you get to pick one of two loot cards to add to your bag; to do so, at least one full item must be placed within empty or full squares. You can cover any number of other items in your bag as long as the entire item is covered.<br/><br/>Once all story cards have been exhausted, players add up their scores. Add 1 point for each regular item, 1 point for each pair of identical items side-by-side, and extra points for conditions met on your squire card. Visible junk items reduce your score by 1 point each, so cover them up whenever possible!<br/><br/>Keep vital items in your bag for when you need them, pack efficiently for extra points, and eliminate junk to be the squire with the highest scoring bag! Play solo to beat your own high score with all of the cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You group your ships into formations, assigning them orders, and select the targets to attack with torpedoes and guns.  Simple mechanisms control Japanese maneuvers and target assignments in a realistic manner.  You never know when combat will occur until the explosion of torpedo salvos signals the presence of Japanese forces who detected you first and made their surprise attacks.  The two-player version modifies the solitaire game and pits players against each other in an exciting recreation of World War II naval combat.

        "description": "From the Manufacturer<br/>Discover the secrets of Hogwarts in this version of the classic Mystery game. Enjoy new game play features and a moving Hogwarts game board. Dark magic has been performed at Hogwarts. A fellow student has vanished from the famous School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--and it is up to you to solve the mysterious disappearance.<br/>Play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna or Neville and try to discover who did it, what spell or item they used, and where the student was attacked. Was it Draco Malfoy with a Sleeping Draught in the Owlery?<br/>Move around Hogwarts making suggestions--but watch out. Wheels on the board actually move to reveal secret passages, hidden staircases, and even the Dark Mark. Think you've gathered all the facts you need? Go to Dumbledore's office to make your final accusation to win the game.<br/><br/>This version of the classic Clue game combines the standard clue idea of going from room to room making suggestions of who, what, and where. However, this version adds a few new ideas.  The first is the ever changing board.  On a players turn s/he roles three dice, two regular and a special die.  The special die has the four houses of Hogwarts on it.  This allows a player to change the layout of the board, by opening/closing doors, changing the secret passage way, reveling the dark mark (causing lose of house points), or getting help cards.<br/><br/>The house points are a second change.  In this version either a player can win, or all players can lose and the dark side wins, by getting all the players house points.  House points are lost when the dark mark appears and a card is reveled from the dark deck.  The players affected must either show a help card that protects them from the dark deck card, or lose the set number of house points.  Dropping to zero house points causes a player to lose and out of the game.<br/><br/>The other two card types are the third change in the game.  There are help cards that consist of items, allies, and spells.  These are used to combat the second deck, the Dark Deck.  The dark deck cards are revealed when a dark mark appears either on the dice roll, or by moving the house wheels changing the door layouts.  The dark mark card affect players in specific locations and those players must be able to show the indicated help cards or lose house points.<br/><br/>All-in-all the idea is the same as traditional clue, but the extra things makes the game just different enough.  People that like Clue and/or Harry Potter would enjoy this version.<br/><br/>",

In our village, in every house we are enjoying its crafty yet unforgiving nature. <br/>This game offers you a chance to become a chief of one of the four ancient tribes. And chief's goal is to bring the prosperity to his people. Expand your tribe, find food and praise the great spirits of nature!<br/><br/>Natives is a card game, where each player take a role of tribe leader, guiding his tribe to prosperity through clever management of resources. Each turn player adds one or more cards to the parries - the &quot;open market&quot; and then chooses one of professions in clan to activate. Professions allow player to take different card from players and add them to tableau - chiefs help to recruit people, warriors collect spoils, shaman provide totems and so on. Each card grants a player some points, but new people in clan also helps to collect more cards, when activating their professions. So, each player must decide, when it's time to stop building tribe engine and start to gather resources and prepare for the winter.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The player with the lowest value (and for ties, farther back), moves first.  If your horse and rider land on another player's figure, you displace them backward.

Several game modes, various challenges, different levels of difficulty and random distribution of districts will make each game different!<br/><br/>Your goal will vary depending on the mode chosen, but it&rsquo;s all about building structures that you will pay for with materials gained with your actions. You only have a certain number of rounds to reach your goal, so plan every move carefully.<br/><br/>Micro City second edition introduces 2 completely new game modes and several changes to the base game. It&rsquo;s still primarily a solitaire game but now you can also play against another player or face challenges together in a 2 player coop mode.<br/><br/>In Micro City you start of by rolling 2 dice. You then play one of the cards on your hand and resolve its effects. Each card causes your builder to move through the city and perform an action - either basic or an advanced one which requires a correct die. You then gain benefits from the city tile your builder ends up on. Be careful as each tile action uses one of your investment tokens and blocks that tile until the investment token is removed. Also bear in mind that you have a certain amount of time to fulfill your current objective so plan your moves wisely!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The tourists will of course seek out the cheapest hotels first, so you must carefully plan when to demand sky high prices, and when to drop prices low in order to attract the tourists right under your opponents' noses.

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Following on the success of No Retreat: The Russian Front, where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, Victory Point Games' dynamic duo of game designer Carl Paradis and his trusty developer Alan Emrich have teamed up again to present the second chapter in this game series, No Retreat: The North African Front. This time they take the gaming action to the African Front, from the start of Operation Compass on 8 December 1940, through 1942 to the eviction of the Axis from Libya.<br/><br/>Building on the notion of a card assisted game and death-or-glory victory conditions, No Retreat: The North African Front offers a narrative game rich in the feel for the ebb-and-flow of the campaign, wrapped around an exciting maneuver and combat system that harkens back to the glory days of classic wargaming, but includes all the modern features and plenty of innovations. Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 &quot;mini-maps&quot; located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating &quot;mini-games&quot; in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.<br/><br/>This Deluxe Edition combines both the original game, featuring Five quick-playing scenarios, a Tournament Game, a Full-Fledged Campaign game, and a Bonus &quot;Invasion of Crete&quot; mini-game, all using deluxe components of &quot;Twillight Struggle Deluxe Edition&quot; quality.<br/><br/>The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.<br/><br/>The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.<br/><br/>The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake. You must endure and prevail under the most surprising and grueling of circumstances, for there is No Retreat!<br/><br/>Bonus Game<br/><br/>No Retreat: The Invasion of Crete<br/>This Bonus mini-game will allow you to refight the first airborne invasion in history, during May 1941. Each player will fight to gain or maintain control of the Island's critical 3 airfields. Time is of the essence here as each contestant has to manage his limited ressources in a life-or-death contest where neither has space to Retreat! This is a very intense knife-fight that can be very well be decided in the few first days, while the German Airborne force is most vulnerable, or could turn into a desperate rear-guard action, as the hard-pressed Allied troops try to escape the island. An innovative pre-game set-up planning procedure, and Airborne Landing rules, will insure that no two games play the same.<br/><br/>Scenario Listing:<br/><br/><br/>     Operation Compass, 1940: The British surprise offensive against the unprepared Italians in Lybia, pushing them back over 300 miles and capturing 115,000 prisoners!  This scenario makes an excellent tutorial due to its low unit density. It is essentially a race game, with the Allies rushing to reach Map 2 and win the game there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operation Sunflower, 1941: Rommel arrives in Africa with the 21st Panzer Division and begins operations to roll back the recent Allied advances, thanks to the withdrawal of their best troops to fight in Greece. Can you capture the important Port/Fortress of Tobruk, or will you to be stopped by the tenacious Australians?<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operation Crusader, 1941: The importance of Tobruk and pressure from Malta on the Axis convoy routes to Africa caused both sides to fully commit to winning the war in the western desert during the British all-out attack to relieve the siege of the embattled Fortress. It's a wild free-for all battle, where speed of manoeuvre is all-important.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operation Venezia, 1942: After capturing Tobruk in this operation and routing the Allied forces in the desert (and the cancellation of the Malta Invasion), the German High Command sends resources to help Rommel&rsquo;s exhausted forces race to Egypt. Can the forces of the Commonwealth hold the line at El-Alamein, or will the Afrika Corps reach Alexandria and the Suez Canal?<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Operation Lightfoot 1942: The last-ditch defence of Egypt and the resulting stalemate at El Alamein was finally turned to victory for the Allies as Monty&rsquo;s overwhelming force pushed back the depleted and badly-supplied Axis Divisions.

This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each region of the board contains five areas, each one of five different types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring will either gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.<br/><br/>Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tunisia II is an Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing covering the campaign in Northwest Africa from November 1942 through May 1943.<br/><br/>This new edition is similar to the original 1995 Tunisia game from The Gamer's, but features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and new maps. The tempo of play is just outstanding, beginning with just a few units in play. Over the next few months both sides rapidly reinforce the theater. The build-up culminates with Rommel&rsquo;s offensive at Kasserine and tension over the variable entry of Montgomery&rsquo;s 8th Army. This climax is followed by the slow destruction of Axis forces in North Africa.<br/><br/>The upgrade of this game involved a handful of important decisions. A straight reprint was out of the question, since the original was designed back when the OCS v2 rulebook was fairly new. In Tunisia II we standardize how the game should be played with the latest series rules, and also have updated it to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; better with newer OCS games. So units and rules have been changed to conform to games also set in 1942-43: DAK II, Case Blue, and Sicily II.

It is available as a physical copy with the Xbox One Collector's Edition of the video game (Northern Realms and Nilfgaardian Empire factions) and in &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;physical expansion for PC/PS4 (Scoia'Tel and Monsters factions).<br/><br/>Gwent has two players simulating a war between two of four factions: Northern Realms, Scoia'Tael, Monsters, or Nilfgaardian Empire. Players take turns adding strength to the battlefield until both players pass. The highest strength on the battlefield wins the round and matches are played best of three, with little to no card drawing in between rounds. Special cards may also be played to reduce the effect of certain unit types. Gwent also features various once-per-game leader abilities and deck building rules.<br/><br/>",

The game goes over five rounds giving a scoring after the 1st, 3rd and 5th round. Victory points are awarded for majorities of allocated buildings (very similar to the original game Alhambra). To get the buildings you roll 8 dice each showing the six building-symbols. Each player has 3 rolls on his turn to get as many similar symbols as possible (up to a max of 8). A player can only note his result for one type of building. The results of the dice rolls from every player is marked on the game board. So everybody can compare his dice rolls with those of the other players. After a round is completed the player with the highest dice-roll can choose between 2 buildings of the respective category or 1 building and a special counter giving a certain bonus. (Bonuses can be: additional 1-3 VPs, extra dice-roll,  exchange one building, determine Starting player, etc.) The second best player in that category will get the other part. Each round has a certain number of turns depending on how many players are playing (3, 4 or 5 turns). So, because a player can only hit one type of building during his turn, he cannot score all 6 types of buildings in a single round. After round #1, #3 and #5 the majority in each building category is awarded the same way like in Alhambra. The player with the most VP's wins the game.<br/><br/>Special: There is a variant in which you can combine the building counters of the Alhambra game which adds some building strategy.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Alhambra<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands.

They must build a dyson sphere.<br/><br/>Solar Sphere is a dice placement/manipulation game with elements of engine building, resource management, and set collection. Set hundreds of years in the future in a time when competition will move mankind forward, but when collaboration is also sometimes necessary. In Solar Sphere, each player commands a mothership. Their primary task is to build a dyson sphere. But, with crew to hire and aliens attacking the sphere, there are many other ways to earn prestige and become the saviour of mankind.<br/><br/>In this dice placement game, players can manipulate their dice using drones. However, players have a limited supply of drones, which are also used to upgrade dice placement spots or to support in fights against aliens. Players can always recycle used drones to get them back into their supply. Or, spend them for instant benefits.<br/><br/>Players simultaneously start the turn by rolling their dice. Dice act as spacecraft and are sent, in payer order, to locations to gather resources, build the dyson sphere, build or recycle drones, upgrade worker spots, hire crew, and fight off aliens.<br/><br/>Crew come with their own unique benefits that will help players in a variety of areas. Chain crew abilities together to build a good engine, and retire them for extra benefits. Making space for new crew members.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, more aliens will arrive to defend a sun that they also need. Fight them off alone, or join forces with other players and share the rewards. However, if no one takes on the rebellious aliens, then you all lose points.<br/><br/>Solar Sphere combines a combination of mechanisms with a powerful theme to bring players an immersive experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Crusoe Crew (a.k.a. Baiam or Kuala), you embody a character in an immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!<br/><br/>What's different with this story compared to other Graphic Novel Adventure books is that The Crusoe Crew is for 1-4 players, and each player has their own book, embodying a particular character with special powers. Work together with others (albeit separately) to progress on islands full of adventures and brain twisters!<br/><br/>",

With a little luck and clever planning, you just might outmaneuver your fellow travelers and be the first to make connections for a complete ten day journey!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Players begin by filling their tile holders, drawing and placing tiles into 10 spaces. Each space is a day of a player's trip. Each tile shows a country, a plane, or a ship. Tiles are drawn and placed one at a time, and cannot be moved once placed. Once all players' holders are full, a face-down draw pile is made of the remaining tiles, as well as three face-up discard piles. On his or her turn, a player either takes a face-down tile from the draw pile, or a face-up tile from the top of a discard pile. He or she then decides whether to exchange the new tile with an old one. The tile not being kept is then discarded.<br/>Players are attempting to have all 10 days of their trip connect, either by foot, by plane, or by ship. To connect by foot, countries must be adjacent or connected. To connect by plane, a plane of a certain color must be placed between two countries of the same color. To connect by ship, the ship must be placed between countries adjacent to that ocean/sea (or one ship can connect to another).

The result is a very addictive game that is easy to learn and will be played over and over again.<br/><br/>Every player starts with a specialist role and an ID (either Government Informant or Rebel Fighter). At night the Informants reveal themselves to one another &mdash; assuming any exist, that is, as at all player counts between zero and three Informants are in play &mdash; then all players complete their specialist action in a clockwise order (removing the need for a rigid script/app and reducing the potential to accidentally reveal your role). Specialist actions include gathering information, switching roles, and helping players in their attempt to identify the Informant(s) before the day is over. If a majority of players identify an Informant, the Rebels wins &mdash; but if the Informant(s) remain hidden, they win!<br/><br/>",

Each player competes to accumulate the most money from land speculation before the &quot;last spike&quot; is laid.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of four track tiles, with each tile showing a particular location on the game board and a cost. The game board depicts nine cities in a diamond shape, with St. Louis at one tip and Sacramento at the other, and locations where track can be built are marked on the game board.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player places one of their track tiles in the appropriate space, paying the cost while doing so. (If a player can't afford to place track, they must sell one or more of their train deeds to raise cash.) If the player is the first to place adjacent to a city, they gain a deed to that city for free. After placing a tile, a player can purchase one deed for a city.<br/><br/>Whenever two cities are connected, all holders of the deeds for those two cities receive funds from the bank based on the number of deeds they hold. A city will pay out 0-4 times depending on where it is and how track is built during the game.<br/><br/>When a player places a tile that creates a contiguous track from St. Louis to Sacramento, this player receives a $20,000 bonus, everyone receives a deed payout for the cities just connected, then the game ends. Whoever has the most cash wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In W&uuml;rfel Bingo, a.k.a. High Score, each player takes a dry erase marker and a glossy game board with a 5x5 matrix. A round consists of 25 die rolls of two standard six-sided dice. After each die roll, each player places the sum rolled into one of the fields on his game board. After 25 rolls, each player tallies his points; each row and column scores 1-12 points depending on whether it's filled with a pair of matching numbers, a triple, a full house, a straight, a five-of-a-kind, and so on, with points scored along the diagonals being doubled. After three rounds, whoever has the highest cumulative score wins!<br/><br/>W&uuml;rfel Bingo, unlike High Score, features a double-sided game board with a 6x6 matrix on the reverse. When playing with this side, the game lasts only two rounds.<br/><br/>Knister (2017) lists player count as 1-12.<br/><br/>",

In Pirates of the Spanish Main, players make fleets of ships to sail to different islands looking for treasure. This booty is obtained in one of two ways: commanding your salty dogs to dig it out of the ground or sending your opponent&rsquo;s ships to Davy Jones&rsquo; locker! Either way, game play is fast and fun, and the built-in damage tracking system makes Pirates of the Spanish Main the game of choice of wannabe-buccaneers everywhere. (From the official press release)<br/><br/>Pirates of the Spanish Main includes numerous different collectible pieces, including ships, crew, treasure, and famous (and infamous!) personalities. It sells in booster packs that include all materials required for play (&quot;A game in every pack&quot;), which typically consists of two ships, an island, crew, treasure, a small six-sided die, and complete rules for play.<br/><br/>WizKids officially renamed the entire product line &quot;Pirates of the Cursed Seas Pocketmodel Game&quot; in 2008.<br/><br/>Topps officially shut down WizKids in November 2008, and put the property up for sale.

You, the leader of your people, have moved quickly to consolidate your local governments in hopes that you are not too late to carve some chance of hope out of what appears to be none. Rushing to develop effective technologies and retrain your military against this new threat proves difficult but is your only chance at salvation. Resources will prove important and become continually scarce as MV1 continues to sweep through your territory. Do you have what it takes to keep your people alive? Or, better yet, can you eliminate the threat of the walking dead from your territory completely? Many technologies lay at your disposal if you test them successfully, but the true strength of these technologies lie in the versatile combinations that you choose to use. Will you rely on military strength, physics and science, or research medicine to find a cure? Perhaps your survival lies in utilizing combinations of these technologies. Either way your fallen countrymen have only one form of diplomacy and that is that they are at peace only when they are feeding. Feeding on you and your people and spreading the deadly MV1 viral infection. Welcome to The Zombie State: Diplomacy of the Dead.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>You are the world leader of a group of nations.  Each turn zombies feed and randomly spread throughout your territory, quickly reducing your population and increasing the number of zombies. At the beginning of the game you have no technologies or military that are effective against the viral threat on a worldwide scale.  Each turn you must maximize the use of resources to draft and use military, test technologies, and then strategically use these successfully tested technologies.  As the game progresses, outbreaks and the spread of zombies makes the game more difficult through a loss of population, resources, and freedom to act.  However, if you have been an effective leader you will have developed effective technologies that you may use to try and eliminate the threat from your territory completely. Otherwise leaders will find the game ends with the total conversion of their population into the walking dead.<br/><br/>",

The map board's Solar System Display keeps track of the 4 inner planets (Mercury through Mars) and the 9 larger asteroids along their orbits. The rest of the board is taken up by the various territorial displays; the larger planets are subdivided, plus there is Deimos around Mars, the Moon, L-4 and L-5 around Earth and Mercury's two artificial satellites --for a total of 42 territories.<br/><br/>Leader Characters each have special powers. Troopers represent the grunts --infantry workhorses and cannon fodder. &quot;Gennies&quot; are Genetically Engineered fighters; they are stronger than Troopers but cannot leave the planet for which they were designed. Transport ships carry troops and factories between planets. War ships come as Fighters and Battlers (i.e., Bombers). Killer Satellites play the role of air defense. Factories make all these pieces - although you do have a Black Market option.<br/><br/>As the planets move through their orbits you must plan your own moves well in advance to exploit planetary conjunctions. The movement rules consider not only the ship movements in the planet's orbits, but also the respective revolutions of the planets around the sun, and allow players to plan some nice surprises when two planets are near one another, which usually happens only once or twice in the game.<br/><br/>Upgraded by:<br/><br/>    Buck Rogers 2.0<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "League of Dungeoneers (LoD) is a detailed Dungeon Crawl and party management game. The game is designed to be a solo/coop game but could be played with a game master as well. The main task of the game is to develop your characters both by gaining experience but also by finding gold, equipment, magic and legendary items that can help you in your quest. The game is set in its own fantasy universe, containing many of the races and monsters that you would expect from a classical fantasy setting. You could either run the campaign supplied with the game or run any of the 22 single quests.<br/><br/>All dungeons are procedurally generated, and all monsters and treasures are randomized making the quests different every time you play them. There is however a theme for each quest you embark upon so don&rsquo;t expect to find a goblin among the undead in a crypt. There are more than 50 different room and corridor tiles, each with details about furniture and 5 different large seized objective rooms. All rooms have different furniture and a chest is likely to contain gold or magic items, where for instance a bookshelf is more likely to contain magical scrolls.<br/><br/>Party morale and sanity are two important factors to monitor in the game. Meeting fearsome monsters and springing deadly traps will take its toll on the mental state of your heroes and too much strain will give your heroes unwanted disorders such as claustrophobia, arachnophobia or stress syndromes. This will make them less effective and maybe even a liability for the rest of the party. To remedy this, you will need to rest in between quests. If you can&rsquo;t afford to rest due to lack of funds, maybe that stressed out Dwarf will have to stay behind during the next quest, forcing you to solve the task with a skeleton crew.<br/><br/>Characters are designed around several stats such as strength and dexterity but also around skills such as Pick lock or Heal. Depending on their profession the heroes will excel in some of these, while being quite useless in other. Through levelling, you will also unlock talents which will boost certain areas of your character and perks which are powerful boosts that can be used a limited number of times. There are more than 100 talents and perks in the game. As your heroes levels up, the monsters they meet will be tougher as well.<br/><br/>Combat is an essential part of the game and is designed to promote movement and prevent those bogged down battles of attrition. With several types of attacks available, both for monsters and heroes, combat becomes more flexible and less of a chore. Add to this the decision if you should evoke that special perk that could change the outcome of the battle or save it to the next.<br/><br/>Finally, each dungeon has a threat level. This will increase as the Dungeoneers make their way through he dungeon. Making noises such as bashing down a door, or maybe screaming because of your stress syndrome, is a bad idea. This will increase the threat level, which in turn increases the chances of something bad happening. Maybe you will trigger a wandering group of monsters or set of a trap? It can also give the monsters unexpected boosts during combat.<br/><br/>I've have received some question and I thought I would make some clarifications:<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium+ I would say. There is quite a lot of information defining each character which of course makes things more complex. However, the actual gameplay is pretty straight forward once you get the hang of it. A gaming session can easily be paused by just taking a picture of the setup.<br/><br/>What miniatures can I use?: You can use tokens, standees or any other miniatures you have. The tiles are supplied with miniatures about 28mm with a 25mm base in mind but can of course be scaled to any scale you want to.<br/><br/>How many different kinds of monsters are there?: A little more than 80. Some of these are variants, such as Orc, Orc brute and Orc berserker for instance. There are also several special characters that you will face during the quests not included in this list.<br/><br/>Can I use other tiles or a 3D-printed dungeon with this game?: Yes! This is a simple matter of making your own rooms and corridors table. There is even a template for this in the files section.<br/><br/>This game does not focus on stream lining, but rather on creating a detailed dungeon crawler experience. It will require more on the behalf of the player than some of the more modern designs, but for me it's the perfect level of detail.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is 1700, and a youthful Karl XII has recently come to power as King of Sweden. Rivals around the Baltic Sea seize the opportunity to get their hands on Swedish territory. An alliance is struck between Denmark, Saxony-Poland, and Russia, the last under the vibrant leadership of Tsar Pyotr. This coalition mobilizes to take advantage of the untried King, and break Swedish dominance in the Baltics forever... Thus opened the Great Northern War, ravaging Northern and Eastern Europe for over two decades at the beginning of the eighteenth century. By the end of the war, one nation would lose its status as a Great Power, while another would rise to dominate the region for centuries onward.<br/><br/>PAX BALTICA is a two-player wargame covering the entire Great Northern War (1700-1721). Published first as a limited &ldquo;guerilla&rdquo; edition in 2009 by Three Crowns Game Productions of Sweden, this new enhanced edition has been revised and upgraded by GMT Games in conjunction with the original designers.<br/><br/>Over twenty years of fighting span the map from Norway to Turkey, Saxony to Finland. Units are represented by labeled wooden blocks, which are stood upright to conceal their identity and strength from the enemy, allowing players to dupe and outfox each other on campaign. Action points are spent to maneuver on the map, but also for reconnaissance, replacements, or a roll on the treacherous but lucrative National Politics Table. Straightforward rules account for lines of communication and forage, as well as time-consuming sieges, adding to the period flavor. The fast-paced and exciting combat system captures the aggressive &quot;charge with cold steel&quot; tactics that Sweden used to defeat her enemies in succession at the start of the war.<br/><br/>Players are subject to a host of influences and distractions that will hinder their plans at every turn. An elaborate plan will be at the mercy of a poor action roll or sudden plague, while other events shape strategy with historical motivations and deterrents. Players must prepare for the worst, but be open to fleeting opportunities.<br/><br/>Special rules capture simply the unique events and circumstances of the Great Northern War, including:<br/>&bull; Russian army reforms<br/>&bull; Ukrainian Cossack uprisings<br/>&bull; Intervention by the Ottoman Empire<br/>&bull; Polish royal politics<br/>&bull; Attrition of Swedish manpower<br/>&bull; Founding of Sankt-Peterburg<br/><br/>Four scenarios are included with the game: a short tournament scenario covering the Swedish invasion of Russia that led to the Battle of Polt&aacute;va; two scenarios that simulate the first and last half of the war; and a &ldquo;grand campaign&rdquo; scenario that refights the entirety of the Great Northern War, a first in wargame publishing. Turns typically take no more than a couple of minutes, ensuring a fast pace of play. Swings of fortune ensure that no two games will turn out the same.<br/><br/>Can you save Sweden&rsquo;s empire? Or ensure Russia&rsquo;s rise to prominence? You make the choices that will determine who reigns over the PAX BALTICA.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&bull; 1 Map (22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;)<br/>&bull; 1 Rulebook (16 pages)<br/>&bull; 1 Playbook (32 pages)<br/>&bull; 65 wooden blocks (units) in five colors<br/>&bull; 1 sticker sheet for mounting on blocks<br/>&bull; 51 wooden cubes (control markers, etc.) in six colors<br/>&bull; 8 dice, 4 blue and 4 green<br/><br/>Game Design: Stefan Ekstr&ouml;m and G&ouml;ran Bj&ouml;rkman<br/>Development for GMT: Scott Muldoon<br/>Complexity: 4<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 3<br/>Scale: Strategic. 1 turn = one season; units are armies, regiments, and fleets; 1 strength step = approx. 1500 troops or 6-8 fighting ships<br/>Players: 2<br/>Time to Play: 1-2 hours for the shortest scenario, 7-14 hours for the grand campaign<br/><br/><br/>Original Three Crowns edition:<br/><br/>Great Northern war, a 21-year long war lasted from 1700 to 1721 and ended Sweden&rsquo;s period as a major power in northern Europe and started Russia&rsquo;s domination of Eastern Europe. An intriguing conflict that is often considered a side-show of the War of Spanish succession. Nevertheless the former had probably greater impact of the developments in Europe during the 100 years to come than the latter. The effects of the war are in fact still seen today.<br/><br/>Pax Baltica. Probably the first board game ever covering the entire Great Northern War.  The game includes five different scenarios with a varying playtime between two hours and a day. The units in the game are blocks which give a great flexibility in taking steps and differentiate the quality and strength of the troops. The high quality map is divided into provinces which you have to conquer in order to take control over a country. This dynamic conflict covers large parts of northern and eastern Europe. From Bremen in the West to Smolensk in the East. From Trondheim in the North to Bender in the South.<br/>Playable nations are Sweden, Russia, Turkey, Denmark and Saxony. Other countries represented as minors are: Great Britain, Poland, Ukraine, Prussia and Hanover. The game, packed in a book case, includes a A2 full color map, 60 high quality wooden blocks, 4 dice, various markers and rules including 5 scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Like the original, Cosmic Run: Regeneration is a quick, push-your-luck, space race for 1-4 players. On a turn, a player rolls dice and must commit at least 1 of them to one of the various exploration tracks or to an alien card. Some of the tracks require multiple identical dice, with the most valuable tracks costing many identical dice. However, once a player commits a die, it cannot be moved. So players have to decide between a conservative approach (making sure and steady progress along less valuable tracks) or an aggressive approach (pushing one's luck to try to move up the highly valued tracks).<br/><br/>Players may opt to use their dice to befriend aliens, rather than explore, because the aliens provide special powers that can eventually help them move along their exploration tracks even faster.  The game may be played competitively or cooperatively.<br/><br/>Cosmic Run: Regeneration is different from the original Cosmic Run in many ways. Regarding the rules, these are the main changes:<br/>- A 6th planet track with its own rules for placement<br/>- A 6th type of alien card<br/>- The mechanism for the alien race landing on planets (which used to be meteors hitting planets) is now card-based, rather than dice<br/>- Alien cards must be turned in during the game to score points<br/>- Alien cards are one use and easier to acquire<br/><br/>The game's components are also different, insofar as this game has a full board and some updated graphic design.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space Marine is a miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. This game in both its editions was the flagship of Games Workshop Ltd.'s Epic scale (6 mm) miniatures games until they were replaced by Warhammer Epic 40,000 which worked at the same scales but had all new mechanics. Both first and second editions were sold as box sets which contained rules, scenery and enough miniatures for two armies.<br/>  <br/>First edition subtitled Epic Battles in the Age of Heresy was set in a much earlier time period than Warhammer 40,000. It featured Space Marines versus Space Marines in a civil war. The game could be combined with the previous published Adeptus Titanicus which featured Titans, giant robots, in the same 6 mm scale. Ork and Eldar models were also released, with rules for them in the Codex Titanicus expansion.<br/><br/>Second edition was subtitled Epic Conflict in the War Torn Universe of the 41st Millenium and brought the setting into the standard era of Warhammer 40,000. It was radically revised but still fundamentally the same system, unlike the latter version of the Epic range. The new edition included Orks, Eldar and Titans in the base rules. These and other new races were greatly expanded in latter supplements.<br/><br/>First Edition expansions and compatible games:<br/><br/>    Adeptus Titanicus (1988) - also a stand alone game.<br/>    Codex Titanicus<br/><br/><br/>Second Edition expansions and compatible games:<br/><br/>    Armies of the Imperium: Space Marines and Imperial Guard (1991)<br/>    Renegades: Eldar and Chaos Armies for Space Marine (1992)<br/>    Ork and Squat Warlords (1992)<br/>    Space Marine Battles (1993)<br/>    Titan Legions (1994) - also a stand alone game.<br/>    Hive War:Tyranids (1995)<br/><br/><br/>Later Editions of the Epic system:<br/><br/>    Warhammer Epic 40,000 - 3rd Edition  (1998)<br/>    Epic Armageddon - 4th Edition (2004)<br/>    NetEpic - unofficial continuation of 2nd Edition (1997)<br/>    Heresy - unofficial rules in same scale and setting, designed to be a grittier wargame.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Western Town, each player is a Marshal of an expanding town in the Old West of the U.S. in the early 1860s. Each Marshal wants to develop the most prosperous town, one that President Lincoln himself would be proud to visit.<br/><br/>The three principal criteria that allow you to win the game are population growth, charm/attractiveness, and wealth, as measured by gold. Turns are regulated by the visits of Lincoln, who determines, bit-by-bit, the value of the towns relative to those three criteria. These criteria can and do change every round, and you will need to adapt to these changing criteria to win this game!<br/><br/>Each player has his own board on which he will be building his town. Every building gives him different, and increasing, rights and abilities, and therefore power. The bigger your town gets, the better &ndash; but managing too much growth is challenging, so you'll need to make difficult choices at the beginning of each round as to which buildings you'll bring into play.<br/><br/>This &quot;building-adding&quot; mechanism helps players stay in the game and not get lost in the overwhelming number of choices available. Of 22 different buildings, six of them are identified every round as &quot;bonus&quot; buildings, and players are forced to adapt varying strategies and test new combinations of these buildings for their town as the game progresses.<br/><br/>In addition to logic and strategy, Marshals will need to bluff and occasionally resort to questionably bending the law a bit, to succeed in building their Western Town. And as if that weren't enough, there are even occasional Indian attacks to deal with as well!<br/><br/>",

As in the show, pro-bending matches are a game of push and pull, with an objective toward being the team that has either advanced the farthest forward, or completely knocked their competitors out of the ring.<br/><br/>The game play of The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena is closely modeled after the popular Pro-bending sport featured in the first season of Avatar: The Legend of Korra. As such, the game is designed for 2 players, each controlling a team of 3 benders: earth, fire, and water.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is simple: be on the other team's side of the arena when the game ends and you will be victorious, or dominate the competition, pushing all their benders off the back of the arena to end the game immediately and claim the championship as yours!<br/><br/>",

The fighting had all but ceased. There was a hissing from the trees as they recoiled from the broiling mists, their branches curling up and twisting into ash, then blowing away on the breeze. As the stars faded in the sky the terrible silence was deafening.<br/><br/>The gathered legions weren&rsquo;t trying to attack the walls of the city - they were trying to escape. The templars of the Rose had known all along: it was His coming. The Overlord had sent forth his minions within the gloom to prepare the way. And now the masses of black figures swarming outside the gates of the Sprawl turned as one to face what was coming.<br/><br/>Far through the darkness, beyond the ruined plains, upon the horizon, a halo of red light coalesced. The circular light brightened and stretched, growing impossibly in size.<br/><br/>The silence was shattered as a booming, thunder rumbled beneath the earth and the ground began to shake. From both sides of the walls screaming, shrieking and wailing filled the air as thousands of souls cried out to the heavens in despair. Figures fell from, or threw themselves off, the highest walls and towers.<br/><br/>A single, terrible, discordant musical note pierced the cacophony, a blaring, otherworldly hornpipe, loud and clear throughout the land. Clutching their ears and falling to their knees as utter hopelessness crushed them, the people collapsed in great throngs. The klaxon sound deepened and fell quickly through the octaves until it violently seizured the bodies of the now writhing shapes scattered in and around the city.<br/><br/>Then came the Rending.<br/><br/>As the circular red light continued to grow, and the thrashing, shuddering tone amplified, the earth shook and suddenly snapped hurling upwards huge, city-sized chunks of rock and debris. A depthless chasm ripped the ground asunder as though giant hands had torn the earth apart. Buildings and entire streets buckled and fell into the abyss along with screaming hordes of bodies. The plates of the earth shrieked and shifted, and as the giant mountains of land that had been thrown into the sky descended a fathomless ash cloud filled the air.<br/><br/>And so the world ended.<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Ribbons of silver light weave their way through the Veil. Fleeting souls soaring through the ethereal fabric of what has been left behind. Fewer in number with each passing moment.<br/><br/>A colourless, shadowy realm engulfs the senses. As the silver ribbons fade into the impossible distance, terrible loneliness pervades in this twilight of emptiness.<br/><br/>Then, from nowhere, a voice. Indivisible from reality: melodic, languid, and utterly compelling: &ldquo;He has gone too far,&rdquo; The Lady whispers.<br/><br/>After what seems like aeons, the realisation dawns. She is talking to you...<br/><br/>Veilwraith is a fantasy card game with deck building elements for 1 player which is set after the end of the world.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1936 Guerra Civil (1936 civil war) is a card game in which each player plays one of the sides in the conflict, either the Republic or the Nationalists. A player must design his deck from the cards available for his side (a pool of over one hundred), with a minimum selection of 36 of them. Besides the cards belonging to one of the two sides, there are cards representing political and military objectives, for which the sides fight. Each objective gives victory points to the player who wins them. Victory can be achieved by military victory points, by political victory points, by a combination of the two of them or by the demoralization of the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is for two players, although some possible variants for four players are also provided.<br/><br/>There are different types of cards: objectives (political or military), characters, military units and management cards. Each side is made up of factions (ten factions for the Republic and eight factions for the Nationalists). A side may also benefit from having appointed a leader if certain conditions are met.<br/><br/>All cards have images from public Spanish archives and contain detailed historical information.<br/><br/>(A note on the language barrier: it's not as big as it seems. If your first language is French, Italian or Portuguese most game terms will be either the same or very similar. Even with English there are many easily understandable text parts. Additionally, all game text and rules are available to download in French and English from the game's website).<br/><br/>Game components:<br/><br/>     252 unique cards<br/>     4 game boards (one for each side, one for managing military objectives and one for managing political objectives)<br/>     24 small markers to be used on the boards<br/>     1 rulebook 36 pages long, plus two additional double-side reference sheets<br/><br/><br/>The game was slowly developed between 2000 and 2006 and it was finally self-published by the author himself through Ediciones Rotura as a limited and numbered edition of 1936 copies, being released in Madrid on December 29, 2006.<br/><br/>The game entered the BGG ranking on July 18th 2007 (anniversary of the outbreak of the war).<br/><br/>A small expansion ('Guernica') was released in September 2009 through Spanish magazine ALEA (#33). Several Print&amp;Play expansions have been released since October 2009 linked to the game reaching certain milestones: number of fans in Facebook, number of distributed games, presence during gaming events.<br/><br/>",

Using tiles with all four colors on them, the players place them onto the board in fixed locations.  In doing so, they try to surround victory point markers and capture them.  Of course, since each tile has all of the player's colors represented, every tile placement must be carefully thought-out so that you maximize your points while minimizing them for your opponents.  Ties disqualify players - and so the next highest color total will earn the points.  The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the beginning of the 16th century, the city of Rouen is the main French port. The city's wealth depends on fishing and the trading of salted fish. Salt produced in the mines has to be loaded onto ships and used to preserve herring and cod fished in the Atlantic Ocean. Every week ships full of salt barrels leave Rouen for the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean, and once back, the goods are sold in the city markets. The players represent city merchants, and they invest in ships and city buildings to try to get rich. Who will be the richest merchant of Rouen, when Francis I, King of France, comes to visit the City?<br/><br/>In Upon a Salty Ocean, players start the game with one caravel loaded with three salt barrels, a salt mine and 10-16 money. From this, they must build a shipping empire! The game lasts five turns, with each turn being divided into three phases.<br/><br/>In the event phase, players adjust prices on the market based on the current event tile, take into the account the weather and environmental conditions that will affect them the remainder of the round, and reveal the event tile for the subsequent round.<br/><br/>The action phase lasts a variable number of rounds depending on how many actions players want to take and can afford. Eight actions are available and they're divided into four types:<br/><br/><br/>    City: (1) buy a saline and (2) buy a building<br/>    Navigation: (1) travel to the ocean and fish and (2) travel to Rouen<br/>    Harbor: (1) build a ship and (2) move goods<br/>    Market: (1) sell to the market and (2) buy from the market<br/><br/><br/>On a player's turn, he can take any one of the either actions or pass; the cost of an action is the number of times this type of action has been performed previously during this round. For example, the first use of a City action costs 0, while the next use (whether to buy a saline or a building) costs 1. A player who passes can take an action later in the same phase. The action phase ends once all players pass. A player can go into debt during a turn, paying one coin in interest when doing so; as long as the player is in the black once the action round ends (by selling to the market), no further payment is due.<br/><br/>In the turn end phase, players produce salt, may use special buildings, pay interest (if needed), reset the cost of the actions to zero, and so on. A player can have no more than 40 coins at the end of a turn unless he owns a banque, and the limit is 80 coins without owning Salle des Coffres. This limit is important as the player with the most coins after five rounds wins. Some buildings provide endgame bonuses to which the coin limit doesn't apply.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It isn't easy being a zoo animal. The enclosures are far too small for your needs, the daily routine is boring, and the visitors to the zoo are too obnoxious. You have decided: You need to break out of the zoo, ideally within the next seven days.<br/><br/>There are multiple ways to escape in KuZOOkA, but you need to work together with the other animals &mdash; in secret &mdash; to pool the trash left behind by zoo visitors and develop an escape plan that makes use of these items. Each player has one of the ten animal cards with a unique power, and you play on a game board that features a path comprised of spaces in six colors, with each space having a number in it.<br/><br/>In each round, a number of item cards is dealt out to players, with 20-22 cards being dealt in the first round. Cards show a colored item, e.g., a red ice cream spoon or a purple scarf. On a turn, you place one of your animal tokens on the path farther than any other animal token, say, in the 1 red space or the 2 purple space, to give some indication of what you have in hand. (The first player is limited to one of the first five spaces.) The next player places one of their tokens farther down the path, and so on, with each placement giving players a chance to suggest what cards they hold in hand. A player can use their animal power once during a round.<br/><br/>At some point a player will decide that instead of placing an animal token, it's time to attempt an escape. At that point, all players reveal all cards of the color matching the location of the animal token furthest down the path. If you have more cards, you gain experience stars equal to the number depicted on that space &mdash; and with experience stars, you can purchase a higher starting experience level, which means you'll have more cards in play, including face-up cards visible to all. If you have exactly as many cards as the number depicted, you gain experience stars as well as a universal tool card that counts as a joker. If you have fewer cards, you fail.<br/><br/>Shuffle all cards, then deal out the current number of cards and start a new round. If during a round you manage to reach one of the six final spaces on the track and you have at least that many cards of the designated color, you escape and win the game. If you fail to do this by the end of the seventh round, you lose.<br/><br/>You can increase the difficulty of KuZOOkA by requiring more stars to advance in experience level or by playing on the opposite side of the game board, which requires you to win universal tools in order to succeed in the final six spaces.<br/><br/>",
