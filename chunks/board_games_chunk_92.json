The successful British defense of the mission station of Rorke's Drift, began when a large contingent of Zulu warriors broke off from their main force at the day-long Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879, diverting 6 miles (9.7 km) to attack the British, under the command of Lieutenants John Chard of the Royal Engineers and Gonville Bromhead, 24th Regiment of Foot at Rorke's Drift later that day and continuing into the following day. The massive but piecemeal attacks by the Zulu on Rorke's Drift came very close to defeating the much smaller garrison, but were consistently repelled. Just over 150 British and colonial troops defended the station against attacks by 3,000 to 4,000 Zulu warriors. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded among the defenders, along with a number of other decorations and honors.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The prime minister is decided by a bid at the beginning of the game, where players go around in circle, saying how much money of the national budget they think they can win. The highest bidder becomes the prime minister and decides what roles to give to each player.<br/><br/>The deck is composed of 3 suits of cards and suit-less money cards. It is a pseudo-may-follow trick taker, as while you must-follow the lead suit if you want to play a suited card, you can instead play a money card (regardless of if you can follow or not) which will go to the winner of the trick. These money cards also act as a lifeline, because if you ever cannot follow and are out of money cards, you are immediately exiled from the game (though you give your earned money to another player).<br/><br/>The 3 and 6 in each suit are also special cards, 3's causing the lowest played card to be the winner, and 6's cause the payout from the round to be doubled. When all the cards have been played, roles are revealed, money counted, and winner decided based on if the bid was met.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

This game has a surrender and temporary cooperation mechanism. When a player does not have any believer card in his turn, he will find another player to surrender and swear allegiance (Of course not true allegiance), become a Follower in a sect, and cooperate against another player. However, the Follower players can still secretly recruit their forces in order to seek a comeback.<br/><br/>According to the surrendering mechanism above, it also has a betrayal mechanism. After becoming a Follower, players can use specific skills or action cards to betray and take away the believer cards of their Leader. In addition, of course, there are also special cards, that allow players to prevent betrayal.<br/><br/>In the game, players will experience what it feels like a sect Leader. You have to consider how to use the cards and the strategy to get the most benefit. You also may become another's Follower and conspiracy to betray. No matter what you do, you have to find a way to become the most powerful sect Leader to win the game.<br/><br/>&quot;&mdash;description from the designer&quot;<br/><br/>",

Combine your forces with the other Heroes in order to destroy the undead pirates and take back control from the Flying Dutchman!<br/> Your mission is to destroy the Black Fortress in each active Realm but first you must take control over the Galleon by destroying the Ghost Galleon's pirates. If the Invasion marker reaches number 20 in an active Realm, then all players lose the game.<br/><br/>To take control over the Galleon you must first destroy the 4 pirates. Each one has a question mark (?). Roll the Talent Die to determine the Talent needed to destroy each one. There are town cards and Bonus town cards that allow you to kill all the Invaders in a Realm. The pirates are not affected by ANY Town card except Musket and Pistol! The other way to destroy the Pirates is to move your Hero to the Area where the Galleon has stopped and exploit 1 Swiftness Talent in order to get on board and start the attack. Yes, this Area is Cursed, but if you state that you want to get on board and offer an extra Swiftness as a tribute, then you can enter the ship.<br/> When you take control over the Galleon, move your Hero onto it. Now you are Cursed too, and you can never leave the Galleon and as an extension you cannot buy any town cards. In each round, you can move the Galleon 1 Area forward or backward by spending 1 Swiftness Talent. If you have more Swiftness Talents, then you can exploit them to move the Galleon more than once. To destroy a Black Fortress you must exploit 2 random Talents by rolling the Talent die. First, you must move your Galleon to the Area where the Fortress is placed, and then you can attack it.<br/><br/>",

The purpose of the game is to collect the most Triangle Cards which they carry variable effects and help you during the game. To win a card you must place the most dice on the board at the end of every Triangulation.<br/><br/>The game board is separated into a number of shapes. The large kit shapes in Red and Blue are called Tribases. Each of you, can place max 1 die on a Tribase. The Red bases are strategically important as they help to spread your dice on the rest dark bases. The small red triangles, at the base of each Tribase is an Exit Point. There are 4 in total and through these, your dice can enter and move on the board.<br/><br/>Strike Dice is a clever, short in time  and easy to learn game carrying a new innovative way to use Pyramid Dice. We call them Pawndice because they have 2 roles in the game. You can use them as Pawns and as Dice too!<br/><br/>",

Although the &quot;bad&quot; cards will lose you some sheep, the special abilities of these cards might grant you some unexpected benefits in the later turns of the game.

All others play the agents who try to find out what that secret wish is. If the agents are ready, the wishing machine spits out four wishing cards and states whether or not they show the preferred item. Another set of four wishing cards and another statement follows. Who will be the first agent to guess the secret wish of the machine?<br/><br/>With each row of cards and statements made in Wunschmaschine, you gain new information about the secret wish of the machine. Sooner or later it will become clear what the wishing machine really wants. Depending on the distribution of the cards, you can solve the problem after just a few rows, or it may take you longer. Haste and pressure from your opponents ensure that mistakes will happen along the way &ndash; much to the other players' delight as they profit from your mishaps. To increase the level of difficulty, look for the experienced gamers variant enclosed at the end of the basic rules.<br/><br/>",

Not only do they have to deliver goods, supplies and military loads during difficult time, but they have to adjust to a dwindling rail network.&quot;  This is a great pick-up and deliver game, the 24 railroads are assigned during the game to the players and many Contracts (load from/to) have to be selected and satisfied. Event cards (passive and active), particular flexible Contracts add interest to the system<br/>to limit its repetitive attitude.<br/><br/>Trains have fixed movement allowance to be spent over a network of friendly and expansive rivals' tracks, congestion and rail conditions affect the movement. The key point of the game is the Union force invasion, they are simulated by weighted tables and dice roll to gradually shrink the network from north to south. After the Union victory the player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Most games in the series have players commanding anywhere from a division to a corps worth of forces, and employment of combined arms tactics becomes critical. The system shows the evolution of tactical doctrine in both the Japanese and Allied armies with Banzai charges, superior U.S. fire coordination, naval bombardment, airpower, amphibious landings, and engineer operations. Games in this volume include:<br/><br/>The Fall of Singapore is a simulation of one of the worst military defeats in British history. From December of 1941 to February of 1942, the campaign is a case study of a smaller but better-lead force of Japanese outmaneuvering a much larger but poorly trained and ill-led British.<br/><br/>Struggle on Bataan recreates the desperate U.S. and Filipino defense of the Bataan Peninsula between 9 January and 9 April 1942.  The defense of Bataan, though ultimately doomed, constituted the only serious disruption to the string of Japanese victories during the first six months of the war.<br/><br/>Turning Point: Guadalcanal is the struggle between the United States and Japan for possession of the island of Guadalcanal in the southern Solomons chain. The battle lasted from August 1942 until early February 1943.  The opponents on Guadalcanal were approximately of equal strength and with control of the seas around the island still to be decided, Guadalcanal was the last time in the war when an American amphibious operation faced the prospect of total defeat.<br/><br/>",

The two games are entirely different.<br/><br/>The Skip-Bo Dice Game takes all of the fun and planning of the Skip-Bo card game and turns it into a roll &amp; write dice game. In this game players race to collect the most stars by filling in their build piles using the numbers rolled on the dice. The game comes with four dry-erase markers, four player boards, and six dice.<br/><br/>On your turn, roll all six dice. Call out the number shown on the bonus die (the green 10-sided die) - everyone can use this die each time it is rolled. Then, use the dice as best you can to fill in your build piles. Build piles must be filled in in numerical order (starting with 1, then 2, 3, 4, etc.). Each time you fill in a circle underneath a star, you collect the star. Skip-Bo symbols are wild and can be used as any number, but you never collect stars when using a Skip-Bo to fill in a circle.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, all players select one of the numbers showing on the unused dice and write it in in one of their discard piles. You can use numbers from your discard piles on future turns to help you complete your build piles.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has completed three of their four build piles, then each remaining player gets one final turn and the game ends. The player with the most stars wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Selection #5 of The Games Collection by Pin International.<br/><br/>Zaroc is a 3-dimensional game for 2 players. The object is to descend from the heights in the back, down to the lowest pegs, and then jump off at an opportune moment, to ultimately control three of the winning spots.<br/><br/>The game starts with pieces arranged in alternation on the tallest pegs. A piece can move forward following pointers on the board, but only from the tops of the pegs. From a stack which does not fill a peg, a piece can only move sideways.<br/><br/>The catch is that one turn incorporates two moves, and you have the possibility of repositioning your opponents pieces as well as your own.<br/><br/>",

In addition to different cake types, the cards also display between 1-3 cakes/card. It is therefore better to place 1-cake cards on other players' piles/slots and the 3-cake cards on your own piles.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player to finish his/her deck shouts &quot;I'm full!&quot;. That player gets an additional 3 bonus VPs. Each player then counts the number of cakes, getting 1VP/cake and adding them with any bonus VPs. The winner is the one who gains the most VPs (i.e. the one who has eaten the most cakes in the shortest time).<br/><br/><br/>The new version of My Cake! has been released in September 2011. In this second version there are 108 cards and the brand new artwork makes these cakes even more delicious! The addition of two new rules of play offers more variety in your gaming experience.",

        "description": "Return to the 18th century when Łazienki Kr&oacute;lewskie (Royal Baths Park) was the summer residence of King Stanisław August Poniatowski. Deliver to the king the most gorgeous artwork and win the game!<br/><br/>Łazienki Kr&oacute;lewskie, which literally means &quot;Royal Baths&quot;, is the largest park in Warsaw, Poland. The park-and-palace complex lies on the &quot;Royal Route&quot; linking the Royal Castle with Wilan&oacute;w palace to the south.<br/><br/>In the game Łazienki Kr&oacute;lewskie, players use movement cards to try to meet the king walking around the park. When a meeting occurs, the artist delivers artwork and the player receives victory points. Each turn, the player can move up to three different artists and perform the corresponding actions or draw cards. The player who ends up with the biggest artwork collection &mdash; and thus the most victory points &mdash; wins.<br/><br/>The game has an educational value in that the artwork collected by players is real and can be seen in Łazienki Kr&oacute;lewskie. Three real historical artists &mdash; Marcello Bacciarelli, Andr&eacute; Le Brun and Jean Martin &mdash; are included in the game.<br/><br/>",

Player ONE begins play by turning over top card of each stack, and from the 8 face up cards makes ONE word of 2-or-more letters and places it in his play area. Words are played fanned together like a Rummy hand to save space.<br/><br/>Player TWO (and every player thereafter) flips over any face down card atop stacks the prior player used to make their word, thereby replenishing the formation to 8 face up cards. Player TWO likewise makes ONE 2-or-more letter word and places in in his play area. However, in addition, he may steal words from other players' areas by adding one or more of the remaining letters in formation to those words (inserting at any point of word or optionally rearranging the letters in those words). Multiple play-ons are allowed each turn, and players can &quot;play on&quot; their own words also. Play continues with the next player. When any stack is depleted of cards, face up cards from other stacks with multiple cards are slid over to occupy open position and underneath card is flipped over to be face up.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most letters in his play area when all cards in the 8 stack formation are depleted.<br/><br/>80 cards total in deck. Deck is re-shuffled before each game for a fresh set of 40 cards in the formation for each round.<br/><br/>Play best 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5 rounds (as decided by players beforehand) to determine winner of match.

Immediately he photographed everything that he loves to make disappear when he is haunting&thinsp; &ndash; including himself, of course. Unfortunately, the enchanted camera takes many photos in the wrong colors. Sometimes the green bottle is white, at other times it's blue. Looking at the photos, Balduin doesn't really remember any more what he wanted to make disappear next. Can you help him with his haunting and quickly name the right item, or even make it disappear by yourself? If you grab the right items quickly, you have a good chance of winning...<br/><br/>The lightning fast shape and color recognition game that is sure to test the reflexes of kids, families and gamers alike. In Vlotte Geesten, five wooden items sit on the table waiting to be caught: a white ghost, a green bottle, a cute grey mouse, a blue book, and a comfortable red chair. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way. With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?<br/><br/><br/>     If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.<br/>     If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected. Once the card deck runs out, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins!<br/><br/>",

Whenever a player lands on Car, Engine, Engineer or Driver squares, they can purchase these various elements to form a racing team.<br/><br/>Once a team has been formed, players then complete one lap of The Jigsaw Board. The Jigsaw board consists of six double-sided track sections, which can be combined in various ways to create all sixteen circuits around which the players will race. Clever.<br/><br/>Players move their cars around each circuit in procession. No dice rolls. The mechanics of racing come from overtaking lanes, which are positioned at critical points around the track. To overtake and improve your race position, you move your car into an overtaking lane and draw an overtaking card for either a straight and a corner. These cards list different elements that must be compared to the car you are overtaking.<br/><br/>For example, You succeed if CAR + ENGINE + ENGINEER ratings are higher.<br/><br/>This is the crux of the game. If you have assembled a team with high ratings then overtaking will succeed and therefore your team will succeed.<br/>Whoever has the highest points after 16 races wins the championship.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;That night, the earth shook. The ruins of an unknown civilization appeared but the earth's crust continued to tear apart, causing natural disasters all over the planet. Strange seismic impulses seemed to come from a temple within these unexplored ruins.&quot;<br/><br/>Equipment<br/>Maztec comes with 28 &quot;game turn&quot; pieces, 38 &ldquo;gem&rdquo; pieces and 4 &quot;temple&quot; pieces: <br/>The four &quot;temple&rdquo; pieces represent 4 parts of the entrance to the temple. <br/>The &quot;gem&quot; pieces are of two different colors. The front shows a red or green gem with 3 or 4 symbols. The back shows a gray gem and two continuous pattern lines.  <br/>Each &quot;game turn&quot; piece is numbered from 1 to 28 on the back. The front reveals 1 symbol on the decor background of the temple.<br/><br/>Overview and purpose of the game<br/>Welcome Adventurers! As an expert archaeologist of ancient civilizations, you have been commissioned by governments around the world to solve the temple enigma of this strange civilization.  <br/>After a trying journey, you approach these ruins. A camp has been set up. A strange temple with an entrance marked by two red crystals invites you to enter. Carefully, you enter this temple and feel terrible tremors around you. But you're brave and courageous, and you decide to continue as planned. <br/>As you explore the place, you discover new symbols. You also gather strange green and red gems surrounded by these symbols. These symbols appear to be clues that allow these stones to be placed in the right locations within this temple, by uniting them. After placing back a crystal, the tremors seem to be less important.  <br/>But the earth is shaking again. That&rsquo;s right. These crystals must be placed back as quickly as possible within the temple in order to permanently stop the seismic waves coming from this temple!<br/>You'll investigate why this is all happening once the challenge is faced, the problem solved.<br/>Only the  sharpest minds can solve the enigma behind these stones. It is now your turn... But time is running out... And if you can solve the enigma of thsi temple, you can finally declaim: MAZTEC!<br/><br/>Elements of the game<br/>&ldquo;Game turn&rdquo; pieces: On the back, the number of the turn of play, and on the front, an element of the temple with a mysterious symbol. <br/>Temple:  the starting point for exploration. This temple is to be assembled at the beginning of the game, already shows you 2 symbols. It is made of 4 pieces.<br/>&ldquo;Gem&rdquo; pieces: On the back is a gray gem. Beneath this gem are drawn 2 lines of patterns. On the front is a red or green gem framed by 3 or 4 symbols on the front. These symbols allow you to form combinations by juxtaposing them. But the combination is only successful if confirmed by the perfect combination of patterns on the back of these pieces. The &quot;gem&quot; pieces also have a small &quot;spiral&quot; symbol (a sort of deception maker) located at the top left of each piece allowing you to always put them in the right way.<br/><br/>Setting up<br/>It is necessary to assemble the entrance to the 4-room temple in the first place. You then have to form 3 stacks of parts: A stack of &quot;game turn&quot; parts, sorted from 1 to 28. Number 1 is visible at the top of the stack. And 2 stacks of &quot;gem&quot; pieces must be formed: a stack per gem color, gray gem on a visible blue background. At the beginning of the game, you have to reveal 2 gems below each &quot;gem&quot; stack.<br/><br/>Each player also picks 2 &quot;gem&quot; pieces in the stacks: 1 red gem and 1 green gem per player that he places with the front visible before him. <br/>Solo mode: The one player 2 red gems and 2 green gems that he places in front of him.<br/><br/>Course of the game<br/>The last player player to feel an earthquake begins.<br/>Game turn: <br/>The first player will pick a &quot;game turn&quot; piece and add it to the temple. It bears the number &quot;1&quot; on it. This begins the exploration and reveals a new symbol. At the beginning of each round, each player will pick a &quot;game turn&quot; piece. <br/>Possible moves during a player's turn:  <br/>- select 1 gem piece from the 4 visible ones and draw one of the same color to replace it. If there are no more gems to draw, replenish the pickaxes with discarded gems if there are any. <br/>- discard the 2 pieces of the pile of green or red gems and replace them with 2 others, then select 1 of the 2. <br/>    With the selected gem, you can:  <br/>    - place it on the temple by combining it, <br/>- add it to a gem or to a combination of gems from an opponent (except in a solo   game)<br/>    - add it to one of its gems to create a combination. <br/>If no placement is possible, the player places the piece in front of him. <br/>If a placement is successful, the player may try again to place or combine the pieces in his possession as long as his placement attempts succeed, at an opponent&rsquo;s (except in a solo game) or on his/her pieces. <br/>Last possible move: the player can try to place a combination of his/her gems on the temple. It is then the next player&rsquo;s turn (or the next turn in a solo game).<br/><br/>Bonus move:<br/>At any time, the player can secretly (without revealing it to other players) return his/her gems to observe lines that can help him assemble the pieces.<br/><br/>End of the game and goal<br/><br/>&rdquo;If not all of the gems are placed in the temple before 28 turns... The end is near.&rdquo;<br/>Competitive mode: If all the gems have been placed, it is the first player who no longer has any gem to place who wins the game. <br/>Collaborative mode: If all the gems have been placed, your team wins the game.<br/>Solo mode: If all the gems have been placed before 28 turns, you win the game.<br/><br/>If all the gems have not been placed, after 28 turns, the first player who no longer has any gems, or any more combination of gems in front of him, or who has the least, wins the game. <br/>Must-know: a combination of gem not assembled in the temple counts as a single gem. <br/>However, humanity will only be saved if all gems are correctly placed before the 28 turns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fill the Barn is a card game in which players earn money by planting and harvesting crops to the barn. The game board is a barn with only enough room for three harvests each of six different crop types. Each harvest of a same crop pays a lower price than the previous harvest of that same crop. Once all three harvests of a crop have been filled, players may not harvest any more of that crop type.<br/><br/>In addition to planting and harvesting, players may fertilize a crop to increase its value, or irrigate to protect against drought. Drought or Bugs cards may be played to wreck your opponents' crops while they are still waiting to be harvested. Mice, Junk, and Clean-up cards add a further wrinkle by allowing players to change the availability of crop spaces within the barn.<br/><br/>As the barn fills up, the competition increases to outmaneuver opponents to fill the last remaining crop spaces, with an extra bonus paid to the player who &quot;fills the barn&quot; by harvesting the last crop to fit in the barn. The game ends when either the barn is filled, or when the 115-card deck has been exhausted, whichever comes first.<br/><br/>",

Laying a numbered card on the Street starts a building, which extends down a column in numerical sequence and is completed as a ruin or house or tower. Laying an intersection starts a rainbow, which is filled in colour sequence. When structures are completed, they are removed to be scored, and the space in the Street is filled with a new construction.

Four empires -- Antares, Crate Armada, Chroma Raphael, and Star Concord -- engage in a major interstellar war. Game rules cover space and ground combat, exploration of new systems, economic development, ship and planetary-shield construction, troop recruiting, the whole nine yards. Four different winning conditions are suggested: (1) the last surviving player; (2) the first player to control more than 50% of the star systems on the map; (3) the strongest player after a set number of turns; or (4) the strongest player after a set time limit (they recommend five hours).<br/><br/>The rulebook states that the game was &quot;formally&quot; (believed to be a typo for formerly) &quot;referred to as The Fourth Galactic War.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Magic and Uno had a baby.<br/><br/>In Boss Fight, players take on the role of bosses in a fantasy RPG dungeon competing to land the killing blow on an adventuring Hero.  Doing the most damage has no bearing on the victor -- whoever ends the Hero's life wins.  It will require careful use of devious Traps, disruptive Spells, and convenient Loot drops to ensure you will become the Final Boss!<br/><br/>Boss Fight is NOT a collectible card game.  Every pack contains the same cards in the same quantities.  No need to break the bank hoping to find the one card that will make your game &quot;work.&quot;<br/><br/>The game is designed for two to five players.  Most games take 10 to 20 minutes to complete, making it the perfect game for those looking for a quick game that doesn't sacrifice strategic challenge.<br/><br/>Accessible and friendly play are central concepts of Boss Fight's design.  Simple core rules combine with descriptive cards to create a smooth and short learning experience, while careful design limits the tense, confrontational feeling that can emerge in many strategic card games.<br/><br/>In short, it's fun, fast!<br/><br/>",

Players compete against each other by increasing their snail population. You need to place your snail cards and flower cards wisely to claim the delicious flowers (for the snails, of course), and maintain your snail population to score the most points!<br/><br/>The game is played in two phases: Multiplication and Die Out phases. In the Multiplication phase, players alternates to place their Snail cards (with values 1 to 3) onto the game board adjacent to other snails already there. As an additional action, they may also place one Flower card onto the game board. After all Snail and Flower cards are placed, players check who controls each Flower cards by adding the values on their Snail cards. The higher sum may take the adjacent Flower card as scores.<br/><br/>In Die Out phase, players alternate to remove Snails cards from the game board if the chosen Snail card has a lower value than all the other adjacent Snail cards, until no more Snail cards can be removed. Each remaining Snail card scores the printed value for its owner, and each Flower cards worths 2 VP. The player with higher VP wins the games.<br/><br/>",

He realizes that he will not be around much longer, and is in a hurry to choose his successor. You are one of the most prepared candidates to be the next master, but this task will not be easy because there can only be one master. There will be several duels ahead ...<br/><br/>In Duelo: Kung Fu, players are masters of various martial arts styles invited to the big tournament that will determine who will be the new Master of Kung-Fu. To win the tournament, you should eliminate your opponents by knockout competition or winning more duels than them when the time is up.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can choose to fight with one of your opponents or reflect to better prepare for a future duel.<br/>If you opt for reflection, play the card face up and use the first effect. If you choose the combat, play a card face down and choose an opponent. That player must place a card from his hand face down and then both are revealed. Activate the second effect of the card. Who ever has the greater focus(the number on top left) wins the duel. The winner draws a card as a prize and puts the defeated card in his victory pile.<br/><br/>Each style has its strengths and weaknesses. Explore them to be the winner!<br/><br/>",

The cards start shuffled and face-down.<br/><br/>Game 1: Small and Big Animals<br/><br/>Each player in turn flips a card.  If you notice a complete animal on your turn then you collect all of the cards that make up the animal. If someone doesn't notice an animal then you can pick it up on your turn in addition to flipping a card and possibly picking up another animal. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Game 2: Quick Zookeepers<br/><br/>Same as above but the animal goes to the first player to touch a zoo keeper card with the same background colour.<br/><br/>Game 3: Chaos in the Zoo<br/><br/>This is played like the card game Memory. Flip cards until you get a complete animal or mismatched parts. Take complete animals and turn mismatched ones face down for the next player.<br/><br/>",

Problem is, the stadium that holds the race has incredibly strong winds that can blow skinny people like you in directions you don't want to go. Can you win this race against the competitors and the devil winds?<br/><br/>In Wind Runner, players have a runner and a hand of seven action cards. Each turn in a round, the first player rolls the wind direction and speed dice to determine whether the wind is blowing north or south and how quickly. Players then each secretly choose an action card in hand, then reveal them and resolve them, starting with the player farthest down the track. The cards let players move forward, move sideways, swap places with another runner, reverse the wind (!), ignore the wind, or move a barricade. Afterwards, players then move forward or backward according to the wind &ndash; but if a player or a barricade blocks the wind, then you receive no benefit (or penalty) from it.<br/><br/>After six turns, players pick up all their cards and start a new round. The game ends after 3-5 rounds (depending on the number of players) or as soon as a runner reaches the finish line.<br/><br/>",

They are further divided into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and difficult.<br/><br/>Avista Pro is really just the 2nd edition of Avista, rather than a self-standing game; the rules are exactly the same, the number of cards is exactly the same, and the first edition already had three difficulty levels; whether the subject matters are more difficult or not is arguable.<br/><br/>",

Each sea has four islands guarded by monsters. Three treasures are placed on each island.<br/><br/>Players use a spinner to move around the four islands.

Other spots move the player back a space.<br/><br/>When one player completes his journey, the round ends and whoever has the most treasure wins. Players then change voyages and continue until each player has made all four voyages. The player with the highest treasure score after all four voyages wins the game.<br/><br/>",

No chips to lose. No boards to keep track of. You don't even need to keep the box. The category cards fit nicely into a compartment on the back of the game. And everything else is integrated into the device.<br/><br/>It is a more compelling version, but expect to spend some time figuring out the buttons and lights.<br/><br/>But A to Z, in any form, is a wonderfully adaptable and fun game. Because there are so few components (the device and the cards) and so many lights, the electronic version most definitely adds to the attractiveness and the sheer delight of it all.<br/><br/>",

You will also need the provided set of 12 tokens (or coins if the officers are elsewhere).<br/><br/>Play:<br/>At the start of a game the following number of tokens are placed in the center of the playing area, depending on the number of players taking part:<br/><br/>4 players: 3 Emperor tokens, 6 Compass tokens, and 3 Lady tokens<br/>3 players: 2 Emperor tokens, 4 Compass tokens, and 2 Lady tokens<br/>2 players: 1 Emperor tokens, 2 Compass tokens, and 1 Lady token<br/><br/>Choose who goes first.<br/><br/>Players, clockwise in turn, roll the dice once and try to get five-of-a-kind. Players may keep as many of the previous player's dice and roll the remaining ones in their turn.<br/><br/>A player who rolls 5 Compass tokens (regardless if it is the Compass or the Marked Compass) claims one Compass token from the center. A player who rolls 5 Emperor tokens claims one Emperor token from the center. A player who rolls 5 Lady tokens claims one Lady token from the center.<br/><br/>Once a player has made five-of-a-kind and claimed their reward, the next player rolls all the dice to start the next round. If a player is unable to claim their reward from the center because there are none left, they may take one from another player.<br/><br/>If 3 Marked Compass die faces are rolled that player may take the &lsquo;roundabout&rsquo; die to use during future turns; rolling it once when taking it to determine its use during the time the player has control of it. The player can only lose that die if another player rolls 3 Marked Compasses and takes it from them.<br/><br/>This die gives the player the following bonuses:<br/><br/>The Engineer - the player is allowed to take a token on a 4 of a kind<br/>(a crafty engineer always makes the best of a situation)<br/><br/>The Mistress - the player allowed to take a 2nd roll of any dice they choose<br/>(one girl here and one girl there)<br/><br/>The Cutpurse - the player can choose one die which will be locked and<br/>cannot be re-rolled by an adjacent player to their left or right as indicated by the die<br/>(the left hand never knows what the right is doing)<br/><br/>The Alchemist - the player may choose any token in center not yet taken<br/>i.e. acts as a 5 wild<br/>(lead turns to gold)<br/><br/>The Spy - The Roundabout die is lost by that player and placed back in the center<br/>(your secrets will gain you nothing)<br/><br/>The first player to hold a Emperor, Lady and two Compass tokens wins the game.<br/><br/>this game is based on the ancient roman game Jactus<br/><br/>",

Players move the ball in turns and aim to place it in the opponents goal.<br/><br/>In one turn, the ball may be moved into one of the eight paper line crossings around it (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and a segment from the original position to the new one is drawn to mark the move. The ball may move neither on the game field border nor on the segments marking the past moves but it bounces from them, i.e. a player who moves the ball into a position where there is already an end of a segment or a game field border gets another turn.<br/><br/>The first player to place the ball in the opponents goal wins the game. The game may also end when a player does not have a valid move (he or she loses automatically).<br/><br/>",

One player represents the Bogeyman, a superhuman maniacal mass murderer, and the other takes the part of the collection of victims he intends to murder. Movement of the 14 characters including a Bus Driver, Whiz Kid, Football Player, Surfer, BMOC, Biker, ROTC, Psych Major, Cheerleader, Jockette, Preppie, Valley Girl, Ingenue takes place on the map. The victims try to stay alive as long as possible. Each character has a unique set of attributes for movement, special abilities, disadvantages and damage.<br/><br/>Can be played as a board role-playing game (and thus expanded past just two players). One player takes the role of the Bogeyman; other players take the roles of only a few of the victims. This can lead to some animated conversation between the Victim players, sounding suspiciously like the real thing.<br/><br/>Developed by Aaron Allston. Art by Paul McCall. Map art by J.

Each turn you roll three dice and may use them to dribble, pass, or run. Generally you may only use one die per soccer player and move in one direction as is the case in dribbling. If you are running a player without the ball, or if you are passing or shooting, you may use the pips on another die to change directions ( curve )  and move in that new direction. Movement points are flexible, in that you do not have to use the maximum amount shown on the die if you don't want to, but direction of travel is usually linear unless you use the second die as mentioned above. The components ( especially the field which you have to print twice ) are beautiful.<br/><br/>",

For each piece (animal or human) there are 9 cards with values 1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5.

        "description": "The Glass Bead Game was created by the Dutch game inventor Christian Freeling in the late 1970s. It was named after the final novel of the German writer Hermann Hesse which was published in 1943 (&quot;Das Glasperlenspiel&quot;). Hesse was put on the Black List of the Nazis while living as a refugee in Switzerland. After continental Europe was liberated, Hesse was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946. Freeling's game is one of many conceptualizations that were inspired by Hesse's novel.<br/><br/>The game differs from most traditional Mancala games in having counters with different values. Another unusual concept of the game is that there are two types of capturing (direct and indirect). The game can be played online at Freeling's homepage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A children's game about counting and additions.<br/><br/>Basic idea: The hamsters are on a frantic shopping spree - they'll buy whatever they find. The only thing that counts is that they can collect as many nuts as possible because they get a certain number of nuts per purchase. This isn't as easy as it sounds, though, as they have to calculate the exact total for their purchase, and if they make a mistake, another hamster will be happy.<br/><br/>Aim of the game and how it is played: The aim of the game is to collect item cards with as many nuts printed on them as possible. Each item card also has a price printed on it. There is always one item card fewer at the center of the table than there are players. The players have to use some of their bank notes to exactly reach the price of one of the items in the middle of the table (e.g. if there is an item that costs 837 and another that costs 1200, they can choose the 800 and the 37 banknote, or the 800 and 400). Some items are worth more nuts than others. All players do the calculating simultaneously. If a player thinks they have put together a correct set of banknotes, they put the banknotes face down in front of him/herself and puts his/her hamster on the item card to reserve it. Once all the items have been reserved, the hamsters proceed to the checkout: all players check if the cards are correct (i.e. make up the exact price of the item). If they are, the player earns that item. If they aren't, this hamster doesn't get any card this round. The player who hasn't managed to reserve an item (there is always one item fewer than there are players) gets lucky if another player has miscalculated: he/she gets the item that player has reserved.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no item cards left. The player with the most nuts wins the game.<br/><br/>There is also an &quot;expert&quot; variant of the game, which includes a memory element.<br/><br/>",

From the world famous opera to clubs, from shopping to recreational areas - all are easily reached by public transport. There are many charming caf&eacute;s which serve cake specialities or the viennese favourite, the &quot;Melange&quot; to strengthen tourists on their way. Vienna has something to offer any taste - day or night!&quot;<br/><br/>This simple game is played on a city map of Vienna. The map features stations of public transport facilites: underground, bus and tramway. At the beginning of the game, a player's pawn is put on a random station. He then draws a number of destination cards showing the stations he must visit in order to win the game.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player rolls five special dice, showing the symbols &quot;underground&quot;, &quot;bus&quot; and &quot;tramway&quot;. He then moves his pawn from station to station, using only the transport facilities his dice offers him. If he reaches a station which corresponds with one of his destination cards, he may discard that destination card.<br/> You win the game if you have visited all destinations on all your destination cards.<br/><br/>",

The counters are placed on the hexagonal board with fields in different colours. Different colours mean different &quot;strength&quot; for the checkers - the aim is to eliminate all opponents checkers from the board.<br/><br/>The game was invented by the famous Belgian mathematician Maurice Kraitchik who described it for the first time in his book La Math&eacute;matique des Jeux (Brussels 1930) on page VII-VIII (introduction) and 470-475 (rules, example games). It is one of the oldest stacking games (older are just Tower of Hanoi, Lasca and Bashni).<br/><br/>",

This game requires speed, a sharp eye, creativity and memory. Is so appropriate to train memory, attention and creativity capacities and also communication and social skills needed in any social context.<br/><br/>1. Deal all the cards among the players more or less evenly. It doesn't matter if a given player receives an extra card.<br/><br/>2. Each player will form a stack of cards in front of him/her. Cards must be placed face down so that no one can see them.<br/><br/>3. The player with the strangest face begins, by taking a card and placing it face up in the middle of the table, within reach of all the players. Clockwise, each player will take a card and place it in the central stack. The moment two cards showing the same alien or the same letter coincide, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and the fastest in doing so must shout out a word beginning with the letter on the covered card.<br/><br/>Then, he/she must take all the cards from the central stack and, mockingly, distribute them how he/she chooses among the remaining players. This player will place a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The cards that players receive are incorporated to their stack of cards at the bottom.<br/><br/>4. The game continues in the same way: the moment two aliens or letters coincide again, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and, at that moment, he/she must shout out the preceding word and add a new one beginning with the letter on the card that he/she has just been covered.<br/><br/>Progressively, a word sequence will be formed that must be memorized. If a mistake is made while shouting out the word sequence or if a word is invalid because of a spelling mistake or if he/she has covered the central deck when two cards do not match, the player receives the central stack of cards and places a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The existing word sequence is eliminated and begins to reform.<br/><br/>5. The first player to get rid of all of his/her cards wins the game.    <br/>Variations of the game: play using not just real words but also words in other languages, invented words or sounds.<br/><br/>",

Each team takes turns using three pennies to work their way across the board to score in the opponents goal. The goal is created by the defending team placing two fingers (both index/ index pinky) against the side of the table creating a goal for the offense to score in. The offense moves across the table by setting the coins in a tight triangle position and flicks the rear most coin through the other two coins. The flicked coin must pass through the other two and play continues by flicking a coin in play between the other two continually without disturbing either one until a goal is scored (by getting a penny in the goal), a coin goes off the table, the coin fails to make it through the other two, or the coin contacts one of the other two. At this point roles are reversed. Play continues to a predetermined score (suggest 5 or 10).<br/><br/>",

Players place tiles to build paths, and move their pieces along paths, sometimes jumping onto another path. The object of the game is to score the most points by completing paths containing your piece.<br/><br/>Contents<br/>4 Player pieces<br/>A set of 35 Playing tiles<br/><br/>Wend tiles are square in shape, and have 2 path entry/exit points on each edge. They each have four path sections which go from one path entry/exit point to another. When placed side by side, the path sections from one tile join up with those on the adjacent tile, to create meandering paths. There are 35 Wend tiles in a set, which includes one copy of all possible different combinations of 4 path sections on a tile.<br/><br/>A single set of 35 Wend tiles is enough for a good game with 2-4 players. You can use extra sets of Wend tiles to accommodate more players or for a longer and more challenging game with a small number of players.<br/><br/>",

The lowest caste of all underdogs sits in the Shinjuku honky-tonk as they do every night after work, digesting their lost time. Delirious thoughts waft through cesspools, spilling into an endless nirvana of drunken stupor and hubris. The only fixed point of their blank stares is the smudged cup with the stomach ulcering mixed drinks of Don&rsquo;t Ask and Definitely Don&rsquo;t Ask. A hot, stuffy, yet wild vibe drools through the humid air. It drools saliva that the divers inhale and excrete again as armpit sweat.<br/><br/>The divers brag about their precious finds from Tokyo's sewers. In drunkenness, yellow slime hardens into gold ingots and rat poison mutates into cocaine. Or was there really a giant diamond that a courier frantically shat out shortly before the raid? What is the truth about the silver coins that Akito once claimed to have found? And did he really exist, that mummified politician Tanaka slurs about every night?<br/><br/>Two to four players get up close and personal with the secret society of Poo Divers. Take part in their stuffy discoveries and, like them, rejoice in every bit of dirt. In this world, all finds have equal value. But take the advice of a wise Poo Diver and keep your glued eyes open, lest some greedy asshole snatch the loot from under your nose.<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns drawing a card from the deck:<br/><br/><br/>    If you draw a character card, place it in front of you.<br/>    If you draw a pass card, pass one character card that doesn't have a figure on it to the player on your left.<br/>    If you draw a dance card, press the button on the dance floor and watch the figures waltz around. When the dancing stops, you claim any figures in your sector of the dance floor if you have a character card matching those figures.<br/><br/><br/>When all the figures have been claimed or the deck runs out, the game ends. Players score the points listed on the character cards they hold &ndash; but only if they hold this figure! The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Until sea-faring invaders lay siege to Kochi, a capital port for Tosa, and threatens this lasting peace.

In each round, one player is the explainer, while the other players try to guess the concept. The explainer receives a set of 24 blocks (consisting of 11 brown blocks and 13 blocks of other colours). He is also given a card which tells him the concept that he has to explain using the blocks. He may not talk or make sounds, though he may move the blocks. He can also give a hint by placing one of his non-brown blocks in one of the circles on the board that show different categories.<br/><br/>If one of the other players successfully guesses the concept, he gets the card and the block used to give a hint (if any). Then, all non-brown blocks are placed aside, and the explainer receives a new card, and continues to explain the new concept with the remaining blocks. This continues until the time runs out, after which the results are scored. The explainer receives points for each concept he has explained, and each other player receives points for each concept he has guessed. Each concept is worth 1 to 4 points, depending on the amount of non-brown blocks that have been set aside. The more blocks that have been used during the round, the higher the value of the concepts.<br/><br/>Now, a new round begins, and the next player becomes the explainer. The game ends after each player has been the explainer thrice; the player who has gathered the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

This was one of the longest and most intense battles of the 1968 Tet Offensive. Hue has two scenarios. The Standard scenario covers the first stage of the battle. The Extended scenario follows the fighting all the way through to the final Allied victory. Both scenarios are set up in the same way.<br/><br/>Operation Pegasus simulates the operations surrounding the U.S. Marine Corps firebase at Khe Sanh. The game has two scenarios. The Lang Vei scenario starts with the Communist assault which overran the Lang Vei Special Forces camp and includes the possibility of a fullscale Communist assault on Khe Sanh itself. The Relief scenario covers the airmobile attackby the U.S. First Cavalry Division (Airmobile) which relieved Khe Sanh.

Each player has scraped up just enough cash to purchase themselves a brand spankin&rsquo; new used shrimpin&rsquo; boat. Unfortunately, not much money is left, and if a profit is not turned quickly, then the whole shrimpin&amp;#039; idea might fold on itself.<br/><br/>As luck would have it, all players have congregated in the same small stretch of Louisiana coastline. Competition will be fierce and ruthless because there just aren&rsquo;t enough shrimp to go around. The player who shrimps the most in this crucial first week in business will earn enough money to stay around. The rest have to pack up and return to their day jobs shrimpless and hopeless.<br/><br/>To Shrimp, players move their boat to choice shrimpin&amp;#039; holes to shrimp while also playing cards to augment their catching ability, such as improved nets or Shrimp Findin&amp;#039; Com-Pewters.  In addition, players may use cards to foil their opponents&amp;#039; plans, such as capsizing waves or mechanical failures.  The object of the game is to catch the most shrimp over a 3, 5, or 7 day period (choose game length).<br/><br/>",

This episode:<br/><br/>Konan Castle was owned for centuries by the McDonald clan.  When the McDonalds killed two Campbells, a feud ensued and eventually the Campbells took the castle in the late 19th century.  The remaining McDonalds fled to the US and the castle went into disrepair.  For two generations (the year is 1955), the McDonalds waited to return to retreive their treasure (hidden within the castle).  So, a party of eight went to Scotland to search.

Even if you have never played a strategy game before, you will discover that the system is easy to learn and fun to play. For indoor and outdoor use. So get a couple of friends together, grab your favorite toys, and let the battle begin!<br/><br/>NOTE: Toying With Destruction shares some thematic similarities with the earlier game Toy Wars, but it was developed independently and is a different game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A two player abstract strategy game played on a board which is developed by the players over the course of the game.<br/><br/>Each player starts with ten pawns on a six by six chequered board. Each turn consists of moving one of your pawns and placing a card. To begin with, pawns can only move one square forwards or backwards and cannot capture your opponent's pawns. However, once a pawn is moved, a movement card is placed onto the square it vacates. Movement cards have arrows showing possible moves - directions and lengths. The more possible directions (eight being the maximum) the card shows, the shorter the maximum move. Pawns which begin their move on one of these cards follow one of the arrows and are allowed to capture enemy pawns. When a pawn moves off a movement card, the next movement card may be placed in any vacant space on the board, in any orientation. Thus there is scope for clever placement to limit what your opponent can do. Gradually the board fills up with movement cards which show the possible moves from each square. Moves are essentially chess-like, but some are more limited, for example some movement cards allow movement in a straight line in only three directions, or diagonally in only two.<br/><br/>The game ends either when one player has captured all their opponent's pawns; when one player loses due to having no legal move; or when all 36 movement cards are placed, in which case the winner is the one with the most remaining cones.<br/><br/>",

Goren, the world&rsquo;s leading expert and authority on Bridge, whose aim was to make Bridge EASY and FUN for everyone. This is the way Beginners Bridge works: The book contains step by step directions on playing Bridge. After each step, you will be directed to the Bridge Tutor for some examples to illustrate how the information you have just learned is used. The Bridge Tutor is a device that eliminates the other three players needed to play Bridge! Thus, you can practice by yourself and yet actually simulate a four handed game. You progress, at your own pace, by simply following the easy directions in the book and playing the different hands in the Tutor.<br/><br/>",

Each team has three kinds of players that cover different roles in a match. The movement of counters on the game field is performed by pushing them with the finger. They try to hit and push the Dodecaedron towards an opponent's goal and stop it in the goal area. The first to score 12 points is the winner.<br/><br/>The game since 2011 comes with athlete counters mounted on coloured wooden discs. Six complete teams are included in the game.<br/><br/>",

Instead of the standard suits and numbers in a 52-card deck, Belisha's cards can be grouped into numbers, colors, and types of traffic signs.<br/><br/>Per Rummy, the players are dealt a hand of cards and at the beginning of their turn, draw a card from the deck or the first card of the discard pile.  Their aim is to get rid of the cards from their hand by playing them in sets or straight sequences.  They can play their cards to extend sets or sequences laid out by their opponents.  They must also discard one card in their turn.  The current round stops when a player has played or discarded his last card.  Players sum up the values of the remaining cards in their hands as their score for the round and begin the next by reshuffling the deck and dealing new hands.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has accumulated a certain score (usually 250) or more.  At that point, the player with the lowest accumulated score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

And they did a great job with it.<br/><br/>The game comes with flat cardboard triangles for the footballs. What is cool is that each one has the name and logo of an actual NFL team. And yes, they made expansion packs so you could &quot;collect them all&quot;. It also comes with a very cool item, a field goal that you put together and stand up for when you attempt an extra point.<br/><br/>The game is played by two opponents stationed at opposite ends of a tabletop surface. The person who goes first flicks or slides the football toward the other end of the table. If it is touched by the opponent a field goal attempt is allowed for the &quot;flicker&quot;. Otherwise, a touchdown is made when part of the football rests over the edge of the table but doesn't fall off. Then an extra point can be attempted if a score is made. If a score is not made, the other person attempts to score, and so on until a winner is declared.<br/><br/>The game was first introduced in 1994.  The inaugural events which introduced the game were sponsored jointly by the NFL and Ocean Spray.<br/><br/>Tournaments were established around the country at thousands of Universities, with a grand prize package at stake for a team of four to attend the Superbowl with all expenses paid.<br/><br/>",

With no inspiration and a lackluster body of work, your newfound ambition is to die penniless and insane.  You believe that this will make your work more valuable, which only proves you're already insane.<br/><br/>You spend your last few dollars buying art from students, apprentices, friends, and even total strangers.  This is the artwork you hope to pass off as your own after your looming death.  However, since all the talented artists are still young and idealistic, they care little for your so-called &quot;money&quot;.  In fact, the less money you offer them, the better art you will get!<br/><br/>The game is scored over multiple rounds.  Each round consists of 3 tricks.  Every player starts each round with exactly $20 in chips.  To start the round, deal 3 cards to each player... and start buying (cheap) art!  There are &quot;Penniless Bonuses&quot; and &quot;Insane Bonuses&quot; awarded after each round.  First to 300 points wins.<br/><br/>This first appeared in Game Trade Magazine #17, July 2001, Page 47.<br/><br/>",

Each player begins the game with a hand of 6-7 cards depending on the number of players, and one card is laid face up on the table as a starting card.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player lays one card from hand onto the end of a card on the table, covering one or two sections of that card with one or two matching sections on the played card. If the player covers one section, they draw one card, then end their turn; if they cover two sections, they can play again immediately, still drawing one card and ending their turn whenever they play something that covers only one section or can't find another play. (A player can optionally choose to draw cards at the start of their turn.) If a player can't make a legal play, they must draw cards from the deck until they can make a play.<br/><br/>The first player to play all their cards wins the hand. If no further plays are possible, the player with the lowest pip count wins the hand. In either case, the winner scores the pip count of cards in hand from the pip count of each opponent, then scores the sum of these values. To determine the overall winner, you can play to a particular point total or play a certain number of rounds.<br/><br/>",

This is important because each of the six tomes is best against a specific demon lord, middling against most of the others, and worthless against another specific one.  Players are different teams of adventurers in the 1920s, finding tomes like the Necronomicon, fighting monsters like the Mi-Go, and solving world-spanning Events, mysteries of Lovecraftian weirdness.  Events give victory points to whoever finally solves them, but the great demon will arise if there are 100 points worth of these Events in the unsolved stack--if he arises, there is the endgame of final apocalyptic battle. So players are constantly balancing co-operation with competition--under certain circumstances, a player can discover the great demon ahead of the endgame, and even decide to join the demon!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In September 1816, San Mart&iacute;n relocated his Army of the Andes to Plumerillo, in the northern part of Mendoza Province, where he finished the details to start his crossing of the Andes. The army was divided in two main columns and four minor ones, keeping the decided paths in secret.<br/><br/>On January 18, 1817, a main column parted with the artillery to Chile through Uspallata, under command of General Las Heras, reaching Las Cuevas on February 1, 1817. The second main column led by San Mart&iacute;n, left on January 19 through Los Patos pass, and reached San Andr&eacute;s de T&aacute;rtaro on February 8, where he was later joined by Las Heras, concluding the first part of the crossing.<br/><br/>The crossing of the Andes took twenty-one days. It was an extremely difficult enterprise, with temperatures ranging from 30&deg; Celsius during the day to -10&deg; Celsius at night, altitudes averaging 3000 meters above sea level, and paths that were far from being roads appropriate for an army: they consisted of a 50 cm wide paths mainly used by locals for traveling on mules, with several passages which had to be crossed literally in single file. Besides all those hardships, San Mart&iacute;n was far from healthy and was carried on a stretcher during most of the trip. By the end of crossing, around 300 men &mdash; 5.5% of the total at the beginning &mdash; had lost their lives, mostly due to the harsh conditions of the trip.<br/><br/>In 1817, he crossed the Andes from Mendoza to Chile, and prevailed over the Spanish forces after the Battle of Chacabuco and Battle of Maip&uacute; (1818), liberating Chile together with Chilean Bernardo O'Higgins.<br/><br/>The game recreat the cross of the Andes by San Martin&acute;s army. In this game the patriot player wins by controlling chile&acute;s cities in less than 20 turns, and the royalist player wins preventing the patriot&acute;s objetive. There are special rules about movement in high altitude and patriot&acute;s surprise factor.<br/><br/>",

The rules had been lost for over ten centuries, but now have been restored by a combination of game theory and historical extrapolation.<br/>The game itself is a fast, enjoyable tactical challenge that leaves you wanting to play again and again. Simple rules but engagingly complex play for all skill levels.&quot;<br/><br/>Addendum: Brandub is one of the oldest known 2-player games that falls into the genre of &quot;unequal forces&quot; games.  While 1 player is given 8 pieces (called &quot;Barons&quot;), the other player is given 5 pieces (4 &quot;princes&quot; and 1 &quot;king&quot;).  The different pieces have different abilities, perhaps the most notable being the fact that the king cannot be removed from play by any means.  For fuller rules, see the &quot;files&quot; section.<br/><br/>",

Most creatures are from the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who, with a few Jon Pertwee characters making an appearance. Such as an Exxilon &amp; Aggedor.<br/><br/>These cards were placed in the 'Action Zones' and may help or hinder the players.<br/><br/>Forgetting the simple roll &amp; move nature of the game, the art work by Gordon Archer was excellent. The game also had a number of monsters/characters that will not be found in the other Doctor Who games which normally come with the regular Daleks &amp; Cybermen.<br/><br/>At least one of the game boards (Escape from the Underworld)was released as a seperate game by the BBC and could be found in Doctor Who Easter Show bags in Australia around 1978.<br/><br/>",

The players circle a flock of sheep with their herding dogs. All players throw their dice simultaneously and have to perform an action as fast as possible depending on the dice throw, e.g. saying &quot;Woof!&quot; or running around the table. <br/>Also, the movement of the dog depends on the dice throw.<br/><br/>As soon as the action is performed, the dice throwing continues. When one dog reaches or overtakes another, the round ends and the faster dog gets a sheep from the flock as a reward.<br/><br/>The game is on the recommendation list of the SdJ-jury 2009.<br/><br/>",

Scoring is done 1 for 1, this means one red dot lined up with 2 red dots scores 3 points for the player who layed the piece. There is a twist however; you must subtract the total # of mismatched dots from your score. The more colors you can line up, the more points you earn and the less points you subtract. Its a battle of scoring more positive points than negative points while competing against an opponent who's being extra careful not to set you up for any high scoring opportunities.<br/><br/>",

But in addition to that challenge, players need to guess various qualities about the animal in question: What does it eat? Is it faster or slower than a human? How many legs does it have? It is a mammal or reptile? Each animal card has two sets of questions relating to it, and players in the know will score additional points. The first player to circle the score track wins the game.<br/><br/>Re-implements Klappe auf!<br/><br/>",

Patterns show two, three or four peg positions with complex patterns worth more points than simple ones. See how good your pattern recognition is.<br/><br/>The cards each show a pattern of 2, 3, or 4 colored dots, and are divided into a 2-dot deck, a 3-dot deck, and a 4-dot deck.<br/>Players start with 3 cards (one from each deck), a set of double-sided Pegs (Red/Silver Pegs, Silver/Black Pegs, and Black/Red Pegs), and Green &quot;Hue Turn&quot; Pegs.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player may either place one of their Pegs onto the board (with either color facing up), or discard a Green &quot;Hue Turn&quot; Peg to flip an existing Two-Colored Peg on the board.  The current player then reveals any Pattern Cards that were created by the action they took this turn, keeping them in front of them for scoring at the end of the game.  Then they refill their hand from any of the draw piles.<br/><br/>The game ends after any two decks are exhausted and all remaining players take one more turn.  Score one point for each colored dot on the cards you collected, plus 2 points for each unused Hue Turn Peg.  The highest total wins!<br/><br/>WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Pattern Recognition, Spatial Visualization<br/><br/>",

Check out the files section for the full extended rules, a quick-reference printable version (which folds up to fit in your pack of cards), and an extraneous (but helpful) flowchart of gameplay (because flowcharts make the world a better place.)<br/><br/>Relatively recently added: Alternate card faces for all numbered cards representing both items and zombies, as well as zombified jacks, queens, kings, aces and jokers.<br/><br/>",

The end could now begin.<br/><br/>Set in an alternate but familiar world, Black and White pits two players against each other as they try to complete their agenda, namely to either prevent or begin the apocalypse.<br/><br/>In the game, players morally battle for the control of five key figures in the end time by either praising their virtues or exploiting their vices, while fighting to find and recover a holy artifact that holds the key to opening the first seal and bring the world to its end. This is achieved through the play of cards that affect either specific characters or less powerful cards that can target any character. At the end of each round of play, the first player rolls to take control of characters. This roll's success is determined through comparison to the morality score of each character. The player who takes control of each character moves it, trying to pick up and deliver the artifact to that player's own base.<br/><br/>",

The picture tiles show different tools (pincers, hammer, shovel, drill, ladder), materials (cement, bricks, stone, sand), pieces of clothing (helmet, boiler suit, glove, protective vest, shoe, tool belt) and screws.<br/>The basic game idea is that an adult reads or tells a story or a poem, and the children have to grab tiles when they hear the names of the items on those tiles. The player with most tiles is the winner, but it is also playable with just one kid.<br/><br/>Other ideas presented in the booklet include memory games, sorting activities (sort tiles into tools, clothing, construction materials), and telling what an object is used for.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cards: The Attackening! is a limited collectible card game (LCCG) for 2 - 5 players. Games take anywhere from 15 - 45 minutes, depending on how many people are playing. The game works on a system of sharing decks. I.e., instead of everyone bringing separate decks, there are three decks in each copy of the game from which every player draws. Specifically, Cards: The Attackening! consists of an Attackener deck (characters); Arsenal deck (Pets, Weapons, Armor, Evasions, and miscellaneous Items); and Twists of Fate (scenarios that affect gameplay - e.g., SciFi Attackeners gain a certain advantage while attacking.).<br/><br/>The game is played by every player drawing three Attackeners, three Arsenal cards, playing their first Attackener and then rolling to see who draws and plays the first Twist of Fate. The player with the highest roll chooses three Twists of Fate, and choosing the one that benefits them the most. That player then draws one Arsenal card, plays one, and attacks an opponent by rolling a die. Damage is determined by the amount rolled (1 is a miss, 2 is half damage, 3-5 is full, and 6 is double). If the opponent does not evade the attack, they take the damage and the move is passed to the next player, who follows the above steps to complete their turn.<br/><br/>When an Attackener's health is depleted, the person who beat that Attackener collects the card as a trophy. The person who was beaten chooses the next Twist of Fate, but does not play their next Attackener until it is their turn to play. This gives them a few rounds of immunity while play continues. The game is over when one player has collected three trophies from any player in the game.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you spin the spinner and act accordingly:<br/><br/><br/>    Numbers 1-8: Move your Disney pawn 1 to 8 spaces on the road forward. <br/>    Clock: Move the hand of the clock 1 or 2 hours forward.<br/>    Mickey-Mouse: Draw and reveal the first card from the deck, turn over the sand timer, and together try to find and mark with plastic rings the depicted objects on the game board. Stop and count after the timer has run through. All may move their pawns the number of correctly marked objects.<br/><br/><br/>If all reach the castle before the clock strikes midnight, the game is won.<br/><br/>",

Imagine a game of Peg Solitaire getting combined with a Rubik's Cube.<br/><br/>The Goal of the game is to remove as many pyramids as possible from the 3x4 board to achieve the lowest score.<br/><br/>The board is made up of 12 pyramid nests (a nest is a large pyramid  atop a medium pyramid, atop a small pyramid) on a 3x4 grid.<br/><br/>Each turn, use the top pyramid to hop over an adjacent top pyramid and land on the following location. Immediately remove the top pyramid that was hopped. The twist is that pyramids are only allowed to land on a pyramid of the same size or on an empty space on the board.<br/><br/>When no more legal moves are possible, count the pips on all of the remaining pyramids on the board to get your final score. <br/>Larges = 3 pts. Mediums = 2 pts. Smalls = 1 pt. <br/>It is possible to end the game with 1 point. This is considered a perfect score.<br/><br/>Egyptian Solitaire is featured in the recently succesful Kickstarter campaign of Pyramid Arcade by Looney Labs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Hipsters and Hamsters is a light card game for individual or team play. To begin play, each player is dealt four cards. In a unique twist, players can win the game in one of two ways. Players win as a Hipster by having no cards in their hand at the end of their turn. Players win as a Hamster by having eight (or more) cards in their hand at the end of their turn.<br/><br/>There are four card types. Object cards serve as simple discards. No action is taken when Object cards are played. Action cards trigger the action shown on the card when played, helping players eliminate, or accumulate, cards. Calamity cards can be played at the start of an opponent&rsquo;s turn, forcing the opponent to take the action on the Calamity card. Comeback cards can be played on Calamity cards, in which case it becomes the turn of the person playing the Comeback card. Depending on the Comeback card, that person either takes the action on the Calamity card, or ignores it, before starting their turn.<br/><br/>Despite its pick-up-and-play game mechanic, Hipsters and Hamsters is filled with dynamic and precisely-balanced strategy, as opposing sets of victory conditions cause players to flip between playing styles in reaction to draws and opponent actions, all while attempting to control turn order to alter the flow of play.<br/><br/>In the Basic game, players do not declare which character style (Hipster or Hamster) they are playing as and can switch between styles at any time, as many times as they wish, allowing them to adjust their strategy on-the-fly.

        "description": "Vicksburg was the key. Holding it meant &quot;holding the South together,&quot; with access to all the western men, food, horses, supplies... and Mexican ports. Holding it also meant the Mississippi River could not be freely used by the North, for transporting troops and supplies, nor by Midwestern farmers, for shipping exported goods. Can you, as the Federal forces, match U.S. Grant's finest campaign? Can you, commanding for the Confederacy, gather your scattered troops and create a force strong enough to punish Grant for his audacity?<br/><br/>This division-level hex-and-counter game includes Grant's Army of the Tennessee, facing off against the oft-at-odds Army of Mississippi of Pemberton and Army of Tennessee of Johnston.<br/><br/>The sweep and scope of the campaign are included, from Grant's Crossing at Bruinsburg to the finale (or not). Interesting side stories are included, like Grierson's Raid, the CSS Arkansas, and &quot;that devil Forrest&quot; and his part--or not-- in the grand campaign.<br/><br/>",

This game is the official board game of Japanese Manga &quot;Majime Kei Kuzu no Nichijou (Everyday of serious type scum)&quot;.<br/><br/>&quot;I'll skip school events more smartly than everyone else does!&quot;<br/><br/>In this game, players try to live lazily, eluding tiresome school activities while not destroying your reputation with your classmates. Your reputation is gauged by school hierarchy. You go up ranks in the hierarchy if you accomplish something with your classmates, and go down if you blow off something.<br/><br/>Players have the same deck of cards, each of which is numbered 0 to 2 indicating how much energy they will commit to an activity. Each round, an event card is drawn. Players secretly determine how much energy they commit on that event, placing cards face-down. Then all cards are revealed simultaneously.<br/><br/>If the event is co-operative, players need to commit a certain number of total energy to accomplish. If successful, all involved players go up ranks. If the event is competitive, only players who have committed the highest energy are successful and go up ranks.<br/><br/>But you should not over-commit an event because the victory goes to the player with the most energy saved in their hand. Because of that, you may play a &quot;Blow off&quot; card secretly instead of committing energy. It saves you from wasting your cards, and you may draw two cards instead of regular one card at end of the round. But if two or more players play &quot;Blow off&quot;, their ranks go down.<br/><br/>After the round, cards played are discarded, except for &quot;Blow off&quot; cards which return to players' hand. When you go up to a certain rank, you may have a friend who can use a special ability for you.<br/><br/>The game ends after several rounds, and you win the game if you save the most energy in your hand, but you can't claim the victory if you are at the lowest rank in the school hierarchy.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>「オレは学校をサボる！誰よりも上手く！！」<br/>学校で起こる様々なめんどくさい青春イベントをやり過ごし、<br/>周りに嫌われぬまま、楽して生き抜くことを目指すゲーム。<br/>人間関係わずらわしい！めんどくさい事やりたくない！<br/>周りを欺き、裏では手を抜き、本能のまま生きる事を目指す！<br/>学校行事に参加してスクールカーストを上げ、<br/>ここぞという時にサボって体力を貯めこむ！<br/>漫画『まじめ系クズの日常』公式ゲーム<br/><br/>",

The game then alternates in phases of &ldquo;night&rdquo;, in which werewolves agree to covertly kill a villager, and &ldquo;day&quot;, in which villagers debate the identities of the werewolves and vote to kill a suspect. Play continues until all of the werewolves have been killed, or until the werewolves outnumber the villagers.<br/><br/>THE CARDS<br/><br/>There are NO DUPLICATES in the Werewolf House deck of 37 different character cards. Each card features a unique, full color character illustration, so even after dozens of game rounds players will still be discovering new art.<br/><br/>CORE CARDS - The base version of the game can be played by 7-12 people, using 6-10 basic villager cards and 1-2 werewolf cards - all included in the Werewolf House deck.<br/><br/>ADVANCED CARDS - It&rsquo;s fun to mix it up. Dozens of characters with unique abilities have been carefully curated to add complexity to the gameplay, without burdening the moderator with messy role management tasks.<br/><br/>",

You and your friends split up and head to your respective homes, trying to get there first. Snowballs thrown by your opponents and the blistering cold will slow you down, and if you're not careful, you might freeze before you arrive.<br/><br/>Snow Day has players creating Paths with cards, hoping to create a route from their origin point to their Home. Each turn, a player places a new Path card from a draw pile or manipulates an existing Path, then rolls a Movement Die to determine their movement, and finally accounts for their loss in body temperature. The game acts as a race against both your friends and the weather itself, as players lose temperature on each turn. If their temperature reaches zero, they're frozen solid and eliminated from the competition.<br/><br/>Players can disrupt one another's paths as a defensive move, at the potential cost of their own path development. Special Path cards also allow for a player to chuck an imaginary Snowball at an opponent, speeding up their friend's freezing process. The first player to arrive to their home before freezing is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Yet, watch out!  Your opponents will try to stop you with poops, problem cards,  and more importantly, dirty toilets.<br/><br/>BASIC GAME ACTIONS:  Players can perform three basic actions during the course of their turn.  They can solve a problem; discard a poop; and, or create a problem. A player&rsquo;s turn ends when s/he draws two cards from the deck.  There are no limit on the number of actions, but players can not use duplicate cards.<br/><br/>STARTING:  The game is played in turns, clockwise with each player receiving eight cards.  The remaining cards are placed in the center as the draw pile.  Each player places their clean toilets in front of them from left to right.  The person with the least amount of clean toilets or no clean toilet plays first.  If there is more than one person with the lowest amount or no clean toilets, players can start with various options noted in the rule book, available on <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.dirtytoiletgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.dirtytoiletgame.com</a>.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME:  The game ends with a winner when the following is met:  The player has collected five clean toilet points and discarded all poops, without having a problem to solve.<br/><br/>Let's play dirty!<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.dirtytoiletgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.dirtytoiletgame.com</a><br/><br/>",

The Map of the Realm is always different and compiled by players from 48 tiles, before the game begins. Each Cult has an unique advantage throughout the game, moreover, additional artifacts will grant other powerful advantages. A player's turn is as short as possible, to keep everyone interested: each player throws the dice, chooses one action and performs the effects of that action. The main goal is to gather resources: converting villages or finding powerful artifacts. Luck plays its role in this contest, a dice is used at the beginning of each turn, and each player can sometimes draw cards from three different decks: Artifact Cards, Ruin Cards or Debate Cards. Sacrifice tokens can be obtained during the game and used as extra dice points. The game ends when a player has enough resources to perform the Ritual of Ascending at the King's Castle and becomes the Prophet, winning the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>&quot;Welcome to the epic world of religious doctrines, where everyday events may help shape the world to come.<br/>You start this Game of Truths as a Lost Soul, longing for spiritual fulfillment. As soon as the doctrine is revealed to you, set forth to spreading it among the villagers. Some of them may prove too resilient to new ideas, so you may have to use powerful artifacts to help you on your holy quest. As your popularity rises, your tasks will become easier, but be warned that your competitors may challenge you at any time.<br/>Who will emerge as the True Prophet of the Realm?&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

Recently another Galaxy has approached ours; it looks like the local Villains were pumpkin-headed enough to waste each other. Only Minions remain. The poor things wither without supervision on their desolate planets...<br/><br/>The scouts (those who managed to survive) report though that space self-defense forces are still active on some planets, while miniatures shaggy alien beasts were spotted on other planets, while somewhere else... these issues have to be dealt with. I have to send an Asteroid there.<br/><br/>Or two Asteroids. Or, even better, three. Somebody has to scavenge the scarce values left on these mysterious planets. Otherwise other Villains are going to loot everything...<br/><br/>Postscriptum. A special note for Asteroid firing pointers: &ldquo;Shoot gently! The Asteroid must neatly penetrate the force field around the planet leaving all the valuables intact for further scavenging. Understood?&rdquo;<br/><br/>During the game, Lootable Planets expansion provides an alternative. You may launch an Asteroid either into another Villain or into Lootable Planets. Then, in the beginning of your next turn, the Asteroid hits the target and... you find out what has happened.<br/><br/>Some cards of the Lootable Planets expansion are very useful. Hitting such a card is like hitting the jackpot! For example, May the Loss Be with You! card allows you to seize a random card from other Villain&rsquo;s hand immediately, Backdoor Asteroid &mdash; to deliver a sudden blow to other Villain&rsquo;s planet, while Star Shower &mdash; to launch two Asteroids at once.<br/><br/>Other cards of the Lootable Planets expansion are not that efficient. Sometimes the Minions point the Asteroid not very precisely and it smashes a half of the planet. The remaining half brings smaller loot.<br/><br/>Finally, there are two nasty cards &mdash; Ambush of Alien Hamsters and Assault on Black Hole. The Minions have launched the Asteroid... in a wrong direction. Assault on Black Hole simply &lsquo;eats&rsquo; your Asteroid, which is logical &mdash; what else would you expect from a Black Hole?! But the Hamsters are worst of all. These tiny evil beasts retarget your Asteroid into you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "America&rsquo;s realest real estate game is back!  It&rsquo;s Blacks &amp; Whites: 50th Anniversary Edition.<br/><br/>Fifty years ago, Prof. Robert Sommer and Judy Tart created a socially-conscious version of Monopoly, highlighting the racial inequity of the housing market and capitalism in America. Inspired by the original, the 50th Anniversary Edition features a new foreward by Prof. Sommer, modern original artwork, entertaining gameplay, and renewed lessons in the economics of prejudice.<br/><br/>The objective is simple: control the board by owning the most property &ndash; and hopefully learn something about empathy and cooperation along the way. Play as a Black player: you may feel disenfranchised, but you also get access to Bonus Cards that White players can only dream about!  Or play as White, and this game should be as easy as getting a loan or being seen as human by the police!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In each round, one chosen player tries to give as many correct answers as they can for a category with ten items. Each answer earns money, and a player may stop and bank what they have at five correct answers. Banked money goes into the final jackpot for the bonus round.<br/><br/>To help, a team gets one life per round (in case they give a wrong answer), as well as one &ldquo;Overrule&rdquo;, where the team captain can reject a given answer and substitute another one. These can be used once per round, with the Overrule only allowed prior to five correct answers. The final help is three &ldquo;Nominate&rdquo; tokens, which are used among all players. With them, the player may chose another player to give an answer if they can&rsquo;t think of one. Players get eliminated if they give a second wrong answer and are sent to the Vortex.<br/><br/>When all players have played a question, the final round begins. Any player who banked money and was not eliminated participates. If no player remained in the game, 500 is put into the bank and the captain plays solo. The team is given a choice of two lists to play, and they begin giving answers one at a time, in turn. A wrong answer eliminates a player. If the tenth answer is given, any remaining players split the money. If everyone is eliminated prior to getting all ten answers, the player who banked the most money in the previous rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Cards show one of seven items on them &mdash; banana, strawberry, elephant, cocoa, carrot, bell pepper, or schnattergei (this being a chatty parrot) &mdash; with each item being in one of four colors: yellow, red, blue, or brown.<br/><br/>On a turn, flip the top card of your deck onto the discard pile and quickly say the object (banana, strawberry, elephant, cocoa) matching the color of the card revealed (yellow, red, blue, brown). You never say &quot;carrot&quot; or &quot;pepper&quot;, and when you flip a schnattergei, you must &quot;parrot&quot; the previous player by saying what they said, not what matches the color of the parrot. If you make a mistake, take two cards from your deck and place them under the discard pile.<br/><br/>When someone reveals an item that matches the item on the top of the discard pile, everyone must race to slap the pile. Whoever does so first claims all the cards in the discard pile and puts them under their draw deck, face down. <br/>The game ends when a player runs out of cards and does not manage to win the discard pile in the same round. Whoever has the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fun tea parties are all the rage in Wonderland! However, the Queen of Hearts is vain and jealous. She hates for any tea party to steal the spotlight from the tea parties she hosts at her castle. If the Queen finds out that you're throwing such a tea party, she shouts that familiar line: &ldquo;Off with their heads!&rdquo; To stay out of trouble, Alice and her friends must make sure their tea parties draw less attention than those hosted by the Queen of Hearts while still attracting guests. Who will avoid the Queen's attention while throwing the most exciting tea party?<br/><br/>In Liddell: Alice and the Secret Tea Party, players place cards either in the common play area or in their own area. Players compete for the highest total value of cards. However, the total value of the cards in your area must not exceed the total value of the cards in the common area.(Any cards exceeding the total value of the common area will be worth 0 points). Avoid going bust, use each character's special ability, and try to collect all 5 types of character cards!<br/><br/>&mdash;translated description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only the one who carefully works out where each of his animals is staying and skillfully swaps their places will be able to bring his six party friends home.<br/><br/>In Treetop Trouble, a specific type of animal lives on each floor of the treehouse and in the elevator. (It's not cozy, but it's home.) To set up the game, each player takes his set of six animal tiles &ndash; which are color-coded on the back &ndash; shuffles them, then lays out one animal on each floor and in the elevator. The player may peek at the animal in the elevator.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the die, then moves the elevator up or down or to any floor desired based on the roll. Each player in turn may then swap his animal on the elevator with his animal on that floor. A player can look at the face of one of his tiles only when placing it in the elevator, so you might want to swap willy-nilly until you nail down who's who.<br/><br/>Be the first player to get six animals home and you win.<br/><br/>",

The ship contains a quantity of beads which shift around like an unstable cargo, and there are various pivoted fittings (mast, plank etc). There is also a loose rolling barrel on the deck which trips various traps as it rolls around.<br/><br/>Essentially a roll and move game, the shipmates start the game in a 'raft' and move onto the first of the 17 numbered spaces on the ship. Some spaces are more precarious than others, especially the mast and pivoted traps. Half of the numbers printed on the spinner have a 'ghost' symbol which enables the player to also move the Ghost Pirate onto any of the marked larger spaces, thus causing the entire ship to rotate and pitching any unlucky players back into the sea, where they have to start over (unless they've got past space 9, whereas they can return to space 9 instead).<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to get to space 17 (the treasure) by spinning the exact number to get there.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pathfinder Arena is a competitive board game set in the Pathfinder RPG's &quot;Age of Lost Omens&quot; setting. Monsters and heroes clash in four stages of challenges in a labyrinth. In each stage, the number and power of the monsters increase, while heroes level up and gather resources to gain new skills, magic spells, equipment, and the deities' favor.<br/><br/>Pathfinder Arena will feature high-detail miniatures of the most iconic monsters of Pathfinder, along with its greatest heroes. The monsters summoned in the labyrinth never leave their spot, but the labyrinth shape is dynamic, and players can change it by moving the board's tiles. Monsters can then be used to attack other players, in the end leaving only one winner.<br/><br/>Pathfinder Arena Pledge Manager and Late Pledge are live on Gamefound till august 10: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://gamefound.com/projects/giochi-uniti/pathfinder-arena\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://gamefound.com/projects/giochi-uniti/pathfinder-arena</a><br/><br/>",

Indeed, by the end of the war the small ships, PT&rsquo;s LCI etc. numbered 7,000 craft of 80 types. Many Early PT boats had up to 4 torpedoes and 2 twin .50 Cal guns in powered mounting, a heavy load for the day. As with most American hardware, this was only the start! Soon a 20mm was added at the stern as standard, useful for surface or air action. Then, enterprising crews frustrated by strafing the tough Japanese barges to negligible effect mounted a USAAF 37mm automatic gun (acquired from an Air Cobra) and found it most effective!<br/><br/>Indeed, America had not been blind to the possibilities of the coming war and took great pains to watch and learn from her allies and foes so that when war came, America was ready to put into place a building program that dwarfed all the other navies combined and led to the naval dominance that she still enjoys today.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The mechanics are pretty much the same:<br/><br/>Players are given a card secretly, each showing the bunny's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the bunnies. When you move a bunny onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green bunny one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue bunny on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final bunny because it is blocked or it lands on a space of its own color. Eventually, the bunnies cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins.<br/><br/>Funny and quick puzzle-racing game and one of the (if not the) first games published by Doris and Frank.<br/><br/>",

The board is also ruled off in squares, with each square 20 yards per side on the scale of the holes.<br/><br/>There are 14 dice representing four woods, eight irons, a wedge and a putter.  These have various ranges (in yards)appropriate for the club printed on the faces.  Another die called the &quot;directional die&quot; has either &quot;hook&quot; or &quot;slice&quot; and a yardage on each side.<br/><br/>Players hit their ball (represented by a colored tee) by announcing the direction they're hitting - one of the eight cardinal points - and rolling the directional die and the die for the club they're using.  The new ball positioned using the die values and the grid.  There are various rules restricting club use depending on the type of landscape you're hiting from.  Once you're on the green there's no direction to worry about, just range and the odds on putter die.<br/> The manufacturing quality of the game is very good, almost extravagant.  The box is hefty, there's a nice cork-lined plastic holder for the dice, a pad of score cards, and large cards printed with golf terms, club ranges, and even golf etiquette (&quot;Replace divots.&quot;).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What's Wild?! is a rummy-based card game for 2-7 players Ages 7 and up. Instead of cards featuring suits, the game's cards are made up of four different animal skins&mdash;alligator, cheetah, peacock, and zebra. And to further the &quot;Wild&quot; theme of the game, when a player's hand allows him or her to end a round of play, he or she must declare, &quot;I'm going wild!&quot;<br/><br/>A complete game of What's Wild?! includes 10 rounds. Each player receives three cards to begin the first round, and by the final round, each player is holding 12 cards in his or her hand. Players collect appropriately-named &quot;herds&quot; and &quot;caravans&quot;&mdash;called &quot;books&quot; and &quot;runs&quot; in traditional rummy games&mdash; throughout each round, until they are able to &quot;Go Wild,&quot; or end the round.<br/><br/>Four cards - called &quot;Chameleon Cards&quot; change the Wild Card when played throughout the game. The four Chameleon Cards give the game a sort of &quot;Old Maid&quot; feel, in that if the card is in a player's hand when another player &quot;Goes Wild,&quot; the player holding the Chameleon Card is awarded the maximum amount of points. In a game in which the low score wins, players must carefully weigh their options for playing Chameleon Cards when holding one. Playing the card too early may allow the Wild Card to be changed in later turns, but holding on to it too long may lead to an stampede of points. The Chameleon Card makes each round of every game of What's Wild?! new, exciting, and completely unpredictable.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.whatswildcardgame.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.whatswildcardgame.com/</a><br/><br/>",

Then the player whose turn it is rolls all 7 letter cubes. Immediately all players shout out words that relate to the category that begin with one of the letters face up on the cubes. As a player shouts out a word, that player snags the cube with that letter on it. Opponents must object immediately if they think the word just shouted does not relate to the category.<br/><br/>When all of the letter cubes have been snagged, or players have gone 10 seconds or more without coming up with a word, the round is over. Players score one point for each letter cube they snagged during the round. The first player to snag 20 points wins.<br/><br/>The rules include some variants.<br/><br/>Contents: 7 dice, dice cup, 30 category cards, score pad, rules.<br/><br/>",

Shuffle every deck and take , without looking, 1 card per deck and face it down in the middle of the table. then merge the remaining cards into one deck, shuffle and deal evenly among the players.<br/><br/>Now its time to play!: <br/>The objetive of the game is to discover the face down cards using logic and deduction.<br/>First of all you know that the &quot;confidential file&quot; cards can't be in the center of the table so you discard those card from the &quot;personal agenda&quot; deck in your hand.<br/><br/>Now a player begins its turn by asking other players about some of their cards. For example: I ask to the player on my left for &quot;the BLUE SPY in LONDON&quot;, or &quot;In AIRPLANE to PANAMA&quot;. Every question must involve 2 elements of the 3 different variables (cities, spies and devices) it may include 2 of the same element, for example 2 agents, 2 cities or 2 devices.<br/>Once the question was askes, the other player checks his/her cards of &quot;confidential archive&quot; and if he/she has 1 or two of those cards, he must show 1 to the player who asked. By knowing the card, you can discard what he/she shown from the personal agenda. otherwise he says &quot;I'll pass&quot; and another player must be asked.<br/><br/>The game continues like this until someone thinks that they know the cards facing down and makes and acussation! if he guesses right he wins if not the player to the left makes and acussation and so until someone wins!<br/><br/>",

To succeed, you need to block others to keep them from reproducing!<br/><br/>To set up the game, shuffle the cards, then deal everyone a hand of six cards, placing the other cards aside as a draw deck.

It can easily be learned and played in a few short minutes, but mastery of the game will take much longer. Each and every move can have huge ramifications, and players will find it extremely difficult to plan more than a couple of rounds in advance.<br/><br/>I stumbled upon this game while skimming through some old journals I found in my grandfather&amp;#65533;s attic. The rules were gleaned from Kardon's writings on the Muighar tribes, and I've tried my best to keep them authentic. However, as Kardon's description of the rules are not very clear, this version may vary slightly from that of antiquity.<br/><br/>As most of you probably don't have access to authentic Muighar Slings and Stones pieces or boards, I've taken the liberty of finding some substitutions. This game can played using a chess board, with 4 pawns and 12 checkers. Pawns represent the slings, and checkers represent the stones.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.darkshadowgames.com/Epic_Registration/register.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.darkshadowgames.com/Epic_Registration/register.ht...</a> <br/>(Click &quot;Download SLINGS.ZIP&quot; for rules and bits)<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bug racers have come to compete from all over the world, and the first one to cross the finish line will become globally famous. Moreover, the winner will gain interplanetary fame as for the first time in the Grand Bug Races, robobugs from the space station will participate in the next stage of the competition.<br/><br/>Bug Race is an easy to master but still captivates as a dynamic board game race for 2-4 players  from 8 years old. Each player leads his own bug to victory moving its legs one after another. Of course, legs shouldn&rsquo;t be torn off the body or tangle with each other. When a bug passes all 9 levels of the playing field and crosses the finish line first, its owner wins the game.<br/><br/>Each bug consists of 7 elements, body and 6 legs, and runs at its own track, divided into sections. There are special notches for the bug&rsquo;s legs, gashed on the each side of the track. Body, that covers three sections, is placed at the track between the legs. &ldquo;Losing&rdquo; legs is permitted: each leg should touch the body at least diagonally all the time. So the bug can not stretch for more than 5 sections.<br/><br/>When the game begins, players place their bugs at the start positions &ndash; the three first sections of the track. Tracks cross at the middle of the table and connected by the central element with the race aim on it. They are not bonded hard so players don&rsquo;t pull others&rsquo; tracks while moving their own bugs. If needed, in case of lack of free space on the table for example, playing is possible without a center element. And of cause you don&rsquo;t need extra tracks if there are less than 4 players.<br/><br/>Moving bugs is performed by using special cards. Each of them allows to move 2 or 3 legs, a front left and a middle right, for example. In the beginning of each round players draw two of such cards from the stack. One of them stays at the hand and another one goes to the next player. Then both cards in the hand should be played in any order. Player moves all the stated legs forward if there is a free notch and the leg won&rsquo;t be torn off the body. It&rsquo;s possible to move the bug&rsquo;s body forward as well at any time during the turn if it won&rsquo;t cause a leg loss.<br/><br/>When everyone finish playing cards &ndash; by verbal understanding cards can be played all at the same time or by turns &ndash; players discard them and draw the new ones. The game is over when at least one bug has passed the finish line by its body, which should be located at the three last track sections. If such a bug is the only one, its owner wins the game. If there are several challengers, the winner is defined by the location of legs.<br/><br/>Skillful players can play 4 cards instead of 2 during the turn. In that case each player draws 4 cards from the stack, leaves one in the hand and gives three to the next player, chooses one from the derived cards and gives two, and at last gives one and keeps another. By the way, players can choose the convenient design: there is a forest glade with an apple at the one side and a space station with a big red button at the other. Bugs are also two-sided, well-matched to the game field. Of cause, nothing impedes robot-bugs to land on the Earth as well as common insects can visit a space station, it will be even more interesting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once upon a time, the world needed heroes.  Brave souls seeking fortune and glory in the name of all that's good.  Eventually, they gained whatever it was they sought and have retired.  Too bad evil didn't do the same.  Thus quests and monsters grew in number until, finally, Percival Thistlewood invented 2 foot tall wooden golems which, when clothed, took on the role of whatever garmets they wore. Initially designed for utility, the popularity of these Dungeoneering Dolls quickly spread throughout the kingdom and now you are one of many collectors attempting to create the best collection of Dungeoneering Dolls.<br/><br/>As a simple card game, Dungeoneering Dolls has two types of cards.  The first is the quests, which occur at the end of the game, but the most cards are actually the Dolls. Dolls come in six classes and each class contains dolls numbered 1-8.  These dolls are all worth a set number of positive or negative points.  When you play them, you will stack like classed dolls on top of other like classed dolls.  So any new Ranger goes on top of a previous Ranger, if applicable.  There are also eight Limited Edition Dolls which may be played at any time and act as &quot;rule breakers.&quot;<br/><br/>When someone plays a card, there is a chance for another player to steal it.  To do this, they need to play a card of the superior class in an equal or higher level.  So Berserkers beat Thieves beat Rangers beat Wizards beat Knights beat Clerics beat Berserkers.  If a card is used to steal a card, they discard the card used and instead, claim the card they are stealing for their collection.<br/><br/>The game continues this way until the first quest is revealed in the draw pile.  Then players resolve each quest one by one until the game is over.  Quests will make demands like having the strongest Ranger.  You'll discard the Doll which fulfills the quest to claim it and in the end, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Each hand takes 9-12 minutes to play and a longer game may be desired, in which case, play to a set number of points.  Percival Thistlewood's Incredible Dungeoneering Dolls was initially released on The Game Crafter in both Poker Sized and Tarot Sized card formats. It became a part of The Game Crafter's Village in a Box Kickstarter as one of the Microgames.<br/><br/>",

Not only are they skilled hunters and craftsmen, but also nimble traders. As the head of one of these Polynesian tribes, your task is to attract as many villagers as possible to your tribe. Market day takes place infrequently for the islanders, but when it does come, it attracts many merchants.<br/><br/>In Полинезия, you are attempting to purchase fish, turtles, masks, and flower garlands in order to hire patrons to your village and become the richest tribe in Polynesia. Each turn, the active player will roll four dive (each one with values of 1,2,3,4,5, and 8) that will set the market values of the four products for that round. Then, you will exchange your expensive goods for multiples of cheap goods, trying to get the best combinations of goods that let you attract patrons from the marketplace.<br/><br/>Your patrons, once 'purchased,' will come to your village where you will lay them out. As you progress through each of the three seasons of the game (there are three rows of four), you are trying to earn the most points from your patrons by stacking similar patrons, earning points from totem masks, and getting all three types of patron in one season. Your goal at the end of the game is to become the richest tribe in all of Polynesia!<br/><br/>",

Each player takes one of the factions and rolls all nine dice. Taking turns, players then either attack the opponent or use a special power. Dice that are used are placed into the dice cup. If a player cannot attack or use a power, he instead &quot;rallies&quot;, rolling the dice cup and simultaneously rerolling all of his dice still in play.<br/><br/>The zombie dice are unique in that they have no rank 4 unit, and instead have an additional rank 1 unit on their dice.  However, they have several powers that revolve around gaining extra rank 1 units.

For two players, the Head-to-Head Mode urges players to pile up their Pixit cubes, pick a card, and then twist, turn and tip their 16 cubes into place to be the first to recreate the pixelated image shown on the card.<br/><br/>For Solo play, create images as fast as possible against the clock, and the aim is to beat your best time! Alternatively, the Memory Mode is for 2&ndash;6 players, in which one player is the builder and must recreate the image as the other players guess what is being formed. Each player has only one chance to guess what is being built, and if a player guesses incorrectly, they are out for that round. The faster you guess, the more points you win!<br/><br/>Whether Pixit is played in teams, in pairs or as a solo activity, each mode is exceedingly addictive and gets tremendously tense as the Pixit cubes twist and turn.

        "description": "CRITTER COMMANDOS is a game of squad level (and larger) combats that occur in a universe gone mad. All the combatants are modeled after Saturday morning cartoon characters, and that the damage caused by the weapons isn't really real! Each bit of damage puts a &quot;hole&quot; in the character (just like a cartoon!), and when they've taken enough holes, they are out of the game. But they come back for the next episode, safe and sound!<br/><br/>This game is intended to be a fast and fun introduction to the world of miniatures games. Each soldier has an INDEX that tells you how fast it is, how smart it is, how well it can shoot, and more. They also have a list of whatever weapons they carry. Using this, you as the player control how the battle unfolds, and try for ultimate victory.<br/><br/>The combat is quick-paced and east to learn. It uses a single roll on a ten-sided die to figure out any combat. The emphasis is on fun and excitement, not massive tomes of over complicated, supposedly &quot;realistic&quot; systems that bog down in too much detail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1992 a supplement with roleplaying rules was released, see the RPGGeek entry Critter Commandos Compendium.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This fairly ancient Racing Game (my copy seems at least 50 years old) has no dice whatever, an unusual feature for the genre. The gameboard has a series of turntables on it, which can be rotated so as to alter the paths in front of the players: the skillful manipulation of the turntables lies at the heart of the game. Each turn the player's piece (a small racing car) moves 1,2,3, or 4 squares forwards, at the player's discretion. If he lands on a space with black dots, he can rotate a turntable anywhere on the board, either to clear his path to the finish line or to hinder someone else. The Finish squares when reached give you points, and then you return to the start, only winning when you have 100 pts. It is possible to become completely trapped in an area with no black dots, and this carries a penalty of 20 pts and return to start. <br/>The theme is pasted on, but the deduction and 'screwage factor' involved should appeal to many.<br/><br/>",

Players acquire resources (food, wood, stone, metal and gold) to train troops and construct buildings to earn benefits at different stages of the game and victory points to win the game.<br/><br/>Players can acquire resources in three ways, the main one being through your peasants, with each player starting with three. You decide which resources to produce, but some are easier to get than others, so you can play it safe or risk trying for a few more precious resources. You can also gain resources through rangers, which you must first train, which takes several units of food and wood.<br/><br/>The last way to gain resources is through the bidding phase. Each turn, all players bid secretly on one of five different resource bundles.<br/><br/>",

Shouting Mau Mau doesn't end the game, but gives you 5 bonus points. Playing identical cards and some special spaces also wins bonus points. The game ends when all the spaces on the board are covered with cards. The winner of this fast-paced board game version of the classic card game is the player who scored the most points!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>Draw two on the 7, skip a turn on the 8 - the famous card game mau mau gets its own special charm as a board game. Anyway, if Reiner Knizia takes over the implementation.<br/><br/>Placing a suitable card on another, the next player must react - this is the classic principle of mau mau. The suit or number must match the previously placed card. Reiner Knizia has transferred this principle to the game board: tiles are placed on a path. The color or symbol shown must match the adjacent tile. Special fields provide surprise effects. And the classics such as &quot;two draw&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; are also present here. For the penultimate card, announce &quot;mau&quot;; for the last card, &quot;mau mau&quot; also applies. However: &quot;mau mau&quot; is not the end. But only when all fields on the map are occupied. This creates tension: the winner is not who got rid of his cards first, but who has collected the most points.<br/><br/>So it is important to proceed strategically and reach the special fields, because they certainly lead to the coveted point chips. In addition, you usually have several investment options.<br/><br/>&mdash;description form the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

The game plays with 2, 3 or 4 players. 4-player game are usually played in partnerships.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt four cards and four cards are played to the table making the &quot;floor&quot;. Jacks and 7's of diamond from the floor are shuffled back into the deck and replaced. Players take turns playing one card to the floor and capturing cards if possible. When each player has played all four cards, the dealer deals out four more to each player, unless the deck is empty in which case the round is scored.<br/><br/>Captures can be made by playing a card of the same rank or a card that sums to two or more cards. Multiple captures are possible, for example a 10 would capture a 3, 7 and 10 from the floor. Queens and Kings do not have numerical value so the only way to capture them is by playing the same rank or a special card.<br/><br/>Players earn a Basra, worth 10 points, by capturing all the cards remaining on the floor . Players keep track of this by keeping the capturing card face up in their point pile. Jacks capture all cards on the floor, but do not count as a Basra. Jacks played on an empty floor capture nothing and remain on the floor. The seven of diamonds plays just like a jack except it earns a Basra if the captured cards add up to 10 or less. After the last card is played, remaining cards on the floor go to the player who made the last capture.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>The player (or team in partnerships) with the most cards receives 30 points. Ties are pushed to the next round (so 60 points could be earned).<br/>Jacks and aces are worth 1 point. <br/>The two of clubs is worth 2 points.<br/>The ten of diamonds is worth 3 points.<br/>Basra's are worth 10 points each.<br/><br/>A new hand is dealt unless someone has a total score of 101 in which case the player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie a new hand is played.<br/><br/>",

All player start out at the dock with a fishing boat playing piece.  They choose a level of difficulty from 1 to 4 for their questions.  This is a way to handicap the game.  Older or more experienced fishermen should choose a higher number.<br/><br/>Each player in turn rolls the die and moves along a track marked with lily pads.  Green lily pads are safe spots.  On a yellow (or orange) lily pad, the player must choose a question card and answer a fishing trivia question at their level.  A decoder (transparent red plastic) is used to reveal the answer.  If the answer is correct, the player rolls and moves again.  If the card depicts a fish, the player keeps it and has now made a catch.  If the card says so, the player may take the GPS card (of which there is only one), which may allow him or her to take a shortcut along the path.  Purple cards may move the player to &quot;Shore Lunch Island&quot; or other locations, possibly delaying him or her.  The first player to move completely around the track and reach a &quot;Home&quot; space with at least one caught fish wins the game.  However, if a player finished without a fish, he or she may move immediately to &quot;Last Chance Launch&quot; and move toward the home space from there, attempting to catch a fish along the way.<br/><br/>",

In Perlen Tauchen you play as pearl divers searching for these precious objects from the depth.

The winner will be the pearl diver achieving that goal most frequent.<br/><br/>The shell cards lay down with their back side, like they were laying on the sea floor. There are mission cards for 2, 3 or 4 players, showing the required shell colors for each of the ten rounds. Each player has two action cards on his hand. In every turn a player draws a third card and plays one of them. He may either turn one card of his own or on the sea floor, or take it to his own shell chain in front of him or do both, take and turn it. There are also action cards to steal from another player or swap with another players card. In the case of a &quot;flush away&quot; or a &quot;seaquake&quot; the player must play this card immediately. In the first case he has to lay one of his cards back on the sea floor, in the second case all cards from the sea floor will be drawn to their back sides and shuffled again. <br/>A round ends when a player has fulfilled his mission for the current round. Afterwards all cards wil be shuffled again for the next round. All players now should achieve the goal of the following round. The players may play up to 10 rounds.

        "description": "Slicks is a car racing game limited to 500 copies that comes as a basic edition (with only paper sheets) or a premium edition (with wooden cars and 4-, 6-, 8- and 10-sided dice).<br/><br/>Your maximum speed is limited by the condition of your tires, the kind of space on which you start your turn, and the weight of your fuel. If you have bad tires, have a lot of fuel or are in a sharp turn, you are limited to a maximum of four spaces. On good tires on the straight way you may have a speed of ten spaces at a maximum.<br/><br/>Your car starts with proper tires, and you may choose to use the highest speed die. The actual number of spaces you move on your turn is evaluated by rolling a die (premium edition) or drawing a card (basic edition), so if you're unlucky, you may move only three spaces when rolling a ten-sided die, while another player moves six spaces although he was limited to a maximum speed of six (using the six-sided die). Reducing your amount of fuel allows you to reroll the die or add a number of spaces to your die result equal to your position (1 when you are the leader, 6 if you are the last in the field).<br/><br/>Your tires lose quality when completing a round, crossing curbstones, or driving into cars in front of you, so you may be forced to take the pit lane, refresh your tires, and take new fuel.<br/><br/>Slicks is probably the first racing game in which the condition of your tires directly impacts your maximum speed. Although some luck is needed, the strategy of when to make a pit stop or when to take a worse position to stay on a better space is important and makes Slicks unique in the category of racing games.<br/><br/>",

The Summer turn is when everyone gets to work. The Winter turn is where great commanders take huge risks. All movement is a variable, impacted by leader initiative and a die roll. Sometimes, the troops will move far and fast. Sometimes they won't.<br/><br/>The game provides a range of different foot and horse unit types which impact how well they fight, but is unusual in one area&mdash;each unit is a single unit (strength of &quot;1&quot;), with no numbers to clutter up the counter. With few exceptions, once lost, units are gone forever...making each battle and each risk of attrition something to consider.<br/><br/>Poltava&rsquo;s Dread Day provides a keen look into a decisive historical situation that few people know very much about. This period saw not only the founding of St. Petersburg but the birth of &quot;modern&quot; Russia. It saw the rise of Prussia, and led to shifts in the balance of power that would have significant effects on the Seven Years War.<br/><br/>Part of the TPS, &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series<br/>That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value. Poltava&rsquo;s Dread Day features randomized elements for everything from reinforcements to diplomacy. No two games will play the same.<br/><br/><br/>",

The one or two werewolves try to keep their identity a secret so that no one identifies them; the humans must kill one werewolf or else their town is overrun and they lose.<br/><br/>Each player secretly gets a role card (with two role cards placed in the middle of the table), looks at it, then closes their eyes to represent nighttime in town. One player is the game's moderator and calls out the roles in order for the players to take actions. The werewolves and the CIA Agent(s) open their eyes to see who belongs to these groups, but they can't say anything! Thus, a lone CIA Agent learns who the werewolves are, but he can never reveal his identity when trying to communicate this information to others. The werewolves, on the other hand, might not be sure who is actually on their side. And of course some cards might be out of play in the center of the table!<br/><br/>The psychic then gets to look at one player's card or both cards in the center of the table. The ninja gets to exchange his card for someone else's, looking at the new card if he swaps. The madman doesn't take an action at night; he just wants the werewolves to win!<br/><br/>During the day phase, players discuss who the werewolves are (or if there even are werewolves). Then all players vote simultaneously for a player. The player with the most votes is killed. If at least one werewolf is killed, the human team wins; if no werewolf is killed, the werewolf team wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Back in the mid-1960s, Milton Bradley published a pair of wonderfully sexist games: POW! (for boys) and WOW! The Pillow Fight Game for Girls. The games are essentially the same: dexterity games that consist of sending a small projectile over a barrier with the intent of knocking over the opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>POW! is a soldier game &quot;in which boys try to 'shoot' the opponent's Army with Cannons that gently toss harmless cannon balls.&quot; The game board is divided into two sections by a cardboard barrier. Each side has a plastic cannon with a cannon ball (marble). The cannon &quot;shoots&quot; the marble over the barrier to knock down the opponent's soldiers. As described in the directions, POW! is &quot;a safe, fast-action soldier game...&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BARKING MAD is a dog racing game in which players predict where the dogs will come in the race and then try to fix the race to ensure that their prediction turns out to be correct.<br/><br/>The game is played in two phases - a betting phase and a race phase, with different parts of the board being used for these two phases.<br/><br/>Placing Your Bets:<br/>Players place their dogs at the start of betting board.  Players take turns to throw a D6, moving their pieces and following the instructions on the board.  These will generally involve taking cards (which are used later in the game) or placing a bet.  Betting involves placing a marker on the Betting card to indicate, for example, that the yellow player thinks the red dog will come 4th.<br/><br/>Play continues like this until a player's piece passes the &quot;Go to the Traps&quot; space, at which point he/she completes their bets by filling up their betting column, and move their dog to a free trap to await the start of the race.  Once in the traps the player must way until all the other traps are filled.<br/><br/>The Race:<br/>The race phase comprises two actions:<br/>- Playing a card (if you have one) and following the instructions on it.<br/>-  Roll three dice and, using the score on each of the dice to move one of the seven playing pieces forward - three of the pieces (two dogs and the hare, or three dogs) move each turn.<br/><br/>A roll of 10 (on the three dice) allows a player to position a lampost in the path of one of the dogs which prevents the dog from moving until the lampost is moved.<br/><br/>The hare is moved in the same way as the dogs but is normally  in the lead.  If one of the dogs overtakes the hare it is deemed to have eaten it, and is &quot;lamposted&quot;.  At this point the hare is dead and takes no further part in the game, but is deemed (on account of the fact that it is in the dog's stomach) to finish immediately after the dog for betting purposes.<br/><br/>Once a dog crosses the finish line it is placed on the betting card in the position corresponding to where it actually finished the race.  The player owning the dog keeps playing however so as to influence where the other dogs finish.<br/><br/>Once all the dogs are finished, the actual result is compared against the predictions with players scoring as follows:<br/>- 15 points - correct prediction of the winner.<br/>- 10 points - correct prediction of any other position.<br/>- 5 points - almost correct (one place out) prediction of any postition.<br/><br/>Scores are totalled and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The board is a Dragon that shows the places were the players must move his figures.<br/>There are 6 dice, each with different number of faces, and each player can use each dice only one time in a single game.<br/>The single game works with rounds and the goal is to roll the dices with a result always bigger than the player just before. The point is that you can use the dice only one time in each single game, what means, if you use the D12, for exemple, right at the begin and don&acute;t have a good result, you cannot use this D12 again later to have better chances to beat a high result.<br/>The winner is the player who has the better results.<br/>But there is another trick thing: in each single game, one of the players is the Dragon. If he wins, then the Dragon wins, and the dragon receive a &quot;victory point&quot;.<br/>The complete game is made with 3 single games, what means that every player will be the Dragon one time.<br/>The game can be played with many more than 3 persons. To do so, one new player will join the table in each new single game, to substitute the loser of this single play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pyramid (Battlestar Galactica) is a card game based on the 1970s television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. It was depicted as leisure activity for the characters in the television show. Later on, rules and decks of pyramid playing cards were made available commercially to fans of the show. Both are currently out of print.<br/>The game uses a 55 count deck of hexagonal cards separated into three kinds of suits and three ranks as well as a 'capstone' card which is used as a wild card. The game is played very similarly to poker. Players are dealt hands and place bets based on how strong their hand is. There is a discard between bets and players reveal their hands to determine the winner of that round.<br/><br/>Winning hands are determined by a number of factors including suit, rank and matching sets. There are approximately fourteen different hand combinations possible in the game. There is no 'end' to the game, players merely quit at their leisure.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 55 hexagonal cards, which is divided into 3 suits: purple, green and orange. Purple ranks highest and orange ranks lowers. The deck also contains a Capstone (*).<br/><br/>Each suit contains:<br/>- 3 First level cards<br/>- 6 Second level cards<br/>- 9 Third level cards<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Each player is dealt 6 cards. If a player feels a better hand is possible, he may discard up to 4 cards and receive replacements from the dealer. This may only be done once per hand, much the same as &quot;Draw Poker&quot;. Players then construct their best possible pyramid and compare to the other player hands to determine the winner.<br/>Ranks of Hands<br/>A pyramid is made up of at least three cards.<br/><br/>1. First level pyramid consist of 2 third level, and 1 second level card.<br/><br/>2. Second level pyramid consist of 3 third level, and 2 second level card.<br/><br/>3. Third level pyramid consist of 3 third level, 2 second level cards, and 1 first level card.<br/><br/>4. Any of the above may be considered &quot;perfect&quot; when all of the cards used are of the same color. (&quot;Perfect&quot; pyramids rank higher than non-perfect pyramids.)<br/><br/>5. If two or more perfect pyramids are the same level, then the highest suit would win. (NOTE: Only perfect pyramids can be ranked by suit; non-perfect pyramids are considered to have no suit.)<br/><br/>6. If two or more pyramids are still equal, then the persons play another hand to decide the winner.<br/><br/><br/>    ) The Capstone can be used in place of the first level card in a Perfect third level pyramid. This is the highest of ALL PYRAMIDS!<br/><br/><br/><br/>        ) The Capstone may also be used as a wild card to replace any card in any pyramid.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to score points with the dice (10,000 to win) and strategically use the Upset cards to beat your opponent.  Players strategize not only on how and when they play their cards, but also how to get or avoid getting the cards.  However, the special dice contain letters as well as numbers and if someone rolls the word &quot;Upset,&quot; then everyone else, no matter how close they are to winning, must restart from scratch.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.playupset.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.playupset.com/</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "StreetSmart models a rapidly growing city in a developing country.<br/><br/>The players are Capitalists/Politicians/Maffiabosses trying to control as many neighborhoods/slums as possible. Each turn you move one of the city's characters: the Consumer, the Gangster, the Policeman, the Smoker or the Fireman. The characters are moved by simultaneously playing direction cards. Predicting your opponents' moves in order to disrupt their plans is a major part of the game. The game is fast and easy; for a more complex gameplay, there are expansions included in the game:<br/><br/>The Bureaucrat Game adds the Bureaucrat character who creates Addresses and grants Land Titles. The Cholera Game adds an epidemic as well as the Garbageman, Bacterium and Doctor characters. In the Power &amp; Water Game you fight for access to electricity and freshwater for your subjects.<br/><br/>Each expansion can be played in Original Mode, in Chess Mode (no luck factor) or in Political Mode (The players elect a Mayor who then decides who controls which character.)<br/><br/>",

In your turn, you either flip a card or play a card from your hand. If it is different color and different number form the previous one, then it stays there. Otherwise you take all the face-up cards to your hand. The game is over when there is no face-down card in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>There are a lot of games with similar rules. This one is particularly strategic. As there are only 2 colors (black and red), you really want to time when you start decreasing the hand size.

It was originally licensed by the NBA in 2003, ending the next year. The sets were based on real games, court games, and simple street games.<br/><br/>The minifigures in this theme are known for their special design. They have spring loaded legs and specially designed hands so players can shoot, pass and even reverse slam dunk. It took a team of four LEGO designers and six engineers a full year just to develop the arms and hands so that the minifigures could properly hold, and throw a small basketball piece. They also featured more realistic skin tones, being based on real-life NBA players from real teams.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clue and Pachisi together in a tin. It was available through Avon. It is based on the 1996 edition. The quad fold board is slightly smaller than the traditional game, but everything else remains the same. One side of the board is for the game Clue and the other is for the game Parcheesi.<br/><br/>In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file.<br/><br/>In Parcheesi, each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board. The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &quot;home&quot; section. Movement is controlled by dice. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns. Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. The winner is the first player to move all pawns &quot;home&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pet Shop is a Solitaire worker placement game that involves you as the new owner of a brand new pet store selling Dogs and Cats to special clientele!  Your business must earn enough money and keep a high enough reputation by the end of 30 days or the pet shop will close. You have three main departments that are the money makers of the business: Grooming, Veterinarian, and Training.  These three departments can be run by a contractor, a trained contractor &ldquo;specialists&rdquo; or a Professional.  There are two other departments that take in new strays or donated pets and sell them once they&rsquo;ve been through the three main departments: Sales floor and the Kennels.  The last office is the Manager's Office, which is where you must be to hire new contractors or professionals, fire bad employees or send your contractor out for training to become specialist.  The office is where you control the day-to-day operations of the business.<br/><br/>The game board shows a floor plan of the Pet Shop with all the departments and your office.  Inside the three main departments is a space for an employee token and a pet card.  In the office is a space for you and/or your Asst. Manage token.  In the Kennels there is a space for employee tokens and four pet cards.  The Sales floor has a space for employee tokens and four pet cards.  There is another building next to the Pet Shop that has a Temp Agency and an Employee Training office.  This building is used to hire new employees: contractors and Professionals.  The Employee training office takes in your contractors and trains them to be a Specialist as a Veterinarian, Groomer, or Trainer yet they are not as proficient as the true Professionals.  On the outside game border is a sidewalk with 30 spaces that represents a turn track to keep track of the 30 days you're in business.  In the middle of the board is the Reputation track to keep track of your businesses reputation.<br/><br/>The game play is worker placement with a countdown 30 day turn tracker.  You will collect new animals or abandoned strays into your kennels but are limited to three spaces within the kennel to hold the pets, so picking the right animal is critical.  You the owner must decide which department is most important to change the new pet into money making breeds!  Each animal has a large, medium or small breed and only certain departments can be used to help improve the animals for sales.  You only start with a small non Professional staff although you the owner can run any department in the business.  You must decide who to hire, place those new hires in the most needed departments, and decide when to place them in training to help each department improve their operations.  With each animal you sell, you will earn more money to put back into the business to hire more employees, train more staff, to improve the pet quality for the customers.<br/><br/>The customers will have specific needs such as; breed size, quality and number of pets wanted.<br/><br/>Each day you will draw an event card which will show either a new customer walking into the store, a donated pet, a picked up stray, a business problem, or customer issues!<br/><br/>To win the game you must maintain a certain reputation and earn enough money to stay in business for another month, if you don&rsquo;t do this you lose and your business goes OUT-OF-BUSINESS!<br/><br/>",

The other 32 tiles have chess pieces printed on one side and checkers printed on the other.<br/><br/>The namesake custom variant Kamikaze Chess introduces two changes, custom placement of pieces and action spaces:<br/><br/>After setting up the checkerboard, players shuffle their tiles keeping the chess symbol face down (showing the checkers side), then take turns placing their pieces on the white squares (gaps) until the board is full.  Then players flip over all of the chess pieces to reveal the layout and play chess with the usual rules from that position.  It is additionally suggested that one bishop on each side is moved to an adjacent black square at this point.<br/><br/>When players move a piece onto any black square, they flip over the tile and perform the action listed on that other side, which may be helpful or harmful.  Players leave the space with the action side up and do not reactivate the actions.<br/><br/>",

The players take turns placing one of their four pawns on any unoccupied square of any color.<br/><br/>After the set-up phase the pawns move like chess rooks, i. e. any number of squares in a straight line onto an empty square, without capturing or jumping over another pawn. Whoever places his four pawns on the four squares of a single color wins the game.<br/><br/>The title Bl&ouml;ff, a variant German spelling of &quot;Bluff&quot;, refers to the distracting nature of the board - the rules advise keeping your opponent in the dark about your desired winning combination.<br/><br/>FINESSE - rules of the game<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/>The playing board is marked into sixty four squares of sixteen different colors. These are joined by lines to show the directions in which the pieces can move. Four orange or four red pieces are used by each player.<br/><br/>Playing the game:<br/>Red begins by placing one piece on the board on any square. Orange does the same. Each player takes turns to place his men. When the eight pieces are on the board the moves can start. A player may move his piece along any line, in any direction, as far as he wishes to provided no other piece is jumped over.<br/>Each player takes turns to move a piece, and this continues until one player has all four pieces on squares which are all the same color.<br/><br/>Tactics:<br/>It is important to try and prevent your opponent from guessing the color of the squares you are trying to capture. If you are trying for one color and you think your opponent has guessed this, you can change your mind and try to capture another color.<br/><br/><br/>FINESSE - r&egrave;gles du jeu<br/><br/>Joueurs et accessoires:<br/>Une partie r&eacute;unit deux joueurs qui disposent d'un tableau et de quatre pions chacun. La couleur des pions, rouge ou orange, est attribu&eacute;e &agrave; chaque joueur avant le d&eacute;but de la partie.<br/><br/>But du jeu:<br/>Le gagnant sera celui qui parviendra le premier, &agrave; disposer ses quatre pions sur quatre cases de m&ecirc;me couleur.<br/><br/>D&eacute;but et d&eacute;roulement de la partie:<br/>Les pions rouges commencent. A tour de r&ocirc;le chacun place un pion a sa guise sur une case de couleur libre. Lorsque tous les pions sont pos&eacute;s, on les d&eacute;place d'une case a une autre, dans n'importe quelle direction d'une ou plusieurs cases. On ne peut pas sauter un pion (le sien ou celui de l'adversaire), ni prendre plusieurs directions a la fois.<br/><br/>Un dernier conseil:<br/>Dissimulez aussi longtemps que possible la couleur que vous convoitez ! N'h&eacute;sitez pas &agrave; modifier vos plans si vos projets ne peuvent plus &ecirc;tre r&eacute;alis&eacute;s !<br/><br/>",

E.g. playing a number card which creates a row 4+3+1 permits a player to advance all of his cars which would move onto a track tile with value 8. The game has an easy variant (3x3 tableau of number cards &amp; lower values on track tiles) and hard variant (tableau which grows without bound, like Scrabble or Qwirkle &amp; higher values on track tiles).<br/><br/>As soon as some player's car reaches the end of a track, no further movement occurs in that track. The game ends when all tracks are completed, and the winner is determined by summing the progress of each player's cars on all 4 tracks.<br/><br/>",

There are five resources that are farmed by all players throughout the game. Players collectively keep track of plagues which eventually end the game. Aside from the seven resource dice, there are three speculation dice which allow players to increase the amount of dice they roll each turn and to modify the results of their dice. Scoring is done as in Nile the card game where your score is equal to the resource of which you have the least.<br/><br/>One major difference in Nile: the Dice Game from the original card game is the solo option. In a solo game you are challenging an invisible player whose score increases as you go.<br/><br/>Nile: the Dice Game is fast (10 - 20 minutes), easy to learn, easy to setup and put away, and best of all... FREE!! (at least for now).<br/><br/>",

On a turn, someone leads a card, and players must follow suit if possible. For each Beutelschneider (cutpurse) you collect, you must subtract 20 points from your score for the round, which could put you in the red; the Beutelschneider is the highest ranked card in each of the non-trump suits, though, so ideally it will allow you to collect the 10-point gold sacks that rank far above the cards worth 1-4 coins.<br/><br/>Many of the trump cards in Beutelschneider have special powers, and the deck even includes a bunch of violet special cards that can be added to gameplay if desired. To do this, shuffle the deck of special cards separately, then give each player one before dealing out the other cards like normal.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "June 1996 Gamefix issue #8 on the then and still is current<br/>event in Chechyna.  The game has four scenarios which range from the historical, to Chechan first strikes and a larger Russian Civil War.  In addition, a random events chart covers everything from Chechan &quot;terrorism&quot; to Russian anti-war protests and UN ceasefires.<br/><br/>The game ends either in a UN ceasefire, on turn 10 or 15.   Victory is decided on the basis of accumulated political points which are gathered by each side depending on game actions.  In addition, the Russian gains big points for holding Grozny and surrounding towns and oil fields.   The Russian can hardly be denied a military victory.  In other words, the Russian has enough<br/>troops to literally carpet Chechyna, but the political cost of such an approach would lose him the game.<br/><br/>In true Joe Miranda fashion, the political point chart is the heart of the game.  Both players must<br/>consider their strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>The Russians costs political points to have air, air assaults, armor, air supply, airmobile, security, mech, heli, special ops, and propaganda units activated.   <br/>They can be caught OOS and crushed by a Rebel counterattack if the Russians went too far forward from the supply base.  The Rebels, on the other hand, are mostly infantry and militia but have patriots (foreign volunteers).<br/><br/>Random events and random rebel reinforcements (with militia popping up all over the place) made every game different.   Another feature is the various special combat results tables for probe and assault attack, and psych warfare table (conducted by special ops, propaganda and patriot units)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Predicting the imminent collapse of the United States is a journalistic and academic commonplace as old as the republic itself. In fact, the first op-ed pieces on that theme began appearing in newspapers--both within the country itself and elsewhere around the world--before the ink on the first copy of the constitution was even properly dry back in 1787. The genre even had a name: &quot;declinism.&quot;<br/><br/>Similarly, the reasons given for that supposedly inescapable fall have generally always--from the late-18th century to the present--been divided into three categories: ethno-racial conflict, class conflict, or some mixture of the two. America Falling enables two players to simulate the entire first year of a hypothesized near-future civil war--brought on by whatever is your own favorite reason--across all of the lower-48 states.<br/><br/>One player commands the conservative &quot;Red&quot; forces while the other leads the liberal &quot;Blue&quot; forces. The rules also allow for the possibility of local separatist movements erupting independently of those two main factions, including: The Republic of Texas, The Islamic State in America (ISIA), New Jerusalem, Aztlan, La Raza, Aryan Nation, New Afrika, Ecotopia, and The LGBTQ Rainbow Coalition.<br/><br/>Conflict can take place with conventional armaments as well as Weapons of Mass Destruction. Cyberwarfare is a constant.<br/><br/>No two games will set up or play exactly alike. The initial territorial division between the two sides is based on major cities (chosen randomly) rather than on whole states.<br/><br/>Game mechanics recreate the inescapable dilemmas of fratricidal struggle inherent at the start of every civil war. The keynote centers around the fact one military has suddenly become two. That means things previously taken for granted--chain of command, supply, political loyalties, etc.--have become uncertain. Nothing can be depended on; for instance, movement allowances among the same type of units may vary by as much as a factor of 12.<br/><br/>Play moves rapidly back and forth during each turn, one &quot;action&quot; at a time, in any order the players choose: enter reinforcements from off-map areas; regroup previously devastated units; move a friendly force; attempt to subvert an enemy force to defect to your side; launch a conventional, cyber or WMD attack; move your capital or attempt an airpower surge. In the end, victory hinges on the balance between control of key terrain and accumulated demoralization within the factions.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: six two-month turns<br/>Map Scale: 33 miles (54 km) per hex<br/>Unit Scale: brigades, with abstracted air &amp; naval power<br/>Players: one or two, best with two<br/>Playing Time: four to six hours<br/><br/>Part of the &quot;Absent Superpower Series&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game takes place on the famous Orient Express. There are 12 spies on the train as well as the detectives Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. The players take turns moving the detectives and the spies around the train and keeping track of their movements. Every 8 turns (8 hours in the game) they check their notes and determine which spies have been killed. A spy is killed if it is ever a) alone in a compartment or corridor square for 1 or more hours, b) a second spy enters the compartment or corridor square and c) the spy is never in the same compartment or square as one of the detectives afterwards. Since the status of a spy is not determined until turn 8 (or 16 or 24) it is possible to move a spy, which is already &quot;dead&quot;. This spy cannot kill other spies even if it fulfills the conditions above. Since the status of a spy depends entirely on their movement it is important for the players to keep careful notes and to be able to defend their logic to the other players.<br/><br/>",

You are among the few Cardinals he trusts to serve as his successor, but you have to earn it by performing good deeds. To complicate things, the other Cardinals won't go down without a fight; they'll do everything they can to sabotage your every move. Pay them back in kind.<br/><br/>Before each round, each player is dealt 5 cards. Players play a numbered DEED card to begin. Players then take turns playing one card at a time, or passing. Sabotage deeds in play with CROSS cards, or redeem crossed deeds with deeds of higher value. Additional strategies are created with the use of action cards, or the rare and powerful POPE and NOPE.<br/><br/>When all players pass in succession, the round is over and successful deeds are awarded a point. The first to 5 points wins and may don the Papal Mitre.*<br/>*sold separately<br/><br/>The game can be played in teams, as well as free-for-all.

Pick your routes to be the quickest and most efficient.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards in the game. Route cards show a potential cargo delivery route, displaying a PICKUP AIRPORT and a DELIVERY AIRPORT, and also the point value of the route once completed. Action cards can be either GREEN - which benefit the player playing the card and RED - which negatively affect an opponent who receives the card.<br/><br/>Play begins with a number of unclaimed route cards equal to the number of players plus three. These are available to all players.<br/><br/>On their turn, the player does two things. First is the movement phase, where the player rolls the dice and moves their airplane token. Airport spaces must be avoided unless the player intends on &quot;landing&quot; there. Once on an airport space, that player claims an associated route card with that airport as the PICKUP AIRPORT. The goal is now to complete that Route card as quickly as possible by moving on subsequent turns to the DESTINATION AIRPORT indicated on the claimed card. Once the DESTINATION AIRPORT is landed on, the player claims the associated points and now may chase another route to gain more points.<br/><br/>The second part of one's turn is comprised of playing one action card if the payer chooses to. Follow the card (either GREEN or RED) instructions. Then play moves to the next person in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>First player to earn 20 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Their task is to play the role of a wise sorcerer defending the fortress and collect four treasures before the ghost reaches the top of the castle tower.<br/><br/>How to play?<br/>Although you all play on the sorcerer&rsquo;s team, each player makes their own moves each turn. Of course, this does not mean that you cannot consult other players &ndash; many sorcerers are better than one! Each turn starts with drawing three cards in a pile and putting them in a row. The youngest sorcerer on the team starts their turn and then performs the moves indicated by the cards in order (left to right). After the moves are completed, the used cards are put aside and the next three cards are drawn and put in a row by the next player. You can also play alone and go on a creative and exciting adventure when there are no other board game lovers nearby!<br/><br/>You can draw:<br/><br/>     arrow cards: move the sorcerer to an adjacent field on the board, in the direction indicated by the arrow. NOTE: in each turn, you can rotate up to two of these cards by 90&deg; in any direction, or you can leave them as they were lined up;<br/>     loop cards: repeat the movements indicated by the cards to the left of this card twice, one by one, if this card is placed first from the left, it remains inactive;<br/>     sorcerer cards: move to any of adjacent fields on the left, right, above or below;<br/>     ghost cards: move the ghost token one field up.<br/><br/><br/>There are special fields on the board, which may make it easier (or more difficult) for you to collect treasures:<br/><br/>     if you enter a teleportation gate field, you can magically move the sorcerer to any other gate field;<br/>     if you enter or pass through a field with a sorcerer&rsquo;s wand, you <br/><br/><br/> can move the ghost token one field down;<br/><br/>     you cannot stop or pass through the ghost fields; turn the arrows to walk around them.<br/><br/><br/>When you enter the treasure field, put it in one of the boxes at the top of the board. If you use all the cards before the end of the game, shuffle them carefully and stack them again (since there are 35 cards, only two cards are dealt in the last turn). If the sequence you draw makes movement impossible (for example: even after turning the cards you hit a ghost field or you can&rsquo;t walk because of the end of the route), you move the ghost token one field up. You will win if you collect all the treasures before the ghost moves to the last field of its route and leaves the castle tower.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are 18 Planet cards, 15 Multiplier cards and 24 Value cards. Players start the game with six Value cards (values one to six) which they use to bid on the other cards. Each turn, three cards are auctioned. Each player can bid a number of face-down Value cards. It is allowed to make two or three seperate bids. After everyone has bid, the bids are turned face-up, and the three highest bidders receive a card, with the highest bidder choosing first. The winner can keep the card, or, if it is a negative one, give it to an opponent.<br/><br/>The Planets and Multipliers may be placed alone, but they may also be added to a single card that is already in play to create a scoring Multiplier-Planet pair. Planets have a value from -3 to 3, Multipliers are x0, x1 or x2, with a pair scoring the Value of the planet times the value of the Multiplier.<br/><br/>After the cards have been auctioned off, all bids are passed to the left, so each player gains those Value cards bid by their right-hand opponent.<br/><br/>The auctions continue until all but three cards have been auctioned. Now, each player's final score is calculated. The pairs are separated by Planet colour (red, green or yellow). For each colour, the player scores a number of points equal to the number of pairs of that colour times the total score of the pairs of that colour. The scores for the separate colours are added. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There are two circular paths around the airstrip: the Holding Pattern and the Landing Pattern.  Players take turns to roll a die to move their planes on the board.  The planes must first enter the Holding Pattern, then the Landing Pattern before they can land on the airstrip; players slide down the planes on their stands as they do so.<br/><br/>Each space on the board contains instructions that must be followed.  Emergency and Special Clearance cards are drawn when planes land on their space, and their effects (beneficial and detrimental) must be executed.  Planes can only enter the Landing Pattern through the effects of certain Special Clearance cards.  To land on the airstrip, planes must land exactly on the Final Approach spaces on the Landing Pattern.  Players then need to roll on their next turn to determine if their planes can taxi to and park at their designated gates.<br/><br/>The first player to park all his or her planes is the winner.  The game ends when the third player has parked his or her planes, effectively establishing the rest of the positions.<br/><br/>",

The only components required are 3standard six-sided dice and a small bowl in which to roll them.<br/><br/>Players take turns making wagers, then rolling the dice to try to outscore each other.

Like poker, the goal is to have the highest-ranked hand after several rounds of wagering, although the exact rules differed among numerous regional variants (this too, is much like poker). The game is played with a standard deck, with the 8's, 9's, and 10's removed.<br/><br/>From lowest to highest, the four-card Primero hands are as follows:<br/>- Numerus: Two or three cards of any suit. Only the cards from the strongest suit are scored.<br/>- Primero: One card from each suit.<br/>- Supremus: Ace, 6, 7, of one suit (this is the highest-scoring Numerus, but counts as a superior hand).<br/>- Fluxus: Four cards all of the same suit.<br/>- Chorus: Four of a kind.<br/><br/>Some variations exclude the Supremus or Chorus. Ties are resolved by the total value of the scored cards in the hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Centrifuge is a trick-taking game for 2 to 4 players, and was originally developed for the Decktet.  Centrifuge makes unusual use of the dual-suitedness of the Decktet cards (Each card valued 2-9 has an &quot;upper&quot; and a &quot;lower&quot; suit depicted on it.), in that the led card's upper suit will be positive, and its lower suit will be negative.  Subsequent cards may follow either suit, but those with the positive suit will be positive; those in the negative, negative.  Cards sporting both suits (such as the card that was led) cancel themselves, due to having both the positive and negative suit.<br/><br/>If the total value of the cards in the trick is positive, then the highest card wins the trick - even if it's an off-suit card.  If the total value of the cards in the trick is negative, then the lowest card wins the trick - even if it's an off-suit card.  The ability of an off-suit card to win is the equivalent of a trump mechanism in Centrifuge.  Another unusual feature is that it's possible for no one to win the trick.<br/><br/>Each player is playing to collect symbols of her own secret suit, indicated by an ace she was dealt at the beginning of the hand.<br/><br/>The game also supports partnership play (additionally offering a Cancellation variant).  The two-player game also offers a Playing for Both Teams variant.<br/><br/>",

Once each player has a hand, four rounds of trick taking are held, where the card with the highest power wins the trick and gets the round's stone (drawn at random from the pool prior to the drafting). However, each card also has a special power, and the most powerful cards require the player to either pay up coins or having played card of specified colours in earlier rounds.<br/><br/>Once one or more players has 5 stones, the game ends, and points are calculated. Only stones are worth points, the more of the same colour you have, the more points. Most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players may choose from the CCGer, the RPGer, the Eurogamer, the Wargamer or the 18XX-er<br/><br/>To Win: Survive one-on-one combat until only one player is left.<br/><br/>Setup: Each player chooses 1 Gamer Gladiator card and places it in front of them and then places a red wooden cube next to the (10) on the Health (HP) Track, located on the left-hand side of the card. Track a gladiator&rsquo;s health up and down this track. If it ever reaches 0 that gladiator is out of the game. Place the six dice in reach of all players.<br/><br/>Play: 2 players each secretly roll three dice, hiding them from view. Two dice are the Attack dice and the total of both dice is the player&rsquo;s attack strength for this turn. The other is the Special Ability die can be used for a special ability on the Gamer Gladiator card based on the number on the die face (players do not have to use a special ability if they choose not to. In this case set the Special Ability die aside). Players place these dice at the top of their Gamer Gladiator cards in the spaces indicated. Both players then reveal their dice at the same time. Any special abilities chosen are used (if special abilities conflict, players flip a coin for the ability that will happen first), and the player with the higher attack strength wins. The other player reduces their health (HP) by 2 (ex. Bob&rsquo;s attack strength=10, Kylie&rsquo;s attack strength=8, Kylie takes 2HP of damage). In the case of a tie, both players lose 1HP.  If a player rolls their Signature Move with their attack dice, after any special abilities have modified the dice values, they will gain 1HP.<br/><br/>Play continues in a series of rounds until only one player with health remains. They are then declared &ldquo;Top Gamer&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Note: For a 3 player game: the youngest player will be the first round&rsquo;s starting player and will choose an opponent. In other rounds, the player who lost last in a round chooses which players will fight in the next round.<br/><br/>This is the 3rd in a series of Annual Games Unlimited Holiday Games (2013) and is the followup to Gameshop Express (2011) and Gameshop Workday (2012)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "30 Seconds to Live is a light-medium 1-2-player competitive zombie card game. Zombies broke thru the defenses into the warehouse encampment and the Lone Survivor escaped out the backdoor into the alley. They barricaded the door but it won't hold long. They must escape the alley to the street where a pickup is waiting, fighting through the hordes of zombies. If the zombies reduce the Survivor to zero health, the zombies win the game. The confined game space and a limit of only 30 seconds to complete their turn make the game tense and fast-paced, so every turn feels like the last 5 minutes of a season finale of The Walking Dead.<br/><br/>The game is different from most zombie games in several ways. Most zombie games are expensive, take all night to play, have tons of miniatures, require a whole bunch of friends to play and you all are good guy Survivors. This game is the opposite. It's inexpensive, uses only cards and counters, and can be played solo or with two people in 20-40m. Best of all, one of the players gets to be the zombies! If you're tired of being the hero, this is the game for you! Players need to complete their turn in 30 seconds or forfeit the rest of their planned actions. This is tracked using a companion app downloaded from the 30 Seconds To Live website, or with the included sand timer. This forces players to think and act quickly. Nobody likes it when a player takes ten minutes to decide what they want to do on their turn. Do you think zombies are going to wait for you to decide whether to move, draw a card, or attack? They will just attack! Finally, health and ammo are tracked using a simple mechanism that eliminates the need for dice and other counters and makes for faster and simpler gameplay. The game includes male and female versions of eight unique player characters, eight types of zombies, and 19 different weapons.  The game has great replayability due to the numerous ways the game can be played and the different strategies that can be employed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is part of Excalibre&rsquo;s PANZER BATTLES AND SIEGE SERIES (PBSS). The games in this series features a common four (4) page series rulebook and generally a four (4) page game specific rulebook, of which one page is the cover. The games of this series feature simple rules that are a quick study and low counter density. Most games feature step reduction and have substitute counters included in the counter mix.<br/><br/>CAEN 1944 features an 11x17 map and 100 counters. The units are divisions with some brigade/regiments. Several units have step reduction.<br/><br/>From the rules introduction:<br/>After the Allied landings in Normandy in 1944, the main concern of Eisenhower was to expand the bridgehead and bring in supplies and new units. Ike thought Montgomery should have made more rapid progress in his attacks on Caen. One thing slowing down the British and Canadians was the preponderant numbers of SS and regular Panzer divisions facing the British along the Caen position.<br/><br/>Turning slow progress into a partial tactical victory, Montgomery held down this large German armoured strength while the Americans broke out on the other flank and cut off a large number of German troops in what became known as the &lsquo;Falaise Pocket.&rsquo; In this game the Allied objective is to accomplish what Montgomery did only much sooner. The Axis objective is to stop the Allies in their tracks and destroy Montgomery's army group.<br/><br/>From the design notes:<br/>Caen is truly siege warfare with Panzer and armoured divisions leading the siege. The massive number of German Panzer and SS divisions employed at Caen were able to stop Monty cold for weeks.<br/><br/>This game uses a very complex sequence of play to bring in all the elements of the campaign.<br/><br/>In general, the SS was usually better equipped and stronger than a comparable Whermacht(sic) unit. Some SS units in this game are weaker than one would expect, this was due to the immense difficulty in reaching the front intact and because of Allied air harassment or they were being rebuilt when thrown into the campaign.<br/><br/>Caen helped the Allies tie the Germans down, but it would have been an even bigger victory for them if Monty had reached Falaise sooner. Now it's your turn to try or try to stop him. <br/><br/>By today&rsquo;s games standards the complex sequence of play referred to in the design notes is a very relaxing stroll in the park.<br/><br/>Other games in the PBSS include: Caen 1944, Crimea 1941, Sidi Rezegh 1941, Cassino 1944, Ancient Conquest, Atlantis 12,500 B.C., Crete 1941, Edgehill 1642, and Tunisia 1943.<br/><br/>",

This one will remind you a bit of Snake, except there are no apples to eat in order to grow longer. What you are trying to do is cover the front or the back of the opponents&rsquo; snake, moving your back-most card to the front time and again until you win or you lose. The target is determined by a coin flip, and if you land on the coin or collide into the wrong part of a snake, you lose. This is sure to be a chaotic sort of fun that comes with very few cards and only a single coin as a component (well, apart from the table&hellip;)<br/><br/><br/>This is a reimplementation of 2018 9-card game Adder: Realtime Chase System, with more cards (18) that gets the game to 4 players and some new rules.<br/><br/>Released in the February 2021 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.<br/><br/>",

Pieces can be stacked up to 3 levels high. There are white, black and gray pieces scattered along the track.<br/><br/>Each piece's move is the piece's position (behind all players' pieces and stacks of pieces), times the piece position in a stack (1, 2 or 3). If it is on a white or black piece there as additional multiplier of x2 or x3. So one can complete the race in two giant moves if you are clever and lucky. Pieces must move between 1 and the full value available. Pieces that bolt way out in front tend to hang out there a while. Pieces that hang back can often make the biggest moves. Also if someone is on top of a piece it isn't moved, but every exposed piece must be moved every turn, so things don't usually stay blocked long.<br/><br/>There are 3 gray pieces that are worth 1, 2 and 3 VPs each and go to the first player to land on each. Otherwise there are 12 spots worth 12, 11, 10, etc VPS so you count the total of all the pieces VPs and add gray piece VPs to get a winner.<br/><br/>",

To score a goal you simply have to win a Midfield play, then successfully Attack their Defence and finally get a Strike past their Goalkeeper. Play returns to Midfield when any Attack fails or a goal is scored and the match continues. It only takes 3 cards to score so you never safe till the very end of the match when all the cards are used up.<br/><br/>The 5-a-side version of the rules is simple enough for younger players and the full tactical 11-a-side game brings a more tactical and varied gaming experience for the more competitive gamers amongst us.<br/><br/>The playing box allows KIX to be played on the go, i.e. In the car, on the bus in all those places not many good games can reach.<br/><br/>...oh, and it's totally gender equal sporting girls and boys teams!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "シュレディンガー勇者 (Schr&ouml;dinger Hero) is a partnership game from Japan published in Japanese with English rules.<br/><br/>Players belong to either the Hero's side or Satan's side, and their objective is to defeat the leader of the opposite side. However, no player knows any player's identity, including themselves, and their identities often change.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt one identity card: Hero, Satan, Hero's friend, or Satan's servant. During your turn, you can gain a clue by looking at another player's card or by exchanging your card with other player's. When a player looks at another player's card, that player's comment or expression can also be a clue.<br/><br/>Only the Hero can defeat Satan, so even if you know who Satan is, you cannot defeat Satan until you have the Hero card, and vice versa. Unlike Werewolf, this game doesn't require a moderator, and players aren't eliminated during the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>プレイヤーは勇者陣営か魔王陣営に所属し、勇者陣営は魔王を倒すことを、魔王陣営は勇者を倒すことを目的としています。しかし、最初は誰も自分の正体を知りません。プレイヤーは自分の手番に、他人の正体を見る、もしくは他人と正体を入れ替える事が出来るため、それらの行動を活用し自分と周囲の正体を把握していきます。正体を見た際の表情や言動もヒントになることでしょう。<br/>夜の襲撃フェイズや人狼同士の顔合わせもないため、ゲームマスターが不要ですぐに遊ぶことが出来ます。プレイヤーの途中脱落もありません。<br/><br/>",

The first player to reach 15 on their turn or the last player standing, wins the round.

You can try and trick the others by resting on the journey, but if this means that trek fails, you must pass out your highest cards to the others. Then at the temples, players use their cards to beat each other to the treasures.<br/><br/>The 64 card deck uses authentic b&amp;w illustrations from contemporary explorations of the nineteenth century, which lend the game a strong theme. The cards have simple German text. The cardstock is laminated but flimsy, and while the production is good for a first release, gamers may expect better. However, the price at Essen 2005 was only &euro;4 which was fair. German rules only in the box.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player reveals the top card from his deck and (in most cases) says either &quot;Color!&quot; or &quot;Word!&quot;, asking for opponents to yell out either the color of the text or the word printed on the card. If the first opponent to answer yells out correctly, she keeps this card (and any cards already on the table) and places it in her score pile; if the first player is wrong, the current card stays in the center of the table and the wrong player places one previously scored card in the center, too.<br/><br/>Some cards have special functions, such as allowing the player who wins the card to peek at the top card of an opponent's deck. Other cards are multipliers and they double the points scored for cards claimed previously; to track this, you must keep cards in order as you claim them. Still other cards are &quot;Mystery&quot; cards, and the player who reveals a Mystery card should immediately ask any question at all, the more bizarre the better. The first opponent who offers any kind of coherent answer wins that card and any others on the table.<br/><br/>As soon as a player runs out of her stack of cards, the game ends and everyone tallies their points (mostly positive but sometimes negative), summing points from bottom to top and remembering to multiply cards accordingly. Whoever ends up with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Varna took place on 10 November 1444 near Varna in eastern Bulgaria. The Ottoman Army under Sultan Murad II defeated the Hungarian and Polish armies commanded by Władysław III of Poland (also King of Hungary) and John Hunyadi. It was the final battle of the Crusade of Varna.<br/><br/>This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missle range). Example:<br/><br/>1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)<br/>2. Cavalry of player A attacks<br/>3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)<br/>4. Infantry of player A attacks<br/>5. Player B moves cavalry etc.<br/><br/>Movement is determined by terrain and unit type. Battles are determined by comparing unit strength, which is modified by various factors (armor, charge, terrain, leaders etc.), and dice roll. Interesting elements of game mechanics include: fatigue of units, morale and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).<br/><br/>",

Of course, it's not as simple as it sounds. Your opponent will be trying to block you all the way! There are three different levels of game, Standard for the very young, Advanced and Tournament. The game grows increasingly complex as new pieces with special properties are added at the Advanced and Tournament levels.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/>The quality is superb. Each game includes 106 pieces, a velvet bag, a game board, a book of rules, 4 racks, a score book and a timer. The board is strong, the playing pieces and racks are chunky and solid, and the velvet bag lined in satin is quite special. The Q game is designed to be used again and again and to last for many years.<br/><br/>WHAT'S IT LIKE TO PLAY THE Q GAME?<br/>It's Fun! Addictive! Competitive! Sociable! The Q game requires strategy, logic, cunning and a little luck. It's easy to learn and you won't need a dictionary or a degree to play it. Every game is different and presents a new set of challenges. The more you play the more expert you become and the more challenging the game becomes.<br/><br/>",

On his turn a player rolls the dice and moves the playing Pirate Captain piece 1, 2 or 3 spaces round the board in accordance with the dice roll. If the Captain stops in front of an island on which there is at least one occupied space, the player places one of his pirates on one of the free squares. If he loses a pirate, the player may then decide to roll again, or if he prefers, to stop. If the Captain stops in front of an island on which there is no unoccupied space then the player takes all the pirates off that island and adds them to his &quot;crew&quot;. His turn then ends. The game is over when a player loses his last pirate. The player with the most pirates in his crew wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the box: &quot;It takes super sailin' to reach the pirate treasure before you're blasted out of the water!&quot;<br/><br/>Players spin the cutlass and move their ships round the board on their way to the treasure chest. If the spinning cutlass lands on 'Blast', the spinning player gets to attempt to 'blast' an opponent's ship by placing an air pump into one of the two openings adjacent to the move space...and slamming it! The result? Roughly one-in-three chance the opponent's ship will be blasted into the air!!! (and forced back three spaces)<br/><br/>Careful, if your ship is on the same move space, you can blast your own ship!<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to make it around the board and pass the treasure chest. The treasure chest is placed in a new location each game, so players can't memorize the pattern of safe spaces.<br/><br/>Similar in 'pump' mechanics to BattleBoard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jak and Poi is a two-player card game based on the hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors.<br/><br/>Everybody knows that Rock beats Scissors which beats Paper which then beats Rock. But when we were kids, we all tried to go around this rule by inventing our own hand symbols like Lightning, Bomb or Tank. Jak and Poi builds on this &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; concept and the result is an accessible one-card-per-turn game that has surprising depth and strategy.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent&rsquo;s 20 life points to zero. To do this, each player uses the 2 main card types in the game: Jaks and Pois. The main mechanic of the game revolves around how these two card types interact with each other. Since Jaks (representing Rock, Paper, Scissors) can counter against or synergize with Pois (representing your lighting, bomb, tank, etc.) correctly anticipating your opponent&rsquo;s moves or leading your opponent to play in your favor is key to victory.<br/><br/>While unique, the gameplay of Jak and Poi is only half the reason the game is so special. Leveraging on the fact that every one of us, at some point in our childhood, invented our own hand symbols to try and win at Rock, Paper, Scissors, we crowdsourced the creation of all the cards in the game from players and artists who wanted to let their imaginations run wild.<br/><br/>The two decks in Jak and Poi&rsquo;s first release are the result of the efforts of 40+ designers and 20+ artists. This collaboration between passionate creators is no doubt the heart and driving force of the game.<br/><br/>",

The clones help do the dangerous labor but the tension between the human and clone populations is only rising.  There is also something unsettling about their eyes. The engineers ensure me that their eyes only hold data but when I look into them, I can&rsquo;t help but see something more sinister&hellip;.&rdquo;  End Log<br/><br/>In Iris, players will work together to manage human populations and rebellious clone work forces while settling four newly discovered planets.  Players have the goal of minimizing clone attacks and maximizing human survival rates.  The game has major puzzle and memory mechanics that forces players to rely on one another for both game play decisions and remembering details. Iris takes the tension, collaboration, and challenge of larger cooperative games and puts them into an elegant 20 minute micro game.<br/><br/>In Iris players attempt to organize 16 clone cards in a manner that does not cause the clones to attack human populations. The game has simple rules that are easy to learn yet make for a complex and difficult game.  There are three types of clone cards and each type of clone card has a common front. Each clone has a letter on the back of the card that stays hidden until the clones &quot;Data&quot; is scanned.  When a clone is scanned this letter is revealed to all players.  Players try to organize these clone cards in a way so that at the end of the game the letters on the backs of the cards cannot spell the words &quot;BOMB&quot;, &quot;MOB, or &quot;AMMO&quot;.  Because the only letters on the backs of the clone cards are A, B, M, and O this can be very challenging.  Players come across the clone data slowly so there will always be information unknown to players.  Players will weigh the odds of playing one clone over another (letter distributions are published on each card) while also risking gaining less knowledge about clones in order to take special actions like moving clones, moving human populations, or learning about un-played clones.  The whole game leads up a big reveal.  When all 16 clone cards are in their final locations they are all turned over and players see if any attacks occur.  When attacks occur, human populations are lost.  When all attacks have been accounted for players compare their remaining human population to their survival goal set at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ultimate Baseball The Game is a strategy baseball board game for two gamers (teams).  Each gamer drafts and manages his/her team, including managing lineups, roster decisions, and ongoing game play.  Play is simulated pitch-by-pitch using an order of play and often involving simultaneous decision-making (i.e., gamers secretly makes choices simultaneously which then are made &quot;public&quot; and enacted on the game board).  Each virtual player that comes in the game box (240 all-time stars) as well as those included in the Ultimate Baseball The Game Player Register (over 4,000 players) are based on top picks from across the annals of American major league baseball, and are rated and ranked based on lifetime composite career stats.  Each rating (pitching, hitting, running, fielding, etc.) is based on meticulous research and heavily influences game outcomes.  These ratings, along with simultaneous pitch-by-pitch simulation and highly detailed charts and tables, afford gamers a wide spectrum of strategic options at nearly every turn.<br/><br/>The Ultimate Baseball The Game game box includes a basic version for youngsters and beginners which takes around an hour.  Also included is the fully advanced and highly realistic game, which takes about as long as a real-life baseball game.<br/><br/>Ultimate Baseball The Game is for gamers age 11 and up.<br/><br/>",

(The pieces are top notch plastic-mold moles &amp; a bright red dog.) Each turn you roll the dice, which tell you which mole hole you can next move to... and which size mole you must move. Now, you can move ANYONE's mole, since the only way to tell them apart is to pick them up and look at the bottom. (Something you get to do each time you move a piece...) Objective: get your three moles home first. (The dog is moved when rolled and can freeze a mole in position... but only one mole at a time.)<br/><br/>Intended as a family game, playable by children Ages 6 and up as well as adults.<br/><br/>",

There are small orders, which are relatively easy to fill but yield only small profit, and big orders, for which a great deal of work must be done. Big jobs also bring big profits, however. The prize that our team receives for a successfully completed job is dependent on the number of tasks. However, the number of machines is limited and the competition among the teams is rough. No methods are shunned in the constant effort to keep away opposing workers or hinder their performance, not even bribery or sabotage. The only thing that matters at the end of the game is which team has the most money.&quot;<br/>-From English rulebook<br/><br/>",

This unique racing board game offers cool components in a slick and compact board game design that captures the fast-action feel and strategy of small-town stock car racing in an exciting new way!<br/><br/>The game abandons the traditional oval-track-on-a-board approach in favor of a mechanic that emphasizes strategy and maneuver relative to the other cars on the track. Strategy cards held by the drivers put race tactics and skillful play in control of the result instead of just rolls of the dice.<br/><br/>Any good ol' boy can put the hammer down, but maneuvering through the pack, watching your tire wear and fuel consumption and knowing the limits of your machine are tricks only the best drivers can hope to master. When Stock Car Saturday Night is over, will you be up on Victory Lane making a hot date with the Performance Princess, or down in the garage gettin' greasy under a broken stock car?<br/><br/>The game includes printable PDF files for full-color counters, a two-section mapboard, turn and lap markers, and 160 strategy cards as well as a simple three-page rulesheet. Also included is a unique cardstock construct in the MicroTactix tradition -- a paperback-sized full-color slipcase storage box you print and assemble to hold all the game components, allowing you to display and transport your game after it is printed.<br/><br/>Web Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.microtactix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.microtactix.com/</a><br/><br/>",

Powerful undead such as vampires and ghouls command legions of flesh-hungry zombies in chilling, inhuman war bands. Small pockets of resistance remain as humans wage a desperate battle for survival in a world where the waters have turned to blood and the sky is night everlasting.<br/><br/>Final Days is a complete boxed miniatures combat game where players command human freedom fighters or undead hordes in Earth's final battle! The combat system uses standard playing cards to determine the outcome of actions, and takes just minutes to learn. Play seamlessly with just two players or a group of eight or more! Everything you need to set up and play this fast-paced, hard-action game is included, and you can be up and  running in no time. This boxed set includes Twenty-Five 25mm metal figures (8 different brand-new sculpts) to recreate your intense tabletop battles.<br/><br/>So grab your shotgun and bar the doors. The dead are coming and nobody is there to rescue you.<br/><br/>Final Days is a skirmish-level miniatures game that uses a standard deck of playing cards, with jokers, as its randomizer.  Each figure has three attributes that determine how many cards it draws during combat, as well as determining how much damage the figure can take.  As a figure takes damage, his combat effectiveness decreases.  The game can be played with any number of players, and lasts on average 1 to 2 hours.<br/><br/>Box Contents<br/><br/>Rulebook<br/>Scenario and Accessory Book<br/>2 Double-sided B&amp;W maps<br/>Templates of burned-out cars, desks, dumpsters<br/>2 Combat Trackers<br/>Equipment counters<br/>25 white metal miniatures:<br/>Demon<br/>Vampire<br/>2 Ghouls<br/>13 zombies<br/>6 survivors<br/>2 dogs<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Chick Game&reg; is a unique conversation game that encourages women to reminisce about lost loves, analyze the complex relationships in their families, discuss the ups and downs of their friendships, reveal their quirks, and dish the dirt. Unlike other &quot;sharing&quot; games, there IS a winner in The Chick Game&reg;&mdash;it's the chick who reveals the most about herself, through a combination of choice and chance, during the course of the game. The Chick Game&reg; rewards you for spilling all the intimate details of your life. But the game also gives you options to &quot;play it safe&quot; and answer less revealing questions if you'd rather keep some things to yourself. The Chick Game&reg; is a great gift for women, and is perfect for birthdays, bridal showers, bachelorette parties, bridesmaids gifts, girls night out, girls night in, girls weekends, reunions, road trips, dorm rooms, and hostess gifts. The Chick Game&reg; is &quot;girls night out&quot; in a box.

Players have a hand of nine cards, draw a tenth, and then play one of their cards either on their movement pile, their pyramid, or an opponent's movement pile.<br/><br/>There are three types of cards, movement cards, pyramid cards, and a few special cards. The movement cards show one or more diagonal directions on the pyramid the player's Q*bert may travel on future turns.  Once a movement direction has been chosen on a previous turn, players may add cards to build a pyramid one card per turn. Players may also play movement cards on their opponent's movement pile to send that player's Q*bert in a less productive direction, or waste another turn to change direction again.  There are also special cards which stop your opponents movement, or put Coily, Q*bert's purple snake nemesis, around an opponent's pyramid.  There are also helpful cards that either move a Q*bert to the top of the pyramid, or to allow free movement on the pyramid.<br/><br/>The finished pyramid is made of staggered horizontal cards.<br/><br/>Players play movement cards to change their direction on the pyramid until one player finishes the completed layout, and scores 100 extra points.  All players total their points on their pyramid and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Anagramania is an anagram-based board game for 2 to 6 players. Unlike typical anagram word puzzles, the clues in Anagramania are not just the word or words from which the answer is derived. Instead, Anagramania clues actually provide a hint or definition of the correct solution. Here's an example:<br/><br/>&quot;Sam rang a friend to find out why the letters he wrote were so confused!&quot;<br/><br/>The object is to re-arrange all the letters of the keywords (&quot;Sam rang a&quot;) - which are shown in bold italics on the actual clue cards - to form a single word that solves the clue. The answer is of course &quot;anagrams&quot;.<br/> For each game, every player has an 11&quot; x 4&quot; 'throw away' clue sheet containing twenty clues like the one above. There are 24 sets of six clue sheets in each game pack. That's enough for six players to play 24 separate games.<br/><br/>During game play, players conceal their clue sheets in special 'pockets' that allow them to see only one new clue at a time. In most board games players have to await their turn, which can be quite irritating if each player requires several minutes for his or her turn. That's not the case in Anagramania. In each turn, all players compete simultaneously to solve the same clue. No time limit is set at the start of the turn, but once any one player claims to have the answer (and has written it down) other players have just one minute more to complete their efforts to find the answer (timed by a sand timer).<br/> By solving clues, players move pawns on a 14&quot; x 14&quot; play board. A correct answer earns forward progress - two squares for the first person who answered, one square for others. For a wrong answer, the player moves his/her pawn back a square; and for no answer, the pawn is left in its current position. The winner is the first player to reach the center circle on the board, with a typical game lasting about 45 minutes. The simultaneous method of play makes the game very exciting, and leaves no time for any player to get bored!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is based on the energy levels within an atom, and it is played on a board representing the Periodic Table of the Elements.  The squares making up the orbits are numbered according to the atomic numbers of the elements from Hydrogen (1) to radon (86).<br/><br/>The number of counters a player has depends on the number of players.  Two players have eight counters each, three players have six counters each, and four players have four counters each.<br/><br/>Players take turns to roll both dice.  The scores obtained on the dice may be used as a total, or as individual dice scores, to move the player's pieces to their best advantage.  For each six thrown, the player may move one piece into play, and roll that dice again.  The player does not have to move a piece into play unless he or she has no pieces in play already.<br/><br/>The players move their pieces along the track until they complete a circuit and land directly on a jump square.  When a piece lands on a jump square it is elevated to the next highest quantum level.  When a piece moves up a level, the controlling player gets an extra roll of one dice.<br/><br/>If a player's piece lands on the same square as an opponent's piece, Blatting occurs.  The piece that is Blatted moves down one energy level whilst the piece doing the Blatting moves up a level.  If a player's piece passes an opponents piece, Zapping occurs.  The piece that is Zapped moves down one energy level, but the piece that Zapped it does not move up.  A piece that is Zapped can Blat any piece that it lands on.  Thus both Blatting and Zapping are subject to chain-reaction.<br/><br/>To win the game a Quantum Jump must be achieved.  This is done by having a piece positioned on the yellow flash square, situated in the fourth energy band, at the same time as there are exactly half the total available number of player-counters in play.<br/><br/>",

This was the time when naval architecture and warfare underwent fundamental changes. No longer the majestic lines of the &ldquo;wooden walls&rdquo;, now the three-decker with smoke belching from funnels looking out of place between the masks, the awkward shapes of the American Civil War vessels and finally the multitude of one off designs which prevailed until the start of the Pre-Dreadnought era. Tactics were dictated by the great variety of vessels and weapons available, (an homogeneous fleet being unknown) and sometimes by the restricted sea-space available. I have tried to reflect these problems and changes in this set of rules.<br/><br/>In order to play the game, players will require the following equipment:<br/>Metric rule    <br/>Angle indicator    <br/>Cotton wool.<br/>Turning circle (see Appendix)    <br/>Protractor    <br/>Damage Control Chart for each vessel<br/>A pair of decimal dice When used as a pair 00 shall represent 100. when used individually zero shall represent 10. Models with removable masts for sailing vessels. Details of armor, armament, speed, dimensions (free board, length, breadth and draught), whether single or twin screwed for each vessel being used. Position of the vessels&rsquo; engines should be known as they are not always below water - if unknown assume them to be below water.<br/><br/>",

It's the Stock Market in a time warp!<br/><br/>You start with 100K ($100,000) and your goal is to be the first to reach $1 million. You do this by playing the Stock Market one card at a time. Each game card takes you back to January 1st of a random year in time, where two companies are pitted against each other in a head - to - head match-up.<br/><br/>These are real companies, with real ratings and real data from the year listed. You must pick one the companies and follow your investment through the year, stopping each quarter to assess whether you want to sell your stock, or hold to the next quarter. The Fourth quarter marks the end of the year, and the end of your turn.<br/><br/>On your next turn, travel to a new destination in time by picking another card and playing that year through.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mrbigshot.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.mrbigshot.com</a><br/><br/>",

For example, the letter &quot;C&quot; could become &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Could&quot; or any word that you choose beginning with the letter &quot;C&quot;.<br/><br/>So, if you were dealt a hand consisting of the letters:  M,F,G,A,B,P, you could create the sentence: &quot;Freddy's Billy Goat Ate Pancakes Monday&quot;...or &quot;Get Powder Because My Foot Aches!&quot;.  You can arrange the cards in any order to create your sentence.  But you are under a time limit and the time depends on how many cards you are dealt (anywhere from 5-7 depending on the roll of the die).  There is also an action card that you must draw before turning over your cards.  The action cards give you an instruction for completing your sentence, such as &quot;Your sentence must be in the form of a question&quot; or &quot;Do not use a proper name&quot;.<br/><br/>Points are at the bottom of every card.  You accumulate points by creating an acceptable sentence within the time limit.  You can also wager points by stealing when an opponent misses a sentence.<br/><br/>The fun of the game is coming up with well thought-out sentences and hearing the silly sentences that people try to get away with (and of course, winning).  It's perfect to play a one on one session or in a large group at a party.<br/><br/>Sentence Says is brand new game and is available at select specialty retail outlets or online at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.sentencesays.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.sentencesays.com</a><br/><br/>",

The regimental unit identifies, battle strengths, and battle terrain were researched in detail in order to provide as much realism as possible, and give the players the feeling of having been involved in that part of history known as the American Revolution. The rules of play and the condition of victory have been designed to reproduce the actual conditions under which the battle was fought.<br/><br/>When playing the game, remember that &quot;winning&quot; is a relative term. It is sometimes more enjoyable to play as the commander of the &quot;weaker&quot; army, and see if you can produce a better result than the actual commander did. In the BATTLE OF CAMDEN, S.C. game, the winner can be decided on this basis. The player who performs better than his historical counterpart gains a measure of victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On February 23rd, the Ethiopian military conducted a massive assault upon the Eritrean Gemehalo fortress. Over 10,000 would attack, many would die. <br/>The WW1 style battle was fought with many very modern weapons. The vaunted defenses of Eritrea in the Badme area had been immune to enemy attacks for years. The fall of Gemehalo would spell doom to the Eritrean defense system. The question was, would it collapse? The game comes with a 11x17&quot;map, 280 counters and rules in which morale levels will create success or failure. Game scale is nine hourly turns, company level. This was the key battle in the war and would define the war's outcome in the weeks that would follow. One side would break and run but which one?<br/><br/>",

The final three faces of the die are not numbers but symbols that give the die special movement abilities, such as the ability to jump over another die.

The player taking his turn chooses what club (and then what die) he wants to use. He moves his marker according to the result of the die throw in direction of the hole, and so on until the piece lands on the hole square. He can move it vertically on the fairway, and horizontally or vertically on the green. He notes the number of strokes he used and the next player takes his turn. When everyone has played the hole, everbody starts the next hole, and so on until 18 holes are played (the 9 hole twice).<br/>If the piece lands in a bunker, a Bunker card is drawn and executed. If the piece lands in trees or rough, a Trouble card is drawn and executed. If the piece lands in water or out of bonds, the golfer plays again (the bad stroke is counted). <br/>Money is gained for different reasons (hole winner, par done...). The winner is the one who gains the more money. Alternative game makes the player who played the less strokes the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player has his own goal space and ten chips numbered from 0 to 9 with which to influence the path that Mr. Zero takes. They take turns placing chips on the roads. When all of the chips have been placed, the decisionmaking part of the game for the players is over and that of Mr. Zero begins. Each time he comes to an intersection, he always follows the road having the lowest-numbered chip. This chip is now flipped over. If by the end Mr. Zero reaches a goal space, a player receives all of the inverted chips. The player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

See Video).<br/>Object: To score points by stacking dominoes on other dominoes with matching numbers.<br/><br/>You Need:<br/><br/><br/>     A set of double-six, double-nine, or double-twelve dominoes.<br/>     Paper and pencil to keep track of each player's score. <br/><br/><br/>Players compete by laying dominoes on the table to form the beginning 4x4 base of dominoes. As the players place the dominoes they score one point for every square on a domino that they played that matches an adjacent square on another domino in play. After the base is completed, players start forming new levels to the 'ziggurat' by playing each domino so that it exactly covers two squares on the level below it. Once all available plays on the current level have been filled (and not before), the players start a new level.<br/><br/>The game ends when all dominoes have been played or if a new level is started with only one valid place to play. Tally the points for each player. The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie for points, then the player with the least dominoes left wins. Additional ties are shared wins.<br/><br/>Download the rules here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/96/ziggurat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/96/ziggurat</a><br/><br/>",

To complicate things, one fairy is allowed to only step on turtles and the other is allowed to only step on frogs, and they start on opposite sides of the pond.<br/><br/>(Oh, by the way...

Each turn a player takes cards from his life deck into his hand and attacks other players. Damage is taken by discarding cards from your hand or your life deck. The last player to have cards left in his/her life deck wins the game.<br/>There is a pile of &quot;Arena&quot; cards as well that determine random events that occur in the Arena - some good, some bad.<br/><br/>Game was handmade, monochrome drawings on colored cardboard cards. Some 200 copies were made of the &quot;basic set&quot; (rules, Arena cards and two gladiator decks; Myrmillo and Dimachaera) and the &quot;first expansion set&quot; (Retiarius).<br/><br/>",

The top cardball from the deck is turned over and becomes the 'option cardball'.  A player then takes either the option cardball or the top card from the deck and then places a card on top of the option cardball.  A player may then make a break.  A minimum break consists of a white cardball, a red cardball and a colored card ball (following the rules of snooker).  As the red cards are played they are placed in the pockets in the snookard box.  Later the colored balls will also be played into these pockets.  A player replenishes back to seven cards.  A scoreboard is also provided.  The winner of the frame is the player with the highest number of points when the final black is potted.  There are also special cards: miscue, snooker, foul, safety shot and free ball.<br/><br/>",

The mechanics are fairly trivial:  one attempts to collect question cards by answering trivia questions: in this case, perhaps surprisingly, questions about North American plants and animals.  Each card has six questions by default, three each graded Hard and Easy.  (The suggestion is that parents should choose Hard questions and children Easy when playing together.)  The player rolls a d3 to select the question randomly.  If answered correctly, the card is retained by the answerer; if incorrectly, the card is returned to the bottom of the pile.  Occasionally, a card contains a special &quot;claim a card from another player&quot; action instead of a question.<br/><br/>",

There is the den of the &quot;Robber Hotzenplotz&quot;, a figure well known in Germany from a bestselling children`s book. Every player has his own way from &quot;home&quot; to the &quot;den&quot;, equally laid out, and at first sight without any interaction or connection.<br/><br/>But:<br/><br/>Instead of dice there is a turning plate UNDER the board. On your way some of the points you walk on are holes in the upper board. So, if you step onto one of those, your figure stands on the plate underneath. Now is the time to turn the plate and watch: Is your figure falling into the trap (the box), because the plate has a hole at the same place, or does it keep standing?<br/>Through the same turning mechanism numbers change in small window-like holes, telling each player how far he is allowed to go.<br/>One more point: Figures you jump over just don`t count. So, if you jump, you go one step further.<br/><br/>The first figure reaching the den gains six points, the second five, the third and fourth four and so on. The winner is the player with the most points in the end.<br/><br/>Looks like a pure game of luck, but the step on a hole also changes the numbers for the other players. There are more twists you have to think of (e.g. a shortcut through the dark wood etc.), so for young children this can be the gate to &quot;tactics&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot;: Is  my advantage worth the risk? And in which order shall I draw my figures? Because of the &quot;jumped over doesn`t count&quot;-rule, there are smart and dumb actions! And the winner is winning because of scoring points, not only, because he was the first!<br/><br/>Absolutely rare game and predecessor of euro-game-mechanics for young kids from the late sixties.<br/><br/>",

If basic navigation wasn't tricky enough, approaching any bit of rock that sticks out of the water somewhere, inevitably means being lured towards your death by the mesmerizing singing of a local hair-combing siren. Loreley, sitting on her rock, surrounded by the Rhine, is one of the more famous ones, and the German mythology is brought to life in this simple family game. Getting your boatmen from the boats surrounding the rock to the safety of the Loreley rock and reaching the fair maiden itself is what this game is all about.<br/><br/>Loreley sits on top of her rock in the center of the board, dutifully combing her hair. The Loreley rock is surrounded by 32 boats, and each boat has room for two to four boatmen. Players will first have to get all their 12 boatmen onto these boats, before the race to the top of the rock starts in earnest, by moving boatmen from the boats onto the rock itself. There are four tracks on the rock, one for each player's color, and all are exactly 11 spaces long. When a player places the 12th boatman on the rock Loreley is reached and that player wins the game.<br/><br/>Players start with 2 of their boatmen already placed on seats in the boats. By rolling the dice, these boatmen are moved from boat to boat. When a boatmen lands on a boat that already contains sailors, that player can place as many new sailors onto empty seats on the board as there are present in that boat before landing on it. You can't land (or place) in boats that are fully occupied. When all of a player's sailors are in boats already, instead of bringing a certain amount of new boatmen into play, that player can start to remove that same amount of sailors onto the rock and when someone's last sailor is moved from the boats to the rock, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>The game needs 3 or 4 players to work, and is mainly aimed at families with children around 7-9 years old.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game first appeared in a full production with Pelikan in 1973. &quot;Altmeister&quot; Rudi Hoffman's return to the game industry after a long illness was celebrated by the republication of his family classic by Spielbox magazine (5/1986 oct-nov), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. The graphics of both publications are showing their age.<br/><br/>",

Others would swamp even Genghis Khan with their detail. This set of rules lets you fight a good-sized wargame in a reasonable time. Complexities that delay the average game  are short-circuited here with a system of built-in probabilities. Though these rules lump some cumulative effects here and there, they nevertheless provide an enterprising general enough complexity to make games realistic.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Political Football&quot; is a simulation of the infamous Rugby [football] Tour of New Zealand in 1981 by a racially segregated team from South Africa ( which was then governed by the Apartheid system of racial separation). The Tour was opposed by a coalition of anti-racist groups in New Zealand. The result was a watershed in NZ politics, as the previously peaceful and harmonious country was bitterly divided by the violence that resulted from the confrontation between these opposing elements. In particular, the NZ Police force emerged without its previous positive image as an agent of fairness and social cohesion.<br/><br/>The name &ldquo;Political Football&rdquo; is a play on the common expression in NZ and elsewhere, where a contentious issue may be referred to in this way, particularly where the original problem has a non-political nature but when there may be an element of political opportunism apparent. In the case of the Rugby Tour, as well as being literally descriptive, there was an element of cynicism readily evident in the controversy.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Game Play is generally intuitive, and the number of Counters ( total 21 only) means play is readily comprehensible as well as fast moving. There are no dice, but some small randomness in the appearance of some features earlier or later. There is only one &ldquo;scenario&rdquo; and the whole Game must be played to determine a winner. Time for whole Game is about 2 hours<br/><br/>The Game has four protagonists<br/>1. The Demonstrators, who seek to disrupt the Tour to the extent that it must be abandoned<br/>2. The Rugby groups, who seek to complete the scheduled Tour.<br/>3. The Police, who seek to allow the Rugby to conduct their lawful business of playing Rugby<br/>4. The Government, which manipulates the other Players, seeking to extract maximum political advantage from a Law &amp; Order issue<br/><br/>Everybody except the Government has an inventory of Counters, which are able to move about the board under a movement allowance system, interacting with opposing counters. Players also have a suite of Action Cards which allow certain Actions to be played. Government uses its Turn to play certain cards influencing the other Players.<br/><br/>The Board is a stylized representation of <br/>&amp;#61623; four Sports Grounds, where the Rugby matches are scheduled ; <br/>&amp;#61623; a Court, where arrested demonstrators are processed;  <br/>&amp;#61623; a Hospital, where &ldquo;injured&rdquo; Counters wait till released by Government. <br/>&amp;#61623; between these venues, a gridded surface of &ldquo;streets&rdquo;, across which the Counters move from place to place. Only one Counter is allowed on any one square; counters cannot &ldquo;jump&rdquo; other counters.<br/><br/>The Tactics of the Game involve each Player trying to <br/>a. achieve certain mandatory objectives ( eg Rugby fielding sufficient Counters at the same time and place to actually play a match !).<br/>b. prevent Opposing Players establishing themselves in such a way as to frustrate opposition objectives.<br/><br/>Progress is measured and the Game won, by accumulation of Points for performing certain Actions ( eg for Rugby ,&ldquo;Play the Match&rdquo;; for Demonstrators &ldquo; Destroy the Goal posts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confront Police&rdquo;).<br/><br/>In short, each Player can ( and must) adopt a mix of Offensive and Defensive play.<br/>In general, all Counters can &ldquo;bash&rdquo; all other counters, putting them out of action for an extended but indeterminable time; while the Police have the power to arrest Demonstrators, removing them (briefly) from play. All counters can be also used to form defensive &ldquo;walls&rdquo;, preventing opponents from achieving their objectives (eg preventing Rugby Counters from getting to the Sports ground to play their game&hellip;).<br/><br/>These tactics will be familiar to anyone who has ever attended a political demonstration, particularly a violent one.<br/><br/>This Game has a number of very interesting features :<br/>1. the protagonists are a-symmetrical in numbers, capacities and objectives yet play is finely balanced,<br/>2.  Both the Police and Rugby lose Points by attacking Demonstrators, but may lose more by NOT doing so!<br/>3. While the non-Demonstrator Players have mutual interests, these are NOT identical &ndash; leading to subtle conflicts that preclude any lasting alliance.<br/>4. The result see-saws wildly throughout the Game<br/>5. Novice Players learn rapidly how their tactics need to change<br/>6. No Player is ever permanently eliminated, which upsets novices !<br/>7. Players offensive capacities are governed by non-recurring Action Cards : when to use them is a matter of judging opportunity.<br/>8. Play often appears counter-intuitive to novices, but in fact is an accurate simulation of this particular variety of conflict, ie the maintenance of Law &amp; Order in a democratic society where Police powers are limited by Human Rights considerations. Playing the Game itself demonstrates these principles powerfully.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a unique and workable game system that provides for very subtle calculations of both short term tactics as well as longer term objectives, within a simple set of rules.<br/><br/>",

And as in chess, the object of the game is the capture of the opposing king(s).<br/><br/>Each player has 9 playing pieces:<br/><br/>- 1 Kapital (similar to the king in chess)<br/>- 1 Intelligenz (similar to the knight)<br/>- 1 Kirche (similar to the rook)<br/>- 1 Milit&auml;r (similar to the bishop)<br/>- 1 Politiker (similar to the queen)<br/>- 4 Arbeiter (similar to the pawn)<br/><br/>The total number of playing pieces is exactly 1/3 (27) of the board size of 81. And since 54 spaces are empty at the beginning, a slower development of the game is achieved.<br/><br/>Several additions are made to the normal rules, like enabling the capture of own pieces (which allows an additional move) or making a putsch against the own pieces. It's not explicitly mentioned, but I guess, these additions can be left away to play the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Holy Hack - Hacking by the Book (1996, Black Falcon Publications) is one of the &quot;Hack&quot; miniatures rules set, but this rules set specifically covers ancient warfare in the Biblical period. The rules are for either 25mm or 15mm miniatures, and while it recommends a basing system that is common with several other miniature rules sets (such as DBA, DBM, WRG 7th Edition, and WARRIOR), it allows for the use of any existing basing system the players currently use (an important consideration for miniature owners looking into a new rules set).<br/><br/>The rules cover the organization of miniatures into units, the variety of formations possible, and the importance of leaders and morale. Units are issued order chits (or blanks to confuse the opponent) at the beginning of the turn sequence, which commits units to specific actions for that turn. Orders are revealed simultaneously. The rules cover charges, movement, missile fire, and melee. Both missile and melee combat use damage tables with modifiers to determine casualties, which are converted into a percentage. Percentage dice (2 x D10's) are used to determine if a percentage fraction &quot;hits&quot; or not.<br/><br/>Although the rules use a casualty removal system, the most a side can lose is 3 figures per missile or melee round. Morale has a strong influence in the game, and the side that can force more morale tests upon his opponent will often win the game.<br/><br/>The rules come with  a sheet of order chits/status markers, which can either be cut out or photocopied (using different colored paper can help to further distinguish the orders or unit status at a glance). This is not as complex a set of miniature rules as compared to Warrior: Miniature Wargame Rules for Ancient and Medieval Warfare 3000BC to 1485AD, but it can get a bit involved for new players.<br/><br/>",

The game uses cards which depict plays to simulate football game.  Includes Football field board and metal football, plus both offensive and defensive play cards.  The game does not include a board, per se. Rather, the football field is printed on the box bottom. It is expected that you will punch small pilot holes in this box bottom with the included pushpin. The plastic football token for tracking the scrimmage line has a spike that can be wedged into these holes as you advance down the field.<br/><br/>The game is played by both players playing cards, one offensive, the other defensive.  The strategy of the game comes from trying to force your opponent to play inopportune cards, such as ones that will cause a turnover, and guessing when they will play those cards, so that you can capitalize on it.  Significant luck is involved, but there's also playing the odds through card counting and outguessing your opponent.<br/><br/>",

A game is divided into nine innings.  Each team is allowed a turn at bat per inning until three outs are recorded.  With the third out a team's 'at bat' ends.  The 'Visiting' team is up first each inning - considered the 'top' of inning.  The 'Home' team always bats last or the 'bottom' of the inning.  The team not 'at bat' is the defense.  The team with the greatest number  of runs after nine innings wins.  If the score is tied at the end of regulation play, 'extra innings' are played until at the end of an inning one team leads.  Runs are scored when a runner touches 'Home Plate' preceeded by tagging first base, second base, and third base.  Not more than one player is allowed per base at a time.  Runs, innings, outs, strike and balls are recorded by their respective markers.  Strike outs are noted by the enclosed &quot;K's&quot; and are to be hung over the backboard when a strike out occurs.<br/><br/>",

Relive the summer fun with this quick mini reproduction of the game.<br/><br/>Please note... this is not the real thing... if you were to be playing this game... well there is not a foot and half long metal dart flying through the air.  We use smaller magnetic tipped darts and our field of green is a felt field with rings backed by a magnetic strip.  The essence of the game is still the same... get it in the rings.  But if you want a bit of danger well we've included two felt feet as well... impale one with a dart and you lose points.  Finish the round without sticking a dart into the tender tootsies... and you'll find your score climbs up a bit more.<br/><br/>If you have any questions... well I'm (mbourgeois) the guy to ask.  We don't forsee production on this game anytime soon.  There simply isn't the current market for it.  However if you'd like to make your own... just ask for info and we'll send off the material requirements and measurements to make your own.<br/><br/>See: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2279107#2279107\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2279107#2279107</a><br/><br/>",

There is also a set of 40 cards which have photos of different mixes of the objects and also a '?' allowing for your own object.<br/><br/>4 cards are turned over and one player secretly chooses one of the cards and fills the horn with the objects shown in that picture. The horn is closed and the next player shakes it and tries to guess which card has been used by the sounds that are made.<br/><br/>The game is intended to develop the ability to pick out different sounds. The original 2001 prototype made by Reinhold Wittig (titled Das F&uuml;llhorn) had an African animal horn which was filled.<br/><br/>",

When you form a loop which surrounds enemy stones, you remove the enemy stones from the board.  Neither player may place stones into a loop.  A player owns the perimeter of his loop as well as all of the points contained within the loop.

Each stone moves in a L fashion, i.e., it slides (orthogonally or diagonally) over a straight line of empty cells and just before reaching an obstacle (board edge or another stone), it must make a 90&ordm; turn (to the left of to the right) and move at least one more cell, until it finds another obstacle (it's invalid to stop in the middle of this double path). A stone already at the last row cannot move.<br/><br/>The player that first occupies his opponent's initial spaces with his own stones wins.<br/><br/>This game appeared in Walter Joris's book 100 Strategic Games for Pen and Paper.<br/><br/>",

A set of 3 four-sided dice is recommended; however, if these are unavailable, the game can also be played with a pair of regular six-sided dice.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to occupy all of the spaces on the board that contain a specific mystic symbol. The 3 symbols are the sun, the moon, and the star. For each of these symbols, there are 5 spaces on the board that must be occupied in order to win. Two of these spaces contain only the one symbol, two are shared with one other symbol (these are called Bi-Spaces), and the final space contains all 3 symbols. (This space is the center space on the board, and it is called the Tri-Space.)<br/><br/>The complete rules are available at Wunderland.com.<br/><br/>",

The players roll a die in hopes of throwing a 1 to leave their start space in the moulded plastic game base. Traveling the track of the board, it is a race to see who can get all 4 of their marbles into their home first. When you land on a space occupied by another player you call out &quot;skat&quot; and send that player back to their starting spot.<br/><br/>In a 4 player game, you can play as teams with the goal of getting the 8 team marbles back prior to the other team. Once a player has all 4 of his in the home spaces, he can begin to move his partners marbles.<br/><br/>Another version of the game is Wild Skat, using an extra hole in the center of the board. This extra hole allows you the opportunity to cross the board in fewer moves, but increases your chance of being &quot;skatted&quot; by your opponent.<br/><br/>",

The balls load under the pitcher's mound and are released one by one by using one of the controls. The bat works like a flipper in a pinball game. Wooden frame, glass top. 14 X 21 inches.<br/><br/>This game from 1946 is sort of a bagatelle game but can be played by two players. One player acts as the pitcher and uses the plastic pitchers spot to dispense a round metal ball (the baseball) towards the batter who has a bat which by pushing a lever, swings at the released ball in an attempt to make contact with the ball.

The sailing boat of the king rides on the water, loaded with jewels. The players slip into the role of wild river dragons who want to steal the jewels. The only player who can do that, however, is one who has his breath well under control. Players move the ship by blowing through a straw to propel it along the river... but other players can end the trip by rolling the dice. In order to win, one needs a good portion of skill and dice luck beside sufficient breath.

        "description": "From the box lid:<br/><br/>&quot;Captain your team to victory using all the tactical skill of a professional cricketer.<br/><br/>Unique card and dice combination provide all the excitement of a fast moving one day cricket match.<br/><br/>Easy to play - family fun.&quot;<br/><br/>This game is themed around the one-day cricket phenomenon that became popular in the late 70s, although the board game lasts for 10 overs instead of 50 like the real game.<br/><br/>Although the rules say that the game can be played by any number of players, in reality it seems to be designed for two people to oppose each other as the two team captains. Each captain has to make the same type of decisions that a cricket captain would normally make during a game, namely:<br/><br/><br/>     In what order to use his batsmen (four &quot;top&quot; batsmen, four &quot;medium&quot;, and three &quot;tail&quot;); typically you would use your best batsmen first, as they have no individual characteristics such as skill against a certain type of bowling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     When to use his bowlers (two &quot;strike&quot; bowlers with one over each, two &quot;medium&quot; bowlers with two overs each, and two &quot;spin&quot; bowlers with two overs each). The rules suggest using your strike bowlers first to get the best batsmen out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Where to place his fieldsmen; the bowler and wicket keeper have to be in their designated positions on the board, but the other nine can be placed in any one of 21 other named positions (mid-off, mid-on, extra cover, etc.). This seems to be where most of the decision-making takes place.<br/><br/><br/>Once the batsmen, bowler, and fieldsmen are in place and ready, a bowler/batsman matchup table is consulted to determine which of three coloured dice is rolled:<br/><br/><br/>     the black die (1,1,2,3,3,4), which favours neither batsman nor bowler<br/>     the blue die (1,2,3,4,4,6), which favours the batsman<br/>     the red die (1,1,1,2,2,4), which favours the bowler<br/><br/><br/>The indicated die is rolled. On a six, the batsman simply scores six runs (the maximum). On a 1 to 4, a card is drawn from the relevant deck, there being four named &quot;Card One&quot; to &quot;Card Four&quot;). Each card has three possible outcomes, one for each type of bowler. The relevant outcome is evaluated based on the positions of the fieldsmen. For example, one of the &quot;Card Three&quot; cards says this for the &quot;strike&quot; bowler:<br/><br/>&quot;Driven in the air for some distance but a bad bounce beats mid-off who stumbles after it for 2 runs. No mid-off, 3 runs. No long-off, 4 runs.&quot;<br/><br/>Some cards call for the red die to be rolled, in which case the batsman must roll a 1 NOT to be given out (50% chance).<br/><br/>The innings is over once ten batsmen are out or ten overs have been completed. Each team has one innings, after which the team with the higher score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

It is known from the Virunga mountains to the Sudanese border, and from Bangui (Central African Republic) to Arui near Uganda. Mangola is a new game which was developed after 1911 according to the ethnologue Philip Townshend and is now gradually replacing older games such as sombi and single lap mancala games. The game was spread by the Belgian colonial administration and military along rivers and roads and is the only mancala game played in the central basin (one of the few African regions where mancala games were still unknown in the 19th century). <br/>There are many local variants, probably more than 30, which have slightly different opening rules (some with simultaneous opening moves) and employ different board sizes. <br/>The game is played by adults on beautiful wooden boards with holes carved in the surface. Children, on the other hand, dig the board in the ground or draw it with chalk on concrete. <br/>It is played by both sexes, but more often by women. <br/>The following rules were reported from the capital Kinshasa by Suzanne Comhaire-Sylvain in 1952.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Mangola is a two players game. <br/>It is played on a board made of four rows of eight holes. <br/>At the beginning each hole has two seeds.<br/><br/>Each player controls the two rows closer on his side, and only moves on these two rows. We will call the row closest to him outer row and the other one inner row <br/>Players take turns to move. <br/>The first move of each player is a special one: they redistribute the seeds by taking the contents of one hole and putting it into the next, and so one, until your side of the board is checkered with holes containing 4 seeds and empty holes.<br/><br/>The second move of each player must begin from the left- or right-most hole of your outer or inner row. <br/>At your turn you take all the seeds from a hole on your side that contains at least two seeds and put them, one by one, in the following holes, in an anticlockwise sense. Singletons cannot be moved. <br/>If the last seed is dropped in an empty hole, you move it to the next hole and your turn ends. <br/>If the last seed falls in a non-empty hole, you take its contents including the last distributed seed and keep on sowing. <br/>If the last seed falls in a non-empty hole of the inner row, and the two opposite holes of the opponent contain seeds, you take the contents of your hole, including the seed just dropped, and the contents of both opponent's holes, and begin the next lap from the hole following the last empty hole (the same from which you began the last lap that effected the capture). <br/>When one player cannot move (his side of the board is empty or contains only singletons), he has lost the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A collectible card game that features Major League Baseball players.<br/><br/>The game plays much like Top Trumps.  Each card has ratings in three categories: Fastball, Changeup, and Specialty.  The pitching team selects one of his pitchers, then the hitting team places down one of his hitters, face-down.  The pitching team then chooses one of the three categories, the hitter's card is revealed, and the higher total in the selected category wins.  Each team gets to play 9 hitters, and the team with the most hitters' victories wins the game.<br/><br/>In 2011, additional rules were added to form the &quot;Major League&quot; rules, and the original ruleset was dubbed the &quot;Home Run Derby&quot;; cards were designed with additional information for the new rules. Under the Major League rules, the game takes place on a &quot;baseball field&quot; poster provided in the starter set. One pitcher pitches for an entire inning, but may not throw the same pitch twice in a row. Hits are no longer automatically home runs, but the batter moves a number of bases as indicated on his card. Players have offensive and defensive abilities that allow them to change the effects of hits, pitches, runs, and outs. Ball fields and mascots were added to the card set, and can affect the game.<br/><br/>From the starter box back:<br/><br/>Introducing Topps Attax, the new card game that puts you in charge of the action!  Manage your team, call your pitches and battle against your friends.  Or take the action online!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An old scandinavian game, played in certain parts of Denmark and Norway. Two players take turns rolling the dice to try and free their pegs for movement, then try to capture the opponents pegs before they can ambush your starting pieces.<br/><br/>The board consists of three lines of holes for the pegs, the middle one being one hole longer than the two sides. The two side lines are filled with each player's pegs. The number of pegs vary according to local tradition, typically 16 in Denmark and 12 in Norway.<br/>The game uses a pair of special four sided dice marked A, II, III and IV. You need to roll an A to free one of your pieces, the other rolls are used to move the pegs once freed. A peg may never overtake your other pegs, but must keep their place in the line.<br/>Once freed the pieces move down the middle aisle and if they manage to avoid being captured they move into the opponent's starting line, capturing the unfree pegs.<br/><br/>The origins of the game are unknown but it is believed to be inspired by certain middle-eastern and north african games, brought back by either vikings or crusaders.<br/><br/>",

It is an educational and fun game for people who want to improve and exercise their arithmetic skills.<br/><br/>Number of players<br/>1 - 4<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Deal 5 Poker cards to each player. Place the rest of the Poker cards face-down in a Poker draw pile, the Operator cards face-up in the middle of the table, and the Result cards face-down in a Result draw pile.<br/><br/>Multi-player Game Play (2-4 players)<br/>During the start of each round, put the top card from the Result draw pile on the table face-up in a Result discard pile. Each player then selects 2 or more Poker cards in his hand such that using these cards and at least 1 Operator card, he is able to form a math expression that evaluates to the number on the face-up Result card. Jokers can represent any number from 1 to 13.<br/><br/>All players put their selected Poker cards in front of them face-down. If a player thinks he is unable to form any correct math expression with his current hand, he has to place all his 5 Poker cards face-down. Once all players have done this, each player reveals his selected Poker cards and take turns to form the expressions with the Operator cards. If the player forms the expression correctly, then he places his Poker cards face-down in front of him in his Score pile.<br/><br/>For the player who is unable to form any expression and has placed his 5 Poker cards on the table, he will reveal his cards and other players have a chance to form an expression. Any of the other players may shout &ldquo;Calculae!&rdquo; and then start to form an expression. If the expression is formed correctly, he gets to keep the Poker cards used in his Score pile.<br/><br/>If a player makes an attempt to form an expression, either using his Poker cards or other player&rsquo;s Poker cards, and is unable to do so or forms an incorrect expression, he will have to discard 3 cards from his Score pile to the Poker discard pile face-up.<br/><br/>Once all players have verified their expressions formed, they draw Poker hands to fill their hand to 5 and the next round starts where a new Result card is revealed. The new Result card is placed on top of the current Result card.<br/><br/>Continue playing until either the Poker draw pile or the Result draw pile runs out. The winner is the player with the highest Score.<br/><br/>Solitaire Game Play (1 player)<br/>All the rules are the same, except that the player has to discard all his cards at the end of a round, whether he has formed an expression or not. Then he draws 5 new Poker cards for the next round. The aim is to score the highest Score.<br/><br/>",

To reach that goal, the heroes deal with a variety of crises like burning buildings, derailing trains and cats on tress. More often than not one of the 25 super villains featured in the game appears somewhere in the city to wreak havoc, and will destroy the city if left alone.<br/><br/>The heroes have got to decide which crises to deal with first, and whether to team up to fight the villains or not, as some villains may be too much to handle for a single hero, and the villains may form teams of their own.<br/><br/>Once the heroes beat a villain or solve an event, they'll earn experience and fame. The fame is needed to win the game, while the experience may be traded for even more super powers, slowly building the hero to be more formidable.<br/><br/>While the game has some cooperative options, in the end only one hero will be the winner!<br/><br/>",

Blame immediately fell on Spain, which was trying to put down a revolt on the island. A short time later, the Spanish American War had begun.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The most famous land battle in this short conflict occurred at San Juan Hill. Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders were among those that gained fame by storming the Spanish trenches on the hills surrounding the city of Santiago.

        "description": "(Text by the publisher) Bildsch&ouml;ne Wortspiele is a compact collection of 8 card games that deal with images and associated words. The set contains 100 cards (90 photos, 6 jokers, 4 blancs), 4 cards with suggestions for words, 1 booklet with rules and examples.<br/>The principal mechanism is very simple: You form compounds by combining the words that you associate with two or more photos. A photo doesn&rsquo;t represent only one word. For instance, for the photo that shows an eagle you can also say &quot;bird&quot;, or &quot;beak&quot;, or &quot;head&quot;, or &quot;feather&quot;, or &quot;claw&quot;, or &quot;animal&quot; and so on. Thus, in combination with other cards in the set, you can form numerous words such as &quot;bird bath&quot;, &quot;bird table&quot;, &quot;frigate bird&quot;, &quot;game bird&quot;, &quot;pack animal&quot;, &quot;stuffed animal&quot;, &quot;animal farm&quot;, &quot;animal world&quot; and so on.<br/>The games can be played on all language levels. The selection of the photos ensures that you can form a large number of compounds within the range of basic vocabulary. Also, you can extend the linguistic range deliberately in terms of code, style and special languages.<br/>In educational contexts the games cannot only be used for vocabulary training. It is also possible to train more subtle competences such as abstract thinking (eagle &gt; bird &gt; animal), the perception of paralleles and differences (bird: bird of prey vs. singing bird), style and narrating (you put down one card after another and let narrate / narrate yourself).<br/>You can play most of the games either in competition or in coordination. Some of the games you can even play on your own. Depending on which game is played, the emphasis is on speed, concentration, memory, or wit. All the games are a challenge to imagination.<br/>The games are suited for cross-generational, highly communicative playing within the family. They have also been designed for educational and therapeutical purposes. (End of text by the publisher)<br/><br/>",

The other players are able to move the villains &quot;B&oslash;ffen&quot; (The Beef) and &quot;Kommiss&aelig;ren&quot; (The Detective) around the map, in order to stop the other player's advancement in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a traditional 2-player game from West Africa, played on a 5x6 rectangular board. Each player has 12 game pieces in her own color, which start off the board; traditionally one player uses small sticks, the other uses pebbles.<br/>Players initially take turns to place ('drop') one of their pieces on the board.  Each must be dropped on an empty space on the board.  One source states that this must not be adjacent (orthogonally) to a friendly piece, but the original descriptions by Monot [1950], translated by Murray [1951] only state that - during this stage - no player may form a row of three of her own pieces.  If a player cannot make a legal drop, she must pass. This continues until all pieces are placed on the board, or until no more pieces can be placed.<br/>After that, in each turn and starting with the player who began the game, each player moves one of their own pieces to an empty adjacent (orthogonal) space on the board. If, by so doing, she is able to make an orthogonal  row of exactly three of her own pieces, she may capture one enemy piece (of her choice, presumably).  The player who captures all of her opponent's pieces wins the game, and scores two points if this is achieved without any of her own being captured, or one point if she has lost at least one of her own pieces.  A series of matches is played, and the series is won by the first player to score 10 points.<br/><br/>",

Faster pace. With 2 resources acquired per term (most every other CCG is 1) plus the ability to barter 1 resource and acquire a third resource each term, every term is exciting and brings new twists into the fray. Never suffer through another, &quot;Draw a land. My turn is over&quot; term again.<br/><br/>2. Multi-region system. With 4 location regions per commander and a central battlefield region, you have far more options and therefore strategy is kicker. Like in a game of chess, in Conquest you need to think about positioning for your units. In most card games, it's simply your army vs. your opponent's army, 2 regions, and whether to attack or defend is a very simple matter of arithmetic.<br/><br/>3. Various strategies to pursue. Because locations and upgrades, commanders' sources of income, are vulnerable to attack and destruction, commanders have more options for how to seek a victory--a straight out offensive on the enemy domain to flat-out win or a more subtle wearing down of the opponent's income. Also, with 2 types of income (gold and mana), you can try to isolate one of these sources to cripple the opponent's army.<br/><br/>",

Open doors allow players to pass between Rooms. Within rooms, players interact,<br/>search, hide and fight. Once all twelve rooms are placed, any door that does not lead to another room is a way out. The first player to escape the maze, wins!<br/><br/>You will roll 2 to 5 six-sided dice to perform the following actions: OPEN, MOVE, SEARCH, HIDE, HELP or ATTACK. Throughout the game, you will search for HAND cards and try to avoid SKULL cards. HAND cards (Useful, Useless and Charmed items) help you defeat the maze, influence others, intimidate them, or just plain force them to do your will. SKULL cards (Bad Scares, Devious Traps, Wicked Hexes and Dark Entities) await those who roll below 9. Skulls can kill you or drive you insane.<br/><br/>In this game, you are YOU. Imagine yourself awakened in a dark room without knowing why or how you came to be there. Act as you might under those circumstances. Strike out on your own or explore as a group; it&rsquo;s up to you. FAIR WARNING: few make it out of the maze alone.

Object of the game is to 'kick' the ball, by means of the 'boot' then smartly tap the coloured ring on the 'boot' with the forefinger of the right hand. The ball will then rise and drop on to the playing field. A little practice will make you quite expert at this. A completely different game but the idea of catapulting the ball on to the board is reminiscent of games like Flying Hats.

        "description": "A trivia game with a tactical component and direct confrontation (using cards to buy other questions/cards, stealing cards from other players).<br/><br/>The game consists of 300 question cards in five categories: geography &amp; history, humanities &amp; arts, science &amp; technology, economy &amp; politics, entertainment &amp; sports.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player has to collect one card from each of the five categories. Each of the cards contain two or three questions. To win a card, a player has to answer all the questions (except for the &quot;guesstimation&quot; one) on a card.<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and two cards are placed, face up, on the table. The front side shows the card's category and what types of questions it contains. Questions come in different levels of difficulty, and there are yes/no questions and &quot;guesstimation&quot; questions where a number has to be guessed. The active player chooses one of the two cards. If they can answer all the questions on it, they win the card, if not, the card is removed from the game. Then the pool is filled up so that there are two cards again, and it's the next player's turn.<br/><br/>A player can have more than one card from the same category. These extra cards can be used to avoid having to answer one particular question, or three from the same category can be exchanged for one from a different category.<br/><br/>For questions marked as difficult, the active player can ask the questioner for a possible answer (which the questioner has to make up), turning it into a yes/no question. Not doing so, however, has an advantage as well: If a player can answer a difficult question without help, they earn an additional turn.<br/><br/>Special rule for the &quot;guesstimation&quot; questions (only when three or more are playing): Instead of trying for a new card from the pool, the active player can decide to &quot;attack&quot; a player of his/her choice. The next player not involved in the attack reads the guesstimation question from the top card of the card stack.

        "description": "An Inheritance game for two to seven players<br/><br/>Your Great Aunt Hattie has passed away and named you in her will. All she left behind was a (sizeable) bank account and her collection of ART DECO prints from the 1920&rsquo;s. Aunt Hattie was a bit eccentric - and created a game for her inheritors. If you want your share of the (sizeable) family bank, you&rsquo;ll have to play! Inheritors start with a stake from the bank, and continually draw money from the pool to bid on Art Prints until all have been won. Each print is assigned points. The Inheritor who gains the most points takes home the entire collection - and the balance of the bank!<br/><br/>Each round, players roll dice [the bid]. Highest roll pays the difference between his die roll and the low die roll and gets the print [card]. If high roll is tied, everybody gets double the roll in chips and the card goes in the discard pile. Winning a Wild Card allows you to choose any card from the discard pile.<br/><br/>Cards range in points from 2 - 12. The 2 - 5 point cards may be 'DOUBLED DOWN', but the 6 - 12 point cards may not. During scoring, each DOUBLED DOWN card doubles the entire score of a color group. All chips accumulated score as well. Highest total wins.<br/><br/>ART DECO is primarily a party game, but is popular at Conventions and any activity with groups. Suitable for young and old.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/><br/>     A 75 card deck of ART DECO prints. <br/><br/><br/>For the two player game, only use the Color Cards that have between 2 and 5 points. Color cards are arranged into five color groups, or sets. There are an extra fifteen Wild Cards in the deck have no points on them - for the two player game, only use five.<br/><br/>     Rules are on an additional 12 cards.<br/>     you'll need to provide your dice and poker chips.<br/><br/><br/>AVAILABILITY:<br/><br/>     ART DECO is only available from The Game Crafters website.<br/><br/><br/>",

Then the player with the lowest card showing decides either to drop out or to force a showdown. Since it goes from lowest to highest, not every player will have the opportunity to drop out before the showdown occurs.<br/><br/>When the showdown occurs, everyone shows both of their cards.  The player with the highest black card wins.  Everyone else (except for those who dropped out) then pay the winning player a number of coins equal to the value of the red card (aces are worth 1 coin, and face cards are worth 10 coins). The winner also gets the antes.  If there is no showdown, the surviving player gets the antes.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Cheapass Games Poker Suite that was released on the Cheapass website.<br/><br/>",

If it shows Captain Hook, her turn ends and she places the Hook token face-up on the table; if not, she can draw again or stop her turn. She can continue her turn as long as she doesn't reveal a Hook token or until she reveals a token that has a Neverland character or a background that matches a token already revealed that turn. In the latter case, you place the tokens on the adventure cards of the same color; in the former case, you leave Hook face-up and shuffle all the tokens in hand with those still on the table.<br/><br/>Each adventure card will say either two or three doubloons on it, and when that card has two or three tokens on it, the players score those coins, placing them in their treasure chest and returning any other tokens to the mix, then remove that adventure card from the game. If a token with this background is later revealed, the players score it immediately.<br/><br/>Whenever the players think they have at least ten tokens in their chest, they can stop the game to count their loot. If correct, they win! The game also ends if the players draw the sixth Captain Hook token &ndash; but if they've already collected at least ten doubloons, they still win!<br/><br/>",

Players are able to cast threats (e.g. fire, pollution, feral animals) that will knock out susceptible animals in play from the game.

All players select what they think are the best celebrities for an ordinary or outlandish, &ldquo;ripped from the tabloid headlines&rdquo; situation. If your celebrity is the one to survive the multiple elimination rounds and is the last one standing, you win! For example, one player draws a situation card that reads &ldquo;Who is the best celebrity to &hellip; play Truth or Dare?&rdquo; Each player chooses and submits a Celebrity Card from their hand of four cards. Maybe Jennifer Aniston, Kanye West, Honey Boo Boo and Marilyn Monroe are competing in this round. Players now take turns eliminating the celebrity least suited for the situation until just one remains, and a winner is crowned. With almost 300 celebrities and 162 situations, the possibilities are endlessly entertaining!<br/><br/>",

Just as in that game, the board consists of a 6x6 board build up with tiles. These tiles have 3 characteristics: form (square, triangle or circle), color (blue, red, green, yellow or white) and size (big or small). Next to that, each player puts a home tile next to one of the corners in his own color. To move the tiles around you can move a tile horizontally of vertically if 1 characteristic with the adjacent tile corresponds. To move diagonally, 2 characteristics have to correspond. Different to Katoiz, instead of rolling dice to determine which tile you can move on your turn, here you move tiles in a fixed order by color.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to collect a stack of four tiles on your home tile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rare card game that uses standard playing cards with the addition of 8 Royal Aces and eight Jokers. As there are two packs, this makes a total of 120 cards per game.<br/><br/>The game is a curious mix of Rummy and Whist. Each player gets 18 cards dealt to them. There now begins a phase of drawing and discarding until a player lays down a run or set of 5 cards (5 Nines or a run of five, for example). Bonuses and penalties are then scored and every player must reduce their hand to 13 cards.<br/><br/>Then the auction begins and one player (or team if playing partnerships) will win the auction and then need to make that many tricks as bid. Card play is exactly the same as standard games like Whist. Royal Aces secured in this phase (or Release) score sizeable bonus points.<br/><br/>It can be seen that strategy is needed at every phase. If you use a high scoring 5 cards in the first stage (known as Release), the cards used will not be available to you for the auction and card-play in the 2nd phase.<br/><br/>The object is to be the first player (or partnership) to score 1,000 points.<br/><br/>",

(leave in an escape pod with a small share).  Majority rules.<br/><br/>After the vote the Nautilus dives and may face many dangers or crises by turning over a dive card. The crew may elect to use their skills and fix these crises or let them pass, however, if 3 crises go unresolved, Nautilus is destroyed and all hands lost to the crushing depths. Resolving a crisis places it back in the dive deck, meaning it may resurface again.<br/><br/>The deeper Nautilus and her crew travel, the greater the rewards but the greatest rewards are shared only with those demonstrating the most loyalty to the Captain.<br/><br/>",

Each player will be given a superhero character to play. Every time a geocache is take, a villain appears on a teleportation pod. Villains move about the board and start to destroy geocaches until they are successfully captured by a superhero. The straightforward combat system adds strategy to capturing villains and some superheroes are more well-suited to capturing some villains.

        "description": "Bill Shakespeare is Dead is a highbrow/lowbrow party game for at least 5 players. There are variants for 3 and 4 players.<br/><br/>Transport yourself back to 17th century England. Ah, the good old days. The smell of feces and dead hobos in the street. The sight of unwashed masses and the complete lack of hygiene. Isn&rsquo;t it lovely? You and your fellow players are members of the King&rsquo;s Men, and you make your living saying pretty words to hundreds of filthy people. Better than digging ditches, right? Well tonight is supposed to be the opening night of a brand new play. The crowds are already gathered in the Globe Theatre, and the only thing missing is your star playwright, Bill Shakespeare. As it turns out, Bill had a little too much pickled herring and a lot too much wine and is as dead as disco. Now, armed with nothing but patches of the new script and (sometimes obscene) scribbles in the margins, you all need to put on a show. Good luck!<br/><br/>In Bill Shakespeare is Dead, one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s famous plays is split into five short acts. During each act, one person acts as the Stage Manager, and two people are randomly chosen to act out the scene. As they go through the script, the rest of the players will have to fill in missing nouns and verbs randomly drawn from the deck and helpfully shouted when there is a blank part in the script. The Stage Manager chooses which nouns and verbs go where. At the end, you can tally your points and declare a winner, if that&rsquo;s your sort of thing.<br/><br/>",

Letters and numbers can go up, down, or stay the same... and switch at any time. Be the first player out of cards and win!<br/><br/>Switch (the predecessor to Qwitch) consists of a deck of 64 cards, each containing one of eight numbers (1&ndash;8) and one of eight letters (A&ndash;H), and a die with plus, minus, and equals symbols. After hands are dealt, one player turns a card from the deck face up and rolls the die. Players race to play the next card from their hands, determined by the symbol on the die.<br/><br/>",
