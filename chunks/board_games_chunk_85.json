Mitropia is a multiplayer territory capture game in which you place warriors and modify their behaviors with special powers, all overlayed on game mechanisms based on the ancient game of Go.<br/><br/>Up to five tribes, each with different powers, take up the challenge. Actions in each round are based on template movement cards that can be combined with special action cards. Movements capture territory and prisoners. At the end of each turn, players draw more cards of the type they want most and prepare for their next move.<br/><br/>A randomized game board changes with every playthrough and introduces terrain features that increase points or change movement on the mystical battlefield. Randomness in the game is driven by two movement card decks, and a handicap mechanism gives less familiar players a leg up when getting started.<br/><br/>The game homepage are here: Mitropia. <br/>The game development blog is here: Timewarp Labs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game (designed in 2002) is played on the intersections of a 5&times;5 grid of lines (or strings).  The game begins with a stack of 5 pieces on the center intersection, and each player has four home intersections.  The first player to pull at least 5 pieces onto any combination of his or her home intersections is the winner.<br/><br/>Both players simultaneously reveal their moves, which consist of &quot;pulling&quot; the end of a particular string toward the edge of the board.<br/><br/>Between turns, stacks of pieces rest on the string intersections.  These stacks are moved, split and/or combined when the ends of the strings connected to those intersections are pulled.  Stacks stop when they reach the edge of the grid.<br/><br/>Stacks pulled in two different directions are split into two equal stacks, with extra pieces added as necessary when odd stacks are split.  If the same string end is pulled by both players, the stacks on that string move, but the extra stress causes the string to break.  After such a move, that string cannot be pulled for the duration of the game.<br/><br/>Bonus: Includes letters in American Sign Language on the back side.<br/><br/>",

They try to reach the newly built oil field first and thus get the lucrative deal with the oil company and win the game.<br/><br/>First players shuffle their land card decks and build a map for the game. Each player has identical 31 land cards and together they form a 21x3 (for two players) or 14x9 (for four players) map. In the middle of the playing area is the oil field that players try to reach. The land cards have two playable sides and they have different rocks/obstacles in them so basically each player faces equally difficult landscape which to overcome.<br/><br/>Now players start to build their oil pipes. On their way to the oil field they need to turn the land cards to make the route possible, flip land cards around to hopefully reveal more suitable obstacles or switch land cards with adjacent ones.<br/><br/>Many land cards have some specialties. Yellow-edged has to be turned around once player builds a pipe next to it, some give extra action and some force player to flip surrounding cards around.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOnline Play<br/>    <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.tuonelaproductions.com/index.php?page_id=13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.tuonelaproductions.com/index.php?page_id=13</a><br/><br/><br/>",

Once they choose a song, they get a Subject card and the fun begins.<br/><br/>Players then begin rewriting the lyrics to the song they chose about the subject they receive.  There is a timer, and you can write as much or as little as you like in the allotted time.<br/><br/>Once everyone finishes writing, its time to &quot;perform&quot; your new song.  This is the part I love.  Everyone take a turn singing (or just reading) their new lyrics.  Needless to say, the results can be extremely funny and usually have people laughing.<br/><br/>You can write as much or as little as you want - and still win.  For example, my niece had the subject Roadkill and the song Brick House - all she wrote was &quot;It was a dead, mouse!&quot; and she won the round.<br/><br/>After everyone performs or reads their new song, everyone becomes a critic (think Simon Cowell).  Players secretly give Smash point cards or Trash (funny insult) cards to the other players.<br/><br/>The points each player receives during the round are recorded, and after playing as many rounds as you want - the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The best thing about this game is the memories it creates.  And players can take their songs home with them and share them.<br/><br/>",

You must appease the god of the darkness with sacrifices while making sure that your civilization grows and flourishes. There are 20 rounds to the game representing the daynames of the Aztec calendar cycle, and to win you must offer up 26 sacrificial hearts or the sun will not rise again and the world will end.<br/><br/>You begin the game with 3 harvest dice (white) and 2 city dice (yellow). Later you will have access to four additional expansion dice. These dice show a variety of resource icons:<br/><br/>corn, useful to harvest to feed your people, extra corn can be stored from one round to the next<br/><br/>black corn, which you may not harvest, and can mean famine and death if have 3 or more ears of it<br/><br/>peasants, who can multiply your harvest yield with their hard work<br/><br/>priests, who can cause your civilization to expand<br/><br/>hearts, with which you must to appease Tezacatipoca<br/><br/>warriors, who can gain you captured slaves for your sacrifices<br/><br/>gods, which come with expansion dice, who can give you divine bonus resources<br/><br/>During the game you must keep track of corn and hearts as well as rounds.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>There are 3 rolls allowed per round, and you must lock a die each roll, re-rolling any others you choose; with the exception of black corn which is always automatically locked on a roll (i.e. you are not allowed to re-roll a die showing the black corn icon, unless there is divine intervention). Some dice have 2 icons on a face; in this case both roll resources showing can be used. You must harvest enough corn in each round to feed all city and expansion dice being rolled (i.e. ears of corn=number of city and expansion dice rolled). At the start of the game this means you must harvest 2 ears of corn for each round, one for each of the city dice. As your civilization grows and you gain expansion dice, the number of ears of corn required will grow as well. If you do not have enough ears of corn to equal your rolled city and expansion dice (and you must use any stored corn you have as part of this), you must subtract 1 heart from your total (corn harvest may be saved from round to round).<br/><br/>During the game you may gain additional expansion dice. These dice are a darker orange and have a set of black dots (1 to 4 dots) on one face and the great jaguar god is displayed in white. You gain these expansion dice in numerical order and they will give you extra peasants, priests, corn to harvest, warriors and hearts as well as gods to pray to.<br/><br/>Game End: <br/>If after 20 rounds you have offered up 26 sacrificial hearts you have won and the world is safe for another calendar cycle.<br/><br/>",

Players use jets, ships, amphibious vehicles, and rockets to seize an enemy goal square or eliminate their opponent.<br/><br/>The map for at least one printing is a bit of a curiosity. In it, the cover of the box shows a 10x10 board with alternating green and blue squares. The instructions note that the land squares are green and the sea squares are blue. However, the actual map provided is 10x16, has only black and white print on yellow paper, and uses the letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;S&quot; to designate land and sea spaces. It would appear that the designer assumed he would be able to print color boards, but then had to fall back to a simpler black and white drawing printed on yellow paper.<br/><br/>",

The book is divided into three segments: games for two, games for a dozen, and games for two dozen (or more).<br/><br/>Interspersed within the game descriptions are some interesting articles about the &quot;New Games Movement.&quot;  A follow-up book, &quot;More New Games&quot;, was released in 1981 and the current director of New Games released &quot;Best New Games&quot; in 2002.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of various short, simple and funny mini-games, where each is more fun than the last. The game encourages players to interact in many different ways. You will master the rules very quickly and the game will never feel the same, because it gives you endless possibilities to experience something new. You will see your friends in comic situations and laught at things you are able to do trying to escape punishment. While playing Drinking Viking you will learn that the art is not to win but to manage not to lose!<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s in the box?<br/><br/>Drinking Viking party game contains 19 types of cards with unique illustrations shuffled in set of 42 cards, rulebook, 3 wooden dice and original cotton pouch.  To play, all you need are your friends, a viking heart and gaming spirit. It is that simple. The game can be played virtually anywhere. No board, no figures, no long setup. YOU are the figures and YOU are the board!<br/><br/>Game mechanics<br/><br/>Every card represents one mini game with unique rules. Players draw cards one by one to know what kind of game they are going to play and what challenge lies ahead. Some minigames are based on words, memory or creativity, others on luck, courage and quick reactions<br/>You will play minigames like  Egg,-chicken-dragon-Viking, Loki, 2-5-7, Mad king, Thor&rsquo;s hammer, Odin, Hunt , Drinking Viking and many more.<br/><br/>Game goal<br/><br/>Goal of this game is the game itself. Players try not to loose in various minigames to escape punishment. Each mini game is competitive and has unique winning goal. The goal of mini-games could be for example:  beating others in rock-paper-scissors to become a Viking,  hitting the table with your hand to &lsquo;stun&rsquo; other players, following the rules made by crazy king or not being the last to row a viking ship.<br/><br/>Rules of each mini-game determine losers. As Drinking Viking is a party game and vikings celebrate the BIG VICTORY, losers normally consume a beverage. But you can play Stripping Viking as well as you can play it just by collecting black points which is another funny way to play.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards are played. Then the winner or winners are determined depending on a game type. Winner is a player who has lowest score or the player who has the most pieces of clothing or the player who drank less than others. It is very simple to recognize winners and losers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tilt is yet another marble race game. The object of the game is to be the first player to move all four of his marbles around the board and into the center &quot;home&quot; area. The twist is that the board see-saws up and down depending on the position of the marbles. At the start, the board is perfectly balanced, but as the players move the marbles, the board tilts back and forth depending on the weight distribution of the marbles.<br/><br/>There are 18 &quot;slide&quot; areas around the board, and should your marble end up in one of these slides, a tilt of the board may send your marble forward or backward, or possibly right into the &quot;home&quot; area.&quot; (Think &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot; with actual chutes.)<br/><br/>Though essentially a children's roll-and-move game, young players will quickly learn how to make the laws of gravity work for them. There is also some low-level strategy as players may choose to move their marbles backward if it would allow them to enter a slide.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle of Kursk (operation &quot;Zittadele&quot;) that took place in 1943 was final German attempt to keep strategic initiative on Eastern front. Germans regained their spirit (crushed after defeat at Stalingrad) after successful recapturing of Kharkov and hoped new powerful tanks Panthers and Tigers allow them to crush Russian defense. It took time to deploy new equipment to the battle which gave Soviets time to prepare deep defenses. On the other side Russian generals planned to slow and weaken attacking German forces and after they have no more offensive power launch Soviet counteroffensive.<br/><br/>German assault was formed by two pincers - one attacking from the North while the other from the South. German plan was to cut off Soviet forces (5 armies) in Kursk bulge and destroy them. North pincer was a bit weaker and faced much more condense defensive lines which took much more time to break through. Assaulting forces was successfully distracted on July 12th by Soviet offensive to the north of the Kursk salient that was aimed toward Orel - directly at the rear of the assaulting Germans.<br/><br/>On the south German forces was much more successful. After fierce combats they managed to break Soviet defenses and reached Obojan and Prokhorovka which was last Soviet defense before Kursk. Soviet forces was exhausted and suffered heavy losses during the battle (Soviet 5th Guards Army defending Prokhorovka was 50 tangs out of 650 that it had couple of days before). On July 12th ,although German commander - general Mainstein insisted on final push and break of Soviet defenses, Hitler - impressed by Allied invasion of Sicily and Soviet offensive towards Orel decided to abandon operation &quot;Zittadele&quot;.<br/><br/>There are many myths that arose around the battle - mainly due to the fact that any real data available was kept confidential for a long time. It is fact that Germans did not break through Soviet lines but from recent historical materials it appears that Germans might have been very close to success. General Mainstein described the battle as German's lost victory - and, at least on the South, it looks like Germans were really close. Also German losses was extremely exaggerated (on July 11 - day of famous battle at Prokhorovka Germans lost around 48 tanks) while Soviet loses was tremendous. It looks like the battle could be won by Germans, but luckily other factors took the spirit of victory from Hitler just in time.<br/><br/>",

For each round, four motif or search cards are turned up. Players look at the search cards, which may show colours or symbols, then count the number of matching colours and symbols on the motif cards. When they think they've got the number right, they take one number card from the middle of the table.<br/><br/>The numbers are checked, and everyone who has a correct number cards scores a point. The number cards go back into the middle of the table and the next round begins.<br/><br/>If the cards turned up are only search cards, then the result is zero - and there are number cards with zero on them, so those are the ones people try to grab. If only motif cards are turned up, another set of cards is turned up.<br/><br/>There is a variation for 2 to 4 children aged 6 and up, with fewer number cards, placed the other way up so that there is only one number showing. In this version, the search cards and motif cards are separated and only one search card is turned up each round.<br/><br/>",

And if you have, you will surely find some new beautiful place that you missed.<br/>The game is fantastically designed with art inspired by oil paintings of the Vojvodina pain with numerous photographs of Vojvodina's towns from the beginning of the 20th century, which gives the game a unique visual identity thanks to Andrea Schwartz, the game's graphic designer.<br/>The designer of the game, psychologist Boris Đurović, a passionate board game enthusiast, wanted to encourage people to spend more time together in the company of their loved ones, sharing beautiful moments, learning, and having fun, away from mobile and computer screens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Brief description of Gameplay:<br/><br/>The game lasts a certain number of rounds depending on the number of players. At the start of a round 6 cards are dealt with each player.<br/><br/>Round is divided into 6 turns:&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;On each turn, starting with the first player, the players use one card from their hand. The card can be used in two ways:<br/><br/>1. Discard the card<br/>- The player discards the card face down on top of the deck and draws one of his field tiles from the common pile and places it in front of him.<br/>2. Keep the card<br/>- The player keeps the card face down and places one of his field tiles on the map.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn, all players pass the rest of the cards from their hand to the player on their left and the new turn begins with a new starting player.<br/><br/>After all the cards have been played, players receive grain depending on how many fields they covered on the map. Then everyone uncovers the cards they saved and for each town, they managed to supply (value of the grain on the blue bag symbol), they get coins shown on the cards, and for the towns, they didn't supply they lose that number of coins from their treasury.<br/><br/>At the end of the last round, the player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The game has 30mm-40mm miniatures that can be used with the free set of Robogear rules or for other miniature systems.<br/><br/>The game uses a simple action point system.  It also has 2 different firing rules which are used in the game: physical and virtual.  Physical firing requires shooting a projectile on the miniature at a target miniature.  Virtual firing is resolved using dice rolls.  The rules also contain stats if players wish to use physical weapons as virtual ones.<br/><br/>Most notable in the series are the modular building constructs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In early 1864, Union Gen. Nathaniel Banks led a small army up Louisiana's Red River. His objective, in conjunction with an overland campaign through Arkansas, was the Confederate Trans-Mississippi capital at Shreveport. Poor coordination of the two columns enabled the Confederates to concentrate their slender resources against each in turn. Banks was first, and in early April his spearhead was hit near the crossroads of Mansfield. Historically, the Union forces, strung out on the march, were routed piecemeal, but the battle could have gone the other way.<br/><br/>Mansfield uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.<br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>     Level: Brigade<br/>     Hex: 440 yards<br/><br/><br/>",

However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>&bull; A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>&bull; Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>&bull; Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan.<br/>&bull; The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode.<br/>&bull; The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>&bull; The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>&bull; The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/><br/>    Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.<br/>    Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.<br/>    Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not.<br/>    Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)<br/>    The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

The goal is to score the target amount of Cheers.<br/><br/>Setting:<br/>In the year 2130 humankind was saved by the most disruptive technology of the third millennium: the hyper-local gravity engines, capable of bending the universal law of gravity at the will of its creator - the Newton Corporation. The new technology quickly became an essential part of everyday life, tackling overpopulation by exponentially increasing living space and solving famine with vertical cultivations: in a matter of years, Newton Corporation became the most powerful and notorious company in the world.<br/><br/>Despite all the good done by Newton Corporation, there were protests, strikes and even revolts of thousands of people who believed that these technological advancements were dangerous for the human species. The strong reputation of Newton Corporation convinced the world leaders to denounce such acts of violence and defend the many research facilities by the military forces.<br/><br/>Many years passed and with them the protests faded. However, a group of fanatics kept on nourishing their anger and plotted an assault on the headquarters leading to the murder of the Newton Corporation founder and CEO. The military arrested the culprits who were immediately sentenced to a public execution, to be aired across the planet as a warning against rebellion towards such a global benefactor.<br/><br/>The execution was followed live by 99% of the world population. This exorbitant share is what pushed Newton Corporation to sponsor a spectacular and bloody event every year. Their goal was twofold: commemorating the punishment inflicted to the rebels and provide a single outlet for violence, so as to experience peace for the future year.<br/><br/>With the blessing of all world leaders and population, Newton Corporation developed new technologies capable of cloning the executed rebels, enhancing their abilities and peculiar traits. Four teams were created and sentenced to battle against each other for eternity, in the name of peace.<br/><br/>From the ashes of those rebels new Champions were created: the Zero Gravity Tournament was born.<br/><br/>",

Each ship is defined by its guns, compartments and combat factors.  You play by acting as commander of a ship or task group with a mission.  You plat the moves, you fire the guns, you assess the damage.  And it is all to actual 1/4800 scale.<br/><br/>Command At Sea is not a board game; it is played on the floor.  It is as close to real fighting ships as you can get and not be blasted.  The scenarios provided are for 3 battles of Savo Island near Guadalcanal in WWII.  If you love the big ships or haven't experienced naval miniatures play you won't want to miss Command At Sea.<br/><br/>Level: Very advanced play for 2 or more Ages 18 and up<br/>Playability: Complex learning, rapid play system.  3-8 hours playtime<br/>Components: 24 ship counters, rules, 20 ship data charts, 20 ship command plots, 4 turn gauges and damage tables.<br/><br/>The base game contains ship information for the US Northhampton Class CA, The New Orleans Class CA, The Atlanta Class CL, Begley Class DD, Benham Class DD and Benson Class DD.  The Japanese contain the Iakao Class CA, Furutaka Class CA, Aoba Class CA, Tenryu Class CL, Yubari Class CL, Kamikaze Class DD.  Two British Classes are represented the Kent Class CA and the Leander Class CL.<br/><br/>Three Scenarios are included: The Duel (One on One), The Ambush and Savo Island.<br/><br/>Somewhat unique to the game is the requirement to use range estimation to determine to hit targets.   An errata sheet was published that is required to play the game.   The scale of the game is 1 Inch = 400 feet.   This makes for a rather large playing area.<br/><br/>The Design notes indicate that the publisher planned to release fleet packs.   To my knowledge none were ever released.

A distinctive feature of the game is that playing pieces are shared by all players, that is, players do not each have their own color of pieces.  Instead, each player is associated with two opposites sides of the board.<br/><br/>Only white and black stones are used. The board starts empty. Taking turns clockwise, on his turn each player drops a single stone onto any empty space. The color of the stone must be different from the previous stone placed (thus, the stones alternate). The first stone to be played is black.<br/><br/>A player wins in either of two ways: (1) By connecting his/her two sides with a chain of stones of either color (i.e. a black chain or a white chain); OR (2) by making a Y shaped chain that connects one of his/her sides with each of his/her opponents' sides on the opposite half of the board.<br/><br/>The name Triskelion (pronounced try-SKEL-ee-un) is the name of a Celtic motif design that consists of three curved branches radiating from a center.<br/><br/>",

It was the era of soldier-kings and enlightened monarchs, when powerful states maneuvered professional armies and fought to gain rich provinces. FW is primarily intended as a multi-player player game. It can be played by two, three or four, with each player representing a different major power: Prussia, Austria, France or Britain. Other states are represented as minor powers. Each player has a variety of military and diplomatic instruments with which he can attempt to make his mark on history.<br/><br/>FW&rsquo;s system is based on our earlier-published 1066 and Hannibal&rsquo;s War games; however, there have been changes to the rules to reflect the differences in scale as well as the era being covered.<br/><br/>The square-grid map shows Europe from London to East Prussia and south to the Balkans and central Italy. Off-map areas are handled using holding boxes. Each game turn represents one year. Each military unit represents 2,500 to 10,000 men. Each square represents 50 miles (81 km) across from side to opposite side. Designed by Joseph Miranda<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: the balance of power, negotiations, mobilization, fog of war, honors of war, fortresses, sieges, forced march, ambush, delaying actions, pillage, leaders, veteran and guard units, fleets, fieldworks, minor powers, declaring war, the Holy Roman Empire, prisoners of war and much more. The sequence of play is as follows.<br/><br/>1) Balance of Power Phase<br/>2) Initiative Determination Phase<br/>3) Taxation Phase<br/>4) Market Phase<br/>5) Negotiation Phase<br/>6) Grand Diplomacy Phase<br/>7) Mobilization Phase<br/>8) Operations Phases<br/> a) First Operations Phase<br/> b) Second &amp; Subsequent Operations Phases<br/>9) Provisioning Phase<br/>10) Sudden Death Victory Check Phase<br/>11) End of Game Turn Phase<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Dave Farquhar's Review:<br/><br/>Chamelequin is described on the box as 'a game of skill and ever changing colours'; a reasonably accurate summary. The board is a striking 8x8 grid of large coloured squares. These alternate, with one row being green and yellow, the next red and blue. The effect of this was illustrated by Alastair (age 1) sobbing his heart out when I wouldn't let him play on it. The plastic pieces comprise circular bases, from which a stem protrudes, and large numbers of coloured 'polo shaped' rings. The object of the game is to be the survivor.<br/><br/>The initial set up is achieved by the players alternately placing one of their pieces on the board, at the same time dropping a coloured ring onto the stem. The basic principle is that the uppermost ring will always be the same colour as the square the piece occupies. This continues until all have been placed; ten each if two player, otherwise eight.<br/><br/>Player turns then continue, with one piece being moved each turn. This may be done in one of two ways: by moving one square and adding a ring or by removing rings and moving up to three squares. The former option is the standard move, and in this way stacks of up to four rings may be built up. Each time the colour ring selected matches the square moved to. The latter option is generally an attacking move. The top ring is removed, and the ring thus revealed shows the colour square which is then moved to. This process may be continued, until only one is left, at which point the move must stop as the last ring may never be removed. Any enemy pieces encountered during this move are eliminated from play. It is theoretically possible to capture three enemy pieces in one turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This popular Swedish game for three players is also known as Mj&ouml;lnarmatte or Mas and in Norwegian it is called Mattis.<br/><br/>Players, cards and deal<br/>The game is best for three players, but it is also possible for two or four to play. A standard 52 card pack, without joker, is used. The cards rank in the usual order: A (highest) K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 (lowest).<br/><br/>Deal and play are clockwise. Each player receives 3 cards. The rest of the cards are laid face down in a pile on the table (stock).<br/><br/>Object of the game<br/>Skitgubbe has two phases. In the first phase players collect cards for the second phase. In the second phase the object is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible. The last player left with cards in hand is the loser and becomes the skitgubbe.<br/><br/>Play in the first phase<br/>The first phase consists of tricks of 2 cards. The player to dealer's left leads first. Any card can be led and the player to the left of the leader plays any card to complete the trick. At this stage the suits have no significance and there is no requirement to follow suit. Each player draws a card from the stock immediately after playing, so that each player always has a hand of three cards so long as there are still cards in the stock. Whoever played the higher card wins the trick, places the two cards face down in front of himself, and leads to the next trick. If the player who led wins the trick, he leads again and the same two players are involved in the next trick.<br/><br/>If the two cards played to a trick are equal it is called a stunsa (bounce); the cards are left on the table, the two players each draw a card from the stock and the same player leads again. This continues until one of the players wins the trick and takes all the cards played, including the cards from the tied tricks.<br/><br/>In this first phase, the second player to a trick is under no obligation to try to beat the card led. If a low card is led the second player may wish to play lower and give the trick to the leader, for it is important to collect strong cards in the first phase of the game, so gain an advantage in the second phase.<br/><br/>Throughout the first phase, when it is your turn to play and there is still more than one card in the stock, instead of playing from your hand you may turn up the top card of the stock. If you turn a card from the stock you must play it - you may not put it in your hand.<br/><br/>The last card from the stock determines the trump suit for the second phase. The player who has to draw this card takes it but does not add it to his hand but keeps it face down until the first phase is over.<br/><br/>When the stock is exhausted, the play continues as long as possible with the cards players have in their hands. If some players have cards left in hand at the end of the first phase they keep them for the second phase. If the final trick of the first phase is a bounce, the players take back the cards they played to it and keep them for the second phase.<br/><br/>Play in the second phase<br/>The players have now divided the 52 cards between themselves, but the cards are probably not divided equally; some players have more cards than others. The player who drew the trump card leads. The object is to get rid of one's cards as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Now you must either beat the previous card played or pick it up. A card may be beaten by a higher card of the same suit, and a non-trump may be beaten by any trump. It is never lawful to duck. If you cannot or do not wish to beat the card in front of you, you must take it up into your hand, and it is then the next player's turn to lead to a new trick. If there is more than one card lying on the table and you cannot beat the last card played, it is only this last card which you must take up into your hand. It is then the next player's turn to beat the card which was underneath it.<br/><br/>A trick is complete when either:<br/><br/>the number of cards in it is equal to the number of players who were in the game when the trick began, or <br/>all its cards have been picked up. <br/>In the first case, the cards in the trick are set aside and the player who played last (and therefore highest) to the trick leads to the next. In the second case, the player to the left of the player who picked up the last card leads to a new trick. <br/>Suppose there are 3 players; player A has led and player B beaten A's card. If C now beats B's card, C puts aside the cards and leads to the next trick; but if C does not beat B's card but picks it up, it is now A's turn to beat the card showing on the table (which is in fact A's own lead). If A does this, and then B beats A's card, it is B who has completed the trick; B sets aside the three cards and leads to the next trick. Another possibility is: A leads, B beats A's card, C picks up B's card, and A picks up his own card. It is now B's lead.<br/><br/>Note that as players run out of cards, the number of cards in each trick reduces. If there are three players, one of whom runs out of cards during a trick, that trick still requires three cards to be completed (or all its cards to be picked up), but the next trick will require only two cards.<br/><br/>For example suppose there are 3 players: A, B, C. A leads his last card, B beats it, C picks B's card up, B beats A's card again, and now C beats B's card. The trick is now over, and C leads to the next trick. As there are now only two players, the new trick will have only two cards. Another example with three players: A leads; B beats with his last card, C picks this card up, and A picks up the card he led. It is now B's lead and the next trick will be complete with two cards.<br/><br/>A player who gets rid of all his cards can draw a sigh of relief, for he is not the loser. The loser is the player who is left with the last card in his hand, and is called &quot;Skitgubbe&quot; (or &quot;Mas&quot; or &quot;Mattis&quot;). Skitgubbe means &quot;dirty old man&quot; (in the sense of unwashed, rather than obscence); Mas and Mattis mean fool.&quot;<br/><br/>- Description and rules credited to John McLeod from his excellent website here:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.pagat.com/beating/mattis.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.pagat.com/beating/mattis.html</a><br/><br/>",

Each trapezoid is one of 6 colors and may contain a witch, a witchy object, or nothing at all.<br/><br/>Tiles must be played so that touching sides are the same color. As a result, colored triangular regions will form. These triangles are the way you score points.<br/><br/>In the basic game, each time you make a triangle using the same symbol (or entirely empty) you score 2 points.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, you start the game with one of the colors as your own, and if someone else scores with your color, they must share the points. Also, at the end of the game, if any of your witches are free along the edge of the board, you gain additional points. Witchy objects at the edge will cost you points.<br/><br/>The 3rd game is solitaire. The rules show 4 different shapes and you must try to lay all the tiles to form that shape while adhering to the normal placement rules. According to the rules, only the devil knows if those solitaire puzzles can be solved.<br/><br/>",

All of you are guests at the Earl of Simpleton&rsquo;s country estate, but some of you are trying to make off with his treasures undetected. Each round, a selected postmaster will choose some guests to send things out of the castle in the Royal Mail bag. The bag&rsquo;s contents are revealed at the end of the round, and Imposters score a point if any treasure has made its way into it.<br/><br/>Now it&rsquo;s time to figure out which of those chosen players put that treasure in there. Are they looking a bit shifty? Are they a bit quick to pass the blame to others? You have your suspicions, but let&rsquo;s see how they behave in the following rounds&hellip;The first team to five round victories wins the game, but the Innocents will win if they can unmask the Imposters before that point!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "End fast, but the grudge will last long!<br/><br/>Kongkang is a party card game based on a traditional card game from Southern Thailand called &quot;Kang&quot;. Players try to get rid of high cards and match those previously played to steal Banana tokens. When someone declares &quot;Kongkang&quot;, everyone reveals their hand, and the player who has the lowest hand wins the pot. After three rounds, the player with the most banana tokens wins!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the first round, deal 5 cards to each player. Everyone places 2 Banana tokens in the center of the table as a pot for the round. On your turn, you must perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>     Draw a card and play any number of identical cards. If they are special cards, resolve the action for each card.<br/>     Follow the card(s) played by the previous player. First, play any number of cards that match the followed card(s). Then, steal that many Banana tokens from that player. However, if that player also followed the previous player, instead steal from the player who first played the card(s).<br/>     Declare Kongkang. Everyone reveals all cards in their hand and compute their total value (with special card being worth 10). The player with the lowest total wins the round and claims all Banana tokens from the pot, where a tie goes to the one closest to (and including) the declarer in turn order. In addition, if the declarer didn't win, they discard half the Banana tokens to the game box.<br/><br/><br/>When a player draws the last card from the deck, the next player is forced to declare Kongkang. After the winner is determined, a new round begins with these changes.<br/><br/>     The winner of the round becomes the first player for the next round. <br/>     Players with the most Banana tokens place 4 tokens in the pot, and those with the fewest Banana tokens place 1 token. Everyone else places 2 tokens as usual.<br/><br/><br/>",

The British lancers can only move diagonally forward. The clockwork Russian pigs can only move orthogonally like a rook (again, never backward). The abandoned, unhappy horses are terrain pieces but can be moved like a pawn (but into any of the eight squares around it) if the dice are right. Movement is blocked by the horses, your opponent's pieces and your own pieces. However, if you can end a move on an opponent's piece, it is removed from the game. The first player to get three of his pieces to his opponent's start line (or prevents his opponent from winning) wins the game.<br/><br/>Each turn, two six-sided dice are rolled and the results, like in backgammon, can move one or two of your pieces. On a result of doubles, a player can move one horse and then take his regular move, or on any result of one, can move a horse instead of moving one of his pieces.<br/><br/>The game comes with a full colour 11&quot; x 17&quot; board (not mounted), 6 British Lancers on unicycles, 6 Russian clockwork pigs, and 6 forlorn-looking horses sitting on their rumps. All figures come unpainted. The pigs must be assembled. There is a one-page instruction sheet with a &quot;history&quot; of the battle on the back.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Couch of Power is a multi-player game where the object is to get the players of your team to occupy all the positions of the Couch of Power.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>Gather players and define the seating arrangements.  You need 1 more seat than there are players.  Therefore, if you have 10 players, you will need  11 seats.  In this way, there will always be one empty seat during the game.  Define the target goal - usually a couch (aka the Couch of Power) with room for four people.  Starting with the Couch of Power, fill up all positions in the seating area except, of course, the empty seat.<br/><br/>Hand out slips of paper to the players.  Each player writes their name on the slip.<br/><br/>Gather the slips up, and randomly distribute them back to the players.  Make sure each player does not receive back their own name.<br/><br/>Divide the players into two teams.  The easiest method is to take the current seating arrangement and alternately assign them to a team.  One effective method is simply having every other player roll up a pants leg or sleeve to indicate which team they are on.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/><br/>The game is played a number of rounds until the Couch of Power consists entirely of players from one team.<br/><br/>Every round, the person sitting to the left of the empty seat is the caller.  They get to call out a name.  The person holding the slip of paper with that name on it moves from their current spot to the empty seat.  The player now to the left of the newly vacated empty seat is the new caller.  Play continues in this manner until the Couch of Power consists entirely of players from one team.<br/><br/>The callers may not repeat the same name twice in a row.  This helps prevent a player from ping-ponging between two spots.<br/><br/>It's important for players to remember who is holding which name.  The game is a combination of strategy, memory, and luck.  Strategy - is it better to pull an opposing team member off the couch or place one of your members on the team?  Memory - you need to remember who is holding what name.  Luck - in the beginning of the game, who is holding what name is unknown.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nothing exciting ever happened in Hicksville, a small town in the middle of nowhere &ndash; until tonight when the town has been taken over by zombies! You and a group of survivors have taken shelter in the old mansion of a coffee baron, but unfortunately a horde of zombies has followed you. Trapped in the attic, you must plan to escape before the house is overrun and you all are turned into hideous undead.<br/><br/>In Turned, each player takes a character card and places his character in the attic. Shuffle the nine escape plan cards, then draw a number equal to one less than the number of players; these cards are placed face up so everyone can see them. Each card shows the equipment tiles that must be collected in order to escape from the mansion room named on the card; players can work toward completing any of the escape plans. Divide the equipment tiles into three piles based on color/symbol, shuffle them, and set them down as piles from which players can draw during the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player has four action points to spend; actions consist of moving to a new room, searching for equipment, trading equipment with other players, making noise, and using equipment. When players search or make noise, they attract zombies in the mansion toward that room. If a player is in a room with a zombie, he gets infected, and the disease progresses each turn until the player becomes a zombie himself &ndash; at which point he then wants to infect other players.<br/><br/>The first player to escape from the mansion wins. If no one escapes &ndash; because they've all been turned into zombies &ndash; then everyone but the last player to become a zombie wins.<br/><br/>",

On every midnight a howling is proof of the curse which has befallen the village: werewolves. The scared villagers are angry and torches are lit, a stake is piled up. Is it possible that one of their own has fallen victim of the curse? Distrust creeps into the hearts of the villagers.<br/><br/>Wolfmond is a game suitable for large groups. It ropes the players inevitably into the eery atmosphere of a cursed village. There they will find themselves in the roles of the villagers, which not only have to fear the werewolves but their own betraying peers as well ...<br/><br/>The game displays some sort of a theater play, in which each player plays a role to bring life in the forgotten village somehwere in the woods, which is plagued by Werewolves. Some players are the hidden werewolves which &quot;eat&quot; villagers each night. The villagers (including the Werewolves) vote each &quot;morning&quot; who is the suspect and &quot;burn&quot; him for venegance. During the &quot;night&quot; several characters affect the gameplay by using their special powers.<br/><br/>Wolfmond is a game set up in the Middle Ages, but the mechanics are based on the game Mafia from Dimitry Davidoff. The game contents various characters with different powers, as the Totengr&auml;ber, Meuchelm&ouml;rder, Medicus and the insane Jeremias which give the game a complete different gameplay.<br/><br/>The game includes 30 cards with many tattoo-like illustrated characters.<br/><br/>",

Build up your reputation while discrediting your opponents, but be careful! If any lead goes unreported or a story is inaccurate, the network ratings will fall.

The game's hard-coded database tracks questions by code, dollar value, and correct answer. A question's code is entered, the question is read aloud by a player, and a sliding door reveals four multiple-choice answers. Players race to buzz in, either to answer or to &quot;screw&quot; an opponent by forcing the opponent to answer. The game reveals whether or not players answer correctly and adjusts scores accordingly. High score after ten questions wins.<br/><br/>Includes 125 question cards with 500 total general knowledge questions. At least two expansions were released--a TV Pack and a Movies Pack--each adding 113 cards with 450 (TV) or 452 (Movies) additional questions in the set's given subject.

Combat is card--driven, each player playing from a hand of five cards. There are Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry cards, of various values; you're allowed to play up to one of each kind when attacking or defending. Joker cards can substitute for any given type. You can play your entire hand of five cards if you wish, but you only draw two per turn, so this could leave you exposed.<br/><br/>Treason cards allow you to take over a non-contiguous land; Desertion cards allow you to get army cards from another player. The Revolution cards are very powerful as they will take over an entire continent! Luckily, there are Counter-Revolution cards in the deck as defense.<br/><br/>A refreshing change from Risk, and certainly playable in a lot less time.<br/><br/>",

But even better hunters.<br/><br/>A day's journey downriver, at the edge of the forest there, live the men who call themselves the Treg. They have learned to reap the bounties of the water. They harvest<br/>the river with nets woven of soft, pliable reeds and roots; and make stories out of symbols painted on hides.<br/><br/>On the broad open plains to the south live the Marmar. Who plant seeds, and raise animals for work and food. They are a peaceful people, desiring only to be left alone. And the strong walls they have built around their village do much to help them maintain their solitude.<br/><br/>Lastly are the Dermen, who are a tribe of raiders. They know the land well, being so traveled -- getting direction from the patterns in the stars. They go wherever the warmth of the sun and the wealth of nature lead them. And if they cannot find food enough for themselves, they simply take it... from others.<br/><br/>Welcome to the World of Nomad...<br/><br/>Nomad is a game based on the life and times of the early tribal societies at the dawning of the Neolithic Age. It is the story of their growth and expansion, their struggles against the elements of a harsh and unforgiving, prehistoric world, full of rivals and predators; every day, a walk through the borderlands between perseverance and<br/>extinction.<br/><br/>As the chieftain of one of these early tribes, it will be your job to make the decisions that lead your people to prosperity.

        "description": "In English the title means Swimmers in the Desert which for some will give away the &quot;setting&quot; as that of the novel and film, THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.<br/><br/>The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.<br/><br/>The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.<br/><br/>When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.<br/><br/>",

Unbeknownst to you, your life is about to change. You curse the postman, as the remains of the shattered letterbox (splinters and all) litter the hall carpet, and a chill Monday-morning breeze whistles through your dressing gown and up the ample trouser of your well-worn pajamas. But this concerns you not, for ripping open the letter reveals a simple house brick with a piece of paper wrapped around it, and a small yellow sticky note attached to the red clay top. The sticky label reads:<br/><br/>&quot;THROW ME THROUGH YOUR FRONT WINDOW&rdquo;<br/><br/>Stepping out into the blank a.m. you tut loudly at the myriad gnomes in next door&rsquo;s garden before launching the plain building component, with fullest force, through the ornate Georgian bay window &lsquo;pon abode&rsquo;s frontage. Screaming with blue murder and foulest language, you first run into your house, and then emerge again a second later bellowing: &ldquo;what b*****d did that?&rdquo; You look to your left and, thence, to your right in vain hope of catching sight of the vandalistic culprit. Cursing under your breath, you return again to your home and gently close the door.<br/><br/>The house brick silently mocks you, your moral outrage, and your &lsquo;Mr. Bunny&rsquo; slippers, lying as it does on one of its long sides &ndash; the attached paper is crumpled, but intact. Sweaty-palmed, you pull the note away from its stony guardian and flatten the creased message before reading:<br/><br/>&ldquo;My dear nephew,<br/>Please forgive my indirectness (and the fact that you may not actually be my nephew) but I have been told (by the giant clams that live on my face) that I have so many relatives that it is nigh on impossible to remember all of your names; so I shall (instead) resort to the simple nomenclature &lsquo;nephew&rsquo;. My mind is not what it used to be &ndash; indeed, it used to be a liver &ndash; that being said, I address you as one of the potential beneficiaries of my capacious legacy! &ldquo;Your capacious legacy?&rdquo; I hear you cry &ndash; Yes! You will, with a bit of luck, by this time next week, be quite incredibly and most-certainly indecently wealthy. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; I hear you retort. The answer is very simple &ndash; you will attend my funeral this coming Friday and, once the merriment and festivity has subsided, you will kill everyone else in the house. That&rsquo;s all &ndash; nothing complicated. The last person alive in the building when Monday (and my tall solicitor) comes will inherit my vast fortune, my enormous financial holdings, and my capacious legacy!<br/><br/>Best Wishes<br/>Great Uncle Sir Hesketh Goodbody Three-Choirs Overcoat (Deceased)<br/><br/>PS. Bring a Bottle.<br/>PPS.

The game has a deck of cards showing tasks, such as word puzzles, drawing puzzles and building with little wooden blocks. The quarter-board shows a crazy room and you progress from task to task until you reach to the finish.<br/><br/>",

Players buy farms and herds and make money by selling milk.  Along the way they are beset by various random events, hold auctions, switch herds with other players, and perform other actions along these lines.  The game ends when a player makes it to the end of the board.  The player with the most assets when the game ends is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Until tonight you knew each other only by your 'alias'.  You have been having intimate 'parties' on-line in your private chat room &quot;The Steam Room&quot; for about a year now, but never in person.  You finally, after all this time, decided to meet to celebrate the on-line engagement of 'Love_King&quot; and 'Zenia'.<br/><br/>It was during cocktails that the lights went out.  Immediately after, a serving tray of glasses fell crashing to the floor.  When the lights went back on, the waiter and a Black Widow spider were lying on the floor.  Both were dead.  None of you had any idea who the waiter was.  Someone reached into his pocket and looked into his wallet.  His name was Alfred Weekes.  How could that be...Alfred Weekes 'Love_King' is right here sitting with you and very much alive.  Or is he...<br/><br/>The Suspects:<br/><br/>Cassandra Lippard &quot;Sorceress&quot;: She was sweet, caring...perfect in every way.  They called her a &quot;goddess&quot;...or would the &quot;devil's consort&quot; be more fitting?<br/><br/>Pierce Cameron &quot;Terminator&quot;: Inhumanly calm, cool and collected.  Nothing fazed him.  When there was a job to be done he was your man.<br/><br/>Roland Patterson &quot;Hotrod&quot;: A 'free spirit' without a care in the world.  He traveled around the country with his Harley Davidson, his laptop...and one big attitude.<br/><br/>Stuart Binks &quot;Latrodectus&quot;: A computer whiz whose first love was a Commodore 64.  He didn't have many social skills.  How was he with murder?<br/><br/>Eliza Kelly &quot;Zenia&quot;: Alfred's fiancee.  Her dream was to be happily married and have a family.  Had she found her Love King or had her dream turned into a nightmare?<br/><br/>Alfred Weekes &quot;Love_King&quot;: He was madly in love with Eliza.  Her happiness was all that mattered to him.  How far would he go to keep her happy?<br/><br/>Jessie Raven &quot;Nympho&quot;: No man could settle her down.  She couldn't get enough.  Did she resort to murder to satisfy her urges?<br/><br/>Phyllis Birch &quot;Wildcat&quot;: Shy and withdrawn until she places her fingers on that keyboard and turns into a fierce tiger waiting to pounce.<br/><br/>",

On Wednesdays, each player purchases inventory.  Tuesdays and Fridays are pay days (you collect your profits).  Sunday, you negotiate.<br/><br/>There are 21 cities.  In each, there can only be one franchise of any kind!  Opening the franchise costs money, of course, but you must also maintain a certain level of inventory for the franchise to operate.  Revenues fluctuate by die roll, one die per player --applied to all of his franchises.<br/><br/>At the end of the month, you total cash on hand plus the ground breaking value of your franchises.  Most money wins.<br/><br/>",

This is achieved by traveling along the board and entering rodeos as they are reached.  Various mishaps can occur, such as hospital stays, and there are the expected expenses along the way.  Once you've garnered two trophies, you can enter the National Finals, at the end of the game track.  Once there, you enter events repeatedly, until the entire Finals purse is gone.  You must therefore decide whether to stop at every rodeo on the way to the Finals (which will garner money and trophies but leaves the Finals purse vulnerable to faster players) or charge there as quickly as possible (assuming the prerequisites have been achieved).<br/><br/>The copyright indicates the game was revised in 1981 and 1987.<br/><br/>",

Built on simplicity of game piece movement, TRIAD plays rapidly, but, to win, requires an uncommon accomplishment. You must achieve three unique outcomes: a Trap, a Capture and a Score.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board crisscrossed by lines in three directions.  Tiles are played on the intersections and remain where they are played unless captured.  Pawns are played inside the triangles and move from space to space.  The object of the game is to complete scores, traps and captures; once one of those is accomplished, a new round is played.  The first person to accomplish one of each is the winner; once you've accomplished one, you are not allowed to repeat that.<br/><br/>A score is accomplished by moving a pawn from your goal to the opponent's goal.  A trap is accomplished by trapping an opponent's pawn so that it cannot move.  A capture is accomplished by capturing ten of your opponent's tiles.<br/><br/>",

The game may instead be played by up to 8 players if players divide evenly into two teams, with each player controlling a certain number of characters in the game.<br/><br/>The game board is a square grid map of the Murphy Pirate base. Three scenarios are included in which the Crushers must infiltrate the base. In two scenarios, the Crushers must rescue the kidnapped scientist, Matua. In the third scenario, the Crushers must assassinate the pirate leader, Big Murphy.<br/><br/>The game uses an action point system, breaking away from the standard Movement Phase/Combat Phase turn order of earlier Atsutoshi Okada simulation game designs. This gave players more options for how to play their characters (by sacrificing movement in order to invest more time in attacking, for example), but was not quite satisfactory to Okada (as per Crusher Joe rule book designer's notes). This action point system would later inspire and evolve into Okada's &quot;Action Pattern&quot; mechanic, which debuted in Macross: City Fight (as per Macross: City Fight rule book designer's notes).<br/><br/>",

Your computer is damaged, and your ship is leaking fuel and oxygen. To complete your mission and return home, you will need to find three missing items and put them in your spaceship. Sound simple? Not so fast. You can get them only by entering three walled cities. To do that, you must collect Biocodes, and put them together in the right sequence and pattern combinations that unlock the cities' gates.<br/><br/>Biocodes and Brain Development:<br/>(serious stuff for parents and teachers)<br/><br/>DNA keeps making headlines. Kids may not be ready to learn the difficult terminology, but Metanon:The Biocode Adventure prepares them to grasp the basic concepts of DNA. All players use the game's biocode pieces in different combinations. Why is this shape and color matching important? Just by playing the game, kids begin to understand how DNA works. This form of learning is one of the most effective ways of preparing young brains. The critical skills learned in Metanon:The Biocode Adventure help kids excel in school and ultimately in life.<br/><br/>At kSERO Corporation, Inc. we create games that help young children develop their cognitive and analytic skills. Our games are designed and tested by noted scientists and educators, using the latest discoveries in FUN and brain research.<br/><br/>",

Players move the selection disk like a Chess queen, capturing the first number disk along the selection disk's move. If no such capture can be made the player may move the selection disk to any space containing a number disk.<br/><br/>When all 48 number disks are captured the player with the longest chain of sequential numbers (i.e., 13-14-15-16) wins. The game can also be played for points, where chains score points based upon their length. There is also a trading variant, in which twice during the game players can force a trade of a piece for a unconnected piece of another player.<br/><br/>In the solitaire game players try to have only chains of six of more pieces, and cannot merge chains.<br/><br/>The ASS edition appears to be identical to the GAMES edition except that in the four-player trading variant players can only trade once, and a &quot;49&quot; disk is included for some reason.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a tile laying game that has math at its base. The object of the game is to be the first one to get rid of your numbers by making examples. There are three kinds of tiles: Number tiles from 0 to 9, equal sign tiles, and math function tiles (+, -, X, and /).<br/><br/>At the start of the game the number tiles are randomly drawn by the players until they have all been drawn. The function tiles are left face down to be drawn one at a time when its your turn.<br/><br/>On your turn you try to make a math equation using your number tiles and the function tile that you drew this turn.<br/><br/>Example you have numbers 0, 1, 4, 6 in your hand and you draw a + tile. On your turn you would  pick up an = tile and then play  4 + 6 = 1 0. The next player would then build off of the original equation either horizontally or vertically.<br/><br/>",

A piece can capture any piece with a lower value. However a trumpeter will lose to any piece which attacks it but will defeat the number eight knight if it attacks. If two knights of the same strength meet the attacker wins.<br/><br/>Like in Dou Shou Qi the trumpeter (the Rat in Dou Shou Qi) is the only piece allowed to go through the fenced off areas (the river in Dou Shou Qi). However, unlike in Dou Shou Qi, it is the seven and eight knights (the Elephant and Lion in Dou Shou Qi) who can jump over the fenced off areas.<br/><br/>The game is essentially what R.C. Bell has described as the Jungle Game. The theme has just been changed from jungle animals to knights. See The Board Game Book, or Board and Table Games from many Civilizations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A very early offering from Games Workshop, and apparently an ancestor of what would become Warhammer 40,000, Spacefarers is &quot;a set of science fiction skirmish rules designed specifically for the Spacefarers range of figures manufactured by Citadel Miniatures Ltd... The rules have been designed for two players to carry out small scale skirmishes with each player in control of a unit of Imperial Marines, Dark Disciples, Star Patrolmen, or independent gangs.&quot;<br/><br/>Most of the rules are pretty standard tabletop miniature skirmish rules.  Each unit may move a certain number of inches per turn, may fire a ranged weapon, and/or engage in close combat with models in close proximity.  No grid is used for movement, a ruler is used to measure linear distances.<br/><br/>Unlike the massive armies sported by the game's descendants, Spacefarers focuses on single squads, and allows for more detail, such as rudimentary hit location, along with different armor protection for each location, and individually equipped models.  The game appears to have much more in common with games like Necromunda or Mordheim in this respect.<br/><br/>The rules are short, only 44 pages, with sparse hand-drawn artwork; not a single photograph is used.  Two introductory scenarios are included, rules are included for constructing your own forces.  Depending on which force you choose to represent, you get a certain amount of &quot;money&quot; to use to buy equipment, and the rules indicate how large your squad will be (in one case, it's random!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A baseball game that concentrates on the pitcher/batter match up. Each pitcher has 6 types of pitches they can throw. The pitcher selects a pitch card and places the card face down (the batter will only know if it's a 'slow' or 'fast' pitch), and places the ball on a square representing the location of the ball. The batter choosing to let the ball pass (if he thinks it'll be a ball), to bunt, or swing. To swing, he places the bat over 4 locations where he thinks the ball may end up. The pitcher then reveals the pitch, and rolls a die to see how many spaces and what direction the pitch moves to determine the final location of the pitch. Curve balls will move a few spaces inwards, a sinker downwards, and so on.<br/><br/>If the ball is hit, the batter rolls a die, and adds a bonus based on which of the 4 locations he covered the ball was thrown to (he may have a +4 to any pitch thrown to the upper right location, but no bonus for the other three squares, for example). For the most part, the higher the roll the better, and you get the results for the hit, such as double play, hit, double, and so on.<br/><br/>The sixth in Grapac Japan's series of games under the label &quot;Aeronaut&quot;. They are meant to be very fast playing (around 15-30 minutes). They all come in a file-type holder, with the inside of the file being the game board, and all of the components attached to the ring binder in bags and pouches.<br/><br/>",

(The cards are paid ads.)<br/><br/>Players secretly select cards from their collection and simultaneously reveal them.  Normally a company beats a person, a person beats a game and a game beats a company.  However, if one card lists the other (i.e., the person worked for the company) then the victory is reversed.  Ties are broken according to the star, diamond and shield stats on the cards.  (Compare stars, diamonds and shields in that order until the tie is broken.)  The star statistic is dependent on the Origins awards and is equal to nominations + 2*wins + 5*hall_of_fame_listings.  Every autograph on the card that matches a name listed on the card is worth an additionally 5 stars.<br/><br/>The second set of cards should appear at the 2004 Origins convention (the 2003 Origins convention was supposed to have the second set, but there were problems).

        "description": "Hoplite Warfare (650-330BC) tabletop Miniatures rules<br/><br/>These rules are designed to simulate the warfare of Archaic and Classical Greece, from the rise of the Hoplite (along with the polis as the typical political unit in Greece) to his eclipse by other systems and the decline of the polis as an important institution. By extension, the rules also cover areas and times where other races were equipped as and fought in the same style as Hoplites; The rules will also cover races and civilizations which clashed with Hoplite armies.<br/><br/>The period of Hoplite domination in the Mediterranean we have taken as beginning c.675 B.C. However, there can be no set date for the end of the Hoplite. In the Eastern Mediterranean world we have taken the battle of Gaugamela 331 B.C.; in Italy we have taken c. 386 B.C. when at the Allia a Roman Hoplite-style army was defeated by Gauls, signaling the end of Hoplite tactics in Italy; but in Sicily Hoplites still seem to have been dominant till the time of Agathokles (d. 285 B.C.). Thus, unlike the established ideas in ancient wargaming, these rules are restricted to a narrow time span and a limited geographical area. They do not pretend to universalize, nor are they immutable dogma &mdash; they may be adapted to suit the individual wargamers research.<br/><br/>",

Can be used with 15mm appropriate figures, players will need to provide at least 1 6-sided DIE for each player, a 6-Ft. Tape measure, a Protractor for determining Gunfire &amp; Observation, Artillery Facing changes, Gatling Gun Firing Arcs, and Cannon &amp; Howitzer firing arcs.<br/><br/>It is suggested that players provide Figures for their characters in the following positions: on Horseback; on Foot; Kneeling; Prone. I would also suggest Figures displaying various armaments such as Pistol wielding, Rifle Armed, Knife or Sabre displayed, etc. The Rules CAN also be used for 25mm Figures and there are annotations in ( ) for this scale. There are Character Record, Artillery Record, and Horse Record Sheets which will have to be copied in order to provide enough for everyone. It is suggested that each Player control no more than 6 Characters per playing. There is a Pregenerated Character List to help gets things started quickly, but most folks will want to create their &quot;own&quot; Old West figure they have in mind. Players will find a Regional Map of the Plains section of the U.S.A. with various Native Areas located upon it and State's borders with numerous Forts &amp; Towns of the &quot;Old West&quot;. There is even a &quot;Detail&quot; map of an imaginary &quot;Old West&quot; area for assistance in starting up a Campaign for whatever the player's desire. The Back Pages of the Rules Booklet contain Movement Charts, Movement Modifiers, Skill Challenge Damage Chart, Observation Modifiers, General Skill Challenge Modifiers, Missile Combat Chart, Melee Combat Chart, Campaign Observation Modifiers, and Weapon &amp; Range Chart.<br/><br/>The Sequence of Play is as follows: 1.Initiative; 2.Movement; 3.Observation; 4.Missile Combat; 5.Melee Combat; 6.Artillery Fire; 7.Static Actions. NOT all of these will be followed since not everyone will be using some such as Artillery everytime. During Static Actions, players will do anything NOT covered in previous phases, such as Draw Weapons, Reload, Gamble at the Saloon, etc. There are even provisions allowed for conducting a Campaign while it is suggested that a Referee be employed for obvious reasons. The Designer has included some of the more well known names of Western characters as well as the better recognized encounters. Another section provides a Bibliography for Western Novel Authors, Western Themed Movies, and Western Non-Fiction books.

        "description": "From the Introduction:&quot;The Energy Crisis Game is an instructive introduction to the complexities of energy management. Get involved in the challenge of planning our nation's energy reserves&quot;.<br/><br/>The Game Equipment consists of the following: a mounted Gameboard; a tri-folded Rules sheet; 1-(6)-sided DIE; 60-Ration Cards; 1-Coupon Disbursement Packet; 6-Various COLOR Ration Coupon Cards; 20-Barter Certificates; &amp; $2,140 in various denominations ($10s,$50s,&amp;$100s).<br/><br/>The OBJECT of the Game is to Collect(through buying, selling, bartering, or auctioning), one of EACH of the SAME Color Ration Coupons which are portrayed upon their COLOR Ration Coupon Card. There are various spaces on the gameboard which indicate when a Player can: Collect an amount of Money; Sell, Buy, or Choose a Ration Coupon for some amount of money, BARTER with some other eligible Player, Collect another BARTER Certificate, and on the Supply &amp; Demand spaces-an AUCTION will take place with the Player landing there acting as Auctioneer. There are 2 LARGE Sections of the gameboard designated the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; and &quot;Coupon Disbursement Center&quot; with a &quot;canceled Ration Coupons&quot; place for when there are less than (6)-Players participating. On each of the COLOR Ration Coupons Cards, there are (3)Sections denoting INDUSTRY, CONSUMER, &amp; GOVERNMENT requirements.      <br/> To Start the Game, each Player chooses a Color Pawn and a COLOR Ration Coupon Card, which DOES NOT have to BE of the SAME Color as their PAWN, and then picks one of the (4) corners of the BOARD to begin from. The Players are NOT allowed to perform any action depicted in the CORNER space they begin IN.  <br/> Before starting the Game, MIX &amp; place ALL 60 Ration Coupons within the Packet. Then PICK someone to be the Treasurer and then 3 Ration Coupons are picked from the Packet and placed FACE-UP in the Energy Market Section of the gameboard. The Players are EACH given $200 and starting with the Treasurer(banker), randomly pick (5) Ration Coupons from the Packet, placing ANY identically corresponding ones on his OWN Ration Coupon Card. This is performed until EACH Player is left with (5) Ration Coupons in their hand.<br/><br/>Then the DIE is rolled by EACH Player with the HIGHEST Rolling Player going first, RE-Rolling the DIE and MOVING in a clockwise direction from where they Started, &amp; then performing any Action as dictated by the space they've landed on. This is performed on every TURN so the ORDER in which Players MOVE and CONDUCT any ACTIONS can be different each TURN. When a Player Lands on the Supply &amp; Demand space, they MUST then Auction ALL (3)Ration Coupons one at a time, in the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; and can even participate in the Auction, then the next Player can take their Turn. Once the Auctions are completed, then the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; is replenished with (3)MORE Ration Coupons picked randomly from the Packet. When a Player lands on a Barter space, he is considered to be the &quot;Head Broker&quot; for any Barter offers. Bartering can only be conducted between the &quot;Head Broker&quot; and another Player as long as THAT Player has a Barter Certificate and once concluded, then a Barter Certificate is given up by the BARTERING Player but NOT the &quot;Head Broker&quot;, and placed back with the &quot;Bank&quot;. The &quot;Head Broker&quot; can listen to ALL eligible offers and even REFUSE them if they are insufficient to his desires. There are further detailed RULES for Auctioning and Bartering contained in the rather concise RULES sheet.<br/><br/>",

Return Interceptions or fumbles from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;-109&quot; yards for a touchdown. Block a kick, return it, and fumble it back over to the kicking team! It is great that all this excitement can be found in a game that can be played almost  anywhere , by yourself or with a friend. Since it only takes a short time to play, you can get a few friends together and play a whole season, and you don't even have to play it during football season! How to play?  The cards are shuffled by the offensive player after each change of possession. Then the deck of cards is cut by the defensive player. At this point, the offensive player begins by turning every third card to determine the outcome of each play. Strategy:  The offensive player must decide on when to punt, kick a field goal, go for a first down or call a time out when needed. Everyone wins with this game, because the end result is ALL-IN-THE-CARDS.<br/><br/>",

Two different GoBots are represented on each card. For example, a card may have two pictures of Leader-1, and two pictures of Cop-Tur. Or, it could have three pictures of Royal-T, and only one of Cy-Kill. (Cards always have either 2+2 or 3+1 pictures.)<br/><br/>On their turn, a player draws one card from the draw deck or the discard pile. If at least one of the four pictures on that card is of the GoBot that the player is trying to collect, they keep it and play if face up on the table. All of the cards a player collects are placed side by side, in front of him. If the card drawn doesn't pictures the player's GoBot, the player discards it face down.<br/><br/>There are also five Zap Cards. When a player draws a zap card, he places it on top of (covering, or &quot;zapping&quot;) any four pictures on an opponent's cards, either over one whole card, or overlapping it to cover one half of two different cards.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who is the first to collect ten pictures of their GoBot.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Taken from the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The Artifact takes us in a fantasy world far away, where humans, magical and evil creatures can be easily found walking around, just as in any Tolkien-inspired game. Players take up the role of one of these heroes (a Human, a Dwarf, an Elf and a Hobbit, indeed) and must recover their weapon, which is proved to be the only mean to destroy a powerful Artifact that is trying to put under its control the whole world. The path to the Mountain of Fate, the place where the Artifact is giving out its will, is full of dangerous creatures such as Trolls, Orcs and the mighty Black Knight. During his turn, the player rolls two different colored six-sided dice, thus determining both his hero movement and which of the evil character will be moved by the player sitting to his right. You got it: players are trying both to win advantage for their heroes and to stop the other players' ones at the same time. And if it's not your lucky day, you may even change the outcome you have rolled, but are you ready to pay its price, giving your opponents a free move? The game gets even more interesting because each evil character has its own special ability, and the map represents different types of terrain: each hero has a favored type of terrain (e.g. woods for the Elf) where he can peacefully rest and plan his next moves. Last but not least, there is also the possibility of casting a powerful spell and then bend evil characters' wills to yours...<br/><br/>This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.<br/><br/>",

A deck of 98 cards (printed in black and red) is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards.  The current player or storyteller begins to read a story from the story book and stops at the first blank.  The storyteller then flashes the bookmark to let the player know what color card can be used to fill in the blank as indicted in the story book.  If the player has an appropriate word card of the right color, the player reads the card aloud and discards the card.  If the player is unable to play an appropriate card, they must draw the next card from the deck.  That card must be played if possible.  If the card cannot be played, play passes to the next player to attempt to fill the blank.  Each of the word cards is worth from five to fifteen points.  At the end of each story, players add the cards remaining in their hand and scores are recorded.  A full game consists of twelve stories.  The player with the lowest score after the last story wins.<br/><br/>",

The roll-up board has to be set up to play: stretch the canvas board over the provided sticks and legs, and it makes a little table that not only stands up well on the beach, it actually requires sand to stand up well as it's a little wobbly on its own...  The pieces are all wooden, and there are no cards to lose or get wet - it really does play well at the beach.  (You can just lay the canvas board flat on your gaming table if not at the beach.)<br/><br/>Each player has four baby turtles, just hatched, which must get to the sea.  These start on your edge of the board, on little cracked-egg spaces.  First player to get all four turtles off the board wins.  (The sea is represented by a space at the center of the board, a little disconcerting ...)  Each turn you roll one die and move any one turtle the number showing, with no backtracking.<br/><br/>Other wooden pieces on the board are dunes.  You cannot cross a dune: you have to land on one exactly.  In so doing, you remove it from the board and must place it on some other space.  Your best option, of course, is somewhere that blocks your opponent ...<br/><br/>Landing on an opponent's turtle sends it back to a start space.<br/><br/>Two of the dune pieces have crabs on the back, which can be used in an optional rule.

        "description": "From the rules:<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION: BEACHCOMBER was created by two world sailors. After rounding Cape Hatteras in a 60' schooner, they found refuge from the storm in Silver Lake Harbor on Orcacoke Island. During their stay on Ocracoke they found the Outer Banks life-style so unique that they were inspired to capture that feeling, and the game of Beachcomber came to life.<br/><br/>BASIC SUMMARY: This is a card game in the vein of Mille Bornes. One's goal is to collect the most shells (similar to mileage cards). The quantity of shells one can pick up is based on the mode of transportation (food, bike, 4x4), and there are various problems that can slow you down (soft sand, no reservation, hot sand). You must be on vacation to collect shells (similar to the Go card), and there are things that can frustrate the vacation (hotel bill, food bill, beach gear bill, and gas bill); bills can be addressed with money or &quot;super solutions.&quot;<br/><br/>",

You have to cut out the 200 cards to create the game.  The rules take up half a single sheet of the cardstock.<br/><br/>Before beginning, shuffle the cards and then choose the size of the deck used in the game.  All 200 cards would make for a very long game and is not recommended except for masochists.  The shortest variant is simply to use the initial six cards dealt you and no more.  They also give estimated playing times for 50 and 100 cards.<br/><br/>Game play is reminiscent of Once Upon a Time.  There are no &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; cards, however: you choose a card from your initial hand to be your ending card.  The cards have phrases or single words on them, largely relevant to the individual genre.  On your turn, you play a single card, weave it into the story, and then draw a card from the draw pile.  Play then passes to the next player, who does the same.  Players may boo and heckle your input, in which case you have to do it over.  This game is definitely concerned more with the quality of story than competition.<br/><br/>In fact, victory conditions are very understated.  Once the draw deck is finished and you've played your last card, on your turn you may then play your ending card, provided you can work it into the story sufficiently well (without getting disdain from your fellow players).  You then win the game, but the game (story) doesn't end until everyone has finished with their cards, also!<br/><br/>Clearly not for competitive players, these games are more a pastime than a game.<br/><br/>The designers also list options for mixing the decks: romance in space or fantasy horror, for example.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Villages is one of the first &quot;boardgames&quot; ported from a computer game.  Unfortunately, that means you have to do all the bookkeeping on paper that the computer could do easily.  Most players will find it a bit tedious to constantly have to calculate and record population, crops, seed, food, weapons, etc.  However, we sometimes play it at a restaurant while waiting for the food to come - it's not a bad way to pass the time, really, when you don't have less portable games around.<br/><br/>The game consists of a rules/events booklet, three six-sided dice, and a pad of record sheets.  The game is set in a mythical Renaissance-era kingdom, with each player playing a separate village in that kingdom.  You can trade goods with each other each turn, but can only attack others when you roll a &quot;1&quot; for an event table.<br/><br/>To play, each player takes a record sheet (you may need more than one per person, depending on how long the game lasts) and a pencil.  Determine first player, and write down your starting village: 5 each of people, gold, land, food, and seed.  The seed can go into either the ground as crops or storage - you should have some of each for safety.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she rolls the three dice.  The red die tells you which table to look under: Attacks, Catastrophes, Good Times, Mixed Events, All Players Involved, or More Mixed Events.  The green (or yellow in some sets) die is then the &quot;tens&quot; digit, and the white die the &quot;ones&quot; digit.  So a roll of 5, 4, 1 means you look at event #41 on table 5.  (That's a bad one, a plague, but it's bad for everybody ...)<br/><br/>Once a player has resolved an event, ALL players Harvest crops, make weapons, get people, eat food, barter with other players or the King, store food and seed, plant seed - record this on your sheet with a pencil.  You assign your people to weapon making or harvesting - they can't do both in the same turn.  Then the next player takes their turn at the event table, after which ALL players repeat the harvest, weapons, food, seed, etc.  This is the part that drives some people crazy - there's a LOT of record keeping.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player reaches either 20 land units, 200 gold, or reaches a population of 35 people.  If you do one of these, you win.<br/><br/>",

The players decide who moves first. Then the first player places 1 tile in any of the intersections on the board and the second player does likewise on any unoccupied intersection. Note:  2 players may occupy the center intersection. This is the only point that 2 players can occupy at the same time. The tiles are placed on top of each other. Each player then alternates turns placing a tile on the board with the aim of forming Quirks until all tiles are entered. If any Quirks are made during the placing down of the tiles, the players take one of the opponent's tiles from the board per Quirk.<br/><br/>After all tiles are placed on the board, the players alternate turns moving a tile per turn to unoccupied intersections of the board. A player cannot jump over a tile and can only move along a straight line. A player may move through more than one intersection as long as it is unoccupied. Squares can be formed in 34 ways and when they are formed the player calls &quot;quirk&quot; and removes one opposing tile from the board. The opponent then takes his/her turn. A player who makes a Quirk and does not call it can have a tile removed by his/her opponent in his/her turn. The opponent can call it, take a tile, and then go on and make his/her move. A player who makes a Quirk cannot make the exact Quirk in a later turn unless all 4 tiles have been at least once removed from the corners.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Double Morphus has a frame you assemble, 18 tiles (nine with yellow circles and nine with orange circles), 20 energy discs in two colors, 2 pawns in two colors (&quot;trovers&quot;), and 6 small pawns in two colors (&quot;guards&quot;). To start the game, you assemble the frame pieces, which create a space large enough to hold 20 tiles. Players alternate placing tiles in the frame - each player places the tiles with his opponent's color on them. When finished there will be two empty spaces in the maze. Put an energy token on a every circle of its color, and each player starts with one energy token in their reserve. Trovers and guards are placed in opposite corners and the movement part of the game begins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move all your pieces. Guards can move up to five spaces orthogonally, while trovers can move like guards but also diagonally.<br/><br/>Trovers are the only pieces that can pick up energy tokens - you can only collect your own color. Guards simply block your opponent's trover, though if he pays one energy token he can move by a guard. The tiles create a two-level maze, with ramps printed on the tiles to change between levels, and walls occasionally to force movement around them. You can pay one energy token to have your trover jump down from the upper level to an adjacent lower level space.<br/><br/>If you spend an energy token, you can &quot;morph&quot; the maze: move a tile to an adjacent empty space. You may do this as much as you like and can afford during a turn. Morphing does not allow you to rotate a tile, only slide it to an adjacent, empty space.<br/><br/>The first player to collect all nine energy tokens of his color on the board wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt a number of City cards at the start and the aim is then to visit every one of those cities. The winner is the one who gets to all of them first. However, things are never simple when you travel and you may well encounter road blocks or be affected by chance. Chance cards can send you in entirely the opposite direction - to Minsk, for example, when you are hoping to get to Dublin - but they can also give you a free airline ticket or allow you to send another player to somewhere like Kishinev. If you're hazy about where exactly Kishinev is, then you certainly need to play  Discovering Europe.<br/><br/>",

The mystery words are all linked to a central theme and appear in a crossword pattern on the card... Players take turns to call out letters and patterns soon begin to appear. From that moment it's a tense battling race to reveal all six of your opponent's words before they guess yours. Scirmish is a top quality game that comes with enough pre-printed grids to play a hundred times without repetition. Additional cards are currently available free to customers via our web site.

As the machine rotates, the cards that are loaded spin and are slowly revealed.  When a player thinks that they can use a card that is in the machine, they press the switch in front of them to stop the tower.  They then have to take the card that is in front of them and use it with any number of the six cards in their hand to make a word.  Points are scored based on the number of letters used in the word.  Players play to an arbitrary point total.<br/><br/>Like a number of Ideal games, this game is based around a contraption.  The cards have letters that are formatted to be difficult to discern when only partly revealed.<br/><br/>",

In the basic game, players are familiarized with the Arena rules, which stress fairness among participants.  Once players have a good grasp of the game mechanics, they can move onto the Optional Rulers [sic] for a more challenging game.<br/><br/>BattleBots consists of two parts, construction and team play.  During construction, players design their own 'Bots based upon the scenario being played.  After the players have recorded their 'Bots on 'Bot sheets, they are ready to enter the arena.&quot;<br/><br/>This is a very small game--it came in a CD jewel case.  The components consist of six small different colored stand-up paper counters representing the BattleBots, an &quot;arena,&quot; and log sheets for the characteristics of one's BattleBot.

The mechanics are straightforward roll-and-move, but several interesting drafting rules are included to give players meaningful choices.  Players are encouraged to race multiple cars, and it is suggested that one neutral &quot;pack car&quot; be in the race for every player.  As a result, there are usually ten to fifteen cars dashing around the track, which helps the game simulate the &quot;tradin' paint&quot; feel of stock car racing.<br/><br/>The game does not come with cars, but Matchbox (or similarly-sized) cars work very nicely.  Flags were made for Texas International and Pocono Speedway, among others.<br/><br/>",

Units range from companies to brigades, with the Soviets having larger units.<br/><br/>Game uses an IGO-HUGO system with opportunities for the non-phasing player to take defensive anti-tank fire. There are 3 kinds of combat: barrage, anti-tank (done by firepower) and assault (done by odds ratio). Combat results are disruptions, morale checks (yielding retreats), step losses and eliminations.<br/><br/>The Kustrin scenario is the smaller of the 2 and lasts 12 turns. It uses fewer counters than Seelow and is more of a learning scenario.<br/><br/>For the Seelow scenario, there are 12 turns - there is a chance the game can end after turn 7, otherwise the action continues 5 more turns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an old Parker Brothers track game where players learn to identify various species of birds. The game board depicts various paths running through the countryside. Bird cards are shuffled and dealt onto the 12 sight locations indicated by bird silhouettes.<br/><br/>On a turn, you spin the spinner and follow the result. If it is a number, you move along the paths the number of spaces indicated. If you spin the word &quot;Fly&quot;, you move any stack of bird cards to any other sight location (usually away from an opponent and closer to you). If you spin the word &quot;Flock&quot;,  you collect one bird card from all the stacks. If you spin the words &quot;Short Cut&quot;, you may move your piece to any space on the board. When you land on a blue space adjacent to a stack of bird cards, you may take half the cards in the stack (rounded down) and keep them. When all the cards have been removed from the board, players turn over the bird cards in their possession and add up the numbers on the back. The highest total wins.<br/><br/>For an advanced game, players are required to identify the bird depicted on the card before taking possession of it.<br/><br/>",

Every fourth square on the track has an icon. If you answer a question correctly on an icon square, you get a marker. When you have three markers, you get to move to the next circle. The questions are divided into the categories Ancient, Medieval, 1500s, 1600s, 1700s, 1800s, and 1900s.<br/><br/>The questions, like in most trivia games, range from pretty easy to downright impossible. The questions as such are usually OK, but unfortunately the quality of the proofreading is very low. There are lots of spelling errors, strange grammar, layout mistakes and so on.<br/><br/>There are only three pawns included in the game, but there are no problems to play with more people; just add a few more pawns.<br/><br/>",

The captured piece is turned over on the board. The game is won, when a player's eight pieces are captured.<br/><br/>The designer, Daniel E, McGuire, sent a copy of the rules to Martin Gardner in 1961.<br/><br/>Martin then forwarded the rules of Hot Spot to Sid Sackson on 1/ 2/ 62.<br/><br/>Spotnik is a military type of game in which simulated artillery pieces are used in an interesting battle of wits between two opponents.  It is a game of fast action and short playing time, averaging about 30 minutes.  It is played upon a standard checker or chess board.  It was sent to Parker Brothers in 1960 for consideration.  On 3/20/61, he writes Martin Gardner to share that it is to be manufactured by Parker Brothers under the new name Hot Spot.  On May 25, 1961 in a letter to Martin Gardner, he shares that he has recently toured the factory where Parker games are made.

The knights select their weapons and combat is solved by checking which weapon is stronger when two knights come in contact. Weapons can be taken from wounded knights. The last knight to stand is the winner.<br/><br/>The game components are essential although made from good quality cardboard, and the game is of pure strategy as there is no luck factor involved both in battle and movements. The map is divided into squares, and marked with letters and a compass so that one can stop a game, record the positions of knights, and start playing again later.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late sixties, Electronic Data Controls Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their &quot;Computer Games&quot; line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The games typically used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column of the matrix to find out what happened.<br/><br/>Computer Sports Games combined five sports titles into one game. In the original 1972 edition, the football field was pre-printed onto a large wooden board. Two double-sided overlays were provided to allow the other sports to be played on the same board. Plastic markers are used to record the position of the ball/puck and show other game stats.<br/><br/>This was followed by the more compact 1974 release. Instead of using the oversized wooden boards characteristic of the original EDC games, this edition uses a smaller plastic board which only displays the game matrix. Two double-sided cardboard overlays contain the matrices for the other sports. The individual playing fields are printed on cardstock panels.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game involves luck, bluff, skill and  fast reaction.<br/>A lot of dice rolling is involved. Movement is determined by a number die.<br/><br/>The players represent reporters, who have to get a theme (on red event spaces)and a buyer (on green buyer spaces). If a player gets a theme he has to create a Headline, while moving his meeple to the buyer space. On arrival at the buyer space he has to present his headline and gets points (chips) awarded. The lenght (number of words) of the headline is determined by the distance between event space and buyer space. Long headlines get more chips than short ones.<br/><br/>The event spaces and buyer spaces are chosen by a funnel action. If a player playes a funnel action he rolls the number die and the letter die to determine coordinates for a section on the game board. In each section there are one or two event spaces, buyer spaces or penality spaces. If any player wants to use a space in the given sector, he throws his pellet into the funnel. The player whose pellet gets into the bottom of the funnel gets to chose one of the available free spaces in this section and puts a task marker on it. If a player has'nt payed attention and the only free space is a penality space he has to put a task marker on this space and can't take place in another funnel action till he has moved his meeple to this space to reclaim his task marker.<br/><br/>The game ends if a player gets a prior agreed on number of chips and has completed all his tasks (headlines)and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Because of Puck, the asses are always in love with one of several possible asses. Yet, only one ass is the right partner.<br/>By meeting other asses frequently, you can climb the fairies' ladder. But those who are unfaithful and visit the &quot;wrong&quot; asses too often support their opponents. <br/>Titania, Oberon, Elves, presents and the Wall add tactics to the game.<br/><br/>In the romantic version, the players themselves are the asses. They exchange vows of love, turn each other down and give each other romantic presents.<br/><br/>The children's game is played without the fairies and thus moves ahead much faster.<br/><br/><br/>",

Instead of LCR***, the &quot;cube selectors&quot; show L,R, cookie jar, and 3 smiley face. Everyone starts with three cookie chips, rolls the number of dice equal to how many cookies they have, and follows the dice instructions. There are some minor extra rules: if you roll three smileys you get to take one back from the center/cookie jar, but that only happens 1 in 216 rolls. You also must roll all smileys to win the game, instead of just winning when you're the last one with chips/cookies. If the final cookie must go in the center/cookie jar, the game is a draw and you must start all over. Finally, there is a scorepad - you cross off one cookie for winning and an extra one if you had more than one cookie left when you won. Essentially, it is LCR with a theme.<br/><br/>",

Whoever wins the hand will score depending on the number of tiles (1,2,3 or 4) led by the previous player. The winner of the hand then leads, and play continues until all tiles are played.<br/><br/>Horol sets sold in Mongolia usually contain an an incomplete set of rules in English, including the following somewhat enigmatic description:<br/><br/>&quot;The Mongols have been playing this game since the 16th century. The game is considered to be a symbol of solidarity and increasing cattle.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In a historical sense, it was a &quot;Little Stalingrad&quot; as the Russians attempted to retake the small town of 5000 people at the foothills of the Black Mountains. Over 2000 Russians and 800 Chechens would lose their lives there. The urban setting littered with many brick and stone buildings with deep basements made for a bloody fight. On March 5th, the Chechen forces seized the town from the Russians and held on until the 15th. Every building would be a war. The Russians pounded the town with artillery, air and Mi-24 gunships creating simply more and more rubble. More Chechens arrived and by the 9th, some 1500 were in the town. Each basement had become a bunker. Russian elite troops were sent in, including Russia's recent new air-fuel weapon, the dreaded Buratino and Schmel. T-72's were sent in firing at point blank range towards the buildings. It was a messy battle and both sides were determined to win and the Russians had just been obliterated near Ulus-Kert on Hill 776 losing its whole 6th Paratroop company!<br/><br/>Depicts what many call the most devastating battle after Grozny. Situated at the base of the Black Mountains, this small town of 5000 became for focal point of two desperate military machines. In early March, a weak Russian security force assumed control of the town. The Chechen forces were very close by and desperate. The Russian war machine had been ripping them apart. Taking advantage of the situation, the 500 man force attacked the town and wiped out the Russians. Beginning on the 6th, the Russian military made six attempts to seize the town, all failed. Artillery, airstrikes, T-72 tanks and Buratino's were called in. It was a sledgehammer. The Chechen force withstood this using underground pillboxes in the stone buildings, and by the 12th, the town was in ruin and the Russians still remained along the perimeter. The Chechen force somehow had received reinforcements and now swelled to 1500 hardened armed fighters. They had laid mines. From the 12th to 17th, Russian forces fought and ugly brutal urban battle with a cunning foe.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules. The map scale is about 200 yards per hex. Each combat unit is one platoon. A game turn is one day of time.<br/><br/>",

This society of treasure hunters, adventure seekers, and artifact collectors gathers men from around the world to share their tales of glory. Each runs a global network, questing for fame, wealth, and the prestige of their home country. Together they pursue a cult that would use the powerful relics for evil, but each adventurer wants the victory to be his alone.<br/><br/>Players follow clues and try to collect all the pieces of an ancient artifacts by strategically deploying their forces and gaining majorities in forgotten territories like El Dorado, Atlantis, and Shangri-La. Leading each team are world famous heroes:<br/><br/>LORD REX HUNTER - Reginald Hunter was heir to a Lordship in Great Britain. His parents were chemists who were doing research in Africa when the family was lost to Ivory poachers. Years later, Rex turned up in the UK with the adventurous spirit and intelligence of his parents and the savage power of his jungle upbringing. He started THE ADVENTURE LEAGUE.<br/><br/>DRAGON PRINCE - A true member of Eastern aristocracy, the Jade Dragon, as some call him, was never content to sit on his riches. He uses it to help those in need and for his globe-spanning adventures to recover lost artifacts of great wealth and power. Best friend of Lord Rex Hunter, but also his fiercest competitor, the Dragon Prince was the first to join his LEAGUE.<br/><br/>DOC ROCKET - &quot;Doc Rocket&quot; is Dr. Werner Von Bronz, one of the greatest scientists of 1920's Germany. He is a physicist, adventurer, and archeologist who scours the globe looking for ancient technologies to incorporate into his gadgets. He is a former WWI fighter pilot of great courage and nobility, loyal to both his own Germany and the LEAGUE.<br/><br/>THE WRAITH - All that is know about his previous life is that he was a police officer in a large American city on a crusade against organized crime. He now fights crime on a global scale with relentless energy and sharp focus. Some say he cannot die. His devoted followers supply him with the scientific and financial resources he needs to carry on his campaign for justice, within and outside of the LEAGUE.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's not a very accurate simulation (or rather it's quite crappy orienteering). To win the game you must visit a number of checkpoints (in a specified order) and get to the goal before the other players. The game board is basically an ordinary orienteering map with an overlayed grid.<br/><br/>To move, you roll three dice. One is an ordinary D6 that tells how far you can run this turn and the other two gives the directions that you can choose from. The direction dice both have three blank sides and the other three sides have directions N, S, NS and E, W, EW respectively. If you are running along a road or river or other distinct feature of the landscape you ignore the direction dice. If not, you have to combine and choose one direction from the direction dice (if both dice are blank you can run any way you like, not necessarily only in one direction).<br/><br/>This game was published during the 1940s.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of 35 Ewok cards - 5 each of 7 different colors. Players are dealt five cards each and the rest are placed on the table to form a draw pile. On a turn you may ask any player for a specific color. If the player you ask has a card or cards of that color, he or she must give you one of them. If you have two or more matching colors in your hand, place them face-up in front of you to start a collection. If you wish to change colors, discard the collection in front of you and play the new one. You always start your turn by drawing cards from the draw pile or discard pile to bring your hand to 5. You end your turn by discarding a card to the discard pile. The winner is the first player to collect all 5 cards of 1 color.<br/><br/>This children's game was intended for Ages 4 - 8.<br/><br/>",

One player commands the princes of Rus and the other leads the Mongol hordes. The game has 3 levels - financial-political, strategic, and tactical.

At the next turns however you must pay great attention. On the track are places with a special sign (green star, red circle, etc). Some of these places give an advantage, others a disadvantage to the racer who is placed on it. It is your job as a team manager to try and place your racers as much as possible on the advantage places and to try and avoid the disadvantage places.<br/><br/>Each team manager should have a list as shown on the backside of the Table for time trial. This list is called the Yellow Jersey Standings.The racers who had the most points in the Yellow Jersey standings, is allowed to wear the yellow jersey (the yellow plastic cap is put over this racer) and he receives an additional fee of frs. 40,-.<br/><br/>End of the Tour<br/>The end of the sixth stage is exactly the same as the end of the other stages, but only the racer who now wins (or keeps) the yellow jersey is the winner of the Tour and he receives now a fee of frs. 100,- instead of the usual frs. 40,-.<br/>There are three ways to win the game:<br/><br/>New divison<br/>This is the fastest and most simple way, also suitable for children. In this variant one only plays for the Yellow jersey standings. No money is used and the Green jersey score is not kept. The normally quite long playing time is now considerably shorter. At the end of each stage only the points for the Yellow jersey standings are written down and the corresponding racers receives the yellow jersey.<br/>The winner of the tour is the one, who has the yellow jersey at the end of the Tour.<br/><br/>Amateurs<br/>In this variant money isn&rsquo;t used either (so no fines and/or fees). For both standings are the points written down, so the yellow and green jersey come into play. In both standings will be a winner at the end of the Tour.<br/><br/>Professionals<br/>This is the Tour de France game in its most beautiful and most complete form. In this variant you use: the Yellow jersey standings, the Green jersey standings and the Banks handles all money affairs such as starting fees, race fees fines, etc. This way of playing costs more time then the two previous ways and it will take about 2 or 3 hours.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns moving stones by picking up all the stones in a well (except for one!) then dropping a stone in each well until they run out, moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise. You skip the scoring wells and must put a stone in the well you started in (in addition to leaving one there to begin the move). A well with only a single stone cannot be moved.<br/><br/>After your move, starting with the well you last placed a stone into, any wells that have exactly two or four stones may be placed in your scoring well. If there is a well that you cannot score (it has a number of stone other than 2 or 4), then any that come after it in sequence may not be scored either.<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player can make a legal move. Any stones left on a players side of the board are added to those in his scoring well. However has the most stones is the winner.<br/><br/>Um el Tuweisat is considered a children's version of this game<br/><br/>",

Circumstances sometimes force you to change your course. It may be expensive, but it may also be profitable. Whatever the cost, you have to return to and complete your route: that is something neccessitated by the service. In the Mediterranean and Black Sea ports you also act as business man and buyer. You may have successful business &ndash; and you may meet with difficulties &ndash; while buying the goods you will carry to Sweden or some other Northern European country. With a little concentration and some good luck &ndash; here as in reality the risks may be reduced and possibilitis of profit increased.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Players engage as a ship's master and take turns to roll two dices to move their ship along different paths in the mediterranean. Each player must aquire 5000 tons of cargo divided into five different goods (1000 tons each) from the harbours around the mediterranean. Players also sail during different seasons of the year and the goods requirement will differ (e.g. one player needs raisins, oranges, nuts, cotton, and tobaco while others need other goods). The types of goods are spread out at different ports and as only half of the requirement for each product can be loaded at the same port, the players will need to visit more than five ports to fulfill their requirements (with some exceptions). The game becomes a task of route optimization to visit the neccessary ports with the least number of dice rolls. Along the way sailors run the risk of encountering storms, price changes on the goods exchange, and random events received via telegram. When all goods have been aquired the players must sail back to Sweden and sell the cargo in Gothenburg and Stockholm (half in each) according to current prices on the goods exchange. The first player to finished selling all their goods ends the game.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The player with the biggest fortune in cash and goods at game end wins the game. Goods still on the ship will be worth according to current prices on the goods exchange, however, players that have not returned to Sweden will lose money for each product missing from their required goods.<br/><br/>Background<br/>Soluret was released by Alga in 1958 during a jubilee for Brostr&ouml;ms shipping company.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Nothing original in the game play, but the depth of questions make this game solid gold (sorry, bad music pun...)<br/><br/>",

Players move around a board and attempt to gain pieces of spiritual armor by correctly answering questions based on the Bible.<br/><br/>The game rules stress to attempt to make game play not a competition, but rather a mutual journey of learning.  Nearly all of the elements of the game are symbolic (an explanation sheet is given for these symbolisms), so there are a lot of opportunities to learn as you play, not only from the 3000 question cards.<br/><br/>The game is pretty simple to learn, and can be played by various ages, but knowledge of the Bible and its contents will prove to be helpful unless you are playing with teams.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game, based on McDonalds restaurant characters, is actually 3 games-in-one. In the first game, 5 cards depicting shadows of the characters are placed in the center of the table. The regular cards are then dealt out evenly among the players. On your turn, you turn over your top card so that all players may see it. The first player to slap the matching shadow card wins the character card. The winner is the first player to collect one each of all 5 McDonaldland characters. In the second game, players try to match cards in their hands to the top card on the center stack by using colors or numbers (shadow cards are wild). The third game is played solitaire. You draw a card and try to match it to the face up card on the table. If you can, you play it on top; if you can't, you start a new pile. If the top card of a pile matches another pile card, the 2 piles may be merged. You win if you have 2 piles or less after you've gone through the deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a set of rules for Minatures in the Napoleonic era. Originally published in 1971 as Napoleonique, it was revised and reissued in 1992 as Napoleonique Encore.<br/><br/>Here is the description from the back of the Encore edition: <br/>&quot;Napoleonique /Encore covers the wars of the French Revolution through the many campaigns of Napoleon and to the final battle of Waterloo in 1815.  You select the battalion or regimental game from scales set up to accommodate your current mounting scheme.  The focus on simplicity will have you finishing a turn in twenty minutes with armies of a thousand or more.<br/>The original rules called Napoleonique, set battalion level games at a scale of thirty men per casting, a ten minute time scale and twenty yards per inch.  Napoleonique/Encore offers 5 game scales with casting representing 30 men in some scales up to 90 men in the regimental version.  These rule shave a history of being the beginners friend and the veteran's &quot;first car&quot; in wargamming.<br/>Napoleonique/Encore is a product of the team of Jim Getz and Glenn Davis.  Over 20,000 copies of the original Napoleonique were sold since its release in the early 70's.  Some of you may buy Napoleonique/Encore for nostalgic reasons while others will find the simplicity to be a pleasant change.  Either way we know you'll enjoy these rules.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players each choose one of 12 major cities as their home terminal and draw a dispatch card with two possible destinations. They choose one, get paid and pay expenses, then set off. When they reach their chosen destination, they draw a new dispatch card from that terminal. If their destination is not a terminal, then they first must deadhead to the nearest terminal before drawing a card. There are 11 dispatch cards for each of the terminal cities.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players can buy more trucks, up to four of them, at $60,000 each. They can borrow up to $50,000 but must make minimum payments on every die roll until it is paid back with interest. The winner is the player to that makes the most money (including truck values) by the end of 3 hours or whatever other time limit may be agreed at the outset.<br/><br/>The roads contain a variety of hazards, from minor annoyances like D.o.T. inspections and flat tires ($100) to a blown engine ($6,500) or a wreck and hospital stay ($8,000). Dispatch cards may be for regular loads (which use a 1 ,2 ,4, 8, 9, 10 green die), or wide loads that move on a slower 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7 red die. Players may buy insurance against cargo damage (or not) and occasionally get asked to take an illegal Hot Load, which pays well if delivered on time but nothing if late or stopped at a scale or inspection point.<br/><br/>Players passing through Atlantic City, Reno or Las Vegas have the option of gambling, drawing from a deck of Chance cards.<br/><br/>",

The Maple Leaf Forever tries to integrate the Canadian plans to counter the American invasion of Canada as outlined in Sutherland &quot;Buster&quot; Brown's (I'm not making this up) Defense Scheme No. 1. All the rules of War Plan Crimson are used except where noted below. Gamers will note that The Maple Leaf Forever does not interfere with War Plan Crimson, but rather adds a section to the beginning of the game (usually four or five extra turns) which represents the days before the American invasion. It was this period that &quot;Buster&quot; Brown calculated would be critical, if Canada was to resist an American invasion.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    War Plan: Crimson<br/><br/><br/>",

Each letter of the alphabet appears twice within the deck and five of those letters (J,Q,X,Y,Z) are yellow, indicating a higher value for those letters.<br/><br/>Each game of Best Sellers consists of ten rounds. During each round, one player is designated as EDITOR. The editor shuffles the deck and presents them to the player on his left. The player draws three cards, flipping over two of them to reveal the letters on the backs. The book title on the third card is the theme to be used for the round.<br/><br/>Once the book title and the two letters have been chosen, the editor starts the two minute timer and all players, including the editor, begin writing a story inspired by the title/theme of the book cover. Players earn points by including as many words as possible which begin with either of the two letters chosen for the round. Each word that begins with one of these letters is worth one point.<br/><br/>- Words only count the first time they are used.<br/>- Words must be in complete sentences to count.<br/>- Words beginning with yellow letters are worth 2 points.<br/><br/>When the two minutes are up, each player stops writing. Beginning with the player immediately to the editor's left, each participant reads his/her story and announces the number of points earned. The editor adds the totals to the score sheet for the round and awards the book card to the player with the most points. At the end of ten rounds, players total their scores from each round, add 3 points for every book card held to reach a grand total. The player with the most points at the end of ten rounds is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

The United Nations has condemned the invasion and authorized the use of force, and your 82nd-Airborne ready battalion will be that force. You must make an immediate drop before the invaders can dig in, and reinforce yourself as needed later. Your goals are to free the capital of Hyrax and at least one other city from the invaders, and to capture at least one airfield so other UN forces can land there and finish what you've started. Those forces will start arriving in three days, which is also the amount of time your men can fight without resupply. Take 'em down! Airborne all the way!<br/><br/>Player 2: A dog's curse be on the United Nations and their resolutions! This territory belonged to our ancestors before the colonial imperialists divided it up, and it is ours again, and we will never leave it. The initial attacks were successful beyond our wildest dreams, and the whole country fell like dominoes. Now we must prepare for the counterattack that the UN and their lackeys will certainly launch. Most of our navy is at sea, searching for enemy ships that might bring invaders, and all the land approaches to our nation are well-guarded. But an attack could come from anywhere at any time, so you must be vigilant. Long live Koni!<br/><br/>Airborne! is a 2-player Expansion for Gators! depicting a modern US airborne operation.

Two to four players may compete, though the three player game essentially calls for one player on one side to fill both the Presidential and Vice-Presidential roles. Players move around the board, capturing states with campaign funds. Players must also watch to maintain their credibility rating and to build either a liberal or conservative rating when appropriate. A lack of credibility keeps your party from winning a state; high credibility allows your party to overcome a liberal or conservative bias; liberal or conservative leanings provide financial rewards in many states.<br/><br/>Unlike most games based on the Electoral College system, Presidential Fever combines a number of contiguous low value states into a single region (e.g., Farm Belt, Border States, Mid-Atlantic, Deep South, etc.).<br/><br/>",

You've got four C-130's and your ready-response battalion, and we can get you some flying air support if you think you need it. Load 'em up, move fast, rescue the hostages, and bring 'em home. If you can't fly them out, we'll set up a rendezvous in-country to get you out by choppers. Rangers, lead the way!<br/><br/>Player 2: Success! The American ambassador and his assistants will make excellent bargaining chips in our struggle. And the existing government can do nothing; our political operatives have seen to that. You, Major, must see to the safety of our &quot;guests.&quot; You can expect a rescue operation from the Americans -- they have a long history of meddling in our nation's affairs. Colonel LeMeow of our Intelligence section will take command of the prisoners tomorrow. Until then, guard them well.<br/><br/>Rangers! is a 2-player Expansion for the free wargame Gators! depicting a modern US Army Ranger airborne operation.<br/><br/>",

This booklet has a yellow front &amp; back plasticized-looking outside covers, with black print on the front and plastic spiral binding for the pages. It contains 20 pages of rules in a half-page-sized format, and covers the basics of minis gaming within this. It details the use of &quot;bounds&quot; written orders and simultaneously revealing them, for its mechanism of play. You will need to provide special 6-sided-dice numbered as follows: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 (&quot;average&quot; dice), as well as some regular D6s, various other sundry items associated with this genre as required, and some markers of the same size as the units that they will represent in the game. These markers can even be used for decoy units where applicable, and you would have to obtain additional data on specifics for individual battles, troops, &amp; leaders prior to commencing play for this. Calculations for creating casualties are based upon a percentages and die rolls method being employed for resolving conflicts. These seem to be the easiest and quickest rules devised at the time, for recreating the many epic confrontations that were to define the &quot;American War for Reunification&quot; in the period covered by this rules set.<br/><br/>",

A twist to the game involves the &quot;To See the Judge&quot; spaces on the board. Land on one and and you must draw a summons card, and then the player designated as the judge (he wears a badge that is included) gives the player a fine. The winner is the player who reaches &quot;The Club&quot; and has the most amount of money left once all players are finished.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Silent Dark is a tabletop miniatures wargame, set in the relatively near future of the 26th Century. The game is designed for the 25mm figure scale, but because it has been designed with the revolutionary G.U.T.S. Core Rules&copy;, it could easily be adapted to 6mm, 15mm, or the 35mm figure scales... or anything else for that matter.<br/><br/>Before we describe the game's features, and offer the traditional list, let us take a brief moment to describe the G.U.T.S. Core Rules&copy;. G.U.T.S. stands for &ldquo;Generic Universal Tactical System&rdquo;. It is a revolutionary new game design, because it uses new models to create accuracy of simulation without adding dreary layers of useless rules. G.U.T.S. can be used for all sorts of miniatures-based games, such as WWI, the Civil War, and other conflicts, past and present. It has some other advantages, though, that are specific to Silent Dark:<br/><br/>Design your armies from the ground up. Every Creature, Vehicle and Weapon can be designed to your exact specifications, down to the last rifle in the last man&rsquo;s hands. Freedom rules!<br/><br/>Availability:<br/>Originally a commercial product, Wolfe Games has released Silent Dark as a free download in PDF format. The entire Silent Dark package is available from the publisher's website.<br/><br/>",

The unique movement and morale systems make the obstacles faced by officers of the period all too evident as players try to coordinate the movements of the units within their brigade or division. This is a fast paced, easy to learn, easy to play games system in which exciting and challenging battles can be played with as few as three or four battalions on each side or as much as a division.<br/><br/>This is not a game of high strategy. It is a game of tactics at a level too long ignored or simply not understood. It is a game about the common soldier and how he was led, maneuvered and deployed as he covered himself with glory.<br/><br/>",

You have two levels of challenge to choose from. Level one Ages 8 and up, level two Ages 12 and up.<br/><br/>Basically you move round the board from A to Z and answer questions about nature.

The six categories are Trees, Edible Plants, Space, Animals, Water, Flowers, Land or any category. You have to name something from the appropriate category beginning with the letter on the square you have landed on. You are not allowed to repeat something that has been used before. In between the letter spaces are alpha nature card spaces, when you land on these you have to answer a question of one of the cards to see if you can advance onto the next letter space. Whenever you answer correctly you move onto the next space, as soon as you are unable to answer a question or name something correctly your turn ends. The winner is the first person to reach the end of the alphabet and name something in the appropriate category.<br/><br/>This is an educational game and there are some variants depending on the players ability.<br/><br/>",

Two players each have six cubes with the sides colored in three different colors (opposite sides matching). One color is &quot;vulnerable,&quot; a second color is &quot;blocking,&quot; and a third color is &quot;aggressive.&quot; Each player's six cubes are alike, but some pattern distinguishes one player's cubes from the other. On a three by six horizontal rectangular grid, each player's cubes start with &quot;vulnerable&quot; on top all along the nearest side and &quot;aggressive&quot; on the left and right sides of each cube. In turn, each player rolls or tips one of his/her cubes up to two spaces, possibly including an orthogonal turn in the middle. If a piece started the turn as &quot;aggressive&quot; it can capture by landing upon an opposing &quot;vulnerable&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; piece as any part of this move. No piece may move through a &quot;blocking&quot; piece. Adjacent captures are mandatory. The first player to capture or immobilize all six opposing pieces wins. A necessary house rule to avoid fortress defense stalemates is to only allow vulnerable pieces to move two spaces.<br/><br/>",

Each player, in turn, either draws a card into his/her hand from the top of one of the stacks (but never one of the four cards at the bottom of the piles) or chooses four cards from his/her hand whose suits match those of the four cards currently on top of the four piles. The four cards from that player's hand are set aside face-down into a score pile. When only the last four cards remain, players may make any last matches from their hands before scoring the round. Each player scores one point for each card taken (this will always be a multiple of four) minus the number of cards in the suit with the least cards taken (void suits don't count). In case of a tie, all players recalculate their scores with the second lowest suit subtracted as well.<br/><br/>",

If you want to hold your head up high in the car park again, you are going to have to know a lot about all aspects of motoring including motor sport, the Highway Code, and a whole lot of useless trivia.  Why will this be important to you?  Well to win the game of course.  Oh, but much more than that, much more.  Your whole reputation and street credibility could be at stake, because at the end of the game, your score will be analyzed, your personality checked, and you will find out what car really does suit you!&quot;<br/><br/>TOP GEAR - THE GAME is a motoring trivia game themed to the BBC TV series of the same name.  Players take it in turns to spin a spinner and answer questions (from one of six different packs) as indicated.  The answer given will result in a tick or a cross being recorded on the individual's scoresheet against one of four personality categories - looks, performance, running cost, safety.<br/><br/>If the spinner points at the figure '9' rather than a question category then a marker is moved along a scale at the bottom of the spinner card.  The game ends when a total of 9 '9's have been spun.<br/><br/>The winner is the person with the most ticks on their score card.  In the event of a draw the person with the least crosses is the winner.<br/><br/>Once a winner has been declared all player can then look up their &quot;ideal&quot; car in the reference book provided with the rules.  This is done simply by totaling up all the answers provided in each personality category (correct and incorrect) and placing the categories in order.  The relative order of the personality traits will indicate whether you should be driving a McLaren F1 or a Sinclair C5.<br/><br/>",

The games are touted as being good for the brain.<br/><br/>There are at least four different games you can play with the Janken Plus set, though not all of them are Rock-Scissors-Paper games.<br/><br/>1. Janken Game: Because the four boards are interlocking, they can be arranged differently, as a 6X6 square (basic game using all 24 janken pieces), or other arrangements with games for 12 pieces.<br/><br/>The pieces can be moved in any direction, any number of squares. Pieces are taken in the traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock way. The game ends when one player has only two pieces left. On the box it says it's a similar game to Shogi.<br/><br/>2. Play-off Janken: Each player places their pieces face down; they can arrange the pieces as they like. The board isn&rsquo;t used. They each choose one piece and play janken. The winner is the player who captures the most of their opponent&rsquo;s pieces. (This is not a thinking game.)<br/><br/>3. Tic-Tac-Toe variant: Using one board, the players play a Tic-Tac-Toe game aiming to get three pieces in a row. Once a player has played three pieces, he or she can only move them on the board. A variant is to use two or more unconnected boards and more pieces, with the ability to move pieces from board to board.<br/><br/>4. Pinch-pon: Players use six pieces each on the 6X6 board. They capture their opponent&rsquo;s pieces by sandwiching them between two of their own (as in the ancient game of Hnefatafl and similar games).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Bicentennial Wargame&quot;<br/><br/>Redcoat was unique for its time in that it was designed to be a campaign game where the battles are fought out using miniatures. The game includes three booklets: Campaign Game, Miniatures Game, and Historical Analysis.<br/><br/>The Campaign Game is played on a map of the American colonies that is divided into regions. Each region is worth a number of victory points for the British player if they hold it. Holding a region requires a garrison whose size varies by region. For example, Massachussetts Bay requires a garrison of 4000 men; the Mohawk Valley requires a garrison of only 500 men. Regions also provide a number of Loyalists that can be recruited as Provincial units in the British army, Militia who fight as partisans against the British, and a variable number of Continental Army recruits.<br/><br/>Movement in the campaign is by area (Region). Americans move pretty freely, but the British forces can have some difficulty getting around. This represents the fact that the British found it hard to get their armies where they wanted them when they wanted them (for example, Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne's miserable time in upper New York in 1777). As the British move through areas, they trigger the arrival of loyalists and militia.<br/><br/>Campaign years are divided into four seasons (turns). The fourth season is winter, which prohibits any British units from moving while allowing American forces to move at a lower rate. However, winter also causes &quot;winter attrition&quot; among American Continental units.<br/><br/>American forces are created through Continental recruitment and militia (who appear as a result of British being in an area). British forces, except for Provincial units, arrive (and leave) according to their historical schedules. The French may intervene depending on whether the Americans can win a Major Victory.<br/><br/>Winning the campaign game for the British requires a long, slow haul of hanging on to sufficient regions (which generate victory points) from 1775 to 1783. Americans win the campaign game by winning Major Victories over the British or by holding out and denying the British their victory conditions.<br/><br/>The rules for the Miniatures Game are pretty standard for 1976, but compare very well to many current rules. The ground scale is 1&quot; equals 15 yards. Time scale is 1 turn equals 15 minutes. Figure scale is variable; regulars are 1:30 while milita and Indians are 1:50.<br/><br/>The size of the playing area depends on the number of combatants in the campaign battle. The terrain set up for a battle depends on the size of the playing area and the Terrain Factor of the region where the battle is located. The defending player places the terrain in the playing area and the attacking player chooses which edge of the playing area he will deploy on.<br/><br/>Morale plays a large part in the game. British units tend to be very good, while American units are mostly average to poor. Battles can be a challenge for the Americans, but they can rely on their strengths in skirmishing and shooting--and avoiding British bayonet charges.<br/><br/>Leaders play a significant role in the game and are specified as Class I and Class II, who are named individuals, and Class III, who represent generic leaders. The rules offer ratings for different historical generals (Benedict Arnold is only rated once as an American).<br/><br/>Without being difficult, the rules add some nuances that bring out the flavor of 18th century warfare. Shooting is *very deadly* at point blank range (1&quot;), but its effect attenuates dramatically as the range increases. Units that stand to receive a charge roll on a Volley Effectiveness Table to determine the range when they open fire. Poorer units will fire too soon and waste the potential destructiveness of the volley; better units can hold their fire on the attacker until they &quot;see the whites of their eyes.&quot;<br/><br/>There are also some &quot;chrome&quot; rules like sappers, Indians, Night Attacks, and the &quot;Simcoe/Tarelton Bugle Tactic.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Many versions of this game have been played by various Celtic peoples for thousands of years and pre-dates the various Viking Tafl-type Games by many centuries. While different rules exist, we have included those that we consider the most challenging and playable for both sides.<br/><br/>The rules for our version of this game come from studying the &quot;Ballinderry Board&quot;. The Ballinderry Game Board was found in 1932 during the excavation of a &quot;crannog&quot;, or lake dwelling at Ballinderry, West Meath, Ireland.<br/><br/>Our games are hand-crafted in the Acorn Games studios in the beautiful Monadnock Region of New Hampshire. The game boards are all hand drawn on leather and suede with Ancient Celtic symbols used for the placement marks. Each set also includes 8 jewel toned glass &quot;Robbers&quot; and 4 jewel toned glass &quot;Lords&quot; as well as a hand carved ceramic &quot;King&quot; in a classic terracotta color. Each &quot;King&quot; is highly detailed as you can tell from the picture below.<br/><br/>The complete rules as well as diagrams for alternate set-ups are permanently attached in the decorated storage box. Each box is hand decorated using a mix of Ancient Celtic designs and wood-burning to make for an attractive conversation piece. Each box measures approximately 4in. long x 3in. wide x 2 1/2in. high. Since each game is hand crafted, there will be natural color and shape variations in the game boards, playing pieces and box decorations.<br/><br/>Each BRANDUBH Game includes:<br/>1 - Decorated display box with rules<br/>1 - Leather or Suede Game Board<br/>12 - Jewel toned Glass Playing Pieces<br/>1 - Hand-Carved &quot;KING&quot; Piece<br/><br/>",

You could end up with a personality profile consisting of the The Leaning Tower of Pisa, Henry VIII, an octopus and a mango.<br/><br/>You can back your judgment and argue to sway the misguided opinion of others.  Those that voted for you then move ahead in a race to the finish.<br/><br/>The game has two objectives:<br/>-  To advance your token on the board to be the first to reach the finish at the center of the board.<br/>-  To discover you image - the impression that you make on other people.<br/>Which object you place above the other depends on you and the other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crazy Talk is a party game based on brief time-limited improvisations. A player randomly picks two cards: one with a character and one with an unrelated situation. The player then tries to act it out so that his/her teammates can guess what each of the two cards say. The character is either a fictional character, a historical character, or a real person depending on which board space the player landed on. The board consists of a single track with different colored spaces for the four type of characters (fictional, historical, occupation, or wild).<br/><br/>As in Taboo, the player is not allowed to say any of the words on the cards. The player is allowed to say what the character might say in that situation, use synonyms, body language, descriptive clues, etc. The game requires a fair amount of creativity since the combinations are often quite bizarre.<br/><br/>Crazy Talk was a Games 100 winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player enters one's own name and subsequently the turn order in which they will play. The players can decide to draw their own tiles or let the device do the randomizing. If the device assigns the tiles, the players may ask the device to suggest a play by using the &quot;Hint&quot; option.<br/><br/>Players keep track of the gameboard using the paper pad provided or use their own gameboard. The device has a LCD readout that is only eight characters by four characters and cannot display the entire board. Players use the arrow keys of the membrane keyboard to scroll around.<br/><br/>All standard Scrabble rules apply. The device will challenge any word played that is not in its 12,000 word vocabulary. The human player is final arbiter however.<br/><br/>The device is powered by four &quot;C&quot; batteries or an AC adapter. Two Advanced Vocabulary Modules were available. Each module added 16,000 words to the machine's vocabulary to bring the total to 44,000.<br/><br/>",

When a player lands on a colored space which is blank, he rests there until his next turn.  If he lands on a colored space upon which a picture of litter has been printed, he yells LITTERBUG and then takes one piece of litter from the trash pile at the CITY DUMP in the center of the board, and deposits it in his own barrel.  But, if he forgets to say LITTERBUG, he has to return the trash to the central pile.  If the colored circle is already occupied by a player and has litter on it, the player who lands there second (or third, etc.) yells LITTERBUG and collects two pieces of litter from the pile for his trash barrel.<br/><br/>When a player lands on a GOLD circle with a picture of a spinner, he yells LITTERBUG and immediately collects two pieces os litter from the trash pile at the CITY DUMP.  He then spins and moves his litter barrel to the next colored space that matches his spin.  If that space has litter on it, he may yell LITTERBUG and collect an additional piece of litter.<br/><br/>Players in turn continue to spin the spinner, advance to the nearest circle which matches the color shown on the spinner and collect litter when landing on pictured circles.<br/><br/>The game ends when all pieces of litter have been removed from the trash pile at the CITY DUMP.  At the end of the game each player counts the number of pieces of litter in his barrel.  The player who has collected the most litter is the winner because he has done the best job of cleaning the streets and sidewalks.<br/><br/>Recommended for ages 4-10.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Lamb Between Two Lions is a game for 2-6 players that attempts to represent some of the action of Buzkashi games held at festivals in northern Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In summary, the sport of Buzkashi involves skilled horsemen who attempt to pick up a carcass (called the Boz) from the ground and then ride free of the other horsemen without allowing the Boz be taken away.<br/><br/>Components: A circular board (made up of concentric circles which are in turn divided into rectangles to form the spaces); six playing pieces for each player (consisting of four attendants, one Chapandazan - a champion Buzkashi rider, and one Khan - the Chapandazan's sponsor); a pair of six-sided dice for each player; and a supply of poker chips or other markers used to track each player's score.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to move your Chapadazan to the Boz to take possession of it (grabbing it away from another Chapadazan if necessary) and get free from the rest of the riders or move off the playing board.<br/><br/>This game was an entry in the 2005 Buzkashi Game Design Contest held here on BoardGameGeek.<br/><br/>",

If you want a horse racing game, there's many better choices - Win, Place & Show, Winner's Circle, and The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game to name three.  If you want a gambling game, there's many better choices.  A lottery ticket is about as much fun as this &quot;game&quot; - when it loses.

        "description": "This game consists of a gameboard with a baseball field on it, and a spinner in the centerfield corner of the board.  There are also four baseball players used to represent the batter and any runners.  The spinner points you to several tables located around the edge of the board.<br/><br/>The player who is the pitcher spins the spinner to determine what kind of pitch will be thrown (fast ball, slow ball, curve ball or knuckle ball).  The batter then decides whether or not he wants to &quot;take&quot; the pitch, or make a swing at it.  If he takes the pitch, the result can be either a ball or a strike, though the pitcher could also incur a passed ball, wild pitch, balk, or a hit batter.<br/><br/>If the batter swings at the pitch, he spins the spinner to get a numerical result, and reads the result based upon the pitch thrown.  This result could be either a strike, a ball, a foul, a hit to the infield, or a hit to the outfield.<br/><br/>If the result is a hit, the batter spins the spinner again and reads the result on the appropriate infield hit or outfield hit chart, with the result being some type of base hit or out.<br/><br/>With runners on base, the batter can also announce to attempt a stolen base or a sacrifice.  In this case he, surprise!, spins the spinner and reads from the appropriate chart.<br/><br/>Continue this way, playing nine innings of regulation baseball.<br/><br/>",

The owner of the first bean reaching the destination ovals that surrounds the starting circle wins.<br/>The Beans (from the information card)<br/>&quot;The Mexican jumping beans (laspeyresia saltitans) come from the mountains in the states of Sonora and Sinaloa, Mexico.  They can be found in an area that is 30 miles by 100 miles where the host plants (sebastiana pavoniana) grows.  In the Spring, the moths emerge from last years beans and deposit the eggs on the flowers of the host plants (actually trees).  The egg burrows its way into the seed and tender heart of the bean.  By the time the monsoon rains come in July, they have eaten all the beans tender innards.  There are 3 beans in a pod and it is covered by a thin skin, similar to walnuts.  The trees need about 20 days to soak up enough water to cause the skin to disgorge the beans, again similar to the walnuts.  Their jumping is a survival measure.  The heat is their enemy.  They jump to escape the heat as it would dehydrate and kill them.  They search for a cool damp place to survivie until Spring.  Many years ago, the bean harvest was over 12 million beans per year.  Now it is about 1/5 that much.  The scare of infestation at the various borders has made exportation more difficult.  The pickers now are mostly senior citizens.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a trick-taking game with fairly standard mechanics.  Players are dealt five-card hands (or equal hands of less than five cards, if the deck is nearly exhausted).  The highest card played wins a trick, and players must follow suit if possible.  Players who cannot follow suit can play a non-trump card (automatically losing the round) or a trump card (potentially winning the round, unless a higher trump is played).  The trump suit is determined by rolling a special die showing the four suits plus one side with both red suits and another side with both black suits.  When a side with multiple suits is rolled, the dealer gets to pick which suit is trump.  The trump suit and dealer change every time the deck is exhausted.<br/><br/>Small plastic poker chips also play a part in the game.  Players start with an equal amount of chips.  A plastic tray is kept at the center of the board during play.  At the end of every trick in which a trump was played, all losing players have to place a chip in the &quot;Suits&quot; section of the tray.  Whenever a King is played, players place chips in the &quot;Jackpot&quot; section of the tray.  Each player has a game card showing the four suits.  Whenever a player wins a trick, he or she places a special yellow &quot;Hoyle&quot; tile under the leading suit for the trick.  Whenever a player fills all three spaces under a suit, he or she wins the chips in the &quot;Suits&quot; area of the tray and the other players have to put chips into that area.  Whenever a pre-determined number of suits are filled in, the &quot;Jackpot&quot; is won along with the &quot;Suits&quot; area.<br/><br/>After a player has filled in a suit, he or she gains the ability to &quot;freeze&quot; the suit -- upon winning a suit for the fourth time, the player can flip over one of the tiles on his or her card.  This prevents any other player from placing a tile under this suit -- instead, the only option they have is to &quot;unfreeze&quot; the suit by flipping their opponent's tile back over.  It's possible for all three tiles to get flipped, making it very difficult for anyone else to win in the suit.<br/><br/>The game has no predefined end.  The rules suggest playing for a certain amount of time, eliminating players who run out of chips until only a single player remains, or playing for a pre-determined amount of time.  The play time listed in this entry reflects a single round of play, not an entire game.<br/><br/>",

The theme includes many funny elements, such as the green eggs which could hatch, resulting in a fight against the awful green things from outer space :-)<br/><br/>Inventory: map showing star systems and connections between them; rocket ship pawns, home base pawns, transporters (similar to monopoly houses), galactic credits (money chits), 4&quot;&times;6&quot; spaceship card with subsidiary engine and cargo hold cards, deck of delivery cards, deck of insurance cards, two six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Players begin by selecting a spaceship dealer and rolling two six-sided dice, then buying one of the available spaceships.  They then build their home base (which doubles as a permanent transporter), selecting a star system from the map.  Each star system has a cost to build, ranging from 10-50, which indicates the value and number of deliveries that can be made to that system.<br/><br/>On each turn, players are dealt two delivery cards, which specify a cargo and three destinations, varying in value.  The cargo is automatically available at the system where the player's rocket pawn is located.  The player may keep as many cards as their spaceship has cargo holds, freely selecting between new cards and previously retained cards.  On a player's turn, they may move their rocket pawn a number of systems equal to the number of engines on their spaceship.  Upon arrival at a system specified by their cards, they are paid for the cargo.<br/><br/>There are no restrictions on arrival at a system.  However, to depart from a system a player must possess a matter transporter at that system, or pay another player to rent their transporter.  If no transporter is present, the player must build one on a later turn in order to move.<br/><br/>During the game, players choose from a limited number of special actions, such as upgrading ships, building new transporters, advertising (to receive two extra delivery cards) or simply taking money (the least appealing option).  Only one special action may be taken each turn.<br/><br/>Random events are included in the delivery deck.  Some of these can result in loss of spaceship or transporter, or devaluing of cargo.  A player may buy an insurance policy, partially covering the cost of losing a ship or transporter.<br/><br/>The delivery deck has a reshuffle card.  Upon reshuffling, an end-of-game card is added to the delivery deck.  The player with the most money when the end-of-game card is revealed wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The questions are based on 5 categories (committees): War, Environment, Commerce, State (International politics and policies), and Domestic Policy (U.S. policies and public opinions).  There is a range difficulty from &quot;lots of people know this&quot; to &quot;Wow!  I didn't know that.&quot;  More difficult questions have multiple choice answers and higher point (vote) value.  Using political reasoning and/or logic can yield a correct answer even when it is not initially known.<br/>The board for POWERPLAY resembles a Senate chamber.  Players are &quot;Senators&quot;.  Each player/team gets a &quot;Committee Table&quot;.  The object of the game is to correctly answer questions in each category to gain &quot;Committee Seats&quot; as well as more votes than your opponents.  <br/>Strategies that can be used include:<br/><br/>    answering multiple choice questions correctly before the answers are read gives the player double the votes for that question<br/>    censuring an opponent sends them to the censure room where they cannot answer questions to gain Committee Seats or votes<br/>    filibustering allows a player to remove votes from their opponents<br/>    players can remove opponents from Committees on which they have already gained a seat<br/>    players that have a Seat on every Committee have a choice: either allow their opponents to chose the category for the next question and automatically win with a correct answer or continue playing and maintaining control over which category questions will be answered.<br/><br/><br/>POWERPLAY game pieces are made of wood.<br/><br/>",

The biggest difference might be that traditonal &quot;4 Player Chess&quot; has 96 open spaces in the initial setup while Forchess only has 4 open spaces.<br/><br/>There are two version to this game.<br/><br/>1.  Standard Forchess has fixed alliances<br/>2.  Cutthroat Forchess focuses on fluid alliances<br/><br/>In this game, four traditional chess sets are placed on the smaller and traditional 8 by 8 board with one pawn removed from each player's side, meaning that conflict occurs quickly due to a lack of available space.  In this version, the pawns move forward diagonally and capture forward vertically and forward horizontally, but they can never move more than one square at a time and thus there is no &quot;en passant&quot; capture technique in this game.  Castling does not exist in Forchess.  It is suggested that kings should be captured like other pieces, although opponents should still say &quot;check&quot; when putting a king in jeopardy.  Furthermore, a player cannot place a teammate in check.  If a player cannot move any of his pieces, he must remove one piece from the board per turn until he can move a piece.  If a player captures a king, he may then use all of the removed player's pieces!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Powerball Das Spiel is played within a wooden frame that is assembled in two halves.  The playing surface or pitch slopes down from the middle to the two ends where the players stand.  In the center of the pitch is a small indentation.  A ping-pong (table tennis) type ball is placed in the indentation.  The players each have one or more wooden shoots under their control, which they use to launch ball bearings at the ping-pong ball.  In front of the shoots at each end is a bar or barrier.  This is suspended just above the playing surface so that there is sufficient room for the ball bearings to run underneath, but not the ping-pong ball.  In the center of the bar the gap is higher.  This is the goal area where the ping-pong ball can also run underneath.  The idea of the game is to launch the ball bearings at the ping-pong ball and direct the ping-pong ball into the opponent's goal.  Play can be to a specific number of  goals or for a particular time period, with one to three players on each team.<br/><br/>",

From then on dice rolls on one or other of the various Charts plot the outcome of the attack until it either breaks down or points are scored. Most of the actions are taken from the Action Chart which is  common to both teams, but approximately one in six are taken from the Team's own Team Card, helping recreate that team's particular style of play, strengths and weaknesses. Other 'actions' are  dependent on individual Player Ratings.<br/><br/>A marker is moved on the Field of Play to chart the  development of the attack, another marker on the Team Card shows who has possession, and a third is used on the Time Clock to keep track of time.<br/><br/>Team Cards use named players and substitutes, with individual Player Ratings to produce accurate results and scorers.

Using no more than their knowledge of the Earth, Sun, and stars, the Mayans were able to tabulate days, weeks, months, and years from 3113 BC until December 21, 2012 AD. No one knew why the Mayan calendar ended on that date..<br/><br/>On December 22, 2012, a small asteroid swung in from the outer solar system and clipped the moon.<br/><br/>For over a year astronomers had been tracking the asteroid, but due to its small size had not thought it a serious threat. It proved, however, to have a much higher density than expected. Its impact with the moon imparted a distinct 'wobble' to the lunar orbit and ejected megatons of lunar material into Earth orbit.<br/><br/>Scientists estimate the moon's orbit will return to normal in a few years. But, its erratic orbit will have catastrophic effects on Earth's biosphere during the first year. By the end of 2013, all life on the six northern continents will be extinct.<br/><br/>Welcome to mankind's last year&hellip;<br/><br/>Two versions of this game are available:  A PDF (Print and Play) version and a Vassal version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A one-on-one book game with a sci-fi/adventure theme.  Each player is a champion of their star-faring race, trying to find pieces of the Ancient Robot, a powerful and dangerous artifact of a lost civilization.  The pieces of the Ancient Robot are scattered throughout the galaxy, and the players move from system to system to find them by choosing which page to turn to.  In their quest, they will encounter all sorts of harrowing adventures, battling or befriending strange monsters, collecting strange new items to improve their abilities, and may even run across each other....<br/><br/>The premise, as described by the books:<br/><br/>A million years before mankind invented fire or the Cybrtrons first oiled their gears, the Ancient Ones ruled the universe. For reasons lost in the mysteries of time, the Ancient Ones channeled all of their galaxy-spanning efforts into the building of one huge robot. There were twenty star systems in the realm of the Ancient Ones, and each one of the twenty was given the task of building one part of the massive robot.<br/><br/>The project was soon completed, the twenty parts constructed. The Ancient Ones had to bring the twenty parts to one central location and assemble the robot. But something went wrong -- perhaps a war between the systems, perhaps attack by some alien race. The Ancient Ones vanished. All that remained were the scattered parts of their robot.<br/><br/>One million years later, two parts of the Ancient Robot were recovered in different areas of the Milky Way galaxy. A team of humans discovered one part of the Ancient Robot in the year 2289 A.D., while exploring the planet Pluto. The Robot provided mankind with the secret of interstellar travel and a star chart marked with the location of the other nineteen parts.<br/><br/>At the same time, a civilization of robots also discovered a part of the Ancient Robot. Called Cybrtrons, they had overthrown their soft-skinned creators centuries before. They are now determined to rule the galaxy! The Ancient Robot part also gave the Cybrtrons the secret of interstellar travel and a star chart revealing the location of the other nineteen parts.<br/><br/>Both civilizations immediately decide to go in search of the Ancient Robot. Records of the Ancient Ones reveal that the Ancient Robot has the capability to design and build technological devices that will advance mankind a thousand years. The Ancient Robot is also capable of destroying anything in its path! With this device, the Cybrtrons know they can conquer the galaxy!<br/><br/>Both civilizations are sending their best pilots into space to search for the Ancient Robot. The Cybrtrons and the humans have become aware of each other. The search for the Ancient Robot has turned into a deadly race.<br/><br/>YOU are the leader of one of the two groups assigned to find the Ancient Robot!<br/><br/>Part of the series of 1 on 1 Adventure Gamebooks.<br/><br/>",

That player must divide it into nine sections by drawing two horizontal and two vertical lines. The other player gets to draw one line. This line must start and end at an outside edge. Starting with the player who did not draw the bending line, take turns marking vacant spaces, one at a time. The game ends when there are no vacant spaces left to fill.<br/><br/>Winning: Score one point for every interior border shared by spaces that you have claimed.

As soon as a player has gotten the ball in the right hole, the detective has to show the picture from the tile on the game board, if successful, he or she can keep it. The magnifying glass is passed on to the next player. The player who wins most tiles wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zhuang Yuan Chou (Chong Yuen Chow in Cantonese) is a gambling game using dice and tallies, first mentioned in Chinese texts in the late 18th century, but still played today.<br/><br/>'Zhuang Yuan' is the title given to the scholar who achieved the highest distinction in the imperial examinations that determined entry into the Chinese bureaucracy.<br/><br/>The game consists of six dice and sixty-three tallies bearing titles of ranks of achievement in the examinations and the number of points they are worth. There is only one each of the top 3 positions, of which the highest value (32 points) and the largest tally is the Zhuan Yuan. <br/>The lower the position, the thinner/shorter the tallies and the fewer points each is worth. At the lowest rank, Xiu Cai, there are 32 tallies worth 1 point each. As with many Chinese dice games, a porcelain bowl is often used to hold and roll the dice.<br/><br/>To play, punters agree on a value per point (Dobree mentions 1 cent, 10 cents or 50 cents). Each player takes turns rolling all six dice. According to the roll, the player is allowed to claim tallies of equivalent worth from the center of the table where they are initially placed. Certain rolls allow one to claim tallies from other players if those tallies were previously claimed. The game is played until all tallies have been claimed.<br/><br/>The best roll is six of a kind, allowing the player to claim all the tallies, whether they are in the pool or with other players. Five of a kind allows the player to claim the Zhuan Yuan tally wherever it is. Red fours (on Chinese dice, the one and four spots are red) are also good to roll - four of them will also get you the Zhuan Yuan tally. Dobree and Culin have both described the game including the values of the rolls.<br/><br/>In the past, tallies were made of bone and hand-engraved. Modern sets have brightly colored plastic tallies and can be found for sale in Mahjong shops in Singapore (and likely elsewhere).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the games intro:-<br/><br/>WAR IN NAPOLEON&rsquo;S TIME<br/>Dickens &amp; Greenwood Games are not historical simulation games, such as you may have seen. They are historically based, in that they recreate the military capacities of a given era in the history of warfare, but they are abstract. They do not restrict the player to the circumstances of a given campaign, or to the capacities of actual units, or to the style of an actual leader. Both players are equipped with units whose capacities are equivalent to those of the era in which the game is set. But their forces and situations are abstract and equal, and each player must win or lose according to his own skill and judgment, without the influence of luck or of pre-existing historical conditions. There are no dice or chance outcomes.<br/><br/>Chris's Comments<br/>The game is played on a map divided into equal squares using units to represent Infantry, artillery and Cavalry.  To make the game balanced the map is also symmetric about the line dividing the two sides.  The game is won by either eliminating all field units, or by blocking the roads leading from the opponents city or occupying the opponent city.<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to locate Puck (Jack of Spades) while avoiding Grandmother (Queen of Hearts).  Puck allows you to eat the candy you  have collected on previous turns.  Grandmother allows another player to eat your candy.  At the end of each turn, you must take one piece of candy from the bowl and give it to another player and also trade a single card with any player.  The game ends when Puck and Grandmother are discovered in one player's hand or if anyone eats ten pieces of candy.  The player who eats the most candy wins.<br/><br/>Candy is an elaborate descendant of The Lost Pueblo of Doctor Green.  It was first published in the program book of ShoreCon 2000.  It was also published in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to get to the other side of the game board.<br/>2. The game board is divided into squares, but you're not told how many squares wide or long it is.<br/>3. You can only step on a square if it has a tile on it. You can step on any tile, even if it was made by another player.<br/>4. If you step on an empty square, or the tile you're standing on breaks, then you &quot;fall in&quot; and have to swim back to the nearest tile.<br/>5. Each empty square that either borders a tile or the starting edge of the game board has a question visible on it. The questions are very simple and have single answers, such as &quot;why does water flow downhill?&quot; or &quot;why can light pass through glass?&quot; or &quot;what is heat?&quot;<br/>6. The only way to make new tiles is by making-up an answer to the question.<br/>7. A tile will only float if you can verify the answer with a reproducible test.<br/>8. A tile can only be broken by proving the answer is wrong with a reproducible test.<br/>9. A test can't break a tile if its results can't be reproduced, a tile can't float if the verifying test's results can't be reproduced.<br/>10. If a tile is broken, then all tiles ahead of it that cannot be connected back to the starting edge by another continuous series of tiles will be broken as well.<br/>11. A player is defined as someone who obeys the rules. If you stop obeying the rules you cease to be a player until you start obeying the rules again.<br/><br/>Further explanation of the rules can be found at: <br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.disenchanted.com/technology/game.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.disenchanted.com/technology/game.html</a><br/><br/>",

Each player has one leader playing piece, several citizens, and some henchman - he must try to get his leader and citizens to the opposite side of the board, trying to lose as few as possible. The other player tries the same with his men. Also both players have &quot;servants&quot; or henchmen, who are expendable for &quot;the dirty work&quot;.<br/>In the end each player gets points for his citizens and leader for reaching the other side - the number of remaining henchman does not matter.<br/><br/>The movement is determined by throwing a dice - but only one player throws it, both have then to use the same number of movement points.<br/><br/>In the four player variant two players control the citizens and the leader, the other two try to help their allies with the henchmen - but they are not allowed to communicate with their partners.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The striking lime green plastic circular gameboard is about 15&quot; in diameter.  It is divided into twelve equal segments, each with a hole near the circumference.  A small ball on a string is attached to the center of the board.  The board has been designed with incomplete joins between each of the twelve sectors so that it is possible to flip the ball upwards by pressing down on the edge of any particular segment.<br/><br/>Players select an equal area of the board to patrol.  If the ball is flipped into an opponent's hole, the player who achieved this is awarded a point.  Each segment has three rows of holes for colored scoring pegs; a peg is placed in the top row of each segment at the start of the game.  When a point is scored, any one peg from the relevant player's segments is moved down one row.<br/><br/>The first player to move all their score pegs from the top to the bottom row wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mysterious treasure of the Aruba Pirates is on the sea-bottom and may be claimed. Since a player cannot do this alone, friends must be called, i.e. collect four maps (cards) of the player's own sea inhabitant friend in four different colors. Whoever succeeds first wins.<br/><br/>Each player plays one of their four cards (maps) from their hand to the center of the table and compares it with the four maps which are already laid out on the table. The player may either take all maps matching the value of the player's map exactly or take all maps which add up to the number on the player's map. Maps which match the player's designated friend (sea inhabitant) and are of a missing color are added to the others displayed in front of him/her. The others are placed in the player's own discard pile. After all players have played their hand of four map cards, a new round begins. Maps in the center of the table remain.<br/><br/>A few specially designed cards bring additional excitement to the game. For example, with the help of these cards one can snatch away maps of the other players laid out in front of them or take all maps which are laid out in the table center. One may replace the maps that were taken by equivalent maps from their own discard pile. Therefore it is recommended that the player collect some of their own friend maps of the color he/she has already laid out. It is important for the other players to note which colors are in each discard pile as well.<br/><br/>In a variant the progressing values of collected friend maps play a larger role.<br/><br/>Arubas Treasure game did very well with our younger play testers (ages six to ten years). Luck, easy arithmetic, and some memory are part of game play. The maps are beautifully illustrated and of good quality. Thus all in all a really beautiful game for families, more fun with 3 or 4 treasure seekers.<br/><br/>Beate and Hans Schmidt<br/>(Translation done in Google, with a little help from Mary Prasad - some parts skipped due to being incomprehensible.)<br/><br/>",

The objective is to attack and eliminate your opponent's forces and prevent them from cloning lost pieces by destroying their cloning stations.  Whether advancing your forces across the board into enemy territories or beaming them directory into any territory via transport stations, you'll find 'Clone' to be a game that will bring hours of fun for family and friends.<br/><br/>Owner's description:<br/><br/>A six sided board with locations for cloning stations on the outside and transportation portals on the inside with hex spaces between.  Each player plays one (or more) color and has 6 cloning stations and 6 playing pieces.  Playing pieces have different values (2 each of one, two and three) and can only capture those of like value or below (a la Stratego).<br/><br/>Three different six-sided dice control your possible choices for action each turn.  The 'Movement' die is numbered 1-2-3-1-2-3 and controls how far you can move and how large a piece you may clone each turn.  The 'Clone' die with 5 blank sides and 'Clone' printed on the remaining side determines whether you can bring a captured piece back and also allows you to roll again.  The remaining 'Control' die determines what combination of actions you may take: Attack, Teleport, enter or exit a Cloning Station.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game players compete to find magical artifacts from an ancient maze. The maze is enchanted and players can change its layout using only their minds. This way they can help themselves in their search or hinder their opponents. Coins placed number up on the maze represent either monsters (stronger the bigger the number on the coin) or artifacts (if the suit, revealed only to the player that lands there, matches the player's suit). First player to find 3 artifacts and exit the maze wins.<br/><br/>This game was designed to be played with a piecepack set and a pentominoes set (e.g. Quintillions). The pentomino pieces are the walls for the maze. It gives a nice 3D feel to the game (each square section of the pentomino pieces has to be of the same approximate size as the small squares from the piecepack tiles). If you don't have a pentominos set, there's an alternative mechanic, although it changes the game a bit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this dexterity game, players build a tower out of variously shaped wooden blocks based upon dice rolls. The results of a roll table indicate whether you must try to use all the blocks left in the kitty, or only one block. Often, the result of the roll indicates the shape of a block that you must place on top of the tower. Completing the tower grants you 15 points, causing the tower to collapse on your turn grants all the other players points equal to the number of blocks left in the kitty. There is an exception: if you fail in your attempt to place the very last block atop the tower, each other player gets 15 points. The game is played to a 50 point total.<br/><br/>The year, 1972, is a guess, as the game is unmarked.  However the box is very similar to &quot;Penta-Logics,&quot; which did come out in 1972, hence the guess.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Viking Waves takes place in the areas raided and conquered by the Norwegian and Danish Vikings during the early Viking Age. It's a game primarily for two players, though limited solitaire play is also possible. The various Viking chieftains rarely fought each other directly, so players compete indirectly.<br/><br/>The game is divided into three phases, each of which involves dozens of raids/attacks and which can be played as a separate game (or all three can be played sequentially as a campaign). In Phase 1, which lasts from 792 until around 834, each raid involves a few ships and lasts only a few days. In Phase 2, from around 834 to around 850&ndash;864, raids are larger. In Phase 3, from around 850&ndash;864 until 879, the goal is conquering land with armies and creating permanent settlements.<br/><br/>In the standard game, each player represents an ever-changing group of Norwegian and Danish chieftains. Optional rules allow for the historical division of territory between Norwegian and Danish groups, allow for limited combat between the two players, and provide for solitaire play.<br/><br/>One twelve-page rulebook<br/>Two 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; maps<br/>One Player Display<br/>342 counters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, you become a business owner attempting to increase your company's profits through hostile takeovers of other companies. You have investment money of 1.2 billion dollars to finance your coming mergers and acquisitions.<br/><br/>Your goal is to buy other companies at a relatively low price compared to their value. If you control that company, your company's profits will increase as well.<br/><br/>The basics of the game:<br/><br/>There is one more business than there are the number of players, each with different company values. Players each have 14 chips with investment values printed on them (4 X 5, 3 X 10, 3 X 50, 1 X 100, 1 X 200, 1 X 300, 1 X 400). They (usually) secretly place these one at a time near a business they wish to invest in. The 2nd, 5th, and some later investments made in each company are made publicly (everyone sees the investment amount).<br/><br/>Players gain control of a company by having more invested in the company at the end of the game than any of the other players (and get more points for having more than all the other players combined). The tricky part being that a player will almost always need to have control of 2 or more business to win, but there's not enough businesses to be able to do so easily, so each player *will* have to out-invest another player, which involves bluffing them as to where your high-value investment chips are.<br/><br/>Each player also chooses an 'investment strategy' card at the beginning of the game, and plays it at some point during the game, changing things like making the value of a company halved, or giving them extra shares in a company, etc.<br/><br/>",

The shoe has holes which have colored edges. Now, the color die comes into play. The first player tries his luck: If the die shows his own color, then he gets to thread his shoelace into one of the next two free holes in his shoe. If it&rsquo;s a different color, then he has to look carefully: If red was rolled and a free hole is also red, then he gets to thread the lace. If, however, none of the next holes are red, then he gets to give away the color by choosing an opponent who needs the color and can use it to continue threading his lace. As soon as a child has succeeded in completely threading his shoelace, he wins the game. If he can then also tie a knot, he&rsquo;s laughing. The others can practice via the illustrated instructions.<br/><br/>Ages 4 and up. Artwork: Kerstin V&ouml;lker<br/><br/>",

The JUDGE gives 15 seconds (timer not included) for anyone else who would like THE RIGHT TO SPEAK to indicate they would like to answer. After the time has elapsed the JUDGE rereads the question back to the original player, the payer has 30 seconds to answer and reason (Yes/No is not sufficient). There is CRITERIA to determine if the answer is acceptable. The JUDGE, regardless of if the answer is to their taste, awards a LAUREL to any answer that meets criteria. A player may CHALLENGE a ruling and risk losing two LAURELS. Anyone else who has asked for THE RIGHT TO SPEAK may provide their answer. If they REPEAT what the first answer was, they lose a LAUREL. If they also provide a satisfactory answer, they receive a LAUREL. After a player has answered one of each coloured card and has 12 LAURELS they may predict even or odd on their turn and finish PHASE 1<br/><br/>For PHASE 2<br/><br/>As the player CLIMBS THE LADDER OF WISDOM in phase two, they must always contribute an answer on another players turn by using the RIGHT TO SPEAK TOKEN. As well, on their turn they must Guess EVEN/ODD before rolling. Being unable to answer or failing to contribute costs five LAURELS or go down a rung. Once at the top there is a final guess of EVEN / ODD to be declared THE GREAT THINKER.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inspired by Sid Sackson's classic abstract Focus, Crossfire is a stacking game played on a hexagonal grid.<br/><br/>Piece stacks have a maximum size dependent on how many neighboring hexes it has. Excess pieces in a stack are removed from the bottom by the stack's controller and either returned to the stack controller's reserve to return to the board later, or else are captured and removed from the game.<br/><br/>A move consists of a player moving either a stack he controls, or pieces from the top of a stack he controls, and then moves those pieces in a straight line a number of spaces up to the number of pieces being moved. Alternatively, a player may introduce a piece from his reserve onto any space on the board.<br/><br/>The game is won when he forces his opponent into a position where his opponent cannot make a move.<br/><br/>",

There are five different types of pieces all with differing moves of 1 or 2 spaces (like restricted chess pieces).  The pieces are bright yellow and red plastic.

Pieces may move individually or in battalions. A battalion is the group of each piece type, e.g. 4 bishops are a battalion. Battalion movement is all pieces making the same move (e.g., three diagonally northwest). It's like station keeping in naval fleet movement. Or battalions can move in a chain, each advancing forward to take the place of the other, like marching forward. All pieces have to spaced apart equally for chain movement.<br/><br/>It was a commercially available game. The map provided was a roll up chess board. The pieces were of good quality plastic in the traditional Staunton chess piece style.<br/><br/>",

The player holding the Masonite bat must attempt to hit the table tennis ball into the plastic grid, preferably landing the ball in a favorable compartment.<br/><br/>",

Although it was one of our first projects, it has taken us nearly two years to finish, since mechanized warfare is quite different from e.g. colonial or ACW. Our main objective was to write a set of rules that would allow a fast, yet as realistic as possible wargame.<br/><br/>In order to keep the actual number of pages as low as possible, we have opted for a system that may be compared with &quot;Lego&quot;. You may have a huge pile of Lego blocks at hand, yet to build a house, you will only use the ones you need. In our system, the &quot;unit cards&quot; stand for the Lego blocks: there is a huge choice of different units for each nation, yet you will only need those you have units for in the game.<br/><br/>The number of COMMAND CARDS is similar to the other games. So far, we have finished the D-Day to Berlin units for Germany and the USA.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a combination of chess and checkers. It was originally published in a chess fanzine [which one?]. It is played on a normal checkerboard. The setup is identical to checkers, except for the rear 4 &quot;checkers&quot;. On the back row, in place of the four checkermen each player has two checker kings (moving and capturing as in normal American checkers), one bishop and one cook (Golomb's name for a (3,1)-leaper, more commonly known as a Camel).<br/><br/>When a checker man gets to the back row, it can be promoted into a bishop, cook or checker king. The bishops move and capture precisely as in chess, viz., capturing by replacement. The cooks move and capture like chess knights, except that they move to the opposite corner of a 4x2 rectangle rather than a 3x2 rectangle. Thus both bishops and cooks are colorbound to the black squares. Unlike a checker piece, bishops and cooks are not allowed to keep capturing after the first capture.<br/><br/>The object is to capture all the opponent's kings; stalemating the opponent is also a win.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSources<br/>    D.

        "description": "Enterprise is a real estate trading game, with some resemblance to Monopoly, but with elaborations. While it is designed in Australia, and uses a few Australian expressions, the content and theme are not noticeably Australian.<br/><br/>The playing area is a simulation of a planned city, divided into two zones : an inner Residential ring and an outer Industrial ring. The play proceeds on a circular track, with each ring containing a series of &ldquo;sites&rdquo;, of which two aggregate to a &ldquo;subdivision&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The ultimate objective is to &ldquo;evenly develop&rdquo; as many of these sites as possible, without going broke !<br/><br/>The Residential zone can be developed by building Cottages, Mansions, and Flats(apartments), while the Industrial zone is available for a variety of uses, represented by card &ldquo;shares&rdquo;( stocks). It is NOT necessary to land on a particular site to purchase it.<br/><br/>Players alternate between each ring according to dice throws, and pay penalties for landing on other Players&rsquo; sites. Several spaces mandate change of zone. Movement is subject to considerable randomization.<br/><br/>Each player receives an initial land allocation of two &ldquo;subdivisions&rsquo; (two sites each of Residential and Industrial) ; plus a cash &ldquo;float&rdquo;. Players proceed to buy development items, initially from the bank. The pool of available items is limited, to induce competition.<br/><br/>The inventory comprises: Cottages 14, Mansions 10, Flats 6 ( total 30). The space available to place these items totals 24. Prices range from a low of $100 for &ldquo;Cottages&rdquo; to $400 for a &ldquo;share&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Electronics&rdquo; factory. More expensive items eventually provide a disproportionately higher return, but may be too expensive in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Players are able to increase the value of their holdings by increasing the capital investment on each site from a single unit up to two units and/or more valuable buildings and upgraded shares. Any site must contain only identical items, but any subdivision may contain a mix ( eg cottages and mansions on adjacent sites; or, say, &ldquo;railway&rdquo; shares next to &ldquo;glass works&rdquo;).Various bonuses accrue when sites are &ldquo;double developed&rdquo; and/or when sites are &ldquo;evenly developed&rdquo;.<br/><br/>These development items are available initially from a bank, but soon become tradeable between Players. Players short of cash for Landing fees may even have to trade/sell at &ldquo;distress&rdquo; prices.<br/><br/>When all a Player&rsquo;s sites are &ldquo;evenly developed&rdquo;, Players can attempt to buy more <br/>(vacant) land, from the bank only.<br/><br/>The game has several unusual features:<br/>1. &ldquo;stock&rsquo; ( houses, shares etc) can be moved from one site to another, or even &ldquo;off board&rdquo; until required again.<br/>2. un-developed sites attract no landing fees (unlike Monopoly)<br/>3. there is some limited scope for trading of rationed items above their &ldquo;bank price&rdquo;, as Players seek to establish &ldquo;double developed&rdquo; sites<br/>4. The amount of cash available to any Player for buying at any one time is limited by certain arbitrary rules.<br/><br/>Possible faults :<br/>1. The supply of in-coming cash seems too small compared to the amount leaving the Game via random penalties.<br/>2. Arbitrary limits on Players ability to spend seem unnecessary.<br/>3. The Game relies on a &ldquo;Special Lucky Seven&rdquo; rule that is easy to overlook ! <br/>4. The Rules are numbered, thus easy to reference; they are not however, arranged intuitively, and contain a few cryptic passages!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Satisfactory&quot; is a card game that bring the best and worst parts of &quot;White Collar Work&quot; into an interactive card game.<br/><br/>Each player manages a hand of cards consisting of &quot;Hours&quot;, &quot;Ladders&quot;, &quot;Back-Stabbing&quot; and &quot;Special&quot; cards. On each turn you pay &quot;hours&quot; to place down &quot;ladder&quot; cards trying to climb the corporate ladder to the top. Beware though, as other players can spend their hours to play &quot;Back-stabbing cards trying to either demote your or take credit for your work.<br/><br/>8 random &quot;CEO&quot; cards alter the game dynamics by creating changes and effects to all players.<br/><br/>Each round is considered a week of work, and after 8 weeks the game is over. The &quot;Worker&quot; with the most Ladder Points wins the game.<br/><br/>This is a NON collectible game for 2-6 players for fast paced card action.<br/><br/>",

You will also be sent to areas of the game board which symbolize key aspects of women's lives: home, employment, personal style, and public achievement. As American women have known both frustration and triumph in their struggle for equality, you too will progress or lose ground on the board as you learn the landmark developments of women's history, the fight for women's suffrage, and the continuing effort for fair treatment at work and at home.<br/><br/>The game is designed for both simple and more complex play. Those players who have had little exposure to women's history will most enjoy the simple version, which familiarizes them with details and people but does not test their knowledge. Those players who are ready for the risks (and pleasures) of a challenge will enjoy the complex version. Here questions are asked and must be answered in the course of pursuing the goal and planning game strategy.<br/><br/>In both game versions, the objective is to reach the end of the path where the Statue of Liberty stands as a symbol of freedom of choice and opportunity - the life goal of both women and men in America.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;In GONE BANANAS your ID, EGO, and SUPEREGO come together on a game board that confronts you with real-life situations.  You take risks and develop strategies.  You will experience 'the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.'  But win or lose, you will know that you have been in a game!&quot;<br/><br/>This is a fairly typical &quot;special interest&quot; roll-and-move game with a psychoanalytical theme and a couple unique twists.<br/><br/>As players move around the outer track, they collect ID, EGO, and WOW!/OW! (Superego) cards through square instructions and a Chance card mechanism.  You use these cards throughout the game to buy BUTTONS and ZAPPERS, and to avoid penalties.<br/><br/>Linked at the corners of the outer track are four independent alternate routes, one each for the themes IS/EGO/SE and GONE BANANAS.  While on these alternate paths you have the chance to earn a BUTTON (literally) of the corresponding color...but each path also entails risk and expense.<br/><br/>Some of the squares along the outer track where &quot;Chance&quot; cards are had can be &quot;owned&quot; by players by buying ZAPPERS with ID cards.  Once bought, the squares are marked with one of the player's ZAPPER tokens.  That player gets benefits for landing on the ZAPPER, while his opponents landing there have to give him a BUTTON or WOW! cards, and the opponent gets all his OW!s.  Each ZAPPER location can be bought and re-bought (at a higher price) throughout the game.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when one player has buttons of all four colors (representing a balanced personality) and more WOW!s than OW!s (representing positive self-worth...I guess).<br/><br/>The production value is first-class, as is the professional artwork on the nicely-mounted board.  The bits are plastic and specially designed for the game - the player tokens are bananas on a little colored base.  The cards are the only weak spot, small print on heavily-colored, cheapish  card stock.<br/><br/>The double goal and constant shift of buttons might make this game a cut above the standard RaM fare.  Keeping resource cards and buttons hidden would also increase the fun...and the chaos.  I've had many of these low-volume specialty games pass through my thrifting hands, and this may be the first I actually try.  The Freudian theme might wear thin early, but who knows, I might learn something about myself...or my mother.<br/><br/>",

The games was for two players, Red and Blue, each has 6 pieces in his own color, numbered 1 to 6. There is,  first a drop phase, then a movement phase with each phase being in numerical sequence.<br/><br/>For the dropping phase Red drops 1, then Blue drops 1. Red drops 2, then Blue drops 2, and so forth through Blue dropping 6. Now the movement phase starts. The pieces are now moved in numerical sequence. So Red moves his 1, then blue moves his 1. Red moves his 2, then blue moves his 2 and so on.  In addition the pieces are started with the silver side up. When the pieces are played a second time, then they are flipped to the other side, gold, to help keep track of the sequence.<br/><br/>The object is to score points; one point is scored by forming a line of four of the players pieces, either orthogonal or diagonal. The first player to score six points wins.<br/><br/>The original pieces, according to the review, were not numbered. The &quot;1&quot; was a clear acrylic disc showing a circle, the &quot;2&quot; was an vesica piscis (oval with pointed ends), the &quot;3&quot; an equilateral triangle, &quot;4&quot; a square, &quot;5&quot; a pentagon, and &quot;6&quot; a hexagon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kariba and Kalak are 2 different games by Frank Stark that come in one box. Both can be played using the same components. Kariba, the main game, is a 2 player variant inspired by the Mancala game family. Kalak is a Marbles variant, or rather, a pebble-flicking dexterity game whose arena is created by assembling the 2 piece jigsaw board in an alternative way. Kalak is mainly aimed at younger players.<br/><br/>KARIBA<br/>This variation on the age-old Kalah game keeps the familiar sowing movement rules, but it introduces an alternative way to capture stones and dramatically changes the way the board is used. It also introduces new types of pebbles. They now come in 3 different colours, each with its own value, and one even with a special protective ability. The board shows 2 large scoring pits at either end of the board. Between them, 2 rows of just 4 pits are sitting side by side. Each player is assigned one row of 4 that ends in their private scoring pit. This row is the only row in which a player will place their own pieces and it should be obvious that the players move in opposite directions.<br/><br/>At the start, both players get a set of 25 stones that forms the supply, and these are kept beside the board. It is a mix of 3 types: 20 stones that are worth 1 point, 3 treasure stones that are worth 2, and 2 guard stones that are not only worth 3 points, but also protect all stones in a pit from capture, as long as a black stone is not caught out sitting on its own. By itself, a guard stone is equally vulnerable to capture.<br/><br/>In turn, players pick up 1-4 tones from supply and move them onto the board, or remove all stones from one of their own pits and move these further along the track towards the scoring pit. To move a hand of stones, the player chooses the first hand stone and drops it into the pit it would reach next on its way to the scoring pit. Then, 1 stone is dropped in each pit thereafter until a player's hand is empty. When a player manages to drop a stone into the scoring pit (here players are forced to drop the lowest value stone), it is safe and counts toward their end total. All remaining hand stones go back to supply and must start all over again. When one player has no more stones left to move, the game ends. Players add up the total points in their own pit. The loser ignores any stones left en-route on the board, but subtracts the value of the stones still in supply from this total. The player with the highest score wins, with simple tie-breakers provided.<br/><br/>What makes this game interesting is the way by which opposing pieces are captured. When a stone is placed in an empty hole, all opposition stones that sit beside it and are not protected by at least one guard stone are captured and are immediately added to the pit of the capturing player, boosting that player's score. The high stone total triggers the need for continued protection from capture by Guard Stones, which adds to the deliberations to be made. Guards stones will be deliberately played so they overshoot the scoring pit, ensuring their continued services as protectors of all other stones on their way to the scoring pit. However, sacrifices will have to be made, making continual forward planning a requirement for victory.<br/><br/>KALAK<br/>By flipping over one side of the jigsaw board, a flat surface is revealed for the bottom half of the board, and that leaves a square of 4 small pits with 1 large one directly above it at the top. The player sits at the base of the flat surface board, and makes a smiling pebble face by placing 2 black pupil stones in the lower &quot;eye socket&quot; pits, 2 blue ones underneath the nose-shaped jigsaw lock to make nostrils, and by creating a smiling mouth of the remaining 8 blue stones underneath.<br/><br/>In phase 1, the player flicks each blue stone once, trying to reach the large target pit at the top. Only blue stones that fall into this pit can be taken into the second phase, the rest are removed. In phase 2, the player places all surviving stones in a single row on the bottom edge, including the 2 eye stones if more than 4 stones survived the first phase. Again, stones are all flicked once, but this time the player determines their end score. Each pitted stone scored one point, but player's will have to spread the stones out across all pits, as any stones that supercede the maximum capacity set for each pit in this phase are worthless. Optional rules to make it harder by using special landing restrictions for the then also more valuable eye stones, or making it easier by relaxing the set-up for phase 2 are also included.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     2006 Kariba (including Kalak) Clemens Gerhards - deluxe wooden version - in print (last checked oct 2006)<br/><br/><br/>Clemens Gerhards produces their wooden games range to high standards, and this is no exception. The 2 solid oiled beech wood board pieces slot together seamlessly, and the (minimum of) 50 semi-precious stones are colourful and elegant. A string-chord storage bag for these is provided. The whole set fits in a remarkably small box, roughly the size of a DVD box set. Frank Stark has been releasing a couple of board games each year through this smaller German imprint, after being attracted by the quality of its products.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFO:<br/><br/>     language skill needed: language neutral. It comes with German rules.<br/>     english translation: Clemens Gerhards has made an English translation available.<br/>     artwork: none, Clemens Gerhards games come in plain brown, ribbed cardboard boxes with the game title burnt into the lid. <br/>     awards won: none.<br/><br/><br/>Note: in 2008 Clemens Gerhards published a three piece jigsaw board edition. An additional piece can be added to the original Kariba board so that a new board with two rows of six pits sitting side by side is produced. This expansion provides new tactical challenges to the game. In addition, rules for a two player game called &quot;Cubango&quot;, a Kalaha variant that is played using the expanded board, are also included.<br/><br/>",

He is an extremely important figure in the development of mathematics yet we know relatively little about his mathematical achievements. Unlike many later Greek mathematicians, where at least we have some of the books which they wrote, we have nothing of Pythagoras's writings. The society which he led, half religious and half scientific, followed a code of secrecy which certainly means that today Pythagoras is a mysterious figure.<br/><br/>Pythagoras is the recreation of the Pythagorian &quot;Pessoi&quot;.<br/>This is a real ancient boardgame from ancient Hellas.<br/><br/>There is one board. <br/>There are 2-6 players. <br/>Each player has pawns. <br/>Pawns must have the signs of ancient Greek letters. <br/>Also there are three dice with ancient Greek shapes on them.<br/>The player with the highest die roll plays first. <br/>All pawns must enter the board make a word.<br/><br/>The board game Pythagoras has the following items:<br/>1. A Colorful Board.<br/>2. Pawns/letters different in color and shape for each of the players.<br/>3. One to Three dice  with different shapes on each one.<br/>4. Many other items.<br/><br/>",

Buy the best used cars from the other players and create the best car collection of all. But each used car has its secrets. Perhaps there's a treasure chest in the trunk or possibly hidden accident damage. Unfortunately, you can't trust anyone in this game. In the next round, it's your chance to sell and you can then try and foist the cursed cars on someone else.<br/><br/>The game is based on the &quot;Lemon Game&quot; from business theory. The lemon game is often used to explain credit notes in the banking industry. There are two important things that a lemon game needs. One player has more information than the other and there is a greater supply than demand. The theory says that in such situations, if a player does everything right, he's making the wrong choice! BTW, the name of the game comes from 'Lemon' being slang for a car you'd rather not buy.<br/><br/><br/>",

These creatures could consume pollutants and scrap materials (they are also designed to be cute and machine washable).  Unfortunately, some of these VERY LARGE CREATURES, or V.L.C.'s have gone rogue and are now eating cities.  Can you stop them?<br/><br/>VLC allows you to take your stuffed animals and wage war with them against your miniatures.  Because of the nature of the VLC world, any minis are usable, from fantasy, to 20th century soldiers, to futuristic vehicles and aircraft.<br/><br/>One player controls the V.L.C. bent on eating another city.  The other player plays the cities inhabitants, militia and army forces.  These troops are armed with swords, spears, rifles, ray-guns or whatever you can find in the way of army men or other minis.<br/><br/>Don't worry, the V.L.C.'s don't eat people, and if a V.L.C. is destroyed, its unique biology allows it to reform after the game.  This makes combat a non-lethal affair.<br/><br/>So take that teddy bear, rabbit, Cthulu or whatever stuffed animals you have, and reek some havoc.<br/><br/>",

They go for a premium on earth and you could become rich. But first you better concentrate on paying off your ship.&quot;<br/><br/>In Rocks for Sale, two to five (best for three to five) players fly their space ships along a pick-up and delivery circuit from the assayer's space station to the asteroid belt and back. Players tow asteroids back from the belt and sell them to the assayer, with the eventual goal of being the first to pay off their ship. But there are additional costs to running a mining ship, such as fuel, repairs and blasting charges. Mining in space can also be dangerous. Fuel leaks, overheating engines and other miners' blasting charges are only a few of the hazards an asteroid minor may face.<br/><br/>Will you be the first to pay off your ship?

Personnel units represent officers, couriers, color guards (6-8 men), artillery crews, and cavalry and infantry units (approximately 20-25 men). Each gun or vehicle counter represents one artillery piece or horse-drawn vehicle.<br/><br/>Scenarios will cover action on McPherson's Ridge on Day 1, and at the Bliss Farm over Days 2 and 3.<br/><br/>",

There he goes ... everyone grabs for him!  Sharp eyes with quick reflexes are needed here.  Catch the Crook when he pops then you can move your Cop along the board toward the Crook's Hideout.  Be careful though, you must finish your move before he pops again.  If you don't ... back you go!  The first player to reach the Crook's Hideout wins the game!<br/><br/>A plastic figure about 5&quot; high representing the crook is attached to a suction-loaded spring device and placed in the center of the colorful gameboard after being 'set'.  Players may roll the die as many times as they wish on their turn, but if the suction device releases before the player has declared their move finished no rolls for that turn count.  Whoever catches the plastic crook has the next turn.<br/><br/>The first player to move their plastic 'cop' along the game path from the Jail house to the Crook's Hideout is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player tries to perform tasks without waking up little 'STANLEY', a light sleeper, who is sleeping peacefully in his crib.  The players earn money for each task they perform while baby-sitting.  Every time little 'STANLEY' jumps up and yells, players lose money.<br/><br/>The game comes in a huge (15&quot; x 21&quot; x 4&quot;) box.  The large elaborate molded plastic gameboard features a complicated mechanism beneath the surface which is responsible for setting the tasks which will not be completed successfully.  The gameboard depicts Stanley's room; Stanley is in his centrally located crib which is surrounded by a circle of 16 holes where the various task symbols are inserted.  These holes are in turn are surrounded by a circle of 20 holes - 16 corresponding task peg holes and 4 chore holes.<br/><br/>Players are dealt three cards at the start of the game and draw another (or more if needed) at the start of each turn to give a total of four; these are used in gameplay to either perform tasks to earn money, or hinder other players while performing their tasks.<br/><br/>The active player receives the task pegs and inserts pegs into the corresponding task peg hole when required.  Up to three tasks may be attempted per turn, depending on the cards held.  25 cents is awarded for the first task completed successfully, 50 cents for the second and one dollar for the third.  If however Stanley pops up and 'cries', all money earned that turn is lost.<br/><br/>The game is over when there is no money left for distribution.  Players total their earnings and the player with the highest amount is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players sit side-by-side facing the bottom of the game board.  Each player has a dial on the board with 6 possible Batting options and 6 possible Pitching options. Cupping their hands over their dial to keep their selection hidden from the opponent until both players reveal their selection simultaneously, the player at bat sets their dial to one of the Batting options (A-Steal, B-Sacrifice, C-Hit or Steal, D-Hit and Run, E-Ready and Cautious (to hit if pitch looks good), F-To Hit (swing hard)) and the player on the mound selects one of the Pitching options (1-Fast Ball, 2-Curve In and Over, 3-Corner Clipper, 4-Bad Ball Break Away, 5-Pitch-Out, 6-Throw to Base). For every bases situation from No-One-On-Base to Bases Loaded there is a separate reference card conveniently held together in small notebook binder fashion. Also, there are three pitcher cards that need to be consulted for some play results, and which can be used for a little more realism about varying pitcher abilities.<br/><br/>For the result of the play dice are rolled to see if the pitch is a ball or strike, or if a play action results.  For example, with No-One-On-Base, and the Batter sets their dial to F-To Hit Hard, and the Pitcher sets their dial to 2-Curve, and a 7 is rolled on the dice, the players would look at the No-One-on-Base card in the F-2 Column with dice roll 7 (F-2-7) and the result might be a ball, strike, hit batter, wild pitch, or one of 150 numbered plays (1-150) resulting, such as Ground Out, Fly Out, Single, Double, Triple Home Run, Error, Rain Delay (or rain out), or whatever.  There's even a Triple Play possibility -- with at least two runners on base -- but because that is a rare play it may rarely if ever happens.<br/><br/>The game appears to be self published in 1962.  Similar to Cadaco's All-star baseball, but without cards for individual players.  Roll dice to determine play outcome.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/>o Gameboard baseball field with Pitching/Batting Dial, and the field can be used to place markers to indicate runners on base (or baseball player miniatures not included).<br/>o Pitch Result Card for each runner situation (No one on base, Runner on 1st, Runner on 2nd, Runner on 3rd, Runners on 1st and 2nd, Runners on Second and 3rd, Bases Loaded).<br/>o Text of 150 play results printed on the inside of the game box top, and which is easily propped up behind the gameboard baseball field (like and outfield wall) where each of the 150 play results can easily be read.<br/>o Three pitcher cards (Rookie to Ace) for use with some hit-pitch results<br/>o Two dice<br/><br/>All American Baseball is a fun head-to-head game with balls and strikes and 150 potential plays every pitch depending on Pitch/Hit selections made by players and a dice roll.  It does not include a lefty-righty factor, real or fictional players or abilities, speed, defense, or pitcher fatigue; the fun comes from trying to outwit your opponent with your hidden pitch and hit choices each pitch, and for the great number of potential play outcomes that are relevant to whether or not runners on on base(s).<br/><br/>",

Even so, his skill at the controls allowed him to not only stabilize the massive robot, but to even bring himself into a good position to use his own heavy weapon.<br/><br/>With a flick of his trigger finger, Lopez's robot fired the massive fusion cannon which belched forth a deadly stream of super heat gas. Johnson's robot took it full in the face and fell backwards, crashing to the arena floor with a might thud.<br/><br/>The crowd roared as Lopez took his victory lap around the arena, one more foe defeated by his superior robot driving skills and weaponry.<br/><br/>This is Bad Baby's latest Mini-game, Robot Jocks. Take your mighty robot's weapon systems into the national arena and fight other robots. Try to out maneuver, out fight and just plain out last your foe in this unique, and fun, card based game.<br/><br/>",

The player may only discard a suitable card if he succeeds in throwing a special combination of three dice: e.g. Street (2-3-4), High-Score (sum more than 15), Sandwich (1-5-1) or OleO (3-3-3).

Brasher Comic Module)<br/><br/>Consists of 30 tiles you cut out from the comic. You need to provide a token to represent you on the board, 1D6, and paper and pencil to keep track of your character and the number of turns spent in the tomb.<br/><br/>&quot;In this solitaire game, you are the explorer, seeking treasure in old tombs. Each turn, more of the crypt is revealed as you travel along the dark and dusty tunnel. Each game is different, and danger lurks around   every corner.<br/><br/>The object of this quest is the recovery of the Pharaoh's Scepter.&quot;<br/><br/>Place the starting tile face up. &quot;The character moves through the various rooms and corridors depicted on those tiles. Each turn, when the character wants to move in a direction not yet explored, a tile is picked at random from the unused pile and placed in the direction the player is moving. Make sure the corridors line up with each other. If there is more than one possible way to align the corridors, the orientation is up to the player. The token representing the player is then moved to the new section.<br/><br/>After a player has moved, look at the new tile. If it has a letter in the center, refer to the lettered paragraphs at the end of the rules. If the tile has a door, it must be opened. If the tile has no letter, then a roll must be made for Wandering Monsters.&quot;<br/><br/>Basically, you explore the crypt (looking for the Scepter), fighting monsters and picking up magical items when you can. The tiles in my copy are missing the identifying text on the tiles that are not supposed to be blank; however, you can figure it out without them.<br/><br/>You must complete your quest - to return alive with the Pharaoh's Scepter - within 40 turns. For more of a challenge, reduce the number of turns allowed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Firefight Games website:<br/><br/>With Baghdad the target and the road network limited, the easiest and most practicable plan was to seize the Iron Bridge over the Euphrates River at Falluja. An elaborate plan was created and carried out without a loss. Iraqi resistance was non-existent. With the town in British hands, the attacking force was dispersed elsewhere. The British did not think the Iraqis would counterattack. On May 22, in the early morning, the Iraqi 6th Brigade\\3rd Division (800 men) with CV33 tankettes attacked. Iraqi artillery pulverized the two British companies holding the town in their trenches surrounding it. They were forced to pull back into the town. The three Iraqi battalions with tanks were as good as the British by accounts in combat but for one thing: steady morale. From 3 a.m. to 10 a.m., the two British companies held but were nearing their end in this urban type combat. Luckily, the Luftwaffe had failed to support this attack (although they did the following day!). At 10 a.m., the tables began to turn when two additional British companies arrived. The battle did not stop but raged onward until the Iraqis gave up at 6 p.m. The road to Baghdad was now open. It had been a near thing!<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>1 11x17 inch map<br/>160 counters, <br/>Player aids<br/><br/>Scale:<br/>company\\platoon <br/>1 hex = 100 yds<br/>1 turn = 1.5 hours for a total of 11 turns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Letter of Marque and Reprisal' is a set of rules allowing you to wargame small-scale naval engagements in the 'Age of Sail', or thereabouts.It was written to recreate engagements between the likes of Francois l'Ollonois, Edward &quot;Blackbeard&quot; Teach and their opponents.<br/><br/>'Small-scale' means that usually, a player will captain a single vessel, not a squadron or fleet. It works fine for engagements of up to four vessels a side (thus allowing 8 players to participate), beyond that things tend to drag a bit.<br/>'Small-scale' at the moment also implies that the ships captained are smallish merchants, pirates and navy ships. The rules will be expanded to include line-of-battle ships later on.<br/>The game is not tied to a particular line of models or a scale. You can play with anything from 1/1.200th to 1/300th scale ship models.<br/>The rules sport a fair amount of complexity in order to keep managing a single ship a tactical challenge. Still, the rules essentially aim at gaming, not simulation.<br/><br/>Lastly, 'LoMaR' is a hobby project which its author would like to share. <br/>That is to say: any feedback on the game or new input is welcome, be that criticism of the rules, adding new ship sheets, expanding the rules to different periods or styles of naval warfare (the galleys of Lepanto) or writing scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Although responsible for unimaginable terror and tragedy, the war also gave birth to innovation and invention on an unprecedented scale.<br/><br/>With Spitting Fire, players can take control of the aircraft forged in this crucible of conflict, and battle each other in skies the world over! We should state at the outset that those who are aching for a historically-accurate, painstakingly-researched, richly-detailed simulation of World War II dogfights should probably look elsewhere. While such games can be exciting, they aren&rsquo;t what we had in mind. However, if you want a fast-playing, fun game that gives a nod to history without getting bogged down in historical minutiae, then Spitting Fire is for you.<br/><br/>Spitting Fire is designed to be used with any scale from 1:700 to 1:72 (although larger scales will require a substantial playing area). The rulebook includes data cards for 25 of the most famous fighters from World War II, with others to be released soon!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A precis of the rule&rsquo;s introduction.<br/><br/>These rules are intended for use with one infantry section (usually 10 men), in 54mm scale, per player, which attacks a small objective such as a machine gun bunker or defended house (Airfix Strongpoint). Start with the basic rules, and when you have mastered these add some or all of the more realistic advanced rules. You can use any scale, of course - half all distances for 25mm scale, and if you insist on fighting Stalingrad in a matchbox an the 10.30 from Paddington, divide distances by 10 and use 5mm figures! As is inevitable, this has escalated to whole platoons (often still with one player per section) with some support such as a medium machine gun team or man-pack flamethrower team per side. We've never bothered very much about a points system, though one is included in the appendices to these rules, except that men defending a strong position such as a farmhouse should be attacked by about twice their number. Favourite games include two units of 10 partisans each, ambushing a German staff car with escort of two motorcycle combinations and a section in a half track, and a British Recce unit consisting of a turret less Stuart tank, a Dingo scout car and a half-track with infantry section running into a German advanced defence unit in slit trenches with MMG's and Panzerfausts. The possibilities are enormous, and great variety can be achieved quite cheaply, using Britain&rsquo;s or Airfix figures and vehicles, which are less prone to damage than Tamiya and other plastic models, though we use these too!<br/><br/>Each soldier must have the correct rank, weapons and equipment, a limited supply of ammunition (so that he can run out!) and is identified by a number on his base. This number ensures that each man stays with his correct unit - if he's more than 20cm. from it, he has deserted! Wounds are NOT bullet wounds - you don&rsquo;t go anywhere with a bullet, in you, no matter WHAT John Wayne gets up to! Wounds restrict a man's fighting ability, and may eventually prevent him from fighting, though he may recover in time for a later round if you are fighting a campaign.<br/><br/>",

Ltd.) is a simple dexterity game using plastic cups shaped like martini glasses. 20 plastic cups in four colors (including one white cup) are arranged in a pyramid with the white cup at the top. Players roll a special six-sided die that has three sides showing a black cup, and the other three sides showing a dot that is either red, green or yellow. If it shows a colored dot, the player has to remove a cup of the corresponding color. If it shows a black cup, the player can remove a cup of any color. The player who causes the white cup to fall loses, and has to rebuild the pyramid for the next game.<br/><br/>The Glass Tower Game (Daiso) is a similar game with the same sort of components but the opposite objective - players roll the die and then stack cups according to the die roll. On a roll of 1 to 4, the player has to stack a cup of the corresponding colour - no action if there are no more cups of that colour. On a roll of 5, the player can stack a cup of any colour, and on a six, the player does not need to stack any cup). The player who puts the last cup on top of the stack wins. Four different structures can be made with the cups, to play the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the rare 1966 version released by Milton Bradley. Players took the role of Captain American and Bucky trying to be the first to reach the secret hideout and thwart the evil plans of the Sky Spider! (Who was he???)<br/><br/>The game is simple spin and move. The only additional  point in the mechanics of the game is that players could land on locations with friends of Cap's (Thor, Spider-Man, Marvel Girl, Wasp, Giant-Man and Iron Man) and get 'help' - (extra spaces). But if you landed on a villain's space, you lost spaces, or full turns.<br/><br/>The villains included some of the lesser characters of Marvel Comics of the day - and ironically, only one is a Captain America villain!<br/><br/>Characters drawn on the board game in full color include: Captain America, Bucky, The Mandarin and the Destroyer.<br/><br/>The villains are an eclectic lot: The Mandarin, Titanium Man, and The General (from Iron Man's story lines); Loki and the Destroyer (from Thor's pages of Journey into Mystery); Lucifer (who barely made an appearance in X-Men comics - issue 9?); the Molten Man (from Spider-Man); and then the only Captain America foe, Zemo. Of course, by this time in the comics, Zemo had already caused Bucky's death, and had in turn died in a battle with Cap! (It was an early Avenger's storyline.)  But we were kids! What did we care!!!<br/><br/>This game is redeemed by the great art work on the board and the box. (Looks like the villains on the board might be by Don Heck working from Jack Kirby layouts, though the larger Cap and Bucky item might be vintage 1940's Kirby. The box cover certainly looks like 1960's Kirby. Since this came out at the same time as the first Marvel animated series, which were limited animations of actual comic panels, it is also likely these are art pieces simply lifted from existing art. (The Mandarin's piece is from the cover of one of his earliest appearances). This would explain the Heck artwork, since he was currently doing duty on most of the titles featuring these characters.)<br/><br/>The game originally came with a comic - one of the few early efforts at cross-over collectibles.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s particularly hard to define where the &ldquo;real&rdquo; ends and the &ldquo;fictional&rdquo; begins. For those of you who follow military and scientific matters, you&rsquo;re likely to spot where reality meets fiction-although in some cases, you may not be able to clearly distinguish between these boundaries. However, it really isn't important where the lines blur a bit. The fuzzy area where reality and fiction intermix is intentional. The real fun is in the game itself and what you can (or can&rsquo;t) make of it to be successful in your mission and/or goals!<br/><br/>You can play T5 strictly as a miniatures game, a roleplaying game, or both simultaneously. As you will see, the Character Profile Log sheets can be filled out and set up to use either way, depending upon the amount of information you want to know, or need to have, about a character. The game can easily be converted into a dual miniatures/roleplaying game simply by choosing to play one character as yourself while the rest of your team (Strike Cell) is played normally as miniatures would be.<br/><br/>T5 is excellent for present-day combat simulation gaming too! The unique and versatile Com20 game system mechanics give you everything you need to game battles taking place today--with no modifications necessary! See the T5 Action! page for additional details.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Off The Hook is a fun-filled, action-packed poker game that combines calculated chance with thought-provoking strategy.<br/><br/>Each player gets ten white chips, two colored dice, one green marker, and one blue marker.  The starting player takes five &quot;community&quot; dice, and one green die in the closed Off the Hook box.  The player then shakes the box, and opens it to look inside, and announce a poker hand based on what they see.  The box is then passed to the next player, who can either call their bluff, accept the call by looking in the box an making a new (higher) call, or give up an &quot;Off the Hook&quot; marker to pass the box without penalty.<br/><br/>If a player gets caught bluffing, they lose the number of chips to the challenger equal to the number showing on the green die in the box.  Otherwise, the challenger pays.<br/><br/>The person with the most chips wins (usually the last one left in the game).<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.offthehookpoker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.offthehookpoker.com/</a><br/><br/>",

The game focuses more on morale than raw strength, and in fact units and combat effects are measured in morale points, rather than strength points. While units pretty much obey the player&rsquo;s wishes, the card system makes for a very dynamic and unpredictable turn sequence.<br/><br/>List Of Ingredients<br/><br/>ITNOG comes as a 94 page book with a spiral binding and two player aid cards on card stock (despite what the back cover says, these are not laminated). There is a dash of color on the inside, with small pictures of beautifully painted 28 mm figures through out. The rules run 56 pages, followed by seven of optional rules. Also included are:<br/><br/>Counters to be copied onto card stock and cut out. <br/>A chronology of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars <br/>A list of the battles between 1792 and 1815 <br/>Army Lists with commander ratings <br/>A small scenario the Battle of Arroyo de Molinos. <br/>Players will need to make a variety of counters or markers to play the game, or else develop paper rosters if they prefer.<br/><br/>",

Depending on what the player takes, she may take more tiles, or possibly even lose tiles.  The player with the most tiles at the end wins.<br/><br/>The Sunshine Game offers the players some choices:  In turn, each player draws from her personal supply of face-down tiles, and then adds it to one of the eight rays of the sun.  In doing so, she also narrates how that particular picture ties into the story so far.  In this game, the first player to place all her tiles wins.<br/><br/>Selecta Spielzeug 3547<br/><br/>Ages 4 and up<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Factors of Spice is a Euro-hybrid game. Similar in theme to Goa with mechanics like Puerto Rico and El Grande but with a map, limited combat, some secret movement elements.<br/><br/>The time is the late 1500s and the domination of the Spice Trade is in the balance.  Far from playing colonial powers, the initial countries sent Factors, or professional trader-agents, to live with native peoples, and manage their trade interests while the fleet returned home. These factors lead dangerous lives, and the success of the next fleets&rsquo; mission usually lay in their hands.   The factors built warehouses, or factories, to house goods collected while fleets were gone, and they were under constant surveillance form the un-trusting locals.  Whether you use brutally repressive means against locals like the Portuguese or Dutch, or more congenial methods like the English you must develop a strategy that lets you maximize your profit while minimizing your losses. Factors of Spice allows player the flavor of the spice race managing fleets, trading with natives, and vying for political influence in these far away tropical islands that changed the course of world history.<br/><br/>Players act as Portugal, Spain, Holland or England.<br/><br/>Each turn is simple:<br/>1. Take 3 cards from Tier I Deck containing simple ships, crews, and characters.<br/>2. Take 2 cards from Tier II containing advanced ships and characters<br/>3.  Buy a Special Card<br/>4.  Increase income<br/>5.  Buy an Influence Card (worth 2-4 VP at games end) but 1 is lost per attack!<br/><br/>3 Years-8 seasons (turns)-and the game is over!<br/><br/>Interesting Mechanics:<br/> Players can have up to 5 distinct fleets on the board and may fission and fusion at will.<br/>1. Players build a hand and &quot;launch&quot; a fleet of as many ships as they have.  Fleets are secret until they land in the East Indies or are moved into by a separate fleet. <br/>2.  Resources &quot;bloom&quot; and then rot a few turns later, creating interesting timing problems. <br/>3. Types of resources: harvest, mine, or delivered-different mechanism for each.<br/>4.  Value increases the longer a good has not been returned to Europe!<br/>5.  Diplomat Characters used in East Indies area control for VP at end of game. Seizing goods erases all diplomatic good will! <br/>6. Interesting and simple interaction with natives<br/>7.  Variable event card played each turn changes weather and conditions in the East Indies.<br/>8.  Special bonus cards that add flavor and strategic options to the game.<br/>9. Simple but interesting combat mechanism between fleets.<br/><br/>",

The game uses a standard deck of 52 cards.<br/><br/>Players are dealt 5 cards each, and players try to get the better hand. A hand is constructed when 3 cards form points that is a multiple of 10. This constitutes an 'Ox'. The remaining 2 cards show how powerful is the 'Ox'. The power is determined as the remainder of the sum of the 2 cards, divided by ten.<br/><br/>When a player is not able to form an 'Ox' with any 3 cards, then he is not eligible to score any points in the round.<br/><br/>",

(Although given the rules, the game is actually more like CANDLEPIN Bowling, a form of bowling prevalent in the North East portion of the country - especially in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and Maine - In Candlepin Bowling the ball is much smaller (ball has no holes and fits in the palm of your hand) and you get 3 tries to knock all the pins down. The pins that are knocked down but remain on the deck stay there during the remainder of the frame. (Those pins are called deadwood and can be used to deflect the ball to help knock down the remaining pins to help you make spares.)<br/><br/>There are ten dice representing the pins, each having a spot on some sides of the dice.  Each player has three shakes. Rolling 10 spots with one roll is a strike. You put aside dice that have spots on them and then re-roll the rest. if you get spots on the rest of the dice you make a spare. You then have a third roll if you make all ten spots with the third roll you score a 10.<br/><br/>",
