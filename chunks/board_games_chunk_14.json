        "description": "Join in the valiant battle to end the ultimate stalemate of good vs. evil and etch the final outcome into history. Regnum Angelica is a two-player strategic card/board game pitting Gabriel and his army of archangels against Beelzebub and the dark forces of the fallen. Wield the three elements of fire, earth and water in angelic combat, use ancient angelic scripts to gain an advantage over your opponent, or deploy pillars to protect your troops in an attempt to infiltrate the enemy's realm.<br/><br/>Regnum Angelica is played with one player having the white deck to represent the archangels of Gabriel, and the other the black deck to represent Beelzebub and his army of fallen angels. Each deck consists of three types of cards: Angels, which are your main combat units; Angelic Scripts, written in the ancient celestial alphabet (Malachim) and granting the angels special abilities to assist them in infiltrating the enemy realm; and Pillars, which call up the elements of earth, fire, or water to protect them from enemy attacks.<br/><br/>Each army has a power meter which is charged when either side's angels visit earth. The power meter must be carefully managed if you hope to crush your opponent as your power meter determines your movement and your ability to execute the Malachim. If too many Angelic scripts are played, then your mobility on the board suffers; if, on the other hand, you use your power for movement, then your ability to harness the powers of the angelic scripts wanes.<br/><br/>Mobility or Angelic Scripts? Have your angels protect your realm, or go on the full offensive to penetrate your enemies kingdom? Execute your scripts now, burn them for precious power, or save them to use with other scripts to pull off powerful combinations? Many of these tactical decisions await you as you control the most powerful beings in the universe of Regnum Angelica!<br/><br/>",

The explored territory was called Neuschwabenland (New Swabia) named after the expedition vessel, Schwabenland.<br/>Unnoticed from the rest of the world a secret base was built: The Base 211 and the Reich began to developed progressive weapon systems.<br/>One day, troops on reconnaissance missions disappeared and there were sightings of strange 2m tall worm-like beasts and house-high creatures. <br/>Due to the potential threat, the high command of Neuschwabenland caused a general mobilization to deal with the menace and to gather more informations about the strange creatures...<br/><br/>Neuschwabenland is a tactical hex and counter combat game for 2 players simulating the hypothetical struggle between forces of the Third Reich and the forces of Alien life forms, in an Arctic setting. The game is also highly suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>The Reich has advanced equipment and special units at disposal, such as the UFO-like flying machine Haunebu.<br/>However, due to the harsh weather conditions they are limited when it comes to unit activation.<br/><br/>Aliens on the other side fight their enemies by sheer force of numbers and can activate all units.<br/>While they lack the firepower of the Reich (with one exception, the Tripod: A monstrous killing machine), they are very dangerous in close combat.<br/><br/>The combat system is inspired by the game Space Crusade.<br/><br/>The game comes with a map (ca. 10 x 18 inch) depicting a part of the Antarctic region, Neuschwabenland, a sheet with 88 (5/8 inch) counters and 6 scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Then players take their turns moving the silver stone in an adjacent not-empty hole and capturing the stones which is contained in that hole. White stones are worth 10 points each. Red, blue, yellow and green stones are worth the square of their number (e.g.: if you capture 3 red stones, you get 9 points; if you capture 5 green stones, you get 25 points, and so on&hellip;).<br/>Play continues until the silver stone is isolated (e.g.: it is surrounded only by empty holes).<br/><br/>In a game with 3 or more players, the final score of every player is given by the sum of the stones he/she captured, PLUS the sum of the stones captured by the following player.

        "description": "The Rhineland Crisis War, 1936-37, designed by Joseph Miranda,is a strategic-level simulation of intermediate complexity that covers an alternative World War II in Europe, one that began in 1936. The assumption is, when Hitler ordered his army to march into the Rhineland, the Allied powers, instead of appeasing him, ordered their armed forces to resist. The ensuing chain of events leads to the war expanding throughout Europe. A war fought at that time would&rsquo;ve found all European militaries woefully unprepared.<br/><br/>Central to the play of the game are its &ldquo;crisis chits.&rdquo; They represent various diplomatic and military events that could bring other powers into the war. Players pick crisis chits depending on the number of crisis hexes (printed on the map) they control. The more such hexes they control, the greater the chances they have of gaining more allies. At the same time, grabbing too much territory can lead to political collapse at home, as domestic foes work to undermine your power before the conflict explodes into a wider war.<br/><br/>Rhineland Crisis War is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries that choose to align with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one month. Units of maneuver are corps and armies.<br/><br/>Special rules cover: crises, political collapse, reinforcements, replacements, terror bombing, railroads, fog of war, airpower, naval and amphibious operations, weather, neutrals, the Soviet Union, armistice and surrender, the Spanish Civil War, expeditionary forces, airborne units, air transport, fifth columns, alpine units, and anti-aircraft units. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. Axis Player Turn<br/> A. Axis Mobilization Phase<br/> B. Axis Terror Bombing Phase<br/> C. Axis Movement Phase<br/> D. Axis Combat Phase<br/> E. Axis Rally Phase<br/> F. Axis Crisis Phase<br/>II. Allied Player Turn<br/> A. Allied Mobilization Phase<br/> B. Allied Terror Bombing Phase<br/> C. Allied Movement Phase<br/> D. Allied Combat Phase<br/> E. Allied Rally Phase.<br/> F. Allied Crisis Phase<br/>III. End of Turn Phase<br/><br/>",

Their mass is much more substantial than any plastic or resin die resulting in a better gaming feel and experience.<br/><br/>IRONDIE is not a difficult game, but the difference between playing and mastering it lies in the player's experience.

However, many dangers await them along their night flight: storms, wind, fog, and other disturbances. To win, they&rsquo;ll need to communicate and cooperate, maintain hope, and stay alive until dawn.<br/><br/>You must cooperate to move the plane on the board, avoiding as many dangerous spaces as possible. Your crew&rsquo;s goal is to fly until dawn, and see the sun rise on a new day. To advance, you must prepare a detailed Flight Plan &ndash; however, the quality of your communications will depend on many cards, as well as on the Hope Gauge that will progressively decrease as your group encounters various disturbances cards. To go forward, you&rsquo;ll need to elaborate your strategy, listen to each other, and trust the Captain of the turn. Each turn has three phases : drawing phase, planning phase and the piloting phase, where you&rsquo;ll move the Plane token.<br/><br/>If you manage to reach a Dawn Hex, then you all win! You&rsquo;ll be able to deliver the mail, and live to see another day. If you run out of Hope however, or if you exhaust your Fuel Stack, then the game is lost: the plane crashed into the deep of the night.<br/><br/>Vol de Nuit / Night Flight offers many components: 6 double-sided combinable terrain boards to play games that differ from each other, 3 Relay Tiles for a special game mode, and more than 150 cards!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Band of Brothers: Old Breed South Pacific is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII. It covers the exploits of the U.S. First Marine Division in the battles for Guadalcanal. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.<br/><br/>Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic. There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression. This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something. You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.<br/><br/>Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops. Their goal is to fire and maneuver. Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close. The system itself forces this realistic play. In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.<br/><br/>Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.<br/><br/>Old Breed South Pacific is a STAND ALONE GAME, but is also part of a growing series of tactical games.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles is the first in the series and follows the U.S. 101st Airborne Division.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is the second in the series and follows the German 11th Panzer Division.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers: Texas Arrows is a dependant expansion that follows the U.S. 36th Infantry Division.<br/><br/>",

The British launched an expedition to avenge that defeat, and that led to another campaign in Central Asia&rsquo;s Great Game. Khyber Rifles is a two-player game of that fateful year in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>One player commands British forces, including the regiments and battalions forming the armies of Gens. Nott, Pollock and Elphinstone. The other player controls various Afghan tribal contingents, led by Akbar Khan. The point-to-point map covers eastern Afghanistan and India&rsquo;s Northwest Frontier area, including the famous Khyber Pass.<br/><br/>Khyber Rifles is part of the Hand of Destiny mini-game series. Each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate movement abilities, combat bonuses and historical events. Accessing the right card at the right time lets the player concentrate forces to win that great victory against all odds&mdash;or perhaps go down to inglorious defeat. Some of the cards include: Ambush, Jirga Loya, Mad Dash and Relief Force.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. There are special rules for: elite British units, fanatic Afghan Ghazis, camp followers, Shah Shujah&rsquo;s army, and irregular units such as Broadfoot&rsquo;s Pioneers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A trick taking card game in which players score for winning aces and 10s in tricks, and for forming certain combinations of cards from tricks won and cards in hand. Point-scoring combinations include four of a kind (aces, kings, queens and jacks only), a marriage (king and queen of same suit), sequence (A-10 of trump) or a Bezique (queen of spades and jack of diamonds). Bezique uses a subset of the standard playing cards, composed of the seven through Ace taken from two decks (i.e. the deck contains no deuces through sixes, with all other cards appearing twice).<br/><br/>A game of Bezique goes through three distinct stages or &quot;phases&quot; of play, and is somewhat reminiscent of cribbage and canasta.<br/><br/>Bezique is the ancestor of Pinochle, and that game's two-handed version is very similar to Bezique but with slightly different deck and slightly different scoring.<br/><br/>(The origin date listed for this game is approximate.)<br/><br/>",

Each suit has one card of each value; a higher card beats a lower card of the same suit &mdash; high (15) to low (0).<br/><br/>Depending on the number of players, a set number of cards from a set number of suits will be shuffled together. Players can decide in advance to play as teams, or each player for themselves. Each player will be dealt 10 cards to create their hand. In a clockwise manner, each player will contribute one card, chosen from their hand, to create a trick.<br/><br/>In each trick, one suit will be stronger than others (trump). Any card in this trump suit beats all cards not in the trump suit. A Sea Change will change the trump suit in the middle of a trick when a player matches the value of the last card played.<br/><br/>Players attempt to win tricks containing cards with positive points, and avoid cards with negative points. *Important* During tricks, 0s are not worth any points. At the end of the round, check which suit is trump. The 0 from that suit, and only that suit, is now worth 5 points. All other 0s are not worth any points.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score at the end of the round will earn 1 Victory Point (VP).  The game ends when one player has earned 3 VPs.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Together they want to convince Nazis to make the world a little better. Each Nazi has an individual IQ. The players have to play cards with arguments (and numbers from 1 to 6), the sum of which corresponds exactly to the IQ of the respective Nazi. It is possible to &quot;argue&quot; alone or together. Some Nazis have a soft spot for certain things (for example, card suits) and bring further specifications into play. In addition, each character has its own rules of play that must be followed. The game is accompanied by an app that provides 18 increasingly difficult levels and also acts as a timer as new Nazis appear at regular intervals. The group loses if it has been surrounded by Nazis. If, on the other hand, all Nazis could be convinced within the time limit, the players win together.<br/><br/>",

Basically a two-player game where one person controls the French and the other, the Germans (a third player can be brought in to control British forces).<br/><br/>The game is open-ended... it continues until one side of the conflict has achieved its victory conditions or a stalemate is reached.  To win as the German player you must capture Paris and cut it off from supply for two complete turns.  The French must capture two German supply centres to win.  Either player may declare a Stalemate if the game lasts longer than 12 turns... a 'marginal' victory may then be calculated based on city control and strength losses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>ボブジテン (Bob Jiten) is a Japanese word game, very dependent on knowing the Japanese language very well.<br/><br/>In Japanese, there are Katakana words. These are very common, used in normal everyday speech, but the words are usually of foreign origin. And to describe a Katakana word, a Japanese person would normally use other Katakana words. The aim of this game is to discover the hidden Katakana word, but without using Katakana words to discuss it. For Japanese speakers, this is quite difficult. As an analogy, try to explain a worker placement game, but without using any game words. As soon as you say 'meeple', or 'VPs', you've lost.<br/><br/>The game uses a system similar to Insider. A player secretly identifies the hidden Katakana word from a deck. This player is the master, and tries to guide the others to identify the word. If a player gets it correct, the master gains 1 point, and the guesser becomes the master. But if the master gets called out for using a Katakana word, the accuser gains a point and becomes the new master.<br/><br/>The artwork for the game is by the publisher and design group Decoct Design.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>Our fellow friend Bob. He loves the Japanese language.<br/><br/>While studying the language, he just realized, that many foreign-origin words were not translated, but accepted as is, as a Katakana word.<br/><br/>Looking up the Japanese dictionary, he found out many of the Katakana words themselves were described using other Katakana words. &quot;Now I have to create my dictionary of Katakana words, which never uses Katakana for a description!&quot;<br/><br/>That was the beginning of the creation of the Bob-Dictionary : Bob Jiten(ボブ ジテン).<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>カタカナ禁止の連想ゲーム<br/><br/>日本語大好きな僕らの友人、ボブ。<br/>彼は日本語を勉強する中で、多くの外来語が日本語には訳されず、カタカナ語として定着していることに気付いた。<br/>日本語辞典で調べても、カタカナ語の説明にカタカナ語が使われている始末。<br/>『だったらカタカナ語を日本語だけで説明する辞典を自分で作ろう！』<br/>そんな考えから、ボブジテン作りは始まった。<br/><br/>",

It narrates the civil wars that tore the late Roman Republic to shreds and paved the way for the establishment of the Principate.<br/><br/>The period covered extends from Caesar&rsquo;s crossing of the Rubicon with soldiers of the XIII Legion (12 January, 49 B.C.) to Octavianus&rsquo; closing of the doors of the Temple of Janus (11 January, 29 B.C.), the act that symbolized the return of peace.<br/><br/>One player defends the interests of Caesar, his allies, his partisans and his successors. The other defends the interests of his adversaries. The roles of the two players may be reversed during the game.<br/><br/>The rules of Alea Iacta Est constitute an evolution for a different epoch of the game system developed for Imperator (VaeVictis #42), Semper Victor (VaeVictis #56) and Ultimus Romanorum (VaeVictis #74). These games, though similar, cannot be played using the rules from another game in the series.<br/><br/>The Game includes:<br/><br/>     an A1 map<br/>     216 die-cut counters<br/>     one rulebook with 7 scenarios (20 pages) - in English OR French<br/><br/><br/>",

The game features various scenarios in which the average infantry squad would become involved.  Typical scenarios simulate meeting engagements, ambushes, raids, snatch missions and assualts on fortified positions.<br/><br/>Sequel to the game Sniper! Popular tactical combat system.<br/><br/>As in Sniper, each player controls the equivalent of a squad of 5 to 15 men depending on the period, the scenario, and whether you attack or defend. One scenario corresponds to a few (one to five) minutes of real time action. The scale is a little larger than in Sniper (5 meters/hex, 5 seconds/turn vs 3 and 3 in Sniper), and there is no facing. The game system (though rated 7.1, ie pretty high, on SPI complexity scale), is quite straightforward and easy to learn. In the beginning of each turn, players secretly &quot;buy&quot; actions for all of their men. A normal man has 10 Movement Points to expend per turn. Fire, direct or opportunity, consumes all MP, as reloading one's weapon, or rearming (ie readying to use it after throwing a grenade or shooting a rifle grenade). Standing up, preparing a grenade, throwing it, cost 5MP. And movement costs MP depending on terrain...<br/>After all actions have been plotted, players check for panic: a certain percentage of all your men, depending on their hex number, have their actions canceled, or move randomly. (although very annoying, this rule does wonders at simulating low level control problems). Then, all remaining actions are performed: combat, movement, and finally grenade and artillery impacts. Rules cover a large variety of equipment: weapons like rifles, MP, MG, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and flamethrowers, but also barbed wire, pillboxes, artillery, mines, and up to one vehicle (APC or tank) per side. Five kind of combat situations are covered: patrol, reconnaissance, ambush, raid and assault. Some lending themselves quite well to solitaire play. A large number of scenarios (from WWI to modern) are provided, and you can easily design your own. A standard scenario plays in a couple of hours. Altogether, I think the system is pretty good for such a man to man combat situation. However, be warned that this very detailed scale has a peculiar feeling, which not all &quot;tactical&quot; game players (ie players used to ASL or Gamers TCS, which focus on company/battalion level units) will like:<br/>in Patrol! the player is a sergeant, not a captain.<br/>review by: Francois Charton<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 5 seconds to 5 minutes<br/>Hex: 5.4 yards / 5 meters<br/>Units: Individual Soldiers &amp; Vehicles<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Six 9 x 9&quot; four color maps<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page Patrol rulebook<br/>Foure Player Aids Cards<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-6 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On March 1, 1815, The exiled Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte landed a small escort on French soil at Cannes, having escaped from the island of Elba. For the next 100 odd days, he would once again terrorize Europe at the command of the feared imperial French legions. Surrounded on all sides by armies of the great European powers, Napoleon's plan was to march north to Brussels, separate the Prussian and Anglo-Allied armies from each other, and defeat each in detail. Destruction of the armies would probably mean peace for France and the saving of the Emperor's Crown. Failure was unthinkable.<br/><br/>HUNDRED DAYS BATTLES is Avalon Hill's strategy game for two or three players which recreates the climax of the Hundred Days Campaign. The division sized units of both sides are represented on the map by leaders who command their corps and army formations. Leaders march, force march, and influence combat according to their individual abilities. Combat is resolved by rolling a die on the Combat Results Table. To win, the French must exit units off the map towards Brussels, or destroy the Allied armies. The Allies win by preventing French victory.<br/><br/>HUNDRED DAYS BATTLES comes complete with a colorful map of the historic battle areas of southern Belgium, 100 playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.<br/><br/>Playing Time: 2 hours<br/><br/>Complexity Rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest); 4<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arvuutin is a new kind of trivia/estimation game from Onni Games!<br/><br/>The main idea is that players answer to each question by playing number cards from their hands. On his turn, a player chooses a question from one of the question categories. After the question has been read out loud, all players choose their answer by playing cards face down on the table. All answers are revealed simultaneously. Each question has an answer between 1-100 and player's answer is the sum of the numbers he played. The player whose answer is closest to the correct answer, wins the question card for himself/herself but loses the number cards he/she played. Players may also play 'pass'-card and skip the question, but get to draw new number cards instead.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players calculate their scores: players get points from won question cards and from hidden score cards that are dealt in the beginning of the game. During the game, players may influence what is the value of each question category at the end of the game - category's value depends on how many questions has been asked from that category. The game comes with eight question categories, from which five are chosen for each game. The player with the most points at the end of the game, is the winner!<br/><br/>Arvuutin offers a fast paced and fun trivia-experience for all people!

Players earn points for each color match that they make, and having a match between each of the four colors earns a bonus of three points.

However, if players can entirely enclose their biergarten within a continuous wall, they earn a six point bonus.<br/><br/>The first player to fifteen points triggers the victory round, with each player thereafter getting one additional turn to top the winning point value.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Unofficial Persona 5 Phan-Game (UP5P) is a short game, taking around 30 minutes to complete. It&rsquo;s pretty small in scale; you can play solo or co-op with a friend, and it&rsquo;s only played using a few decks of cards and some tokens.<br/><br/>You get to choose one Phantom Thief to play as (even Akechi makes the roster), and then in very Persona fashion you have to make some hard choices, because each turn&mdash;represented by a day of the month&mdash;you can only do one thing. Players can go recruit confidants (like Shinya, Miishima and Iwai) to gain perks, go to school to increase social stats, explore locations around them or make a run on the palace, defeating shadows in combat and trying to reach the boss.<br/><br/>This recreates the exact same stresses as Atlus&rsquo; game. How do you best invest the time given to you? If you spend too long getting ready you might not clear the palace in time, but if you rush the palace unprepared you might screw things up.<br/><br/>&mdash;Description from Luke Plunkett, Kotaku<br/><br/>Rules: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-NEmSw3MUyKdrZzekDvAlEKFjnFg3QVi7h1RkTD0RHg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-NEmSw3MUyKdrZzekDvAlEKFjn...</a><br/><br/>Download the Print &amp; Play: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jCD5Qxb9gmIs8nzKJ78qW0N2tzlpKt2Q\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jCD5Qxb9gmIs8nzKJ78qW0N2tz...</a><br/><br/><br/>Find more games by Brother Ming Games here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.brotherminggames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.brotherminggames.com/</a><br/><br/>Twitter: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://twitter.com/BrotherMingMing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://twitter.com/BrotherMingMing</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Command a Greek city's hoplite soldiers. Push and rout enemy lines. Coordinate allied attacks to secure victory, but watch your flanks!<br/><br/>Nika, inspired by ancient Greek geography &amp; warfare, is based around two core mechanisms: facing and formations. Pieces can be routed off the board if attacked from the side or back, but not from the front. A routed piece can rally back onto the board at the cost of an action. Your pieces can move or rotate together in a phalanx if they are adjacent and facing the same way, and you can push back enemies facing you if your phalanx is deeper than theirs.<br/><br/>There are four cities: Athens (white) and Messene (blue) are allied against Sparta (red) and Thebes (black). Allies start across the board from each other, and you win by getting a piece into your victory area in the heart of your ally's territory. Each two-city alliance can be played either solo or with a partner, so the game can support two, three, or four players.<br/><br/>Every player has enemies on both sides, making the distribution of both pieces and actions between fronts a strategic and often tactical consideration. Maneuvering, timing, coordination, and sacrifice are all key elements of strategy.<br/><br/>Says designer Josh Raab, &quot;Nika is the ancient Greek word for 'conquer'. The concept of Nika came to me in a dream while I was studying abroad in Athens. The rules were honed across nearly two years of testing. The board shape and core mechanics were inspired by ancient Greek geography and warfare. Greece has many narrow valleys and mountain passes, and sometimes the only way to defeat an enemy force was to collide with them head-on and literally push them off the field. This othismos ('shoving') is thought to have been the critical phase of most battles between hoplite armies, who were the heavy infantry that dominated ancient Greek war for four centuries.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The only way to remove a block is when it is rolled star side up onto the star space at the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player will move in 2 steps: To begin your turn, tip one of your blocks into any open adjacent space. You may not roll diagonally, and you may not roll into the star space. After tipping, you must hop that same block according to the symbol that lands face-up after the roll. You may only hop onto open spaces.<br/><br/>Each block has six different symbols on each side which signify different movements. The Star: the Star symbol may NOT be rolled face-up anywhere on the board except onto the star space at the opposite side of the board. The Stop:if the stop sign is rolled face-up, the turn is over and the block does not hop to any other spaces. The Cross: when the Cross is rolled face-up, the block hops one space in any vertical or horizontal direction. The X: when the X is rolled face-up, the block hops one space in any diagonal direction. The Slider: when the Slider is rolled face-up, it must slide in any vertical or horizontal direction until it is stopped by another block or the edge of the board. The Hoops: when the Hoops are rolled face-up, the block may hop in any combination of 3 horizontal or vertical steps. The block may even hop back to a space it has previously occupied.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

And, until now, no one has ever tried to make a game to capture the struggle.<br/><br/>Late December, 1944, while the Allies began to pinch off The Bulge, the Soviets&mdash;and their new-found Romanian allies&mdash;began the assault on the &quot;twin cities&quot; of Buda and Pest, where 79,000 surrounded Axis defenders held on against heavy odds, made more difficult by &quot;high command&quot; orders to defend everywhere and not to consider a breakout effort. With German mobile reserves and stockpiled supplies expended by the Wacht am Rhein, a mixed force of Germans and Hungarians held on with little hope of relief. By mid February, after the city fell, less than 1000 Axis troops of all kinds made it back to the dwindling safety of German lines.<br/><br/>Hungarian Nightmare puts you in the difficult command situations for both sides. The Soviets have two full &quot;fronts&quot; worth of troops, plus a corps of their newly gained (and doubtful quality) Romanian troops, while the Axis player commands a hodge-podge of various unit types of widely ranging enthusiasm. German units include remnants of two SS cavalry divisions, panzer kampfgroups, rear-area units, and strays, while Hungarian units are even more diverse, with everything from assault gun companies to police units and WWI veterans, with some troops ready to hold on to the bitter end and others looking for an early opportunity of melting away. The Axis player struggles with dwindling fuel, supplies, and manpower energy, while the Soviet player competes with a difficult time-table and the loss of key units to repel relief efforts. In game terms, the actual historical result would be a &quot;draw,&quot; thus each player has the opportunity and the challenge to &quot;do better.&quot;<br/><br/>Designed by Mark Stille (North Wind Rain, Imperial Sunset, Wintergewitter), Hungarian Nightmare offers 280 counters, an area-movement map of the cities, with each space about one square kilometer, and three-day turns that cover the entire, brutal campaign.<br/><br/>For the first time in gaming, the assault on Budapest is yours to make or to fend off.<br/><br/>",

Each player has an identical set of eight cards, each of them with a special effect.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a round, the common supply on the board becomes more attractive by adding seals (victory points) and wares and by improving the ratio to change wares into seals. All players choose one card from their hand simultaneously and place it face down in front of them (two cards in a two- or three-player game). Then the cards are revealed and the effects become active:<br/><br/><br/>     Knights and Troops take victory points;<br/>     Blacksmith gets wares for each Knight/Troops played by other players;<br/>     Ships and Fleets get wares; Tollkeeper gets seals for ships and fleets;<br/>     Merchant changes wares into seals;<br/>     Monk gets wares for merchants and number of cards already played.<br/><br/><br/>Players with a monk take all cards back to their hand, while others proceed with their remaining cards.<br/><br/>The specific issue is that the more efficient cards become effective only after those which are not that strong. For example, a fleet gets you three wares, but the ship gets you all the remaining ones. If there are ten wares and one opponent played a fleet, you get the seven remaining wares after he has taken three. If three other players play a fleet and take three wares each, you gain only one for your ship. How effective your card is depends on what the other players do &mdash; but you cannot be sure of what they'll do because all decisions are made simultaneously. Perhaps, though, you remember which cards the others have already played...<br/><br/>Visby comes in a basic set for two players and can be enlarged with one or two expansion packs that contain material for two additional players each (to the maximum of six players).<br/><br/>",

Each turn you&rsquo;ll play a card from your hand, score it, then draw a new card to replace it. Every card has a unique scoring condition that will score differently based on the cards you have already played--as well as those your opponent has played. Map out your strategy to maximize your scoring, while also trying to limit your opponent&rsquo;s! At the end of the round, a victory point is awarded to the player with the highest total score, as well as the player with the highest individual card score. Players' hands are carried over between rounds, allowing you to save powerful scoring combinations for just the right moment. After four rounds, whoever has the most victory points wins! Rules are also included for a three-player &quot;Captain&quot; variant, as well as a four-player &quot;Partnerships&quot; game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Will you play prince or brigand?<br/><br/>Brigands is an asymetrical game of deduction and trickery that pits a prince against rival bands of brigands. The prince must protect the coffers of the city against brigands. If no brigand succeeds in stealing 50 Ducats from the kingdom at the end of the 6 game turns, the prince is victorious! Otherwise, the richest bandit wins.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player will send their 3 crew members to the districts of their choice. The choice is secret and simultaneous. When everyone has set their mind, it's time to reveal choices and place every crew member in the city. If a prince's crew is on the same district as a brigand's crew, thieves are arrested before they could hope to get richer. Otherwise, they will be able to plunder the district. Each district allows looting the treasure in a unique way. Be careful, if someone has played an action token on the district in the beginning of their turn, they will be able to steal or push other player's crew, or maybe to run to another district at the last minute. Once in jail, thieves can choose to await trial or attempt to escape.<br/><br/>The prince player will improve their skills during the game to better recover their treasure or better trap brigands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the dice cards, then deal two to each player. On a turn, a player plays one die card (which shows values from 1 to 6), then either starts a new row of cards or adds to an existing row.<br/><br/><br/>    To start a new row, take the card showing this number from the display and place it in front of you; when starting a row, you can choose to play both die cards instead of only one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    To add to a row, add the die value played to the number on the top card of one of your rows, then take this card from the display.<br/><br/><br/>If another player has used a desired card in one of her rows, steal it from her row and use it for yourself. You can have at most three rows in progress. At the end of your turn draw back up to two die cards.<br/><br/>When you play a die card to place the 40 card on a row, you then score the row, earning one point for each card in the row plus one point for each star on cards in that row. Record this score on paper, then return these cards to the display.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player scores 30, 35, or 40 points, with this total being dependent on the number of players: 2, 3, or 4.<br/><br/>",

Then, in each round of play, every player plays and receives four cards like Gun, Armor, Money, Crime, and Intel. Some are played face-up and some face-down, according to three simple rules. Then, all cards are revealed and everyone learns who was shot, who was wounded, who banked money, and who learned what. Finally, players can spend money to treat wounds or learn even more about the other players' roles before the next round begins.

Now the addlebrained, musty fellows are roaming throughout the catacombs, and they turn out to be surprisingly affectionate. With a little skill and a fragrant whiff of tactics in this trick-taking game, you can completely avoid taking too many of these scatterbrained guys home in your luggage.<br/><br/>In Sarkophag, each player has ten cards in hand. Each round, each player plays exactly one card. The second card played determines whether subsequent cards in the round must be higher or lower than what was led. Whoever plays the highest/lowest card (depending on what that second card determined) takes the &quot;trick&quot;, collecting all the cards played. If, however, a player cannot follow the rule &mdash; for example, having only higher cards in hand when supposed to play a lower card &mdash; they take the trick.<br/><br/>Whoever takes the trick is cursed with a few mummy heads; however, they also start the next round. The game ends as soon as all ten tricks have been played. Now each player counts the little mummy heads on their cards, and the player with the fewest mummy heads wins.<br/><br/>",

One player is Mission Control, feeding instructions to the rest of the players who act as a single team controlling the Cadet meeple on the Board.

Each round a card will tell Mission control how many of these cards to give to the Cadet, but they are randomized before they are turned over. Work co-operatively, but without speaking, to figure out the solution within the allotted number of rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lincoln&rsquo;s War reflects the fickle nature of politics and its influence on military policy-making during the American Civil War. Here, the battlefield is an extension of the political arena. Many historical movers and shakers support or oppose their presidents&rsquo; war plans. Will Mr. Lincoln save the Union? Will Mr. Davis succeed in sundering one nation and creating another? How will you direct their political support?<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War is a card-driven game using cards to activate generals, but in Lincoln&rsquo;s War, activation numbers are also political currency or PC. PC not only activates generals but promotes worthy commanders, purchases war material, forces indecisive commanders to act, and represents support for the war. A decisive PC point spread is an advantage in winning the game but driving an opponent to 0 PC (and 0 Congressional support) at the end of a turn will ensure victory, even in the face of defeat.<br/><br/>Unique features include a diceless combat system, seditious characters, and immobilization tokens. The combat system requires players to husband resources and congressional political support to ensure victory. Seditious characters oppose their respective Presidents&rsquo; handling of the war and sooner or later will erode a president&rsquo;s vital political support. Immobilization tokens reflect damage in the form of casualties, as well as hesitation, confusion and even insubordination.<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War contains:<br/>    1 22&quot; x 34&quot; map<br/>    1 color rulebook<br/>    1 color play and background booklet<br/>    162 Operations Cards<br/>    2 countersheets<br/>    2 player aid cards<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War was designed by John Poniske with the assistance of Mike Joslyn, and features the artwork of Niko Eskubi and map artwork by Mark Mahaffey.<br/><br/>(source: MMP website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hurry! Hurry! Repair the words! Broken words are brought to the factory every day. Can you combine these letters and repair those words?<br/><br/>大怪獣コトバモドス (Dai Kaiju Kotobamodos) in English means &quot;The Great Monster Kotobamodos&quot;, with the name &quot;Kotobamados&quot; coming from 言葉 (kotoba) &quot;words&quot; and 戻す (modosu) &quot;revert/undo&quot;, so the names means something like &quot;return the words to their original state&quot;, which is a monstrous task.<br/><br/>This is a word game in which the master creates three words of three letters each behind a screen, then scrambles the letters face down and passes them to the other players. All players race to combine these letters to create the three words, and once someone does, they start a one-minute countdown timer. The first player to create three words scores 3 points, while anyone else who does so with the time limit scores 1 point. For each word that matches the master's word, a player scores 1 point.<br/><br/>In English, the task of creating words would be relatively simple, but in Japanese, this is a much harder prospect. Japanese uses three writing systems, with Hiragana being the most broad. Hiragana has a lot more letters than the English alphabet, and fewer restrictions in combinations, so three characters can be used in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>In addition, there is a further element in Hiragana: 濁点 (dakuten), which is a voiced sound mark similar to accents or umlauts. For example, た (ta) combined with a Dakuten would be だ (da), or す (su) and a Dakuten would be ず (zu). In this game, the letter tile for た may be used for either た or だ. From around fifty Hiragana letters, twenty of them can be combined with Dakuten. If the tiles offered to solve have several of these twenty Hiragana characters, it becomes very hard to deduce what the secret words actually are. Whilst the game could be played using English lettering, it would lose a lot of the complexity.<br/><br/>In 2017, a new English/Japanese edition of this game was produced with the new name ぽんこつファクトリー (Ponkotsu Factory). &quot;Ponkotsu&quot; means something like silly or clumsy. This edition was co-produced with itten, with new artwork by Yoshiaki Tomioka. In this edition of the game, changes were made to allow for the differences between English and Japanese writing. When playing in English, the master constructs three four-letter words using twelve letter tiles, then mixes them thoroughly. The change to longer words should approximate the challenge of playing in Japanese with only three characters.<br/><br/>早く！　早く！　言葉を修理しなきゃ！<br/>今日もバラバラになった言葉が修理工場へ持ち込まれます。あなたはうまく文字を組み合わせ、言葉を修理することができるでしょうか。<br/>このゲームは、問題作成と問題回答の二段階で行われます。問題作成では4文字の言葉を3個作り、それを元の言葉がわからないようにバラバラの12枚の文字タイルにします。問題回答では、他の人から受け取った12枚の文字タイルを使って、4文字の言葉を3個作ります。作成のスピードと質が勝負を分けるでしょう。&quot;<br/><br/>ばらばらになった３つの言葉を、それぞれの文字を組み合わせいち早く元に戻すゲームです。<br/><br/>・問題作成<br/>ついたての裏で３文字の言葉を３つ作り、それを元の言葉がわからないようにバラバラにして混ぜます。他の人に渡します。<br/>・問題回答<br/>渡された９文字をうまく組み合わせて、誰よりも早く3文字の言葉を３つ作ります。<br/>誰かが言葉を完成させたら、残り時間は１分です。<br/>・点数獲得、答え合わせ<br/>いち早く３つの言葉を作れた人は３点を得ます。制限時間内に３つの言葉を作れた人も１点を得ます。問題出題者の解答と一致している言葉１つにつき１点を得ます。<br/><br/>",

In the Build phase, you take turns spending those resources to buy weapon, defense, and special development cards that enhance your compound. When threats attack, you roll dice and use abilities from cards you purchased to survive. You'll fight a Level 1 threat, followed by a Level 2 threat, then finally face down the Raider Boss.<br/><br/>After the final attack, the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins.

Each player controls two prisoners as they make their way through the winding labyrinth of a space prison, trying to collect enough oxygen to survive while denying their opponents the same. The goal is to collect as many points as possible (represented by oxygen tiles of different colors and values), located inside a maze formed by hexagonal tiles. Players must move across the maze and collect the points before their opponents.<br/><br/>The game has two phases: construction and competition. In the construction phase, players take turns placing tiles and creating the the board (maze). Then the competition phase begins, where players move around the maze attempting to collect more points (oxygen) than their opponents. Where players place their tiles is of utmost strategic importance in the construction phase: Sector 6&acute;s building system allows strategic planning while the maze is being created. In the absence of a predefined configuration, each game takes place on an entirely new board. There are essentially an infinite amount of setup configurations which allows for high replay value.<br/><br/>But building a good maze and moving quickly will not be enough to achieve victory. During the game, Sector 6's maze will be in constant motion, as players can rotate the tiles, thereby changing the layout of the maze, potentially allowing players to block their opponents or create new pathways to reach the points faster. So it won't be the fastest player who wins, but the one who learns how to best use the intricacies of the maze to their own advantage and to the detriment of their opponents!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems facing wargamers is finding the time to actually play. Most commercially available sets of rules require several hours to set up and play to a conclusion; some can easily swallow up a whole day or weekend. For many gamers this means that their lavishly prepared miniature armies rarely get used at all. Apart from time, the other consideration is space, which further constrains the opportunities for a game. In One-hour Wargames, veteran gamer and rule-writer Neil Thomas has addressed both these problems. Now it is practical to play a game in around an hour on a normal dining table or living room floor. The book contains 8 (all-new) sets of very simple rules for various periods, from Ancient to WW2 and 30 scenarios which can be played using any of them, so you don't even have to take too much time thinking up a stimulating tactical situation and objectives. All the rules and scenarios are intended to be played on a 3ft x 3ft battlefield. The rules only require a small number of miniatures, so this really is an ideal way for new gamers, or veterans trying a new period, to get started with minimal investment of time and money. Also ideal for a quick game in the evening when a friend pops round. There are also sections on campaigns and solo games.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the active player takes the free labyrinth tile and pushes it along one of the rows or columns marked with an arrow on the game board. This action inserts that tile into the labyrinth and pushes the other tiles one space, popping one tile out of the labyrinth to be used by the next player on her turn. By shifting the walls, the player hopes to be able to move his token along the paths to land on the treasure currently being sought. If the player does this, he claims the treasure card and a new card is revealed; if not, play continues until someone grabs that treasure.<br/><br/>Once all the treasure has been collected, the game ends and whoever nabbed the most treasure wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Six empires have risen from the ashes of the Galactic Realm. Still cemented by the alliance that enabled their unprecedented conquest of the galaxy, the six independent kingdoms now seek to consolidate their power, each hoping to carve out the strongest dominion in the cosmos. Conflicts among the young realms are inevitable, but will the galaxy return to a state of civil war?<br/><br/>Core Worlds: Empires is a worker placement game for 1 - 5 players that includes rules for Solo Play. Each player represents one of the empires that overthrew the ancient Galactic Realm during the original Core Worlds card game. Core Worlds: Empires is a thematic sequel to the original game and its expansions, but players don&rsquo;t need to own the original game to enjoy this one.<br/><br/>Each world in the galaxy occupies a board space that an empire&rsquo;s ambassadors can visit during the game. The worlds that appear during each game are variable. Each player starts with a certain number of Imperial Worlds under his or her control, including one of the coveted Core Worlds that lie near the center of the galaxy. Neutral Worlds that have recently recovered from the civil war enter the game as play proceeds, and players may visit these worlds or attempt to annex them to their empires.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stress Botics is a sci-fi adventure in which four easily-stressable robots (known as Beta Bots) are sent to an exoplanet by their corporation Cubebotics CORP&reg;, in order to mine its resources. Once those resources are extracted, the Beta Bots' task is to deliver them to the corporation's ships.<br/><br/>It won't be a piece of cake. To start with, the exoplanet is unstable, so the Beta Bots will have to adapt to a constantly changing environment.  On top of that, each corporation ship requires different resources, and each payload delivery requires perfect timing &amp; alignment with the orbiting trajectory of the matching ship. And last, but not least, the rival corporation Cylindroids INC&reg; has sent its own bots to snatch resources and interfere with your bots.<br/><br/>But do not fret! Beta Bots can count on Alpha Bot&rsquo;s help, a support robot with a (very) short-tempered AI. Alpha Bot will unlock new places to mine, give the Beta Bots more actions and generally make their life easier...but keep an eye on those pesky Cylindroid bots, since they won't pass up the opportunity to damage your guardian!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Mechanical overview:<br/><br/>The game is organized in rounds. In each round, an event takes place (which might involve trouble for the Beta Bots!) and the players will program actions to interact with the planet's resource-laden chambers, with enemies, with Alpha Bot, or with each other. Actions are chosen in secret and players commit to them before any are revealed. The stress level of each bot determines the turn order as well as its possible resource deliveries. Then players take turns to reveal their programmed actions, and execute them.<br/><br/>Each player has their own robot's blueprint, where they store resources using multiple containers of limited size. Those resources can be delivered to the passing ships, or they can be transformed or spent to enhance the robot's capabilities.<br/><br/>During the adventure, the autonomous Alpha Bot will advance through the planet's chambers until it reaches the surface. Players can interact with Alpha Bot to obtain advantages or to steer it out of harm's way, since it is vulnerable to enemy attacks and the planet's adversities.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, there's a maintenance step that includes the activation of enemy robots (Cylindroids). They can move, attack, or occupy resource chambers. Additionally, players will receive benefits or penalties (stress) according to their distance to Alpha Bot.<br/><br/>The game ends when Alpha Bot reaches the last chamber. The players tally the victory points, which can be earned in different ways: Through successful resource deliveries, by upgrades on their robot, by fulfilling other objectives, etc. Then, each player's victory points is reduced by the amount of stress they incurred during gameplay, and the player with most remaining points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Supply Lines of the American Revolution: The Northern Theater, 1775-1777 was a surprise hit for publisher Hollandspiele and designer Tom Russell. Popular with grognards and logistics nerds alike, it secured a nomination for the 2017 Golden Geek Award for Best Wargame. This hotly anticipated standalone sequel covers the second half of the American War of Independence, and shifts the scene to the Southern colonies of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas.<br/><br/>It's more than just a change in locale, however; this game has a very different feel and emphasis than its predecessor. Both sides have much smaller armies with far fewer resources. The South, after all, is really a very minor theater: the British are chiefly concerned with holding onto their Caribbean possessions, particularly with the French, Dutch, and Spanish circling around those profitable islands, while George Washington is obsessed with taking back New York. Unsupported, Cornwallis must attempt to pacify the southern colonies one at a time while coming to grips with the slippery colonials, while avoiding being trapped himself. Maneuver is central this time around, thanks to new and utterly unforgiving siege rules.<br/><br/>And while this operational cat-and-mouse chase dances across the colonies, partisan warfare rages as both sides seek to win hearts and minds. Crown Loyalists can greatly extend Cornwallis's supply lines, while daring Patriot Militia can harass the redcoats with Raids.<br/><br/>To win this game and the war itself, you'll need to master irregular warfare, operational maneuver, siegecraft, naval affairs, and, of course, and perhaps above all, logistics.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Waterloo was the final and most decisive land battle of the Napoleonic Wards, and possibly the most famous battle of all time. Napoleonic warfare was complex in its variety, and victory or defeat depended on the successful application of such diverse factors as organization and command control, leadership and training, formation and position, firepower, combined arms tactics, luck, and, especially, morale. These aspects of the Battle of Waterloo are accurately modeled in this game. Can you, as the Iron Duke of Wellington, hold the French at bay until night or the Prussians arrive? Can you, as Blucher, old &quot;Vorwarts,&quot; drive forward in time to save the day?<br/><br/>Every unit that participated in the historical battle is represented--British, Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian, Nassau, Brunswick, King's German Legion, French, and Prussian infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The rules cover all the key factors in the battle, line, column, square, and ordere-mixte formations, skirmishers, routing and rallying, leader effects and casualties, cavalry reaction and recall, artillery capture and recapture, hidden units, fatigue, the elan and mobility of the French infantry columns, and the firepower and staying power of the &quot;thin red line&quot; of British infantry.<br/><br/>Scale: 300 yards per hex; 30 minutes per turn; brigade and division-sized combat units.<br/><br/>",

What does &quot;frigiti&quot; mean? That's up to you to decide!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives a sheet of paper on which she will write definitions of created words and vote on which definitions among all the players she thinks are best.<br/><br/>In a round, the active player rolls all ten dice &ndash; seven of which have consonants on all sides, and three of which have only vowels &ndash; then creates a word by using at least three dice. (This word cannot be real, and if anyone claims it is, reroll the dice and try again.) Each player writes a definition for this new word, then places her sheet of paper in the center of the table. The active player shuffles these papers, then hands one to each person; the active player then reads off the definition, followed by the other players in clockwise order. A player might end up reading her own definition.<br/><br/>As a reminder of the definitions, each player then gives a short keyword or key phrase for the definition she read. Players will then each distribute three tokens to the answers they thought best, with one of those tokens going to the player's own answer. (This self-congratulatory vote aids in the scorekeeping process.)<br/><br/>After each person has been the active player once, the game ends and the player with the most tokens is crowned Queen Frigiti!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The APBA Golf Game was origionally published by APBA in 1962.   It contained 18 Greatest Holes and came with 32 well known golfers.   The 18 Greatest Holes publsihed in the 1962 edition contain 4 different holes than later versions of the 18 Greatest Holes.<br/><br/>As the Golfer card sets ran out of production APBA publshed new sets to replace the out of production sets.   This led to the creation of a:<br/><br/>1962/64 set, 1972, 1976, 1978, 1981, 1985 and an All Time Greats Set.   Sports Game Publishing and the APBA Journal also published a number of golf sets in later years as well.<br/><br/>8 Courses were published by APBA officially (Two Versions of the 18 Greatest Holes).   The now defunct Sports Game Publishing company also published at least 3 more courses for the game adding: Sawgrass, Winged Foot, St. Andrews and Oakmont to the list.  The format for these course were 3 to a page on 11 x 17 paper and then changed to 8 1/2 x 11 with one course per page.<br/><br/>ASG Golf (George Gerney | <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.asggames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.asggames.com</a>) has gone on to publish courses for: Bethpage Black, Pinehurst No 2., Augusta National, Pebble Beach, TPC Scottsdale, St. Andrews, TPC Sawgrass and Bay Hill.<br/><br/>From the APBA Journal: An Eighth APBA Golf Course (For Holes 3,4,5,6 of the greatest hits)<br/><br/>&quot;While preparing the Golf Archives Reference Pack (now available from the AJ office). I encountered a letter to the editor in the August 15, 1971, issue of APBA Innings. (Back in those practically prehistoric days, the AJ covered only baseball, leaving APBA's other sports to its competition, AI.)<br/><br/>The letter, by Doug Bauer, notes that the original APBA golf course, the 18 Greatest Holes compilation, had changed between the game's original appearance in the mid-1960's and 1971.<br/><br/>In the original course, holes 3,4,5 and 6 all came from courses in Southem California. Number three was the fourth hole at Riviera Country Club, Los Angeles. a par three. Number four was the eighth hole from Lakeside Golf Course in Hollywood, a par four. APBA's fifth hole was the third at Vaney Club in Santa Barbara, a par four. And number six was the 14th at Los Angeles' Bel Air Country Club, a par five.<br/><br/>In the later version, number three is the 13th hole at Congressional Country Club in Washington, D.C., a par four. APBA's fourth hole is the 14th at Brookline (Mass.) Country Club, a par five. Number five is the eighth hole at Westchester Country Club, Harrison, N. Y., a par four. And number six is the third hole at Akron's Firestone Country Club, also a par four.<br/><br/>As a consequence of these changes, par is 71 in the later course but just 70 in the original version.<br/><br/>So it turns out that there are, In effect, eight APBA golf courses rather than the seven we knew about:Augusta (1964), Merion (1975), Pebble Beach (1976), Firestone (1976), Pinehurst (1977), Pine Valley (1977) and two versions of the 18 Great Holes (1964 and c.1970).&quot;<br/><br/>Sports Game Publishing was a company that published expansions for APBA products, they maintained a web presense from 2002 thru 2006.  During that time they produced a number of products for APBA Golf.<br/><br/>The main product that they published was Doctor Clines Advanced Rules for APBA Golf<br/><br/>St. Vincent College (Latrobe, PA) Golf Coach Dr. Thomas Cline's APBA golf innovations and upgrades have been published many times in the APBA Journal, and gamers have acknowledged the accuracy and realism his work has added. Recently Dr. Cline started from scratch and carefully dissected the game with a mathematical precision not possible when the game was developed. The result is a game completely compatible with the golf courses and cards you currently own, while allowing you to play a modern golf bag and manage holes the way today&rsquo;s pros do.<br/><br/>Golfers will drive the ball, hit fairways, and putt the way they do in real life. You can finally choose from the clubs the players really carry; no more 2-wood that today&rsquo;s players never use. Instead, choose a 4-wood, 5-wood, and/or 1-iron&mdash;just like the pros of today! If you have always wanted wind, course conditions, lie conditions, and each golfer&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;work the ball&rdquo; to have the same influence on your course that they have in the real game, now they can!<br/><br/>Dr. Cline&rsquo;s new Master Game elements are individually implemented, so you can add some of them, all of them, or none at all, and still achieve a level of golf accuracy never before possible. Combined with charts that finally are capable of reproducing the abilities of golfers of the 21st century, this fantastic new game will allow you to use the golf courses and golf cards you already own with accurate results, while integrating future cards and courses as well.<br/><br/>The new &ldquo;boards&rdquo; are actually a spiral-bound, 8&frac12; x 11-inch booklet, printed on card stock for durability, that contains complete playing instructions and play charts for both the Basic and Master games. The game box also includes all the components you need to play: dice, shaker, ball markers, and score sheets designed for use with both the Basic and Master games, along with nine sample golfers and a sample golf hole.<br/><br/>APBA has announced that they plan on re-publishing APBA Golf in 2010.<br/><br/>",

You grab your pencil and you are about to make history while designing the craziest, most difficult obstacle course the world has ever seen. &ldquo;Guys, guys, look at this!

First players draw the terrain and obstacles from custom dice results - deciding which to use. Then each player tries to put the ball into the hole in as few shots as possible. The catch is that the stronger the shot, the bigger the risk of it going horribly wrong.<br/><br/>",

Two sheets of sturdy die-cut counters (560 total, in multiple colors) provide pieces for numerous minor powers, the major navies, additional land and air combatants for the major powers and markers for use in the Campaign scenarios.<br/><br/>The new Scenario Book incorporates Series errata.

Players trade in goods, seeking to keep the best-valued goods for themselves while ruining the values of those held by other players.<br/><br/>To start the game, shuffle the 36 tokens &mdash; which depict six types of goods &mdash; then place them in nine stacks, with the stacks in a circle. On a turn, the active player moves a pawn 1-3 stacks, then takes the top token from the two stacks adjacent to this pawn. He keeps one token for his own holdings and sells the other, lowering the value of that good by one. (Wheat starts with a value of 7, and the other goods start at 6.) When only two stacks remain, the game ends and players tally the value of their holdings to see who best judged (and manipulated) the market.<br/><br/>In the expert version of the game, the active player can move any number of spaces clockwise around the stacks, but must stop if he reaches a stack topped with the same type of good as that of the stack from which he started his movement.<br/><br/>",

The Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter, and the Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-player competitive play or solitaire play, and each set can be played by itself standalone, or combined with other sets to form a larger narrative. Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six Factions.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play For What Remains: skirmishes and campaigns. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Campaigns are a series of skirmishes linked together to form a larger narrative. For What Remains is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually secondary. Players win skirmishes by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.<br/><br/>The game board is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. The default game board is a destroyed urban setting. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement.<br/><br/>Each character is represented by a counter and has a corresponding character card and tokens. During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite level. A chit pull system is used for unit activation, and a step-loss system is used for tracking injuries during skirmishes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Basically, occupied edge spaces score points, and you lose points for each separate group you have at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game appears to have a strategic depth similar in style to Go (trying to give groups bases along the edges while also trying to connect groups together in the center; whole-board strategy directing the tactics of each local fight), yet with the tactical elegance and simplicity of Hex.  It also retains the mathematical elegance of Hex, which has nice implications such as the impossibility of draws, and the existence of seemingly very different scoring rules which are provably equivalent.  Worth a look for fans of Hex and/or Go.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>At the turn of the last century, South America seemed poised to make the same economic leap as the northern half of the hemisphere. Fueled by booming exports of grain, cattle, coffee and rubber, Brazil and Argentina saw their economies grow rapidly and at one time both stood among the world's ten wealthiest nations.  All that cash led their leaders to seek the prestige symbols of the day: dreadnought battleships. Argentina, Brazil and Chile all built dreadnoughts just like the Great Powers, but none of them ever fired a shot at a foreign enemy.<br/><br/>Cone of Fire is a boxed game for both the Second World War at Sea and Great War at Sea series. The fleets of Argentina, Brazil and Chile plus those of Peru and Uruguay are added to both series, along with ships from Germany, France and Britain. Most of the scenarios, or game situations, are based on hypothetical situations arising from the actual war scares between the South American nations and sometimes European interlopers, and the war plans with which they addressed them.  There are also scenarios based on the actual conflicts which took place in South American waters: the hunt for Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee's German cruiser squadron in 1914, and the hunt for the cruiser that bore his name 25 years later.<br/><br/>Alongside the ships actually operated by the South American naval powers, there are also ships they ordered and did not receive, or contemplated but did not order. The Brazilians have several projected classes of battleships that they never completed, as well as the modern warships they sought from the U.S. Navy during World War II. Argentina and Chile have their projected battleships, carriers and cruisers as well. And there are the actual jet aircraft flown by Argentina and Brazil.<br/><br/>There are six maps, three at Second World War at Sea scale, and three at Great War at Sea scale. These cover the region from south of Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the Americas, to well north of Rio de Janeiro. There are huge stretches of ocean as well as the narrow, winding channels of the Chilean coast.<br/><br/>",

Brave knights and heroic beings wage war against sinister demons and monstrous abominations.<br/><br/>Warlord is a complete game system that uses the Reaper Adventure Game Engine (R.A.G.E.) for faster and more enjoyable play. Each model in the game has a set of numbers and abilities that dictate how well it performs in the game. These numbers and abilities are listed on a Data Card, an easy to read record sheet about the size of a standard poker card and freely downloadable here at reapergames.com. A key component of the R.A.G.E. system is the Damage Track. Each row of stats on the Data Card represents a Damage Track which is the total points of damage that the model can sustain before being destroyed and removed from play. As a model takes damage, its stats change to reflect its changing performance on the field of battle!<br/><br/>Tabletop Miniatures Games:<br/>Reaper's tabletop miniature games are played with plastic and/or metal 28mm miniatures on a large flat surface - typically a 4' x 4' square table. Each player will need to build an army using the various 28mm plastic and/or metal miniatures that Reaper produces in its various product lines.<br/><br/>Reaper produces an official line of Warlord miniatures for use with the game. However, you may use any Reaper miniature to represent the models in your army.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAbout the World of WarlordWarlord takes place in the war-torn land of Taltos in the world of Adon. The region is a place of dry, blistering summers and mild winters. Various leaders and their forces battle for the control of their own destinies. The battle for the power to become Warlords and become legends by their own hands - some are just and fair and others are cruel and capricious. Life in Taltos is brutal but there is a fortune to be made and eternal fame to be won.<br/><br/>When playing Warlord, you choose a faction from the 10 different factions of Taltos.<br/><br/>",

A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.<br/><br/>A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.<br/><br/>The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.<br/><br/>The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.<br/><br/>A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.<br/>Counters = 200<br/><br/>Other credits:<br/><br/>Graphic Design: Redmond A.

Whoever first notices which icon is repeated the most times on these revealed cards needs to name this item out loud; if they're correct, that player collects all of the cards played by the players.

When one of those cards is revealed, everybody needs to put their hand on top of the shield. The last one to do so must pay all of the cards they have collected so far that include the symbols indicated in the dragon's card. However, that player can avoid making this payment by producing a chicken card since dragons love chicken and are happy to forfeit all treasure as long as they can get a tasty meal.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, whoever has the most treasure cards in their stash wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Everybody plays simultaneously in the rapid reaction game Nimble. Rush through the six classics of world literature. Alice, Moby-Dick and Co. were seldom as exciting!<br/><br/>Nimble is a fast color-recognition reaction game which is played simultaneously. Each player has a deck of 30 cards and the first one to get rid of them all, wins the game.<br/><br/>There are six colors in the game. Each card displays two of those colors: a colored frame surrounding a differently-colored circle in the center of the card. As part of the setup three cards are placed in the middle of the table face-up. If the frame color of your card matches the circle color of one of the cards in the middle of the table, you can place your card on top of it. Sounds easy, right? Wait until you try out yourself!<br/><br/>The colors used in Nimble were selected in a way that the vast majority of the people with color vision deficiencies can distinguish the colors. If you are affected by any type of color vision deficiency, you can easily check if the colors work for you by looking at the six differently colored tiles on the box making up the title of the game.<br/><br/>Each color represents a piece of classical world literature: Around the World in Eighty Days, Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Don Quixote, War of the Worlds and Moby-Dick. The artwork on the cards is rich and detailed without it being distracting during the fast gameplay. So, it really pays off to take a break between the matches and marvel at the art.<br/><br/>",

Living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering, when few who remain will battle to the last. In the end there can be only one.<br/><br/>Welcome to the incredible world of the immortals, the world of Highlander!  Based on the immensely popular motion pictures and television series, of the same name, Highlander:   The Card Game 2nd edition  is a collectible trading card game of swashbuckling swordplay and dark intrigue.<br/><br/>The first Highlander movie was released in 1986, and became a cult classic.  The movie starred Christopher Lambert as the hero, Connor MacLeod; Sean Connery played his friend and mentor Ramirez; and Clancy Brown assumed the role of The Kurgan, Connor's most deadly enemy.  Three sequels were produced, and a television series starring Adrian Paul as Connor's dashing cousin, Duncan MacLeod.<br/><br/>In Highlander: The Card Game 2nd edition, players assume the roles of Immortals like Connor, Ramirez, The Kurgan, and Duncan. These Immortals are mysterious wanderers who can only die if their heads are severed from their bodies. Immortals spend eternity honing their sword-fighting skills, trying to reach the time of The Gathering, when they will battle to the last. To the victor goes The Prize, an enigmatic goal of legendary proportions that no one really understands. It is simply known among them that he who wields its power will command the destiny of the entire world. Quite a prize indeed.<br/><br/>To attain this goal some Immortals will stop at nothing, while others follow a stricter code of honor and decency in their quest. In the end, for better or worse...<br/><br/>There can be only one.<br/><br/>Highlander: The Card Game is designed to simulate a duel between two Immortals: yourself and your opponent. During the course of play, both players will play attacks and defenses as if they were fighting with swords. Other cards will represent the tricks, tactics, schemes, and plots you utilize to win.<br/><br/>",

The Hungarians numbered around 35,000 (including artillerist), the Ottomans, about 60,000. While there is much disagreement about numbers at this battle, all sources agree that the Ottomans did outnumber the Hungarians significantly. The Hungarian front line was stretched rather thinly to match, or attempt to match, the frontage that would be presented by the Ottomans. The Hungarians had, as was the practice for the last 200 years in European warfare, dug a trench in front of their front line infantry and artillery to give them a defense advantage. The actual battle, which started at around 3:00 PM, lasted but a few hours, maybe less.<br/><br/>Each combat unit represents about 750 men. The map scale is about 225 yards per hex and depicts the flat and, because of the proximity of the oft-overflowing Danube, somewhat soft and, in many places, slippery battlefield at Mohacs.<br/><br/>Suleiman the Magnificent is an accessible, fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. Optional rules include the politically charged issue that has reverberated down over the centuries, that many of the contingents of allies called in by Hungarian King Lajos did not arrive in time for the battle. Some were never going to do so; some were held back - specifically the charge leveled at Johann Szapolyai, Voivode of Transylvania because of his ambitions for the Hungarian throne (which he did get after Lajos' death and some deals reached with Suleiman).<br/><br/>Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map <br/>240 full color die cut counters <br/>Rulebook length - 12 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages <br/>Complexity - Low <br/>Solitaire suitability - Medium <br/>Playing time - 2 hours<br/><br/>Design - Richard Berg<br/>Development - Paul Rohrbaugh <br/>Graphic Design - Craig Grando<br/><br/>",

A Shot on Goal: Defender holds 6 Chance cards in front of him (so he can see the cards), then the attacker will take the card one by one, up to the Shot's Strength.

The focus is on the southern part of the South American continent: Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, from the Wars of Independence starting in 1810 through the last naval war fought completely under sail between Argentina and Uruguay in 1841. These wars attracted naval officers recently unemployed&nbsp;by the end of the Napoleonic Wars as well as providing a proving ground for the first generation of naval heroes native to&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;America.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Updated rules introduce river and tidal currents, modified grounding rules for operations in the Rio de la Plata and Uruguay rivers, and the use of ship&rsquo;s boats to tow stranded or becalmed ships.&nbsp;In all, over&nbsp;two dozen&nbsp;battle scenarios ranging in size from a handful of ships per side, to full-blown fleet actions are presented. Also included is the return of the popular ship duel map and activation cards&nbsp;originally found in&nbsp;Serpents of the Seas&nbsp;(Flying Colors volume II),&nbsp;along&nbsp;with 18 ship duel scenarios.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Like the preceding volumes in the series,&nbsp;Under the Southern Cross&nbsp;is completely&nbsp;independent of, while being fully compatible with, the other volumes in the series. Everything needed to play is included!&nbsp;<br/><br/>Can you, as the Spanish, strangle the rebel American governments and preserve the centuries old Spanish Empire, or will you help the Patriot forces throw off the Imperialist yoke of the European monarchies?

Will you play the stalwart Stormcast Eternals, clad in gleaming golden armour and armed with powerful weapons, or the vengeful spirits of the Chainrasps intend on dooming Glymmsforge forever?<br/><br/>In each game the Chainrasp player creates the labyrinth, while the Stormcast Eternals players searches its twisting passages for the Hyshian Luminator, the ancient relic that will save Glymmsforge. The board is made up of hexagon tiles, and as the Stormcast Eternals player searches further, the labyrinth will reveal infernal traps and can divide into sections leading some Stormcast Eternals to become lost in the dungeon depths.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll resolve your actions using a set of special dice, and mark status effects with tokens. Each faction also utilizes a deck of cards with powerful effects. Banish your enemies with the holy energy of Sigmar, or inflict them with supernatural terror. Every roll of the dice could swing the outcome in your favour, or doom you to ignoble defeat. To win, the Stormcast Eternal player must first find the Winch tile, and then activate the Hyshian Luminator, banishing the undead. The Chainrasp player wins if all the Stormcast Eternals are slain.

In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.<br/><br/>Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!<br/><br/>In Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, The Earl of Lemongrab and his sour disposition take on the cool as a cucumber penguin, Gunter! Lemongrab's deck contains cards that utilize SandyLands and Cornfield Landscapes. His new strategies include giving his opponent bad Creatures that take up space and mess up his opponent's combat phase. Keeping your opponents Creatures alive might just be your key to victory! You will also find new &quot;bounce&quot; Creatures that can enter and leave play at a moment's notice. And this deck can mess with your opponent's Landscapes!<br/><br/>Gunter&rsquo;s deck utilizes IcyLands and Blue Plains Landscapes. As a penguin, Gunter likes to hang out on the ice. Now he can! His deck has brand new ways of putting Frozen tokens on Landscapes...and this time, he might want to freeze his own! When his Creatures occupy Frozen Landscapes, they will be much more powerful. Of course, if he wants to get rid of the tokens he will need a lot of cards in hand. Blue Plains is still the king of card draw. Blue Plains is also the best at moving Creatures between Landscapes.

        "description": "Slap .45 is an old western shootout for three to seven players. Each player will control a six-member gang competing to survive with only their instincts, a quick draw, and dynamite.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. Each player has a home base card in front of them. Each turn, the player whose turn it is flips open a card from the common deck. The other players now have a chance to react.<br/><br/><br/>    If a Talkin&rsquo; Iron card is revealed, players can choose to make an offensive or a defensive move. If players want to take a shot, they can slap one hand on the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card and simultaneously make a pistol-finger with their other hand, pointing at any other player. Only one player gets to actually take a shot - the one who slaps the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card first. Instead of trying to slap the gun, players can slap into a home base by slapping any of the home bases on the table. Only one player&rsquo;s hand can be in a home base at a time. Players who slap into a home base can&rsquo;t be hit by a player who takes a shot, and they can safely keep their hand on that home base until they&rsquo;re forced to move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    If a Big Gun card is revealed, players can slap it to take a shot or slap into a home base. Just like a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, only one player can use it to take a shot - the first one to slap the card and simultaneously point a pistol-finger at another player. Unlike a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, a Big Gun is extraordinarily destructive, and damages players even if they&rsquo;re in a home base.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    If a Gold card is revealed, players can take the card into their possession by slapping it. If you point at another player while slapping the gold, the player you point at takes the gold instead. Gold is required to activate most gang&rsquo;s special powers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    When a Move! card is revealed, everyone needs to slap into a home base. If a player is already in a home base, they need to slap into a new home base. The last player to slap into a new home base loses one member of their gang. If anyone mistakenly slaps the Move! card, they lose one gang member, everyone else is safe regardless of where they slapped, and the turn ends.<br/><br/><br/>Players take turns until only one gang is left standing.<br/><br/>",

It is the awful day that his father is lost at sea, and despite great grandma Tess' belief in the power of the dandelion wishes, Jack knows no amount of magic will bring him back &mdash; but he tries anyway.<br/><br/>Nothing happens&hellip;<br/><br/>In an act of rage, Jack sets in motion a series of events that transports him to the true kingdom of Mourne: a realm half-real, half-imagined that's filled with all manner of fantastical creatures. Jack encounters Cobs, a 437-year old clurichaun (don't call him a leprechaun) who lives alone in a creaky old mansion perched on top of a tree that grows within a tree. Soon Jack learns that his tampering with the long forgotten magic of Mourne has stirred something deep within the heart of the mountains. An ancient wall encircles the center of the Kingdom, a wall that has held strong for centuries, but now the evil it was built to imprison has a plan to escape.<br/><br/>The Nightmares &mdash; the deepest fears from the darkest corners of Irish Legend &mdash; are being called from their slumber. From the four corners of the Kingdom they come. Their one aim: to tear down the wall and set the Old Ones' Shimnavore free.<br/><br/>In MourneQuest, a 2-4 player cooperative board game based on the novel MourneQuest by Irish author Garry McElherron, heroes Jack, Cobs, and their friends must battle to banish the Nightmares and save the Kingdom of Mourne. As they race towards their goal, they gather power from the land itself, with granite, blackthorn, flax and gold fueling their quest and magical items to boost their skills. But even the BogBeans, the normally elusive faerie folk of the dark forests and marshlands, seem set to block their path.<br/><br/>Together the heroes face an epic struggle to escape the BogBeans, dispel the Nightmares, and finally defeat the Shimnavore.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board wargame of the European and North African theaters in World War II. The War (&quot;TW&quot;) is a hex-and-counter strategic-level game which aims to provide the challenge of a monster game with the ease of play of a moderate complexity war game. Experienced players should be able to play a campaign game in a weekend.<br/><br/>The game includes several scenarios designed to be fun, challenging mini-games in their own right, each playable in an afternoon. An array of variants and optional rules offers enough scope to make TW most replayable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Compass Games website)The War: Europe 1939-1945 (TW) is Compass Games&rsquo; new WWII strategic level game combining all the best features of the genre into an intuitive, challenging new game. While offering all the expansive features of the WWII Monster Game genre (such as U-Boat warfare, diplomacy, espionage, strategic bombing, jets, rockets and numerous variants for each Major Power), TW also offers tremendous scope in its 12 scenarios (see below).<br/><br/>Although not a card driven game (and thus a good candidate for solitaire play), TW includes card play for the U-Boat War, Strategic Bombing, Espionage and Counter Espionage and naval warfare. The cards add elements of bluff and surprise more traditional hex-and-combat-table games cannot. But they&rsquo;re optional, so TW can be played solitaire in a way CDG&rsquo;s and block games cannot. Between two (or more) skilled players, no two games are ever likely to be the same. For multiplayer games, up to five gamers can play Campaign Games as Italy, Germany, France, the U.S., Britain and USSR.<br/><br/>For the hard-core military and naval history buff, TW addresses the details of WWII strategy: what if the Germans really built the carrier Graf Zeppelin; what if Mussolini had upgraded the quality of Italian forces; what if Stalin hadn&rsquo;t shot many of his best generals during the purges; what if the U.S. had entered the war earlier&hellip;or later; what if the British had been able to mobilize the Empire and the Dominions more effectively; what if the U.S. had developed the atomic bomb early enough to use in Europe, and so on.<br/><br/>Although the game is the result of extensive research by its designer, TW isn&rsquo;t a simulation and isn&rsquo;t intended to be. It&rsquo;s a &quot;gamer&rsquo;s game&quot; with quick, user-friendly combat systems on land, in the air and at sea. Veteran gamers familiar with classic WWII strategic level games should pick up the game very quickly. For new recruits, the short scenarios teach the basics, but can be played as stand-alone games in their own right. Both realistic and playable, TW should present a rewarding challenge for any WWII strategy game buff.<br/><br/>Scenario List for The War: Europe 1939-1945:<br/><br/>    1939 Full War Campaign<br/>    1941 Campaign<br/>    1942-43 Turning Point Campaign<br/>    Poland 1939<br/>    Norway 1940<br/>    France 1940<br/>    Barbarossa 1941<br/>    North Africa 1941-43<br/>    The Atlantic Lifeline 1939-45<br/>    Bolshevik Hordes 1944-45<br/>    Regia Marina<br/>    D-Day to VE Day 1944-45<br/><br/><br/>Complexity: High (about 8 out of 10)<br/>Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Good<br/><br/>Designer: Ernie Copley<br/>Developer: Paul Shackleton<br/>Artist: Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    2 maps<br/>    9 full sheets of 5/8&rdquo; counters<br/>    Approximately 20 full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cards with various displays, tracks, reminders, tables, charts, worksheets, etc.<br/>    1 rules booklet<br/>    1 scenario booklet<br/>    1 deck of variant cards<br/>    2 dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid &ndash; the big 3&rdquo; deep box<br/><br/><br/>",

Then during each turn, a player can perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. Add a die to the dice formation touching a friendly die - the newly added die cannot touch any of the opponents' dice.<br/>2. Move a die around the perimeter of the existing formation - the die's value determines the number of steps, and may reverse direction while moving.<br/>3. Merge two friendly dice, provided the player has at least 3 dice in the structure - add the value of adjacent dice, and replace one of the dice indicating the total.<br/><br/>It is further required that the dice formation stays connected at all times.<br/><br/>When a player merges two dice that add up to a value larger than 6, they win.<br/>Alternatively, if a player can't perform any action, they lose.<br/><br/>",

But if you want, 5150 can be more than just a wargame.<br/><br/>5150 thrusts you into a universe populated by both humans and aliens. Real aliens. Not just characters with a number changed here or there to make them &quot;tougher&quot; but real aliens that act differently.<br/><br/>5150 starts you off in the middle of the action. Choose whom you are and what you want to do. Star Army soldier commanding a military formation sound good? Maybe a mercenary making ends meet by salvaging equipment on far off planets? How about an adventurer, coming and going as you please always in search of that one big &quot;find&quot; that&rsquo;ll make you famous? Heck, you can even be a blue-skinned alien if you choose! With 5150 you&rsquo;re only limited by your imagination. If you can imagine it you can do it.<br/><br/>5150 provides a changing universe to campaign in. Not only your actions but also the actions of those beyond your control help shape your life. But like in real life first you must survive before you thrive as you try to establish yourself and your followers as a force to be reckoned with. Gain experience and skills as you successfully move through the galaxy. Find friends; make enemies, its all there in 5150. As time passes challenges change and it will take a combination of tactics and strategy to succeed. And a little luck won&rsquo;t hurt either!<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve played Chain Reaction: Fast and Furious Firefights 2.0, All Things Zombie, or Nuts! to name a few the mechanics in 5150 will be familiar but if you haven&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t worry. 5150 is a stand-alone game, easy to learn and fun to play.<br/><br/>",

Hence the name Coffee.<br/><br/>This is what you need in order to play Coffee:<br/><br/><br/>     A hexagonal board with more than 3 cells per side or a square board with more than 4 cells per side (NESTORGAMES version has up to 5 cells per side for the hexagonal board and up to 7 cells per side for the square board).<br/>     A supply of black and orange stones.<br/>     A small white rod.<br/><br/><br/>Black starts by placing a stone in an empty cell, and then placing the white rod on it, pointing in any direction (3 directions for a hexhex board, or 4 for a square board).<br/><br/>From now on, starting with Orange, players alternate turns first placing a stone in an empty cell in the direction indicated by the rod, and then placing the rod on it, pointing in any direction.<br/><br/>It is illegal to place the rod so that the next player has no free spaces available.<br/><br/>The game ends in one of the following cases:<br/><br/><br/>     One player wins the game by making a line of &lsquo;n&rsquo; stones of his color (with &lsquo;n&rsquo; being the victory condition).<br/>     One player loses the game because he cannot place the rod in a legal position.<br/><br/><br/>If both cases happen on the same turn, the first case prevails.<br/><br/>Notice that ties are not possible.<br/><br/>The set includes one extra white rod so that 2 couples can play at the same time on the smallest boards.<br/><br/>",

Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card to the H.D.P., face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The H.D.P. determines which answer card is the funniest one in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card is given the question card to represent a point, and then the player to the left of the H.D.P. becomes the new H.D.P. for the next round.<br/><br/>Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Dubbed &ldquo;Case Yellow&rdquo; (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.<br/><br/>In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.<br/><br/>Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, &ldquo;Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940?&rdquo; His research yields a resounding, &ldquo;Yes!,&rdquo; and the simulation elements of No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 3 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit is one army: The German forces or the Allied forces (French, British, and Neutrals) Each hex is about 30 kilometers from side to side. Each turn represents four days of real time, except the first turn, which is only two days.<br/><br/>",

The rules are very simple. Basically, blank sheets and pencils are the only things needed to start playing. Miniatures are not needed to play but can be used.<br/><br/>The main difference with other naval rules is that Amiraut&eacute; (Admiralty) is not purely a tactical game. Although it has detailed guns rate of fire, penetration,  rules for aircraft, naval bombing for operational scenarios and campaign games are included. For example, you can play the exactly same scenarios as Avalon Hill's Flat Top, not only the battles.<br/><br/>What you need to play:<br/><br/>     rules<br/>     ruler, protractor, pencil, eraser<br/>     two 10-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>A referee is strongly recommended for a better gaming experience.<br/><br/>Naval units: each ship is described on a card with its size (length, width), armor, detailed weaponry (diameter, range), max speed, defensive value (calculated from tonnage, vertical and horizontal armor, age).<br/>Air units: air units are defined by their max speed, range, weaponry and defensive value.<br/><br/>Combat:<br/><br/>     Combat is resolved with tables.<br/>     Combat against ships is resolved with a probability of impact check, then computing the number of hits, and finaly damage.<br/>     Torpedoes have length, speed, angle and distance parameters.<br/>     Anti-aircraft fire is handled globally for air to naval attacks and air to ground strikes.<br/>     Damage can have effects on speed and attack capabilities.<br/><br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>     strategic moves : 1 cm = 10 km<br/>     tactical moves : 1 cm = 100 meters<br/>     miniatures (if used) : 1/3000<br/>     strategic turn : 1 to 4 hours<br/>     tactical turns : 5 minutes<br/><br/><br/>",

The player with the widest time frame on his card now has to set a time frame according to his card in which in his opinion the event has happened. The player with the second widest time frame now can either challenge the previous players time frame or narrow the time frame according to his played card.<br/>When every player has either guessed a time frame or challenged another player the point of time the event has happened is announced. All the players with the point of time in their time frame and those who challenged another player's guess get rid of their played card.<br/>The first player to get rid of 5 cards wins the round and gets 2 victory points, the player with the most cards left gets no points, all others get 1 point.<br/><br/>",

Bring it along on your next adventure!<br/><br/>The sun is shining, as a light, salty wind sends cottony clouds scudding across the sky. Sandpipers filling their bellies with strange insects, crabs hiding under piles of rocks, seashells washed up on the sand, curling waves that break along the beach. Nature in its simplest beauty.<br/><br/>One token at a time, create your Seaside with the elements the sea sends your way. The goal of the game is to have the highest stack of tokens.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Put all tokens in the Bag and mix them up. The Play area is divided into 2 spaces: The sea (central area) and the Seaside (area in front of each player)<br/><br/>On your turn, draw a token from the Bag, look at it secretly, choose the side that interests you and apply its effect. Once you have chosen the side of the token you'd like to play, it will remain like that for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Once you've applied the token's effect, your turn is over; pass the Bag to the player on your left. <br/><br/><br/>There are two types of tokens:<br/><br/>Tokens with a blue design are thrown into the sea<br/><br/>Tokens with a white design are placed on your Seaside<br/><br/>If you pick a token with a blue design and throw it into the sea, you immediately take another turn. Your turn ends when you pick a token with a white design and put it on your Seaside.<br/><br/>The key to the game lies in the interaction among the various elements of Seaside&rsquo;s ecosystem. The Sandpiper allows you to fetch Isopods from the Sea. The more Beaches you have, the more Shells you can collect from the Sea. Having one Rock does nothing, but the second one you place allows you to collect all the Crabs from the Sea... and even steal one from another player! Finally, Waves wash across the Beach tiles and flip them over.<br/><br/>As soon as the bag is empty, the game is over. Stack up all the tokens from your Seaside, and the player with the highest stack wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be careful, though, as your opponent may be the one to claim the more valuable card. In addition, each turn you may set aside any number of the results you obtained on your dice to work towards a card. Rolling six of a kind nets you a Sixis, ending the game.<br/><br/>",

While exploring the wilderness, your main mission as a ranger is to work on reforestation, rescue wildlife, and respond to any threats to the forest. Throughout the game, players may develop ranger skills, protect the wildlife, and strive to become the true guardian of the forest.<br/><br/>Each player round includes 2 steps:<br/><br/><br/>     Landscape Tile Placement: Draw a hexagonal landscape tile and place it on the table. Should the tile indicate an animal encounter, draw an animal card and place the corresponding animal token on the tile; if the tile indicates a forest fire or illegal logging, then forests might be destroyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Ranger Actions: There are five ranger actions that a player can choose from. The main action is to plant forests. Discard the required number of resource card and place the forest meeple on a tile. Planting trees give you victory points and upgrades your ranger skills. Other actions includes rescuing an animal, putting out a fire, swapping resource cards, and sending out rangers to protect your forest.<br/><br/><br/>Besides planting trees, players gain points when placing the wildlife in their proper habitats; also, putting out fire will produce victory points. The game ends once a player has planted all the forest meeple on their character boards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;DEATH IN THE TRENCHES&quot; is a strategic-level World War I wargame covering the entire war, from the opening shots in Serbia and Belgium to the final defeat -- or victory! -- of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1918. The game includes a map illustrated by Jonathan Carnehl, stretching from the Pyrenees to Moscow, and from Norway to the Sudan, covering every square inch of territory in Europe and the Near East which saw combat from 1914 to 1918, in a manageable 34x22&quot; format. An additional map shows the German colonies<br/><br/>The game also features 520 beautifully-illustrated counters depicting the national armies that fought in the war -- from the Germans, French, British and Russians all the way down to the Persians, Montenegrins, Armenians, South Africans, and a host of other specialized units (French Foreign Legion, Gurkhas, Italian &quot;Arditi&quot;, Cossacks, Tyrolean Kaiserjaeger, Zionists, Bavarians, &quot;Dunsterforce&quot;... even the Chinese may send a small expeditionary force).<br/><br/>DEATH IN THE TRENCHES includes a 28-page rulebook (and an additional 20 pages of setups and random events) detailing the game's unique combat system (no CRT!) which portrays the grinding nature of World War I combat in a realistic way that still gives players plenty of options to pursue. Using army-level units (which contain numbers of divisional level formations, represented off-map), players use numerous special military abilities to drive back the enemy.<br/><br/>Detailed random events rules give you more gory details about World War I than you've ever seen before in a game, while helping keep play simple and straightforward. Lenin, the Senussi revolt, intrigue in the Romanian court, the Cruise of the Emden, the Armenian Massacre, the Sinai Pipeline, the Ukrainian Reactionary Hetmanate, Rasputin, Mata Hari, the Russian shell shortage, the murder of Edith Cavell, Wilhelm Wassmuss (the &quot;German Lawrence&quot;), Lawrence of Arabia, the Nestorian resistance, Pancho Villa, the Grand Duke Nicholas, Thomas Masaryk, the Red Baron, Czech Legion, Irish Rising, Berber Revolt, air raids, typhus, influenza... they're all here.<br/><br/>For the World War I buff, &quot;DITT&quot; has everything: Tanks, Alpenkorps, artillery barrages, flamethrowers, poison gas, Krupp guns, Mustapha Kemal, the Royal Air Force, French elan... while the great wartime leaders all leave their mark (good or bad!) on history: Bruchmuller, Haig, Hoffmann, Mackensen, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Rennenkampf and Samsonov, Sarrail, Von Francois, Foch, Brusilov, Nivelle, Plehve, Putnik, Yudenich... history is overflowing. Players command the armed forces of nearly forty nations, in a game that still manages to be small enough to fit on your table!<br/><br/>It sounds like a massive game, but it isn't. DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is designed to be played--easy to play, hard to master. You'll learn things about World War I you never knew before, and you'll have to face the same crises the leaders of the Entente and Central Powers did. Think you can do better than Douglas Haig and Robert Nivelle? Now it's your turn.<br/><br/>The original edition of Death in the Trenches won the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.<br/><br/>The 2021 edition takes this WW1 classic to new heights, and features a revised and expanded combat system that preserves the charm of the original but is much more faithful to actual WWI battle numbers and provides much more detail on individual countries' distinctive military strengths and weaknesses. Each individual battle now takes place on an off-map display that simulates a real WWI battle, each battle opening with a &quot;spearhead&quot; force that drives into a &quot;target area&quot;. The system of entrenchment remains simple and easy to play, but takes into account the role of time and manpower in creating different levels of trench effectiveness.<br/><br/>Added detail includes the Hindenburg Line, German siege guns, and the possible flight of the French government. Instability in the Balkans, and the allegiance of the Roumanian and Bulgarian governments, may lead to unexpected political reversals in Europe's turbulent &quot;backyard&quot;. The impact of the Russian Revolution is expanded, with several possible directions for Russia to travel including the rise of a better Czar, or even the takeover of Soviet Russia by Trotsky, which could bring Russia back into the war!<br/><br/>The system of military reinforcements has been transformed, with greater reliance on historical unit production and manpower. Great Power support and sponsorship for minor country forces has been made a vital part of the game, and the &quot;major minors&quot; like Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria now have their own Army Reserves which give each country a more distinctive role.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each round, players simultaneously choose 2 cards to play from their hand and reveal them. Players then take their turns, using their chosen cards as well as their accumulated speed to catch up with opponents, drift, use their nitro, launch bombs and missiles, and use their precious special ability. But watch out! Curves are dangerous, and might damage your vehicle! Upgrade cards can be acquired to enhance your options, but sometimes require you to remove another card from your hand. The first to finish the last lap of the race wins it all.<br/>Megapulse includes clever catch-up mechanics, and multiples game modes like Derby, Neon God, and Spellflux Ball.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Jinja features evocative illustrations and high-quality components, with custom plastic miniatures representing the shrines, painted meeples to represent the workers, screenprinted score trackers, and a custom multi-color Mask die.<br/><br/>The game board is an illustrated map of Japan divided into territories with a limited number of temple sites. Over five seasons, players place workers on one of the thirteen actions or seven territories as they work towards their different goals. Building a Shrine earns honor and special abilities<br/><br/>Jinja adds replayability with variable goals and events. Omikuji, or &quot;fortunes,&quot; are secret goals that score you bonus points if your shrines are on key locations. Kitsune cards are randomly chosen for each game, providing different discounts, bonuses, and abilities that change with the seasons.<br/><br/>Throughout the game you can exchange deed cards for territory, leave it up to luck by rolling the mask die for bonuses, and revisit your territories to build up your resource supply.

A brave adventurer, you will encounter monsters from terrible dragons guarding hoards of gold to pesky little orcs, ancient, undiscovered treasure chambers, cursed glyphs. Lots of stuff.<br/><br/>As you explore you also come across the items you need to get through and learn spells that can alter the very corridors in front of you. But beware; you are not the only one in the dungeon and your opponent will have a very different view of what it looks like&hellip;<br/><br/>You begin the game with an empty grid of thirty-six square holes (the Dungeon Waffle), plus a bag of thirty-six Dungeoneering Dice. The Dungeon Waffle is placed between you and your opponent, so each of you can see a different side of it. You then take it in turns to draw a die from the bag, roll it and use whatever you roll to either add to the dungeon map, alter the dungeon map or add to your resources.<br/><br/>Your aim is to score more experience points than your opponent over one or more games. During a game you try to map out a route on your side of the waffle from one edge to the other, and collect weapons and equipment to deal with whatever you might encounter on the way. When adding to the dungeon map you will change the map seen on both sides of the Dungeon Waffle, hopefully helping your route, while hindering your opponent&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>",

You can only visit each venue once and will need to carefully plan your route and take sales opportunities when they are arise.  Drive efficiently and score bonuses, or race to the finish and hit the big-time payouts on the way.  Plan your route but expect the unexpected in your path to food truck infamy!<br/><br/>Truck Off: The Food Truck Frenzy Roll and Write is a stand alone game and follow-up to the original Truck Off: The Food Truck Frenzy.  It throws navigation, risk mitigation, and press your luck into the same meal pack for you to digest.<br/><br/>In Truck Off Roll and Write, all players are driving their food trucks around a grid system town map, and marking off venue locations in a secondary location called a route tracker for each venue they visit.  All players will visit a new venue each turn and then mark the value of their corresponding venue dice directly scoring them points.  If you mark three venues in one row or one column of the route tracker, you gain a bonus.  Bonuses help you navigate around town, allow you to reroll your dice more, drive farther, drive faster, and promote venues to make them more valuable.<br/><br/>Each turn, the active player rolls the set of polyhedral dice.  The active player may reroll up to one die to help the sales on their route or hurt the sales on their opponents route.  Then all players select one open venue to drive to if possible up to 4 spaces away following a grid movement system. Each player then marks the value of the die on the corresponding location of their route tracker always progressing their route tracker.<br/><br/>Route Tracker:  The route tracker is made up of six columns, one for each of D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20 venues.  However, the route must always progress forward from D4 to D20 and snake back to D4.  If you skip a venue in your route, then you may not return to that venue on the route tracker.  The route tracker will play a big role in your pathing around the town and also allows you push the game toward end quicker than your opponents expect.<br/><br/>To win the game and score the most sales, you'll need to plan your efficient route, take high sales opportunities when they present themselves, and figure out how to reroute your food truck if you deviate from your plan.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's OGRE implemented in Diceland!<br/><br/>The game consists of one 4-inch die (the Ogre Cybertank) and a set of 16 smaller dice representing lesser units. One side plays the Ogre; the other side picks 30+X points of units, where X is the cost of the smallest unit.<br/>Each turn (starting with the non-Ogre player - call them the Defender), the player may either activate a die on the table or throw a new die onto the table and immediately activate it. Each die has 8 sides with variable levels of attack and defense, as well as special powers. Facing matters when attacking, but range only matters if one potential target is closer than another.<br/>When a die attacks: if its Attack value is greater than the target's Defense value, the target die is destroyed and the player scores its point value. If the Attack Value is lower (even an Attack of 1 agains the Ogre's 40+), the target shifts one side (effectively losing 1 of its 1d8 hit points).<br/>Instead of attacking, a die can move, rotating on its edge for a better firing position or to expose a better face. The Ogre can both fire and then move, making it hard to kill.<br/>If the Defender can get several dice on the table, they have a Command Post which can activate every die, bringing the Ogre down quickly. The Ogre also has a 'systems card' like the old Steve Jackson game, allowing its weapons and treads to be attacked.<br/>The winner is the first to score 50 points; the Ogre is worth 50 points and the Command Post isn't worth any (destroying it is not the goal).<br/><br/>List of Diceland sets and armies<br/><br/>Related to the Game: Ogre / G.E.V..<br/><br/>",

But this game is not about them, these giants of engineering.<br/><br/>No, in Gear &amp; Piston, you play one of the unsung heroes of history, an engineer of meagre means but great ambition, trying to build a prototype for picky investors seeking to profit from the future of transport. Will you make a name for yourself as an automotive pioneer, change the history of motorized transportation, and win the race that is Gear and Piston? With a lot of skill and a little luck, maybe. If nothing else, try not to blow yourself up in the process.<br/><br/>In the game, each player builds an automobile prototype by taking actions in different locations. You may patent brand-new parts in the Patent Office, look for rejected, volatile pieces of machinery in the chaos of the Junk Yard, try to gain an edge through the Back Alley, and finally build your prototype in the Workshop. All this just to please the two investors who are doing the rounds of the different engineering outfits, and who will be evaluating your rickety mess of an automobile. Good timing, keeping an eye on your competitors, and even a dash of luck are all you need to succeed in this business. So grab a wrench, some elbow grease, and your wits, and put some gears and pistons together!<br/><br/>",

A.R.M. (the Achab Remote Mind) security system, a sophisticated artificial intelligence developed by Achab engineers, proactively detects and fights against each intrusion attempt to Gene.sys, but it seems that something is going wrong with it&hellip;<br/><br/>The Breach is a competitive Net Crawler game for 1-4 players, lasting approximately 25 minutes per player, where they attempt to breach the Gene.sys database to steal secret information. Each player is a Breacher, a digital rebel, guided by their ideals or by their Faction interests.<br/><br/>The game map is Gene.sys, a virtual universe of mysterious origin, currently controlled by the Achab Corporation. After hacking into the database, the Breacher Avatars will need to face several dangers: not just other Breachers, but also I.C.E. controlled by the A.R.M. (the Achab Remote Mind), who will try to stop the incursions. In case of need, A.R.M. will also use powerful Guardians to try to put an end to intrusion attempts.<br/><br/>The Breach is a Net Crawler with a distinctive resource management system, set collection mechanics and variable powers. Your objective is to spread your viruses inside the database, while gathering as much information as possible.<br/><br/>The game turn is structured in three phases: Firewall (I.C.E. run their subroutines against players), Actions (Avatars choose and execute their actions) and Net (Avatars configure their skills and steal information using viruses). You will be able to upgrade your Avatar, assign Viruses, fight the Guards and other Avatars, explore the rooms of Gene.sys, but also install programs and use Cheat codes to manipulate the database according to your needs.<br/><br/>Pay also attention to the health of your Avatar: if it will suffer enough damage, it will be disconnected from the network and reconnected in a different location! However, you could play more strategic and take advantage also of this event&hellip;<br/><br/>Each game of The Breach will be different from the previous one: the choice among Avatar, Breacher and Database structure offers a different challenge each time, and players have to be clever to identify the best strategy for optimizing the available resources.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Blind Swords system game on the American Civil War battle of Perryville (Kentucky) in 1862. The Blind Swords system uses chit pulls and activation rolls to simulate the command confusion and difficulty of coordinating 19th century armies. Additionally, each turn a number of events can impact the ability of armies to carry out their plans. The basic units are regiments of infantry or cavalry and batteries of artillery which are rated for size, armament, and cohesion/morale.<br/><br/>Perryville was a short fierce battle between Buell's Army of the Ohio and Bragg's Army of the Tennessee. While Bragg thought he was facing only a small portion of the Army of the Ohio, he was in fact confronting almost its entirety. Buell thought he was facing all of Bragg's Army and possibly even Kirby Smith's Army of Kentucky. Instead Buell was facing only about 2/3 of Bragg's army.<br/><br/>After an early morning skirmish, both armies assembled on the battlefield just northwest of the crossroads of Perryville. What had been planned as a flanking attack against the Union II Corps instead turned into a frontal assault on the newly arrived Union I Corps, half of which consisted of new recruits. Despite a ferocious battle raging about two miles from his headquarters, Buell was unaware of the Confederate attack and was astonished that one of his corps had been smashed by the vicious assault. Only a few brigades were sent to assist the beleaguered I Corps and the Confederates claimed a tactical victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Sixteen &quot;Rewardable&quot; tokens also rotate into play during the game, giving players a changing set of goals, potential strategies, and bonuses every turn.

The standard 1936-1939 game requires not other components than those provided in this game. It is played on the map of Europe and the Pacific and uses an abstract combat system to represent the conflicts occurring in this period. The 1936-1946 Grand Campaign Game require World in Flames to be used in conjunction with Days of Decision to resolve the military conflicts. Finally, there is also a World in Flames mini scenario of the Spanish Civil War which requires some components from World in Flames.<br/><br/><br/>This game can be played alone or as a pre-game of 1930s politics for World in Flames also by ADG.<br/><br/>The game is about who will (if any) declare the Second World War, how the production of the Major Powers are at the time of war  and how the many small nations will align (Axis or Allied). It has been replaced by DoDII, which adds the Communist alignment. DoDII has recently been replaced by DoDIII.<br/><br/>",

Travelling to planet Seratus, you must lead your Bots to find out the truth behind &quot;The Singularity&quot;.<br/><br/>SCRAP is an area control game featuring lots of &quot;Bots on a Map&quot;. Its major mechanical features are:<br/><br/><br/>     Action Queue Programming: You'll plan your moves in advance by placing &quot;Functions&quot; into an queue. Each turn, you'll resolve the Function at the front of your queue and place a new Function at the back of it. <br/>     Hand Building: Throughout the game, you'll acquire new Functions to increase your options when programming. Each card has two major purposes; one, to serve as a unique option for your Bots (no two action cards are the same), and also as fuel for other powers; whenever you reveal a Function on your turn, you can discard a Function of a matching colour to gain powerful bonus effects!<br/>     Hand Management: Your Functions will need time to refresh in between uses, and you must plan a Reboot turn in advance (even Robots need a break!). Spend too many cards too quickly and you'll find yourself rebooting much more frequently.<br/>     Hidden Bidding Combat: Assign your Bots orders in a unique and thematic combat system with no dice or cards; YOU choose what your Bots will do. Probe your opponent to gain additional data or weapons for the future, snipe their Bots before they can strike, brace for impact, and then get ready to brawl! Plus, get data whenever you destroy something!<br/>     Asymmetric Factions: Play as one of six unique &quot;Intelligences&quot; (factions) featuring a unique hand of functions (5 cores similar to other players and one wholly unique ability) and unique upgrades. Crush the competition with Vulkanos, study your enemies as Cerebrum, or manipulate the space-time continuum with Tachyon.<br/><br/><br/>SCRAP draws inspiration from a range of games, including Cthulhu Wars, Inis, Scythe, Concordia, Rising Sun, Cry Havoc, Blood Rage, Mage Knight, and Spirit Island.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One player controls the Communists, the other the Allied Forces. The game has several scenarios (1965, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1972.)

It was during the periods of major offensives operations that there was the possibility to have altered the outcome of the Vietnam War. While the main emphasis of the game is on the conventional operations, unconventional war also has its place in the game; woe unto the player who ignores it!

        "description": "In Mayan Sun, Aztec Destiny: 500 BC - AD 2012 - Beyond&infin;, players are ancient astronomers reading the stars and sun patterns. Using the Mayan Haab agricultural calendar invented in roughly 500 BC, players inform their villages when to best plant their seeds so that they may grow a tremendous harvest to feed their people. After their seeds are planted, the astronomers recommend rituals to aid in their harvest and their reading of prophecies in the stars, but problems arise. A village conducting a ritual to help their crop could be stealing the power of the sun or cosmos from a nearby neighbor. Droughts may crush other villages.<br/><br/>After crops have been harvested, the ancient astronomers now begin to forecast the prophecies of the stars. Using the technologies found in the Aztec Calendar, the important messages from the sky above may be telling us when and how the world will end. Players wager a bet about the ultimate destiny. With their knowledge of Prophecy they may influence this ultimate end, and also may know the exact date! Could the world end by the fires of a super volcano in 1969 AD, or will an alien race arrive in 2012 AD, or will a super nova occur light years away destroying our planet in 3,000,000,000 years? Players are now trusted prophets and will have the knowledge of the end of time.<br/><br/>The game can be played as either a basic SUN game or an advanced DESTINY game. The basic Sun game involves players moving the tiles by conducting rituals, tile positioning can help or hinder players as they grow crops and collect prophetic knowledge. Players in the basic game will score for the amount of villages they feed and Prophecy tokens they collect. The Destiny game is for players desiring a more involved game in which Prophecy tokens, earned conducting ritual, must be used to either influence the value of villages, investments in the future, and/or influencing how and when the world may come to an end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two Rooms is a co-operative card game for two players in which a group of humans has entered the House of Mist and must escape the vampires within.<br/><br/>The game takes place in the two halves of the game box, one depicting a red door, and the other a green door. The game centers around a deck of 15 cards. On your turn, draw a card from the deck and place it into one of the two rooms. When you &quot;open&quot; the room to add the card, you look at the cards already present and resolve their effects in ascending numerical order. Some effects will remove cards to the casualty area, others will cause cards to switch rooms, and so on. While this is happening, the other player must keep their eyes closed.<br/><br/>The game comes with four difficulty levels, and the players win if the Cloaked Vampire is placed in the casualty area and the players know the location of one of the human cards, Nina. The players lose in a number of ways, such as Nina entering the casualty area or the deck running out of cards.<br/><br/>",

Combining Way of the Fighter Turbo with Way of the Fighter Super allows you to tag in two more players for even more action.<br/><br/>Over a period of twelve intense turns, each player will control a fighter&rsquo;s movement, manage the fighter&rsquo;s energy, and decide on what actions to have the fighter perform against the opposing challenger.

Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.

It's the kind of game for those nights when you'd like to play something, but don't want to commit to a traditional fantasy sports simulation.<br/><br/>One of the great mysteries of the sport of Elfball is just where it began, and how it got its name. The Elves of the vast forests of the Westerlands claim to have been playing the sport since the dawn of time, and that they named it in honor of themselves. The Dwarves and Orcs, high in their mountain homes, dispute this bold claim and insist that the game&rsquo;s name instead refers to the type of severed head that makes the best ball core; both races maintain that they are in fact the originators and some of the bloodiest wars in the history of the realms have been fought over this claim. The men of the Middle Kingdoms ignore the squabbles of the elder races and call the game De Circque instead.<br/><br/>Today Elfball is played by every nation and tribe of the world, and with a few regional variations, it is played the same on fields throughout The Realms. The design of the field, the distinctive ball, and the rules of play are all quite standardized.<br/><br/>This game was prototyped in 2002 by Phigs Miniatures but did not see production until the game rules were overhauled and changed about 80% from the prototype and then released by Impact! Miniatures in 2007.<br/><br/>",

To set up the game, you divide the number tiles into four piles based on the number of scarabs on them, with more scarabs typically signifying larger numbers. To create the number pyramid, you lay out one tile with four scarabs, two tiles with three, and so on.<br/><br/>On a turn, one players rolls the three dice &ndash; an octahedron, a decahedron and a dodecahedron &ndash; then all players try to use the four fundamental arithmetic operations to transform the numbers on two or three of the dice to match one of the numbers on a tile. For example, amongst the cards on the board is a 72 and you rolled two 8s and one 1; you can calculate 8 x (8 + 1) and the result is 72. As soon as a player has reached a target number, she takes that tile off the game board, then flips the thirty-second sand timer. Everyone else can grab one tile during this time, then once time expires the players must demonstrate how they reached the number in question. If a player calculated correctly, she keeps the tile face-up; otherwise she flips it face-down as a penalty.<br/><br/>Players then fill up empty spaces on the game board, then roll the dice again to start another round. As soon as a row cannot be filled, the game ends. Players then tally the scarabs they collected, subtract penalty scarabs, and see who has the highest score.<br/><br/>",

Two historical and one theoretical scenario at an operational level.<br/><br/>It is the summer of 1943 and the fate of the Russo-German War - the largest land conflict of the Second World War - hangs in the balance. A decisive victory for either side means a profound change in the course of the war.<br/><br/>Clash of Titans: The Tank Battle for Kursk, 1943 is an operational simulation of the battle for Kursk which took place during July 1943. On 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht attacked with 435,000 men in fifty divisions and 2,700 tanks and assault guns (including the new Panther and Ferdinand types). The Red Army was able to field 1,550,000 soldiers and 4,800 armored vehicles for this battle of titanic proportions. Operation Zitadelle had begun... Clash of Titans comes with two more scenarios, one featuring a hypothetical early German attack in May (favored by some German generals), the other simulating the historical Soviet summer counteroffensive in August. One side represents the German forces of 9th Army, 2nd Army, 4th Panzer Army, and Armeeabteilung Kempf while the other side controls the Red Army forces of Southwest Front, Voronezh Front, Central Front, Bryansk Front, West Front, and Steppe Front.

Three complete games are included: Sicily-Invade and capture Italy's southern island fortress, Normandy Breakout-Direct the critical campaign on the sweep to Berlin, and Battle of the Bulge-The daring breakthrough to Bastogne.  A two-sided (19&quot; x 26&quot;) game board is provided.<br/><br/>The game maps are historically accurate, as well as the initial troop deployments. Troop movement per turn is dictated by 24 troop movement cards. Allied and German units are 112 die cut cardboard pieces. Battles are resolved using 5 red and 5 white battle dice.<br/><br/>The game plays very well for a wargame of its age. The troop movement card deck works better than one might think. Moving the little cardboard counters is typical of wargames of this era. And the battle resolution based upon rolling multiples of any number seems unbalanced at first, but after a few plays you realize that it too works as well as the troop movement card deck.  Two very innovative wargaming mechanisms that allow for quick movement and battle resolution. Thus the game moves fast, but does not sacrifice battle and movement detail(s).<br/><br/>Copyright (c) 1973 RGI - Research Games, Inc and ATHOL Game Co., 200 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010<br/><br/>Also see: Major Campaigns of General Douglas MacArthur<br/><br/>",

During the game, you will select cards to add to your panoramas. Art the end of the game, cards score points based on their relationships to other cards. You will also score points by winning awards.<br/><br/>Panorama is easy to learn with elegant rules! Choose a card from your hand, add it to one of your panoramas, then pass the rest to your neighbor. Cards score based on other cards in your panoramas!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Competitive card game for 1-6 players.

They choose two of the non-white dice, then write the value on each die in an empty space on their player sheet matching the color of the die. (The player sheet shows scoring blocks made of four colored squares; each block has a value in the center, e.g. 6, 14, or 20.) All other players write the value on the white die in any empty space on their player sheet.<br/><br/>If you fill the four colored squares of a block, and the sum of the numbers you wrote matches the value at the center of that block, circle that value; you'll earn that many points at game's end. All other players must X out this block and no longer write in it. If you fill a block and the numbers sum higher than the value, cross out the value; you'll lose 10 points for this block at game's end, but other players can continue to try to score it.<br/><br/>If you complete and score adjacent blocks, mark out the bridge that connects these blocks. Each marked bridge is worth 5 points. Twice during play, you can discard a number instead of writing, but you lose points equal to the discarded numbers.<br/><br/>When a player has no more open blocks, each other player takes one final turn rolling solely for themselves, then they cross out the value for all blocks with open spaces, losing 10 points for each one. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Colour Square includes two types of player sheets with different values and slightly different rules.<br/><br/>",

The object is to make your theater the most spectacular in the city by booking the greatest and most diverse roster of acts that you can find (and afford!).<br/><br/>You win the game by having the highest score on the Success Track, which represents public approbation and goodwill. While money is an important part of running a successful theater, there've gotta be easier ways to make a living than dealing with a never-ending procession of ventriloquists, jugglers, and trained animals! No, you're in this business because greasepaint is in your blood, and you can't imagine a world without limelight.<br/><br/>In each of four turns, players bid on the right to select acts first and place those acts in their theaters. After your theaters are booked, you tally up scores to see who was the most successful. Good shows will drive up the reputation of your theater and influence the popularity of the types of acts that you book, but a flop can always set you back!<br/><br/>",

The sea voyages take you along one of three routes. The routes are of decreasing length, opportunity, and, in some cases, risk. The routes are made up of a series of Unknown Islands, stops in the Known Lands, and trade ports. Movement distance is determined by the roll of a die with the choice of the route going to each Sindbad.<br/><br/>The adventure cards you draw may be used to help you defeat monsters, opponents or events.<br/><br/>The aim is to collect a fortune of a million Mischals and get back to Basra, by fighting monsters or trading in different cities.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Battles website:)<br/><br/>Wagram 1809 simulates one of Napoleon's greatest victories. After the troubling defeat at Essling on 22 May 1809, and still holding Vienna, Napoleon needed to renew his confidence and finish the campaign.<br/>For the second time, Napoleon crossed the Danube to meet the force of Archduke Charles. This time, however, preparations for the crossing were better and during the night of 4-5 july he managed to get most of his troops across.<br/>The battle of Wagram could then commence, and it would last for two days.<br/><br/>The game is at divisional scale and uses a plotted system of moving army corps with alternating activations of units during the turn. There is no CRT and units become progressively weaker during the battle.<br/>For Wagram 1809, Laurent Martin has used an adaptation and evolution of the system he has already used for the battle of Bull Run and Cedar Creek, which appeared in Vae Victis.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Great War at Sea series.<br/><br/>From &quot;Avalanche Press&quot; Website:<br/><br/>During the early decades of the Twentieth Century, the United States Navy made plans to fight a host of potential enemies. Some of these future wars seemed inevitable, particularly that with Japan. Others depended on changes in current politics, but Navy planners wanted to be prepared just in case.<br/><br/>One of these plans, labeled &ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; studied a potential naval war with France. The United States had stood alongside its &ldquo;oldest ally&rdquo; during the First World War, but in the years immediately afterwards the Navy looked at the potential for radical politicians to change France from friend to foe. Also, the peace negotiations which followed the war revealed deep underlying tensions between the Americans and their European allies; some of the more paranoid came to believe the next war would be between Europe and America.<br/><br/>U.S. Navy Plan Gold is based on these plans. American officers believed the seat of conflict would be the same as that of the undeclared naval war against France in the 1790s: the Caribbean Basin.<br/><br/>U.S. Navy Plan Gold includes the ships projected by the Armee Navale but never built due to the Washington Naval Treaty: the large Gilles and Durand-Viel battle cruisers, Normandie and Lyon class battleships, and the very odd &ldquo;croiseur de combat&rdquo; battleship/carrier design. And of course the Americans receive a number of new ships, such as the &ldquo;alternate Omaha&rdquo; large scout cruiser design.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Information wants to be free, but you charge by the hour...<br/><br/>In the world of network security, a &quot;black hat&quot; is a hacker who defeats computer systems for personal gain. These rogue data jockeys pit themselves against the most secure systems in the world for the thrill of it (and maybe to make a little money on the side). However, the most skilled hackers know it's not about getting there first; it's about ghosting in and out of the system without leaving a trace.<br/><br/>Black Hat is a hacker-themed, climbing trick-taking board game for 2-6 players. While trick-taking is the main mechanism used in the game, you can win the game even if you win only a few tricks &mdash; as long as you win the ones that make the most for your game. Black Hat features a random and evolving game board that players progress through during the game, and while that progress helps you toward victory, the first player to finish doesn't necessarily win.<br/><br/>Black Hat allows a wide variety of gameplay strategies to be applied, none of them clearly superior over another, as you have to adapt to the situation.<br/><br/>",

Their values vary from 2 to 5. Buildings (cards) are placed on the table, too.<br/><br/>Each player takes two turns per round, the first in clockwise order, the second one counterclockwise. Your turn starts with choosing a group of commodity cards OR one building from the display in the middle of the table. Then you may build up to three buildings from your hand. To build, you must pay the costs by discarding your commodities. Depending on where you build (with the color of the building indicating the city), your commodities have a different value. Usually the commodity has a base value, but in every city, one commodity is not wanted at all and another one is more expensive. In Gdansk, for example, you cannot pay with grain, but glass has a value +2. The buildings show victory points and persons. They also have different features to help you get more commodities, create more victory points, or build more easily by giving money per merchant on your cards.<br/><br/>Riga continues the series of small games from Ostia in the Baltic Sea following Visby and Tallinn.<br/><br/>",

Battlefront:WWII is designed to model this tactical level of combat. The basic organization used is the &quot;maneuver element&quot;, usually a company sized formation of units fighting as a group. In Battlefront:WWII each player takes command of one or more maneuver elements. A game involving several players recreates tactical actions between opposing battalion or regimental sized forces and can be finished in a single evening.<br/><br/>* Each miniature or stand represents a squad of men, specialized team, or 2-3 vehicles or guns.<br/>    * Each game turn represents approximately 10 minutes of real time.<br/>    * The rules are designed so that each player can handle one or two maneuver elements (a maneuver element is roughly a company).<br/>    * Units of up to battalion size can be handled comfortably by experienced players.<br/>    * Although designed for 15mm miniatures, play aids and rules allow miniatures from 5mm (1/285) to 20mm to be used comfortably.<br/><br/>Battlefront:WWII began life as a training aid for the Army in the 1980's. The rules are not only easy to play and fun, but also historically accurate. Poor tactics or 'gamey' gambits will quickly fail. Players who learn how to combine the strengths and capabilities of their units will be effective on the battlefield.<br/><br/>",

You have no equal...aside from your sibling.<br/><br/>As half-god children of the Olympians, the deathless have posed a contest to determine the greatest of their mortal offspring: sack three cities where the gods have hidden powerful Kraters, each infused with their own divine power.<br/><br/>From soldiers and beasts to seers and muses, mustering forces to sack these cities is only a few coins away. While recovering the Kraters lies at the heart of the Gods' contest, they may also be impressed by the triumphs you accomplish at the city steps, and the company you keep might help to sway their choice of a victor.<br/><br/>The Immortals stand at the precipice of Olympus; breath held, attention turned to the mortal realm. Only one will join the Olympians, while the other will fade into antiquity as another forgotten spawn of the gods.<br/><br/>Banks of the Styx | Omen Game 2 is a standalone card game for two players.<br/><br/>Like the other new Omen games, this standalone game features 22 Unique Unit cards and 6 Unique Krater cards, each offering new Traits and abilities, and is fully compatible with all new (and unreleased) Omen games.<br/><br/>Each Omen game is played over a series of player turns and ends when all three Cities have been destroyed (or when a player has a certain number of cards in their Rewards). Each City is comprised of 2 Krater cards. Players spend Coins to play Units to these Cities, and once a City is Sacked, the City is resolved and the player with the most Strength at that City gains 1 of the Krater cards at that City (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Krater's ability).<br/><br/>The turn structure is broken into five Steps:<br/><br/>WEALTH: The active player receives 3 Wealth Actions. Each Wealth Action is used to draw a Unit or gain a Coin. However, if a player spends all of their actions on the same resource, they receive a bonus resource!<br/><br/>SURGE: The active player spends their coins to play Units from their hand to their side of the Cities. Unit cards with certain Traits can also be discarded during the Surge Step for an ability. Cards played to a player's side of a City boost their Strength in that City.<br/><br/>PORTENT: The Active player will follow the abilities of any Units on their side of the Cities with the Glean Trait.<br/><br/>WAR: Any Sacked Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is Sacked if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).<br/><br/>OFFERING: The Active player can discard 1 card from their hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.<br/><br/>While this game reimplements Omen: A Reign of War, it is not compatible with any previous Omen: a Reign of War title or expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Federation Space&quot; is a strategic-level Science-Fiction board-wargame set in the Star Trek universe from the original TV series.  Players control an entire fleet of starships for one of eight different races of the Star Fleet universe in an attempt to destroy the fleets of their opponents.  In addition to a general melee or &quot;free for all&quot;, 26 different scenarios are provided that cover everything from a Klingon rebellion to the death of the Federation.<br/><br/>Tactical combat can be resolved using the simple system included or the more detailed Star Fleet Battles rules, if desired.  This gives players the ability quickly resolve those conflicts that are unimportant or heavily weighted towards one side, and use the detailed Star Fleet Battles rules for engagements that are pivotal or very closely matched.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s not an easy task when apart from submitting the acts of faith they must simultaneously carry out the perpetual fight against other cults and maintain maximum discretion around curious investigators and other organizations. Their activities focus on the constant quest for spreading influence as well as celebrating dark rituals which are meant to sow the seeds of insanity and uncertainty in people's minds so as to create the power ready for the advent of what is unnamed and lead to the collapse of the present system at the same time.<br/><br/>The main arena for the cult activities are cities on the board in which they seek to gain dominance by creating places of worship and celebration of the rituals, as well as challenging other cults into open confrontation which causes disorganization in their structures.<br/><br/>Cthulhu: Rise of the Cults is an area-control type of game with elements of deck-building in which every leader plans their commands for the turn in order to achieve their goals and destroy their enemies. The leaders have at their disposal their own pile of cards (Cult cards) which reflects the abilities and the potential of their cults. Over the course of the game, each player tries to augment their capabilities by obtaining useful cards in particular cities that will efficiently help them carry out the rituals to sow terror among the residents and hold their own against other leaders.<br/><br/>Custom-made followers' dice are an element that brings uncertainty and fragility into the game. Players roll them at the beginning of the recruitment phase each turn to gain a temporary group of believers who will support the leaders' planned actions.<br/><br/>If you hunger for forbidden knowledge, try and join these ranks; perhaps you will meet your worst nightmares...<br/><br/>",

Voil&agrave;! is a fast-paced dexterity and push-your-luck type of game that will challenge your agility and finger swiftness.<br/><br/>In Voil&agrave;! each player tries to get as many points as possible by completing various dexterity tasks. In a turn the player pulls out a token from the bag, which defines how many tasks the player has to complete (either none, one or two). However, for a turn player has limited amount of time, which is kept hidden from him by another player.<br/><br/>After pulling out a token the player draws the corresponding amount of cards and tries to complete the tasks depicted of them. There are many different tasks, for example, throwing the token in the air and catching it, or creating a tower from acrobats and so on. After player has completed the task(s) he can either end the turn and thus get the points, or try to get more points by pulling out a new token and then completing the tasks. However, if the player chooses to continue, he must complete the task before he can end the turn and this is the risk - if the time runs out while he is still performing the task, the turn ends immediately and the player doesn't receive any points this turn (any cards the player completed during this turn are put in the discard pile).<br/><br/>The game ends after each player has had three turns and the winner is the one with most total points on his cards.<br/><br/>",

Convoys and the bombing and invasion of Malta are brought into the Advanced Games.<br/><br/>The counter mix includes German, Italian and Allied forces: Armor, Motorized/Mechanized/Foot Infantry, Air Units, Fortifications, Merchant Ships and Escorts, Generals O'Connor, Montgomery and Rommel and the SAS/LRDG.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Cold War Battles game system is a grand tactical simulation of battles that were fought&mdash;or could have been fought&mdash;during the Cold War. The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated or could have participated.<br/><br/>Two games included in this issue are: BUDAPEST 1956, covering the ill-fated rebellion in the Hungarian capital in late 1956; and BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA, the clashes between Cuban and South African mechanized forces in Angola in 1987 and 1988.<br/><br/>There are two players in each game. In BUDAPEST 1956 one player controls the Hungarian Rebels and possible NATO &quot;what-if&quot; reinforcements, the other controls the forces of the Warsaw Pact. In BLITZKRIEG ANGOLA one player controls the South Africans and their UNITA allies, the other the Cuban and MPLA forces.<br/><br/>In the Budapest game each hexagon on the map represents half a kilometer across, and each game turn represents one day. Soviet maneuver units are mostly battalions, with regiments for their artillery and assault guns; Hungarian rebel units are ad hoc groups; and NATO intervention, when playing that special alternative history scenario, are represented by US &quot;Pentomic&quot; battlegroups.<br/><br/>In the Angola game each hexagon on the map represents eight kilometers across, while each turn represents anywhere from one week of intensive combat to four weeks of refitting. Units on both sides are mainly battalions or equivalent groups of irregulars.<br/><br/>The game system is low-complexity (totaling about 13,000 words) and compares to the one used in last year's Middle East Battles: Suez '56 &amp; El Arish '67. There are 280 NATO-style (with some iconic) half-inch counters. Playing time between two experienced opponents of roughly equal skill levels will be about three hours per game. Designed by Joseph Miranda.<br/><br/>Cold War Battles: Budapest '56 &amp; Angola '87 was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #235.<br/><br/>",

A few of you have made it to a shelter deep underground. However the lights have gone out, leaving you in the dark with limited resources. You do not know how long you have to stay down here before it is safe to go outside. How many of you will survive and will you be among them? Will you work together?<br/><br/>At the end of each turn players vote whether to open the bunker doors. If they do and it is peaceful outside they win the game. Otherwise they get hurt and must continue the game. Every surviving critter wins the game. It may or may not be in your interest to work together, you do not need the other critters to survive in order to win.<br/><br/>All Item Cards are kept face down. During your turn you take one to three actions. If you turn a card face up as part of an action you must use it regardless of its effects. There is also a limited supply of light sources you can look at some cards. You may share this information or you may even try to trick the others. Handy label cards help keep the memory aspect to a bare minimum, but still allow for backstabbing or cooperation.<br/><br/>You gain a starvation condition for almost every action and can also gain other conditions during gameplay. At the end of your turn must draw and apply a random card from your hand of conditions. This card is applied as damage if it is a bad condition. So if you do not discard starvation conditions by eating you will starve.<br/><br/>",

The path connecting the two sides of the board must be continuous along the surfaces of the same colour; however, the path can travel along the exposed top or any exposed side of a tile. This means that blocking your opponent is harder than you think!<br/><br/>Flink is somehow reminiscent of Stefan K&ouml;gl&rsquo;s Caminos (2010), which in turn resembles Cameron Browne&rsquo;s Druid (2004), on which Flink was inspired. Flink distils the mechanism to use a single piece shape, and introduces the innovation of the connecting path being traced like an insect walking along the tops and sides of the pieces to get to the other side. Of course, all of these games (and numerous others) owe their existence to the original connection game: Hex (AKA CON-TAC-TIX, Piet Hein, 1942).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cycling Party is a game for 2 to 6 players, which reflects the essential features of road cycling. Each player will select a cycling team and take responsibility for managing the movements of 5-6 riders in their team. The aim of each team will be to secure victory at the end of each stage or in the general classification.<br/><br/>The course is built from hexagonal tiles.  Each hexagon tile is divided in turn into three spaces, with each space representing a kilometre of the race. Mountain sections, intermediate sprints and the finish line are shown using indicator tokens placed at the kilometre points agreed upon by the players at the beginning of the race.<br/><br/>This game comes in three versions: Junior, Senior and Master.  Each version builds on the rules of previous versions.   In the Junior version each rider is moved by rolling two six-sided dice.  Riders in a peloton (at least five riders in the same space) may choose not to roll and instead move five spaces.  A rider in the peloton may choose to roll in the hope of raising its pace or of breaking away (roll of 10-12).  The difficulty of the mountain sections is represented by rolling just one dice.  Each team has five water bottles that can be spent to move a rider an extra space (cost of one bottle on the flat, 2 bottles in mountains).  The rider furthest across the finish line at the end of a turn is the winner.<br/><br/>The Senior version introduces different categories of climb and gives each team member a role (climber, sprinter, rouleur, domestique (flat or mountain), and lantern rouge).  Each role has particular abilities.  Each team may launch one attack by rolling four dice instead of the normal two.  Falls, fast descents and falling back to join a team-mate are also represented.<br/><br/>The Master version makes use of software accessed through the publisher&rsquo;s website to enable whole tours to be run.<br/><br/>",

There are thousands of games - virtual spaces, in which people willingly spend time... or their entire life. A shadow looms over this digital utopia in the form of hacker attacks. The only ones able to defend the sensory worlds are Gamedecs: hardboiled private detectives specializing in the mysteries of the virtual worlds. Become one of them and investigate cases in sensory worlds, gather clues and equipment, conduct corporate investigations and cross them or cooperate with them. Watch out though - your reputation is your ticket to better jobs. But beware - every passing second leads closer to a total crash of the virtual net.<br/><br/>Gamedec is an adventure game themed around Martin Ann's &quot;Gamedec&quot; novels. Players try to solve cases connected to the global hacker attacks. Each player choose one from 10 available game-detectives and, during the course of the game, upgrade his/her character by collecting equipment cards, acquiring skills (which helps solving cases) and improving reputation (which provides more case-cards). The game ends either when one of the characters collects enough clues to stop the hackers, or when the Net is too damaged and need to be shut down (all players lose).<br/><br/>",

When everyone is finished, pass the sheets left again, then choose a question that hasn't already been answered for the sheet you were just handed, and write down an answer to a new question. Continue doing this until you fill in one answer on each person's sheet.<br/><br/>Players then take turns reading aloud the answers to the questions for the target player whose sheet they hold. The target player then selects their favorite answer and guesses who wrote it.  The player who wrote the favorite answer scores a point.  If the target player was correct in their guess, they also receive a point.<br/><br/>Play a predetermined number of rounds, then throw all the scores away because you're mad at all the other players.<br/><br/>",

Interview the sheep treating them with vegetables they like, obtain crucial information about judges and sheep participants using special translation device, identify accomplices, and deduce the identity of the thief! If you manage to find the culprit in time, you all win. However, if the wolf with the missing note reaches the train station and leaves the valley, you all lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is based on the Grimm Fairy Tales and the artwork of Arthur Rackham.<br/><br/>The game has two types of cards, Prize Cards and Bidding Cards. Both the Prize Cards and Bidding Cards have powers and combinations that cause players to rework and execute evolving strategies throughout the game.<br/><br/>The Prize Cards are captured in a series of four bidding rounds and have different values (Victory Points) which are triggered by the types of cards each player captures. A summary of their follows are as follows:<br/><br/>     A Prince and A Princess are worth (0) alone and (12) a piece when paired,<br/>     The Angel Mother can turn the Maiden card into a princess,<br/>     The Maiden has a value of nine (9) on her own,<br/>     The Witch is worth negative thirteen (-13) alone and positive thirteen (+13) if combined with both Hansel and Gretel,<br/>     Gold cards are worth one (1) on their own and are worth two (2) when collected with the Dragon,<br/>     Rumpelstiltskin can also turn any card into a Gold card, and<br/>     Dwarf cards increase exponentially when the player collects <br/><br/><br/>more Dwarf cards. One card is worth one (1) point to the player, two cards are worth four (4) points to the player, up to seven cards are worth forty-nine (49) points to the player.<br/><br/>The Bidding Cards are from 0 - 7 and are used to capture the Prize Cards. The bidding tactics each player employs are based on how others bid and capture cards, a player's individual Prize Card strategy, and each player's reading of their opponents. A few Bidding Cards have special rules:<br/><br/>     0/8 Dove&mdash;usually acts a zero (0), the lowest bidding card, but when a step-sister card is played&mdash;it becomes an eight (8), the highest card.<br/>     1 Goose&mdash;when three or four players are playing, if two (2) goose cards are played, the fox card becomes worth zero (0).<br/>     3 Cat &amp; Mouse&mdash;can only be used once per game (rather than once per round as the others). This card is bid face up and then the Cat &amp; Mouse bidder(s) bids one more card face down before the other bidding cards are turned face up.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Coral Islands is the 2-in-1 game featuring 2 competitive games utilising dice stacking as the prominent mechanic. Players are tasked with conservation efforts to repopulate coral as well as redevelop islands to make them conducive to animal life.<br/><br/>&quot;Coral,&quot; designed by Richard Maass, sees players repopulate a shared coral reef using colourful translucent dice. Players take turns stacking dice on the board aiming to score points by completing structure cards that involve both their own dice and opponents' dice. In addition, players earn tokens representing the fish that live in the reef, which allow them to manipulate their dice or even place two dice on the same turn, generating engaging tactical and strategic tradeoffs between pursuing low-scoring easy-to-complete structure or high-scoring complex structures more likely to get blocked by an opponent, and also between earning points now or focusing on fish tokens to gain flexibility later. Sparking players to think in 3 dimensions, Coral creates a gameplay experience that feels fresh and unique. The player who earns the most points by completing structures before placing all 16 of their dice (12 in a 4-player game) is the winner!<br/><br/>&quot;Islands,&quot; designed by Rohan Dargad, asks players to move around archipelago islands from sea-level heights to mountainous terrain in a concerted effort to reclaim lost land caused by rising sea levels. Players thus take the roles of conservation charities. The different coloured dice represent different geology of the islands. Each round 3 land cards are dealt which gives the active player the opportunity to move around an archipelago segment. These are overseen by conservation specialists which are asymmetric rule changes when a stack of cards is taken. Players then take and keep one of the cards from the stack to indicate their geological specialism - and move one of the dice on the archipelago a number of times based on the height of the stack of cards. Dice are continually moved around in this way , until the end of the game where players with the highest specialisms claim the most mountainous lands to score prestige points. The player with the highest prestige wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Genesia is a quick-playing game of placement and civilization that includes a card-drafting system and a lot of interaction between players.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game is played over three ages, which roughly correspond to ancient times, medieval times, and the modern era. At the start of each age, players receive six cards from that age, then draft a hand of five cards for use in the current age. Each age has four phases &mdash; growth, expansion, attack, end &mdash; and the cards include icons that show when they can be played and when their powers take effect. You also receive 15 coins at the start of an age. Within each phase, players take all the actions they want in player order, eventually passing, and once all players have passed, the next phase begins. At any time during your turn, you can discard a card from your hand and take 4 coins from the reserve. The phases are:<br/><br/>&bull; Growth: Play cards that show this phase's icon (paying their cost, if required) and recruit as many clans as you wish, paying 2 coins for each and placing it in your homeland or (in later ages) in one of your cities. Each player has their own game board, with all player boards surrounding a shared &quot;Genesia&quot; board.<br/><br/>&bull; Expansion: As before, play cards with the proper icon, recruit clans for 2 coins each, or move your clans as much as you wish, paying 1 coin for each space than an individual clan moves (although in age III you can move a stack of clan tokens for 1 coin per space); when moving, you can pass through occupied regions, paying that player an additional toll of 1 coin, but you cannot stop on those regions, except for a player's homeland, which can house any number of clans from any number of players.<br/><br/>&bull; Attack: Simultaneously reveal your war/peace token with all other players. If everyone has chosen peace, this phase ends; otherwise, each player who has chosen war performs exactly one attack, choosing a region that contains your clans and an adjacent region controlled by an opponent that contains fewer clans. Choose a number from 1 up to the number of clans in your attacking region, then remove that many clans from each region. If the defending region has a city and no more clans, you can remove one of your clans to besiege the city and replace it with one of your own. If the opponent has now been removed from that region, you can move any number of clans from the attacking region to this space.<br/><br/>Once each &quot;war&quot; player has attacked once, players once again simultaneously reveal their war/peace token, repeating the process above until all players reveal peace.<br/><br/>&bull; End: If you have at least two clans in a region without a city, you now place one of your cities in that region. Then you play any cards you wish with an &quot;End of Age&quot; icon, discarding all other cards for 4 coins each. Score progress points for this round's &quot;End of Age&quot; cards as well as all invention cards you've played to date.<br/><br/>After three ages, you sum progress points, score 2 points for each region on a foreign continent you occupy, score points for every region you occupy (1-15, with the central Genesia regions being most valuable), and score points if you achieved your secret objective. Whoever scored the most total points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Congratulations, you&rsquo;re about to buy your own house! However, buying a house requires money. And lots of it. In order to lay claim on the piece of real estate of your choosing, you&rsquo;re going to participate in an auction. But the market for real estate is tricky. Before you know it, some sneaky bastard walks away with your money. Or, as you&rsquo;re strapped for cash, would YOU rather be that sneaky bastard?<br/><br/>Sneaky Bastard is an auction game with a twist. Whoever gets hold of the most expensive houses wins the game. You&rsquo;re not only placing bids on the real estate, but also on the bids themselves with the aid of Sneaky Bastard-cards, in order to gain more financial means. In this way, the game plays like an auction-within-an-auction.<br/><br/>Sneaky Bastard is a fast-paced game that revolves around strategy, tactics and interaction. By carefully considering when to play a Sneaky Bastard, you&rsquo;ll be able to gather the financials means to place bids in the later rounds. You&rsquo;ll need the best real estate in order to win Sneaky Bastard, but you&rsquo;ll also use houses as an alternative for money cards during later auctions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Patrons are placed and move through the park based on ride exits, and each patron generates money for the different ride owners. Using the unique abilities of rides and park improvements, players move patrons, block exits, and most importantly, add danger in the form of vomit, pests, flooding, electrical failure, and more in order to influence die rolls. High rolls show satisfaction and keep patrons on rides. Low rolls create additional danger and force patrons out to other rides. Additionally, insurance policies can be taken to benefit from certain poor outcomes, encouraging direct sabotage for profit. When the park finally closes due to poor quality, rides closing, or patron injury, the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>Take the biggest risk, snatch the biggest reward, and get away with it in Danger Park!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Gesundheit und Ern&auml;hrung &quot; contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely.

        "description": "Interceptor Ace, Volume 2: Last Days of the Luftwaffe, 1944-1945, designed by Fernando Sola Ramos, is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a German day fighter during the last days of World War II. This is the sequel to the popular, action-packed Interceptor Ace 1943-44, designed by Gregory M. Smith, and picks up the action where Interceptor Ace 1943-44 left off. Each turn consists of several days, during which a combat mission will be flown from one of many bases in Europe, attempting to intercept incoming American Bombers and defend from their escorts. There is a strong narrative around the pilot, as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion and receive awards.<br/><br/>Interceptor Ace, Volume 2: Last Days fo the Luftwaffe, 1944-45 not only is a standalone game, but fans of Interceptor Ace 1943-44 will enjoy having the capability to easily combine both games to span all the career of a German pilot from 1943 until 1945.<br/>While the objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a German interceptor pilot and rack up kills, players will find it extremely challenging to survive the entire war, and will experience the brutal nature of the air war over Germany in 1944-45. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request a transfer to other fighter bases in an attempt to get &ldquo;closer to the action, request a newer type of fighter or even become an elite jet fighter pilot. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player&rsquo;s eventual goal &ndash; to become one of the Top Guns of the Luftwaffe and survive the war.<br/><br/>The system is packed with rich technical detail but without the complexity to capture the key historical facets of the day bombing campaign over Germany. In terms of fighters alone, there are 38 aircraft models available to pilot. The families of fighters include:<br/>&bull; Bf 109 (19 aircraft)<br/>&bull; Bf 110 (2 aircraft)<br/>&bull; Me 410 (1 aircraft)<br/>&bull; Ju 88 (1 aircraft)<br/>&bull; FW 190 (9 aircraft)<br/>&bull; Me 163 (1 aircraft)<br/>&bull; Me 262 (2 aircraft)<br/>&bull; Do 335 (1 aircraft)<br/>&bull; He 162 (1 aircraft)<br/>&bull; Go 229 (1 aircraft)<br/>For each interceptor, you will be using the date of availability, speed, area of operations based on originating base, individual weapon systems, damage, and crew status.<br/><br/>Fighters can be assigned to one of eight possible major geographic base &ldquo;groups&rdquo; as follows:<br/>&bull; Dutch: Deelen, Volkel, Woensdrecht, Schiphol, Venlo<br/>&bull; Bremen: Husum, Jever, Oldenburg, Schwerin-Gorries, Stade, Salzwedel, Nordholz, Westerland, Langenhagen, Fassberg, Wunstorf, Hildesheim<br/>&bull; French: Beaumont-le-Roger, Poix-Nord, Vannes, Tille, St. Trond<br/>&bull; Ruhr: Monchen-Gladbach, Kirchhellen, Krefeld, Dusseldorf, Bonn<br/>&bull; Munich: Neubiberg, Lechfeld, Ingosltadt<br/>&bull; Munster: Rheine, Handorf<br/>&bull; Frankfurt: K&ouml;nigsberg, Wiesbaden, Frankfurt, Trier, Ansbach<br/>&bull; Berlin: Brandis, Brandenburg-Briest, Rechlin, Parchim, Oranienburg<br/><br/>Besides the focus on hardware, the soft aspects of the war are also faithfully rendered for each pilot and crew. For example, air crew is characterized by various parameters, including numerous Pilot skills, Wingman skills, Bordschuetze (Rear Gunner) skills, and Prestige Level. The emphasis on various skills and benefits to gaining experience creates a strong narrative, in the same fashion as in Interceptor Ace 1943-44, which helps weave a tense and dramatic narrative during play. One major change in Interceptor Ace, Volume 2: Last Days of the Luftwaffe, 1944-1945 over Interceptor Ace 1943-44 is that enemy fighter kills are now accounted for final victory, making dogfighting skills particularly important. As in InterceptorAce 1943-44, you have the ability to to choose your crew improvements instead of randomly rolling for them. As these greatly impact on your combat capability (and survival), it is a major decision you must make. Another major characteristic in the system is the wingman concept, who can possibly pull you out of a bad situation if he is still flying.<br/><br/>Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot and crew along with your fighter assignment, play proceeds by checking for base weather and incoming raid information prior to take off. Following successful take off, play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the Americans, trying to avoid marauding Allied fighters while doing so. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a new fighter, or request a change of base.

Do you have what it takes to be a famous race car driver? Find out today with Famous 500 - the World's Smallest Car Racing Game!<br/><br/><br/>Famous 500 is a fun, fast-playing car racing simulation. The game focuses on managing the wear and tear on your vehicle, which you customize at the beginning of the game. For each hairpin, gentle curve, and straightaway on the track, players play a speed card, attempting to be the fastest car through that section. Higher speeds and more dangerous sections of track, however, will increase the wear and tear on your tires, fuel, and engine. Drop below zero in any of these and you&rsquo;ll blow a tire, run out of fuel, or burst into a ball of flame. The player who crosses the finish line with the most speed points is declared the winner. Famous 500 is the third game in Famous Games Company&rsquo;s line of World’s Smallest Sports Games and has earned a reputation as the most strategic and cutthroat title in the series.<br/><br/>",

Each side has some HQ actions they may use to increase their options to achieve victory.

        "description": "As the Second World War raged across Europe, tensions brewed within the seemingly monolithic German war machine. Hitler, like dictators before him, had given his minions overlapping responsibility, so that they would plot against each other and keep him the arbiter. Germany&rsquo;s military leadership worked well enough as Germany&rsquo;s armies advanced in conquest after conquest. But Hitler's no retreat order in the difficult winter of 1941-1942 was a turning point in the way the war was run. All decisions now had to be approved from the top&mdash;a flagrant reversal of the German military tradition of setting objectives and giving subordinates freedom in how to attain them. As victory in the battle for Europe eluded the German generals and final defeat loomed, their competing agendas came ever more to the fore. Contravening their overseer, military leaders looked to a settlement with the Allies and, in a few cases, the end of the regime.<br/><br/>The Other Side of the Hill is a boardgame that simulates the effects that this struggle for power within the German High Command had on the development of the Second World War. Up to four players represent military leaders cooperating and competing as they manage Germany's wartime strategy. To win, they must vie for Prestige by advancing the careers of their favored Army and Army Group commanders, grabbing their share of victories while the early-war pickings are easy, then avoiding responsibility for battlefield disasters as the Soviets and the Western Allies solidify and push back.<br/><br/>Players will pursue hidden objectives to dominate the German Officer Corps on behalf of Interest Groups such as the technically-minded Professionals, a traditionalist Old Guard, or anti-Nazi Dissidents&mdash;all while Allied aircraft bombard Germany&rsquo;s war industry and Allied armies press in on every front. As in history, players must reconcile contradictory roles. The German General Staff&rsquo;s job is to hold the Allies off, but each clique&rsquo;s priorities can subvert any collective strategy. And beware: a player may in secret be sabotaging the war effort!<br/><br/>The Other Side of the Hill offers competition for two, three, or four players as well as fully cooperative, semi-cooperative, and solitaire modes. Playing cards include intriguing historical details on World War Two&rsquo;s real-life German Generals, strategic Directives, wartime Events, and personalities of the &ldquo;Black Orchestra&rdquo; plot to assassinate Hitler.

        "description": "In Alchemidus, players try to extract gold by manipulating alchemic formulas drawn from 15 pages of a book of magic. By modifying dice rolls, players puzzle out which processes produce gold. Whoever can get the most gold at the least cost is the winner.<br/><br/>In more detail, Alchemidus is a speed puzzle, with players trying to be the fastest to find the cheapest way to convert clay to gold.<br/><br/>The game has four pairs of d6 dice, in gold, lead, clay and white to show the process. The 2 gold and clay dice, and 1 of the lead dice are rolled and placed on their respective marker cards. The players must figure how to progress from the two clay numbers, to the one lead number, and then back to the two gold numbers.<br/><br/>To do this, there are three rows of five cards dealt out from three small decks. One row has spells to remove a die, so you need that to go from clay to lead. Likewise, another row is spells to add a die, so you need that to go from lead to gold. The third row is to modify dice values. The spells are varied and often symmetrical, so you might have one spell saying &quot;If the total is &gt;=7, do...&quot; and another saying &quot;If the total is &lt;=7, do...&quot;, or a spell for odd numbered dice, and another for even numbers.<br/><br/>Each spell card has a number on it, the cost of using that spell. The numbers go from 0 to 5 with five cards being 10 and one being 20 (Get any value die). Players must read the spells and quickly figure out the lowest cost method of going from clay to gold. It should always be possible, the spells have sufficient variety and there's enough of them.<br/><br/>When one player declares a cost, the others have a little time to declare a lower cost. The player that proves the lowest formula wins the round.<br/><br/>The game is well made, the dice and card stock are good quality. The game comes with Japanese rules only but the spell cards are all in English mainly, with notes in Japanese. The spells are sufficiently obvious, gamers will not have trouble figuring them out.<br/><br/>",

Frenzied dashes down polished corridors with howling mobs of beasties in hot pursuit. A kicking and screaming Penny being carried off. Again. A desperate battle for time as the Professor prattles inanely, &quot;Maybe we can reason with them&quot;.<br/><br/>The mutants come in three flavors: normal, radio-active and leader. Map and set-up are randomized for re-playability (there are movable Wall counters). The game is played in 10 turns; victory for either side hinges on control of the Tech Room (where a gate to an unpolluted Earth-like planet has been opened, hopefully allowing the &quot;normies&quot; to escape the muties). Optional rules allow for hidden movement.<br/><br/>Includes 5-page rulebook, 25&quot; x 12&quot; board, 133 counters, reference card.<br/><br/>Also the title of a simplified version having the same title. Yaquinto shipped this version free with any order. The mutants, invade the college represented by 25 rooms. If the mutants reach the control room in 10 turns they win. An 11&quot; x 17&quot; sheet of light cardboard includes map, rules and counters.<br/><br/>",

The mahogany frame is shaken until the weighted pieces all fall into place.  The goals of the two included games are straightforward enough -- connect opposite sides of the board, or control the four center squares.  However, the pieces are something of a mystery.  Most will be blank side up at first, and it is only as they are overturned that you discover whether each moves one square at a time or an unlimited number (like a queen in Chess.)  In addition, there are certain special moves that can dramatically alter gameplay.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives a hand of ten monster cards (twelve with two players), then chooses three of these cards to place face down to form their &quot;back line&quot;. All of the other monsters form a face-up front line.<br/>    <br/>On a turn, a player chooses one of their face-up front line monsters, moves it to the center of the table, then triggers its power. As soon as each player has only three monsters in their front line, the round ends and players distribute coffee tokens. Whoever has the most monsters of a particular family, with back-line monsters counting double, earns coffee tokens equal to the number of monsters of this family in the center of the table.<br/>    <br/>After multiple rounds, whoever has collected the most coffee wins!<br/><br/>",

Whatever appeal a gold mine might have, though, the risks are plenty and the riches limited, and when you're working under a gaslight it's tough to distinguish riches from Ouro de Tolo (fools' gold).<br/><br/>Ouro de Tolo is a fast and tense game of risk management in which the players, acting as miners, try to secure the best hauls for themselves while keeping their &quot;colleagues&quot; at bay. Each turn a player has three choices:<br/><br/>&bull; Extract a nugget, i.e., pull a stone from the bag.<br/>&bull; Play a card that brings him advantages or causes problems for opponents.<br/>&bull; Leave the mine for that workday and cash in the stones collected that day.<br/><br/>If at any time a player has two &quot;fools' gold&quot; stones, he loses everything collected that round and sits out until everyone else finishes the round. Each turn spent inside the mine can harm your gains, yet how else but inside the mine can you gather as much gold as possible?<br/><br/>At the end of each workday, players sell their nuggets and earn money. The winner is the player who has the most money, with the game ending at the end of the round that any player reaches a certain threshold, with that value dependent on the number of players.<br/><br/>",

Once infected by the gold rush fever, everyone from experienced gold miners to hotel owners are grabbing a few sticks of dynamite and running to the ghost mine. They throw their dynamite sticks &mdash; BOOM, BANG!!! &mdash; into the mine every hour to blow the gold out of the mountain at any cost!<br/><br/>Don't wait, start collecting! But be careful! Anyone who comes across a bat, snake, rat or ghost amongst the gold nuggets needs to get to safety quickly. And there are all sorts of other dangers lurking in the Wild West: the tense atmosphere means you might be challenged to a duel. And if the sheriff has you in his sights there's no escaping...<br/><br/>Boom, Bang, Gold is an exciting game with plenty of action in which speed and a good eye are important. The person who manages to collect the most nuggets in their gold chest at the end of the day wins the fast-paced hunt for gold.<br/><br/>In more detail, to set up, place the gold mine, filled with face-down shuffled tiles, in the center of the table. Set the pocket watch to 1:00, then give each player one stick of dynamite, one shelf, and one character with a gold chest.<br/><br/>On a turn, everyone throws their dynamite sticks into the gold mine at the same time, then they all search (using only one hand) to remove face-up tiles from the mine and place the tiles on their personal shelf. If you spot a special tile with bat, rat, snake, or ghost, call &quot;Watch out!&quot; so that everyone else must place their hands on their head and call out &quot;Help!&quot; before continuing to play. When no more face-up tiles remain, the round ends.<br/><br/>Players can play action tiles to flip over extra tiles, throw an extra piece of dynamite, duel with another player, and more. After twelve rounds, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>",

The Wolf family, however, has become the best architects of all time. (They hate lousy houses!) The three little wolves now work for the Big Bad Pig to build all kinds of houses. Can you help the wolves build the highest house and find the best home for them?<br/><br/>Three Little Wolves is a family game in which each player needs to build three houses by playing cards from small numbers to large. The higher you build, the better the chance you can score points &mdash; but your fellow players might send their little wolves to live in your nice house for big points! Plans, disguises, and a pinch of luck in your hand are all you need to win the game!<br/><br/>In more detail, players take turns playing one card from hand to build one of the three houses &mdash; blue, green, and red &mdash; in front of themselves, then refill their hand to four cards. If the Big Bad Pig (BBP) is drawn, it rewards the tallest house at that moment, but if you can't keep the house tall enough at the end of the game, you will get punished. If you don't want to play a card, you can discard a card and send one of your three wolves to live in other players' houses for a chance to score points!<br/><br/>The third time the BBP rewards the tallest house triggers the end of the game. All players compare the height of their buildings, and the shortest of each color is knocked down by the BBP! Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Normandy Campaign is a two-player game on the fighting in Normandy which occurred after the Allied D-Day landings of June 6, 1944.  There are two identical maps, one for each player each hidden from the other.  Hexes are 10km, each turn 3 days, counters are from regiments to divisions.  Each turn consists of multiple movement and combat phases for each player.  Movement into enemy territory is done by stating the hex you wish to enter.  The opposing player must state if he has a unit in that hex, if not movement succeeds and may continue.  If so, an attack may take place if desired, and may involve multiple units on both sides with the attacker coming from one or more hexes.  Units are only revealed during combat.  Combat losses are in steps (7-8 becomes 5-8, then 3-8, then 1-8, then elim, etc) and determined by dice on a CRT.  Supply, fortifications and air power rules are included.  Victory is determined per scenario and is based on liberating cities or for exiting the west edge of the map.<br/><br/>This is in the same series with Operation Market Garden: Descent Into Hell<br/><br/>",

You then arm them to the teeth and give them skills.

First you roll for ranged attacks and compare rolls to your DF string.  Each roll that meets or exceeds a number of the string hits so it possible to score multiple hits with one combatant.  The defender then gets to fire back in the same manner.  After DF is resolved you go to Close Combat.  Close combat is handled much the same way except you also have a blocking string so it is possible to block hits.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made of the artwork on the cards.

Each player hops into the cockpit of their own starfighter and duels it out in a dog fight to prove who is the superior pilot. The game plays in multiple modes 1 vs 1, 3 player free-for-all, 2 vs 2, or a solo mode where a single starfighter attacks an orbital space station.<br/><br/>In the real-time phase all players roll and re-roll their command dice simultaneously, and assign them to the various functions of their starfighter.  When a player has fully charged systems and is ready to act they may end the real-time phase by hitting the big red button and yelling, &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; This means all players must cease rolling and allocating dice and move to the tactical phase.<br/><br/>In the tactical phase players then alternate activating the systems they have charged. This allows them to fire torpedoes or lasers at the enemy, manoeuvre around the map, adjust their shields, and other actions unique to their chosen starfighter.<br/><br/>Players must balance the pressure of real-time play while making good tactical and strategic decisions.  The game only ends when one starfighter is destroyed. The pilot that hits the finishing blow gets all the glory and is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the stunning Union defeat at Second Manassas, Robert E. Lee maneuvered his victorious Confederate Army across the Potomac River and into the state of Maryland. George B. McClellan was put back in command of Union forces, being tasked with repulsing the bold Rebel invasion of the North. The uncharacteristically sudden approach of Union troops put the Confederates on the defensive at South Mountain, a site that was considered perhaps the most rugged battlefield of the entire American Civil War (ACW). As the two sides engaged, much more was at stake other than just a victory or defeat; in addition to protecting their vital lines-of-communication, the Confederates had to keep the larger Union Army at bay so that Stonewall Jackson&rsquo;s Corps could force the surrender of more than 12,000 Federals under siege at nearby Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.<br/><br/>A Greater Victory is a Tactical level wargame covering the key encounter at South Mountain on September 14th, 1862. It has been designed to be an historical yet readily playable regimental-scaled simulation of the twin conflict at Fox&rsquo;s and Turner&rsquo;s Gap. With two smaller, quick-play scenarios plus a comprehensive scenario covering the full day of action, the design offers flexible and tense situations for both players (also excellent for solitaire play). The Order-of-Battle has been researched to account for items like Confederate stragglers, offering a fresh perspective on the battle.<br/><br/>This is the seventh release in Revolution Games&rsquo; popular Blinds Swords series which features a chit-pull system covering the most interesting and important engagements of the ACW. New features debuting here include Brigade Activation cards so that each side can more easily gauge the status of their formations, along with a customized Fog-of-War table assigned to each scenario for an enhanced historical narrative. The series rules have also been adjusted at certain junctions to better reflect the extreme harshness of the terrain that soldiers on both sides had to contend with.<br/><br/>More than just a prelude to the famous Battle of Antietam that was fought just three days later on September 17th, 1862, South Mountain set the stage for that epic engagement. Will Confederate General D. H. Hill be able to hold his scattered and understrength formations together until desperately needed reinforcements arrive, along with Generals Lee and Longstreet? Will Union Generals like Jacob Cox (see side-box image) and George Meade be able to coordinate their brigades into effective attacks, fighting the unforgiving terrain as much as their dreaded enemy? If the Confederates cannot hold, and part of their army is either captured or decisively routed at South Mountain, the subsequent results at Antietam could have been drastically altered, thus changing the course of history.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>352 5/8&quot; Counters<br/>22 x 34 inch Map<br/>Exclusive Rulebook<br/>Series Rulebook<br/>2 Event Description Cards<br/>2 Combat Results Table Cards<br/>1 General Records Track<br/>2 Player Reference Cards<br/>2 Brigade Activations Cards<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ctrl, players try to dominate a cube by crawling over it with their colored bricks, preferably covering other players' bricks along the way.<br/><br/>In more detail, you start with a 3&times;3&times;3 cube that has one block of each player color stuck into one of the cube's holes. (In a two-player game, each player controls two colors, but at the start of play they secretly choose one of those colors to be their scoring color, with the other color serving only as a blocking mechanism.) Each player has a matching colored flag that sticks out of their block.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player removes their flag from its current location, adds one cube of their color to the side of any of their blocks (where such a move can be made), then they &quot;grow&quot; their color by adding two blocks in a straight line from the block they just added, crawling around corners and covering other players' blocks if needed. To end your turn, plant your flag in one of your final blocks, ideally blocking where someone else might like to play while also preserving future ground in which you can play.<br/><br/>Once all the blocks have been placed, you calculate your score by looking at the structure from all four surrounding sides, as well as from the top, and counting each unblocked square of your color that is visible. Thus, if you plant a block high up on the cube, you can possibly score 5 points for it since it would be seen from all sides and the top. Climb high, and block others from blocking you!<br/><br/>",

It features a fluid, impulse-based turns, squad-level, and individual heroics, plus lots of armor and special rules to bring the fight for the southern steppes of Russia to life. German Landser, Mechanized, and Armored formations clash with Soviet Line, Guards, and NKVD Divisions. New units never before seen in the Lock 'n Load Tactical series are introduced. The German Pz IV F and G along with the Marder II and StuG IIIF join the battlefield as well as the Soviet Tachanka MG wagon, NKVD troops, and the IL2 Sturmovik. We also introduce a new leader type-the Incompetent Leader. The scenarios range from the city of Voronezh and through Rostov, as far south as the Caucasus Mountains. Into the footsteps of the Silk Road at Khulkhuta, up and into the outskirts of Stalingrad itself. <br/><br/><br/>The steppes of southern Russia await you!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Konflikt '47&quot; is set in a world very much like ours--that is, until 1943. With the development of atomic weapons, the world changed. The testing of a prototype nuclear device by the Manhattan Project opened a rift in the fabric of space. When the Fat Boy atomic bomb was dropped on Dresden in March 1944, it created a second rift. German scientists set to work studying it with far more speed than their U.S. counterparts. Both nations began to receive radio signals through the rifts, though often undecipherable. Soon it became apparent that these signals were messages from unknown originators wanting to help each nation's war efforts.<br/><br/>As the messages were pieced together, discoveries were made that allowed each nation to make huge leaps in industrial and scientific research. Despite repeated pleas and demands from their allies, both the United States and Germany were reluctant to share the messages coming through the rifts. Stalin then declared the United States an enemy in May 1944: the Soviet Union would end the war on its own.<br/><br/>It is against this backdrop that players find themselves. Using the incredibly popular Bolt Action rules, this rulebook offers everything required to build a force that incorporates the incredible weapons and technologies made possible by the rift signals, and to engage in tabletop battles for supremacy and survival. Fully compatible with existing Bolt Action material, Konflikt '47 takes the war to a completely new level.<br/><br/>",

One of the most enduring of English folklore is Robin Hood, legendary outlaw archer and champion of the common people.<br/><br/>Robin of Loxley, a nobleman by birth, returns home from the Crusades and finds his lands taken and people taxed by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his enforcer, the Black Knight.   Confronting the injustices and tyranny, he chooses to become an outlaw and leader of the common folks.  Robbing from the Sheriff and giving to the poor, he becomes a hero and legend as the contest between good and evil unfolds in the castles and villages of Nottingham and the deep woods of Sherwood Forest.<br/><br/>Robin Hood is our two-player game that brings all the action of Medieval England into play.  One side marshals the forces of the Sheriff of Nottingham led by the Black Knight.  He leads Knights, Normans, Pike men and archers.  The other side is Robin Hood and his band of merry men.  Each side has strengths and weakness.  These forces contest each other in a power struggle to gain the most gold to support their causes.<br/><br/>And gold can be gained or lost in many ways.<br/><br/>The game includes a unique blend of medieval military forces with Knights, pike men, archers and leaders engaged in movement and combat, while it has a role playing element depicted  by the characters such as Robin Hood, the Sheriff, Marian, etc.  The characters can do medieval movement and combat and much more.   They can be captured.  They can be rescued.  They can be executed.<br/><br/>A game you will want to play again and again!<br/><br/>",

To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.<br/><br/>The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!<br/><br/>High Above the Yucat&aacute;n jungle, February 29, 1952: With a vigorous jump, a blonde woman in her twenties leaves the small plane's cabin and plunges towards the jungle. When the craft explodes above her, she doesn't look surprised, but pleased. She laughs because she knows that she has won. The shiny object in her hand is proof of that. The air rushing past rips at her expedition clothes. She confidently pulls on her parachute&lsquo;s cord, and then, as she tries pulling it again and again, panic wells up in her chest with the realization that it will never open...<br/><br/>In 1952, a treasure hunt in the Yucat&aacute;n jungle goes horribly wrong when a young woman, equipped with a dysfunctional parachute, plummets to her certain death &ndash; unless the players use their time-traveling, event-altering abilities wisely, and find a way to both unravel the circumstances that led to the young woman&rsquo;s fate, and change it, in UNDO: Treasure Fever.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Released in Essen 2005.<br/><br/>Dschamal offers four variants on a simple game of feeling in a black sack for oddly shaped wooden pieces. Not gentle, relaxed feeling, oh no. This is dog eat dog, fight like animals feeling, as two players each thrust their hand into the sack to grab a piece before the other. The rules call it a duel, and a duel it is! As the crowd watches the very entertaining spectacle of people trying to feel a shape without looking in, pulling the bag back and forth, and trying not to pull out the wrong shape, or a black shape, or to grab the camel piece and slam it down shouting &quot;I'm the camel!&quot;, they get to decide if players have cheated or failed the task. It's a very aggressive but fun game. First player to seven pieces win.<br/><br/>The rules are suprisingly complex though, with several What If variants that you have to run through to understand all the possible outcomes. The other three games in the rules offer variants on what to do with the pieces, such as build a tower, but it's essentially still a duel. Along with Bausack and Bamboleo, Zoch seem to have cornered the market in oddly shaped wooden pieces. Dscahamal is nicely made and fun, but you may tire of it quickly, both physically and mentally.<br/><br/>",

Space Vermin From Beyond! takes place on Beyond III, a planet known for its frogs, bogs and fogs.<br/><br/>Easy, fast and rated PG-12, Space Vermin From Beyond! is the second game in Hermann Luttmann&rsquo;s extraterrestri-awesome Invaders from Dimension X! universe. Space Vermin From Beyond! equips you with; one map sheet (with two separate 12.5&rdquo; x 18.5&rdquo; color maps printed front and back), eighty-eight kick-a$$ counters, 2 separate Player&rsquo;s Aid cards and a 16 page booklet, including 12 pages of rules, two Battle scenarios and one Campaign scenario. It uses a chit pull system to generate Random Events and regulate the direction of the Vermite horde. This randomness enhance the alien theme and culture-shock for us Earthlings!<br/><br/>Battling these nasty varmints on Beyond III may take up to 2 hours (depending on the scenario chosen). But there ain&rsquo;t no &ldquo;high-noon&rdquo; in space, so you take your dang time. Bring a few D6, your spine, brains and guts to defeat these vile space insects and save the defenseless population of Beyond III from total extinction!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fast-paced family game by Reiner Knizia, set in Greg Stafford's world of Glorantha. Players are khans of different fantastical tribes on the Plains of Prax, each riding a unique animal that confers special abilities. Everyone attempts to amass the biggest herd, meanwhile fighting off enemy magic, stampedes and attempts by other players to steal their cows.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a Khan to play, and receives a set number of corral tiles (depending on the number of players in the game). Each Khan has a different special ability. For example, the Morokanth player gets one extra Corral tile, and the High Llama player can sneak one cow card into each of their corrals after the gate has been closed.<br/><br/>Players take turns to raid different locations, drawing cards from 10 different stacks. Each stack contains the cards, in random order: 1 x 100, 2 x 50 and 1 x 20 Cows, a Stampede card (discard highest value cow card), an Enemy Magic card (discard all cow cards), a Tribal Champion card (protects against Enemy Magic), and a Waha's Blessing card worth 20 cows, which a player can swap for another player's Cow card.<br/><br/>Each players' cow cards are placed face-up in front them as their herd. Instead of drawing, on their turn a player can corral their cows. Corralled cows are safe, but each corral can only be opened once in a game. Uncorraled cows count towards the final score at the end of the game, but remain at risk of Stampedes, Enemy Magic and Waha's Blessings. Because each player has a limited number of corrals, a key element of the game is deciding when to corral them. The player with the most cows&mdash;including those in corrals and in their herd&mdash;at the end of the game is the winner and acclaimed &quot;Khan of Khans&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Every game is different, and you'll want to play over and over again to try new ways of outsmarting your opponent. The game is expandable to large team or free-for-all games.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to uncover and attack your opponent&rsquo;s Crown Card with one of your own cards. Each player places 5 piles of 5 cards each face down in front of them. The crown card should be hidden on the bottom of one of the 5 piles. The rest of the cards may be arranged however you like, but choose carefully. A bad setup can quickly give your opponent the upper hand.<br/><br/>Game play: Players take turns attacking by selecting the top Card from one of their Piles and laying that Card face up in front of one of their opponent&rsquo;s Piles. The defending player must then reveal the top Card of the Pile that was attacked. The Card with the lowest number value loses and is discarded. The winning Card must be returned face down to the top of the original Pile it was drawn from. If the two Cards have the same number value, both Cards are discarded. Play continues until one of the players attacks their opponent&rsquo;s Crown Card, winning the game.<br/><br/>Special cards:<br/>Archer Card: If you attack with an Archer Card, it always wins. If your Archer Card is attacked, it always loses. Shield Card: Shield Cards cannot be used to attack. If your Shield Card is attacked, both your Shield Card and your opponent&rsquo;s attacking Card are discarded (except for Archer Cards - see Additional Rules. Crown Card: You can attack with your Crown Card. If you attack your opponent&rsquo;s Crown Card, you win. Otherwise, you lose the game<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battlefields of Olympus is a quick turn based strategy game with some hand management. The numerous tactical choices, combined with a limited military force and the unexpected appearance of Ares on the battlefield, give the game its strategic component. The relatively simple game mechanics make it easy to learn and play, even if you aren't a tactical genius.<br/><br/>Backstory<br/>&quot;In the kingdom of immortals, the restless gods decree that mortal man will fight one another to prove their loyalty. By order of Zeus, The war god Ares leaves his throne to inform man of this noble contest. To the victors go the spoils of war and eternal gratitude from the gods.<br/><br/>As the general of battle hardened archers, infantry, and other units, you have been commissioned by the high priests to lead your people to victory. When the sisters of fate look favorably upon you, your armies will find strategic advantage on the battlefield. Ambush, flank and surround your opponent's forces in an effort to gain the upper hand.  If the battle looks bleak, call on your mercenary forces to turn the tide.&quot;<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>The idea behind Battlefields of Olympus is to secure a number of Land Trophy cards through battle using Warrior cards and Action cards. The one with the most valuable lands by the end of the game is victor. Battlefields of Olympus is a tug of war, where each player must decide when to use his forces to fight and when it is better to retreat and gather strength for later battles.<br/><br/>There is also an element of press your luck as the appearance of Ares and the order that land turns up during the game is randomly predetermined. On the other hand, when there is a stack of face-up Land Trophy cards, strategic planning is paramount, as players must decide when it is better to concede a battle in favor of a more valuable Land Trophy card farther down in the stack.<br/><br/>Each player commands a legion of up to 4 Warrior cards, but there is often a reserve pile of Warrior cards to draw from at the end of battle. Players need to decide when it is better to keep more powerful Warriors in hand and when it is better to retire the weaker ones from their reserve pile. The limit of 4 Action cards in hand forces players to manage what actions they need most.<br/><br/>The optional fortify and sacrifice rules create more tension as players have additional tough decisions to make. Using the Fortify action will protect your land, but at the risk of temporarily weakening the size of your military force in hand. Do you sacrifice a piece of hard-fought land in favor of your opponent's more valuable property, or do you wait until a valuable Land Trophy card turns up on the land pile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Buraco (Burraco) is a Brazilian Canasta-like (Rummy) game for four players in fixed partnerships in which the aim is to lay down combinations in groups of cards of equal rank and suit sequences, there being a bonus for combinations of seven cards or more. Buraco is a variation of Canasta, originated in Uruguay and Argentina in the mid-1940s, with apparent characteristics of simplicity and implications that are often unforeseeable and absolutely involving. Its name derives from the Portuguese word &quot;buraco&quot; which means &ldquo;hole&rdquo;, applied to the minus score of any of the two partnerships.<br/><br/>Buraco is played with two 52-card decks of standard playing cards plus all four Jokers. Team members sit opposite each other, so that no team member is sitting next to their own teammate.<br/><br/>",

It was the beginning of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, one of the most brutal campaigns in the history of warfare. Four years later, the victorious Red Army has suffered a loss of seven million lives. <br/>The Barbarossa campaign included some of the greatest episodes in military history: the futile attack on Moscow in the winter of 1941-42, the siege of Stalingrad, the great Russian offensive beginning in 1944 that would lead the Red Army to the historic meeting with the Americans at the Elbe and on to victory in Berlin.<br/><br/>Barbarossa is not simply one game but it is composed of three different types of games.<br/>1) The Standard Games: There are four of these games. They depict specific situations of crucial parts of the war<br/>2)The Campaign Game: It combines the four afforementioned games and fill in the gaps so that the campaign can be played out in sequence<br/>3)The Variable situations: Several &quot;what if&quot; historical effects are examined when added to the above games.<br/><br/>The Game includes a 23&quot; by 29&quot; map sheet that portrays the area os the Soviet Union in which the operations took place.<br/>A hexagonal grid is superimposed upon the map to regularize the movement and the position of the playing pieces.<br/>The combat map is all inclusive with a Terrain Effects Chart (TEC) and Combat Results Table(CRT)<br/>There are two types of units each repressenting one of the opposing armies.Each piece is distinguished by type strenght nationality and mobolity.<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Each player moves his Units and executes attacks in turn.Players have as an objective to destroy the enemy units and gaining territory whilst minimizing friendly unit loses.<br/>The combat is resolved by comparing attack and defence strengths of adjacent opposing units and expressing the comparison as a simplified probability ratio(odds)<br/>After the defender has chosen which CRT table will be used a die is rolled and the outcome indicated by cross referencing the die roll result and the odds column is applied to the unit being attacked.<br/>Barbarossa is played in turns.<br/>Each Game-turn is composed of two player turns that are divided into three phases.<br/><br/>",

Be careful you don't end up in the shadow, and use the power of light to form complete RAINBOWS. Tactics, combination skills and a good memory are what it takes to win.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is...<br/>...to collect more cards than your opponent by playing your cards skilfully.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can play up to 3 cards in the common area, but you have to play at least 1 card. But:<br/><br/>- If you want to play more than 1 card, you must turn over any one of the cards already on the table. This means, cards are always turned over and played alternately. You cannot turn over or play two cards in a row.<br/><br/>- You can choose to play your cards &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;blind&quot;. <br/>Standard means you place the card with the side you can see facing up. <br/>Blind means you place the card with the back (that you haven't seen) facing up.<br/><br/>- Error! If you play or turn over a card in a colour that is already on display, you lose the round. Your opponent receives all the cards in the row.<br/><br/>- Shadow! If you play or turn over a card in black, you lose the round. Your opponent receives all the cards in the row.<br/><br/>- Rainbow! If you succeed in playing the 6th card of the row in a colour still missing from the rainbow, you have successfully formed a RAINBOW. As a reward, you receive all 6 cards.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when there are not enough cards in the deck for a player to bring their hand back up to 3 cards. The player who has collected the most cards in their personal pile wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge. To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.<br/><br/>from review by Nickjost:<br/>Play begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.<br/><br/>There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in &quot;transit&quot; are moved to &quot;orbit&quot;. Units in &quot;orbit&quot; can be deployed to the board.

        "description": "The great-grandfather of today's racing games, elements of Le Mans are clearly evident in games like Formula D&eacute;.  Le Mans offers the choice of twelve different car specifications that detail the number of spaces the car travels in each gear and which gears the cars can safely negotiate turns.  Also, the different car types have different braking characteristics.<br/><br/>The game includes two tracks printed on the same board, Monte Carlo and Le Mans.  Each track is only two lanes wide, and the spaces on the track are only a half-car-length, so a car takes up two spaces at once.<br/><br/>The cars move in order of track position. Each turn, a car may either remain in the same gear, shift up one gear, or shift down according to the car's specifications.  It must then move the exact number of spaces required by the particular model of car in the specified gear.<br/><br/>When cornering, if a car exceeds the gear specified for the particular model of car, it must &quot;take a chance.&quot;  The driver must roll the die to determine if the car safely cornered, spun out, crashed, or damaged the car such that a pit stop is required.  If a car spins out, a &quot;wet track&quot; marker is placed on the corner, subsequently requiring all cars to roll for a chance when going through it.<br/><br/>If a car is blocked and cannot move the entire number of spaces required (and the car has no more hard braking left and cannot down shift enough), the cars collide.  Collisions require that the involved cars make a pit stop for repairs.<br/><br/>Optional rules include guidelines for slipstreaming, over-revving to move an extra space, and details of team, solo, and timed play, and &quot;Le Mans-style&quot; starts.<br/><br/>The game is a revised version of Wright-Mudge Enterprises' Grand Prix: A Sports Car Racing Game.<br/><br/>",

When placing the card, at least one square must overlap an already placed card. All overlaps must be of the same color.  Additionally, will filling an empty area, colors must match adjacent colors.<br/>Next, each square that is overlapped has a token placed on it.  These represent points, but they don't belong to anyone yet.<br/>After tokens have been placed, players jump tokens to capture them for themself. Jumps can be in any direction, including diagonals.<br/>Finally, a player ends their turn by drawing a card.<br/><br/>The game ends either when a predetermined score has been reached, or the draw pile is empty.<br/><br/>",

It's a fast paced game for 2 players.<br/><br/>The game board is 5&times;5 square fields large.<br/><br/>Each player controls 6 playing pieces i.e. stones with the numbers 1 to 6 marked on them.<br/><br/>The stones of player 1 are set up in the six fields of the upper left corner of the board and those of player 2 in the six fields of the lower right corner of the board so they face each other diagonally.<br/><br/>During his turn a player rolls a die, if he still has the stone with the number corresponding to the rolled value on the board he must move this stone. If the corresponding stone was already removed from play (see below) the player may choose to either move the stone with the next higher or the next lower number.<br/><br/>In his move player 1 may move the stone one field to the right, downward or diagonally to the lower right. Respectively player 2 may move the stone one field to the left, upward or diagonally to the upper left.<br/><br/>If a player ends his move on a field occupied by another stone, be it one of the opponent or one of his own stones, then this stone is removed from play.<br/><br/>To win the game a player must occupy the corner field of the opponent with a playing piece.  A player loses if he has no more playing pieces left on the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the first half of the 20th century, the United States and the Japanese Empire constantly made plans for a naval war against the other rising power. Each believed that the U.S. Navy would fight its way across the Pacific Ocean, with important clashes taking places in island chains like the Marianas and the Carolines.<br/><br/>Pacific Crossroads is the new introductory boxed game for the Great War at Sea series. It's based on the actual plans of both the United States and Japan for naval conflict at the close of World War I and immediately afterwards. Players try to seize and hold bases to either enable or stop the American drive across the Pacific.<br/><br/>While the game is intended for new players, there's plenty here for old salts, too. New ships like the American 1910 battle cruiser design are present, as are the battle cruisers the Americans feared Japan would acquire from the Royal Navy. There's a lot of naval warfare in this small package, which also ushers in a new edition of the series rules.<br/><br/>The 22x17-inch operational map covers waters around the Mariana and Caroline Islands and the coast of northern New Guinea. Players maneuver their fleets on this map and search for one another with aircraft, submarines and surface ships. When contact is made, player moves to the tactical map.<br/><br/>The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.<br/><br/>",

As the heir to Prydon's northern highlands, the troubles of court are far away for you until the King has your father executed for a treason he didn't commit. Pledging to end his reign, you march to war. The other Lords of the land stand with the King for now; no matter, you will take their castles by force. The King has more men, more resources and more power, but you have friends at court, spies who can influence the King's military decisions. Perhaps that will be enough, if the flames of heaven will it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each year there are exactly enough resources to fulfill and the players have to decide which resources to claim for themselves.  It's a simultaneous selection of the resources, so you don't know what the others are choosing.  Sometimes you don't quite fill all your energy needs, so you have to buy resources from other players or the bank to cover.  Action and event cards modify the energy market from year to year, and clever play of these cards can turn the tide of the game.

The more items of the same type you have, the more VP you score, but you might risk losing them if someone trades cards of the same type before you do!<br/><br/>How to play<br/>The cards are shuffled and laid down in a pyramid containing 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 cards in each row.&nbsp;<br/><br/>On your turn, you take one of the two actions:<br/><br/>1. Take one row of cards into your hand, and refill the cards in the row.<br/><br/>(1) You can take the card(s) in the first row for free.<br/>(2) If you want to take cards from the lower row, you must put one card from your hand into each row you skipped.<br/>Example: You want the cards from the third row, you have to put one card each in the first and second rows. (Put down a total of two cards from your hand).<br/>(3) After taking the cards (and putting down cards if necessary), refill the row back to its initial number of cards (1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 cards).<br/><br/>2. Play cards from your hand to score victory points (VP)<br/><br/>(1) Play cards to score:<br/>- If you play 3/5/6 cards of the same type, you score 1, 2, or 3 VP, respectively.<br/>- You keep a number of played cards facedown in front of you as your VP and discard the others to the discard pile.<br/>- You may play as many sets of different types of cards as you want and score VP individually.<br/>Note: Santa cards are wild and can be used as any type of item card.<br/><br/>Example: Wendy played 3 Snowman cards for 1 VP and 5 Chrismas Tree cards for 2 VP, respectively. She kept 3 cards as her VP and discarded the other 5 cards.<br/><br/>(2) Force others to discard cards:<br/>- If any players have 2 or more cards the same type as what you have played, they have to discard half of the cards from their hand (rounded down).<br/>- For each card the other players have been forced to discard, you can draw one card from the draw pile as a reward.<br/><br/>Example (continued): Bob had 3 Snowman cards in hand and he discarded 1 of them. Poki had 4 Christmas Tree cards in hand and discarded 2 of them. Then, Wendy drew 3 cards from the draw pile as her reward.<br/><br/>When someone reaches a certain amount of VP, the game ends after all the other players take a final turn. Whoever has the most VP wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player takes two actions (possibly the same action twice) from this list of options:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a land tile adjacent to any existing tile.<br/>    Place a worker adjacent to any of your workers already on the game board.<br/>    Move one of your workers to an adjacent empty space.<br/>    Jump an opponent's worker and land on an empty space, removing that worker from play.<br/>    Remove two of your workers from the board to remove an opponent's worker from any space.<br/>    Remove two of your workers from the board to place one of your workers in any empty space.<br/>    Remove one of your tower layers from the board.<br/><br/><br/>If at any time during play you have a circle of six of your workers surrounding an empty space, place the first layer of one of your towers in that space. Your ring of workers must remain in place for two additional turns for the remaining two layers to be added to the tower; if your ring is disrupted, you can complete it later to continue the tower-building. If you completely surround an opponent's tower, you can remove the top level of that tower from the board.<br/><br/>In addition to building three complete towers, a player can also win by eliminating all of the opponent's workers from the game board.<br/><br/>",

They each choose two cards to set aside face down.<br/><br/>The lead player starts the first trick by laying down a single card, a pair of the same number, or two or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The next players in turn must play a higher matching combination of cards or pass, although a player who passes can re-enter the trick later. Once everyone passes, the player who won the trick leads again. (Note that all played cards stay in front of who played them.)<br/><br/>If a player lays down an 8, whether alone or in combination, everyone else must pass, then this player leads a new trick. If a player runs out of cards, they score points based on how many players still have cards in hand, and play continues until all but one player goes out.<br/><br/>The last player then takes over a player's seat: first in a two-player game, second in a three-player game, and first or second in a four-player game (with the third player then taking the other option). After moving to their new locations, players then take the eleven cards in front of them, discard two, then play the round again. If the player in the fourth seat can do better than fourth, they score points &mdash; lots of points if they come in first. Along the same lines, if the player in the first seat does poorly, they lose points.<br/><br/>If a player has set aside an 8 in their two cards, they can declare &quot;どんでん&quot; (donden = revolution) by revealing the card on their turn. Now 1s are the high cards and 15s the low ones for the remainder of the round.<br/><br/>Play multiple rounds until a player has reached the point threshold, which is based on the player count.<br/><br/>",

The purpose of this game is to achieve one of the multiple presented city planning cards. What you can do on your turn is simple: take a budget card or a construction card, or construct a building. You'll need cunning to figure out what to do, manage your money, read your opponent's plans, and get cards ahead of time. Also, even if the city plan is achieved, there is no peace of mind. Eventually you have to use up all the cards in your hand. Lean management makes the difference between victory and defeat.<br/><br/>Building cards have effects, which can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the situation. Let's create a bustling city by managing your hand and card effects well!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Farkle is a traditional push-your luck dice game similar to Dix Mille. Players roll six dice (or five, in some versions of the game), and remove any dice they want to use for points. They can stop, keeping the points, or re-roll the remaining dice.  Points are scored by specific numbers (e.g. 5 or 1) or sets of the same number. If all six dice are used points, they can be picked back up and the player can keep going.  The first player to 10,000 wins.<br/><br/>Originally Farkle was played with five dice. The game originated in the 1930s, (Hugo Kastner: Die gro&szlig;e Humboldt Enzyklop&auml;die der W&uuml;rfelspiele. Humboldt 2007, pp. 205-208) but has various joke origin stories, such as that the game was &quot;first played in Iceland by Sir Albert Farkle in the 14th century&quot; or &quot;derived from the Farkleberry tree, a small tree native to Texas. When the early settlers came to Texas, they discovered the Farkleberry would harden as they dried. The settlers carved these berries into the shape of dice so that they might play games.&quot;<br/><br/>Reiner Knizia describes the game as being identical to the French game Dix Mille, and notes that when played to half the target score it is known as Five Thousand. (Dice Games Properly Explained, 1999) The 1975 game Cosmic Wimpout uses similar dice and rules. In 1996, Charlie and Mary Potter published Farkel, a version of the game with a copyrighted scoring system, and lodged various trademarks.<br/><br/>",

But the place is already occupied by lost souls which have been in confrontation for ages. The Standish cannot escape from this haunted house and will be the collateral damage of the conflict.<br/><br/>In Phantom, the four areas of the house &ndash; Garden, Basement, Ground Floor and First Floor &ndash; are placed in a line, with the areas divided into two sides. Each player controls Ghosts in half of the house, and he must make Spectres, Souls and other Spirits appear in front of the different areas of the house in order to frighten the Occupants before the other player. Each turn, a player can play a card &ndash; Ghost or Place &ndash; in order to increase the Scare level of his corresponding apparition; each Place card must be played in front of its corresponding area(s); for example, the Attic must be played in the First Floor,while  the Stairs can be played either in the First Floor or in the Ground Floor. (Note: In Europe, the first floor is customarily the initial floor above ground level, while in the U.S. the floor at ground level is the first floor.)<br/><br/>The Ghost cards can be played in front of any areas. Each of them creates a special effect:<br/><br/><br/>    The Squatter takes a Place from the opponent's apparition.<br/>    The Charmer makes an Occupant come in the area.<br/>    The Howler puts Occupants off the area.<br/>    The Knocker discards a Ghost from the opponent's apparition.<br/>    The Queen takes a Ghost of his family from the opponent's apparitions.<br/>    The Invoker gets a Ghost back from the discard pile.<br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately for you, the adults of the family can kill off some vulnerable Ghosts, and a family of Ghosts is vulnerable to each of the adults. Some Places protect the Ghosts from the adults.<br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, the Scare level of the apparitions in the different areas are compared to the Fear threshold of any Occupants located there. When a player's Scare level is higher or equal to the Fear threshold of an Occupant who is alone in the corresponding area, this player takes this Occupant and wins the corresponding Victory points. After his turn, the player draws Ghost/Place cards until he has five cards in hand.<br/><br/>Each adult is worth 3 victory points (VPs), each child 2 VPs, the baby 4 VPs, and the Priest adds 1 VP to the last Occupant of the house. As soon as a player has collected 11 VPs, the game ends, with him as the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Excitement in the capital: Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu wants to assign the Han of Takamatsu in a challenge. The competing Daimyos direct their Samurai through the palace following some simple rules and quickly see that they can use the Samurai of the other Daimyos for their purposes. An exciting interwoven competition - with unexpected surpises.<br/><br/>Takamatsu is a game of conflict and cooperation, with players trying to place (or not place!) their samurai in their own rooms. The palace consists of two circular paths that merge at one point, then separate once again. Players have 5-7 samurai that are split between two color-coded rooms at the start of the game, and a row of scoring cards &mdash; some face-down &mdash; are laid out next to the board.<br/><br/>On a turn, you choose a room that contains at least one of your samurai, then you move some number of samurai in this room clockwise from this space. If the room contains only one samurai, you can move it one space; if it contains two, you can move both two spaces or only one a single space &mdash; but if an opposing samurai is with you, then you must move both exactly two spaces. When a room has three or more samurai, he must leave at least one behind (while still needing to bring at least one opposing samurai along, if any). When a samurai ends movement in a room of the same color, that samurai's daimyo collects the topmost scoring card, with multiple scorings being possible on a turn. For each open scoring card collected, the player immediately adjusts his scoring marker &mdash; which could move you back on the track, so sometimes you want to escort another samurai to his pad instead of bringing him to your place.<br/><br/>When one player reaches twenty points, players finish the round, then tally their hidden scoring cards, if any. The player with the most points wins! (With two players, each daimyo controls two colors of samurai and must move an opposing samurai when possible. After one pagoda reaches the twenty point threshold, the players sum their two scores to determine a winner.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Captain's Sea is a low-to-moderate complexity game for two players who take the roles as captains of the original American frigates (Chesapeake, Congress, Constellation, Constitution, President, and United States) or their opponents from the British or French navies during the turn of the 19th Century. All of the classic duels fought by these ships are represented in detail. Unlike other age of sail games that focus on fleet actions, Captain&rsquo;s Sea puts you on the deck of a single ship with the responsibility of leading her to victory. You must maneuver against the wind and your opponent to achieve optimum firepower, as well as manage your crew as they scramble to man the guns, work the rigging, and repair battle damage, all while being hammered by the burning shot and flying splinters caused by your enemy. Can you keep your crew in good order or will you be the first to strike the colors?<br/><br/>The action of the game is driven by control of the weather gauge. This is done in a unique fashion by moving ships relative to both the wind and each other, stressing the benefit of position. The ship with the better position has greater flexibility in maneuver as each player predetermines his ship&rsquo;s movement through a simple action selection process that does not require pencil and paper to track. Players must also allocate available crew points (a diminishing commodity as a ship takes damage) to man the guns, rigging, or other actions that the situation might mandate. A deck of action cards provides period flavor and swings of fortune. Throughout a turn, you as captain, are bombarded with difficult decisions that determine the fate of your ship.<br/><br/>Included with the game are ten scenarios, including such classic engagements as the Constellation vs. L&rsquo;Insurgete (9 February 1799), Constitution vs. Guerrier (19 August 1812), and Chesapeake vs. Shannon (1 June 1813). Even those ships that did not fight a major engagement get the opportunity to play out a historical opportunity missed. Additionally, players will find it easy to create hypothetical pairings to see what might happen.<br/><br/>",

But beware of broken plates, you might attract the attention of those clueless humans.<br/><br/>Collect sets or runs of a variety of foods to score points. It is the number on the plates in the group that scores and not the rank on any given dish. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re just here for the food!<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s always mealtime for these mischievous kittens! In this light strategy game, act as your favorite feline and snatch as much food as you can by pushing plates off the edge of the table. Food on the floor boosts your score!

This high energy fur ball can take down a pawful of Christmas tree ornaments in a single swipe. And be sure to guard your dinner plate, because if it&rsquo;s fish night, Snowball will jump, drag and devour the salmon before you can say &ldquo;Bad Kitty!&rdquo; Will his youthful exuberance ever let up? Only time will tell for this fiendish feline!<br/><br/>Fluffbucket <br/>Underneath all that fur is a well-muscled kitty ready to pounce. His favorite pastimes include batting at the window shades, chasing birds in the backyard, and hiding under furniture where he can easily attack an unsuspecting person&rsquo;s legs. One of his favorite foods is ice cream, but he is a bit of a snob and will only eat from a spoon.<br/> Cleo <br/>The cat of many colors! Nothing gets this gal going like the drip from a water faucet. She loves to squeeze her ample body into the sink, waiting as the anticipation builds. Then all of a sudden&hellip;drip! Cleo will try to catch the drip, eat the drip and stick her head into the faucet looking for the source of that crazy drop of water.<br/> Rusty <br/>Rusty is a handsome tabby with a knack for causing mischief. While he has all the cat toys his heart desires, his favorite toys are the ones from the trash can. This curious little kitty can&rsquo;t help but get himself into trouble. He&rsquo;s fallen out of every window in the house, been accidently locked in many a closet, and stolen countless snacks from his humans. Despite all his flaws, he&rsquo;s still a sweet little guy who&rsquo;s favorite thing is to cuddle with his best friend.<br/><br/>Lola <br/>Lola is a giant beast with a magnificent mane and enormous paws, but looks can be deceiving. Unaware of her regal appearance, she squeaks and leaps into your arms at the slightest frightening noise. Lola loves people, and refuses to eat her kibble until she&rsquo;s been given an approving pet. She is happy to plop down on top of whatever her humans are doing, just to make sure she is always the center of attention.<br/><br/>Flapjack <br/>Just about the time his humans are crawling into bed, Flapjack begins his evening prowl. Not content to walk along the floor, prowls begin with a leap from the couch to the fireplace mantle from there it is a small hop to the top of the flat screen TV, that he crosses with more grace than a tightrope walker. It is not until he is perched in the small gap above the kitchen cabinets that he assesses what to attack. Usually it is balled up socks, but he has been known to grab oranges and potatoes. Whatever his evening trophy is, he promptly tucks into bed with his humans.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eddie Robbins' 1834 is an 18xx game set in one of the earliest and most important locations in the development of railroads: Belgium &amp; Luxembourg. Providing service to Antwerp, linking international markets, fostering the steel industry in Luxembourg and obviating the Albert Canal are important features to this game. The late appearance of electrified railways has a big impact. For 3-5 players, one needs a copy of the Avalon Hill 1830 game to provide the trains and tiles, although 4 special tiles are provided with 1834. The player with the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the card game Jungle Brunch, everybody is very hungry, so what food can you ﬁnd for your animals? You need to ﬁnd the tastiest food, but watch out for dangerous predators that hope to eat you! Play your cards carefully, escape from the tigers, and keep an eye on the sky in case a vulture is watching you &ndash; after all, little animals make a great dessert!<br/><br/>Each player has an identical deck of 22 animal cards; at the start of the game, players shuffle their decks, then draw six cards as a starting hand. Someone shuffles the plant deck, then lays out plants until at least one (regular or famine) card is available for each type of plant and at least 3-7 plant cards are available (with the number depending on the number of players).<br/><br/>Each turn the starting player lays down two cards &ndash; one face-up and the other face-down &ndash; then each other player does the same. Players then reveal all their cards and work their way down the food chain: Bats attack herbivores, weakening them and making them eat more slowly; snakes scare away the strongest animal; elephants, tigers, buffaloes and monkeys then eat (one card) in order of their strength, from high to low; elephants eat nuts, or bananas if no nuts remain; tigers eat the highest-valued buffalo or monkey; buffaloes eat herbs, then bananas; monkeys eat anything but prefer bananas; warthogs eat last but consume two items; the animal young copy the animal they're played with and eat at the same time; vultures feed on buffaloes and monkeys that are forced to eat famine cards &ndash; or any such animal that fed. (They're not that choosey, really.) Animals can also be played in matching pairs, which prevents them from being eaten but restricts them to only one food card.<br/><br/>After the round ends, each player draws two more animal cards from his deck, the plant selection is replenished, then a new round begins, with the player who ate first in the previous round playing first now. As soon as players have only four cards in hand or the plant selection can't be refilled, the game ends, and the player with the most food points wins!<br/><br/>",

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals. There's lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in Welcome To...!<br/><br/>Welcome To... Mini is a smaller standalone version of Welcome To... that consists solely of six laminated sheets (10 cm x 10 cm), six mini-dry erase markers, and 55 cards; no rules are included in the box, and the publisher has stated that this version will be sold only as an add-on to the original Welcome To... game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The second game in the series that includes Imperator and Ultimus Romanorum: La Chute de Rome, Semper Victor offers a grand strategic view of the Fourth Century Roman Empire. The full campaign opens with the abdication of Emperor Diocletian (305 A.D.) and continues to the death of Julian the Apostate (in the 360's or 370's - the date is variable). Scenarios cover shorter periods, such as the fateful war between Constantine the Great and Licinius (313-324).<br/><br/>The map shows the Roman Empire in 305, divided into zones that, in turn, are grouped into 12 Dioceses, the Imperial administrative districts of that time. Surrounding the Empire are the zones of barbarian peoples and the rival Persian Empire. A turn is one year. Units have Points de Force (Strength Points) representing about 1,000 men each. Roman units come in three types: Ripenses, who cannot leave their home diocese, Pseudo-Comitatenses, whose ability to range far from home is limited, and Comitatenses, who can go anywhere in the Empire and beyond.<br/><br/>The opposing sides are unusual and may puzzle players who know little or nothing about this era. One player (dubbed &quot;Primus&quot;) represents the senior Emperor (&quot;Primus Augustus&quot;) and his allies, who may include another Augustus, one or two Caesars (junior Emperors), other Roman generals, and even non-Roman peoples. The other player (&quot;Secundus&quot;, misspelled &quot;Secondus&quot; in the rules) has his own set of Augusti, Caesars, generals and non-Romans. An important limitation is that each Augustus and Caesar must have a capital of his own, and only six capital cites are available at the beginning of the game. A seventh, Constantinople, may be constructed, though its advent is not a certainty. (Rome, by the way, is not one of the capitals; its political importance had long since faded.)<br/><br/>In the course of play, Primus and Secundus may swap positions as the result of either a successful usurpation plotted by the Secundus or the death of the Primus Augustus without an Augustus or Caesar to succeed him. In general, it is better to be Primus than Secundus, but it isn't impossible for a perpetual Secundus to win.<br/><br/>The Roman leaders are historical figures (38 in all), who enter the game at the same time as in actuality and run an increasing risk of death from natural causes if they aren't killed off sooner. Names are rendered in their French versions, e. g., &quot;Constance Chlore&quot; for Constantius Chlorus. A Leader is rated for &quot;Capacit&eacute; de Commandement&quot; (number of units he can command), &quot;Capacit&eacute; Politique&quot; (a variety of functions, such as determination of the initiative each turn), &quot;Valeur Strat&eacute;gique&quot; (ability to evade combat plus other functions) and &quot;Bonus Tactique&quot; (useful in battles). Many Leaders are also marked as Christian or Pagan, though religion has much less of an impact than it did in real life.<br/><br/>Very important to play are &quot;stratagems&quot;, which make it possible to embark on a usurpation against the other player, assassinate rival Leaders, spread plagues, trigger barbarian uprisings, pacify barbarians already at war with the Empire, inspire desertions from enemy ranks, and much else.<br/><br/>Turns have a variable number of movement/combat phases, determined by adding the valeurs strat&eacute;giques of the Primus Augustus and the highest rated Leader in the Secundus camp. The pace of the game thus depends on the quality of the current Leaders.<br/><br/>Movement and combat are straightforward. Leaders, accompanied by a number of units up to their capacit&eacute; de commandement, may move up to four zones, halting and fighting when they encounter enemies. Units without Leaders may move only one zone at a time. Battles are often bloody, but weakened or eliminated units quickly return  to full strength.<br/><br/>Players tally Victory Points at the end of each Turn. The list of achievements that garner VP's is long: victory in major battles (35 PF's or more engaged), control of Dioceses, defeat of non-Romans, presence of non-Roman troops in the other player's controlled territory, and so on.<br/><br/>Players must mount and cut the game's counters themselves, which is a non-trivial task. As a minor annoyance, the counters are a bit too big for the zones on the map. The rules are in French, though English translations are easy to find.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battleborn Legacy is a Fantasy themed board-wargame at the strategic level for 2-4 players that takes roughly 120 min to 180 min to play.  Players acquire resources necessary to build powerful armies, accomplish quests and discover rare magic as they attempt to earn enough victory points to win the game.<br/><br/>Put your skilled artisans to work to build a strong economy and then unleash legions led by powerful heroes to vanquish your foes.  Never underestimate roaming undead armies and always be on guard as the deadly dragon may strike at the most unfavorable time.<br/><br/>Players begin the game by choosing a hero and a race alliance.  This can be accomplished randomly, in turn order or by blind bid.  Once the selections are made, players will place their stronghold, hero and starting army on one of their race alliance territories, then in reverse order players will place their race lord on another alliance territory in a different province.<br/><br/>Player aid cards help players with their turn sequence, unit costs, casualty results and random events that may occur throughout the game.  Each players turn consists of the following sequence: A rune blessing that affects all players, players then purchase new units and structures and place them in a queue.  Each player then takes their turn moving units, initiating and resolving battles, deploying new units, collecting resources and updating their victory tracks.  All players may then heal heroes, repair damaged strongholds, draw new quests and resolve a cataclysmic event to end the turn.  There are 7 turns and if a player hasn't earned enough victory points through expansion, questing, killing other heroes or slaying the dragon the final cataclysm destroys the world and all players are defeated.<br/><br/>What really makes Battleborn Legacy stand out from other war games is a combination of features including the following:<br/><br/>1. Unique Battle boards for regiment and hero placement.  Color coded for easy unit placement, also coordinates with matching attack/defense dice.  <br/>2.  Heroes and units may become veterans through battles won.<br/>3. Random casualty chart that adds a real combat element to the game.<br/>4. Card draw that may change the outcome of key battles and events during the game.  These cards include powerful artifacts, unique hero abilities, magic weapons, quests and much more.<br/>5. Resource management system that evolves with game play.<br/>6. Random events such as dragon attacks, natural disasters and undead uprisings that may change players objectives and strategy throughout the game.<br/><br/>Battleborn Legacy is a must try for fantasy war game enthusiast that enjoy RPG elements, real strategy and where victory is decided by each player's tactical combat skill and cunning and not just the luck of the dice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #220.<br/><br/>Group of Soviet Forces Germany features a simulation of a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Germany in the late 1970's. It is a two-player alternative history game intended to examine what could've happened during the first month of fighting had the Soviets opted to invade Germany during the Cold War.  An assumption is made that the invasion would've been executed without lengthy preparation or forewarning.<br/><br/>This game is an update and revision of SPI's 1973 release, &quot;NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970s&quot;. Its time and space scales have been preserved, but the map has been improved by reflecting a more in depth terrain analysis. The system has been updated and the orders of battle are more fully developed. Air warfare has been added, at least as an abstract, and tactical nukes have been taken away except as possible game enders.<br/><br/>The orders of battle for both sides are based on open-source documents that have become available since the parent game was first published. The system, though more complex than that of the original game, still comes in toward the lower end of today's complexity scale. Experienced gamers can expect to be blasting away within 90 minutes or so of first opening the box.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are divisions, as are most NATO units, along with a few brigades and regiments. Each full game turn represents two days.<br/><br/>The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the western portion of Germany and its environs in the late 1970s. There are 280 unit counters in the game, most of which represent combat formations. Others are also provided as informational markers and memory aids.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each turn, players draft and place terrain tiles and monster tokens anywhere, even on their opponent's land! Their goal: to craft the map with the greatest Power and sabotage their rival at every turn to become the ultimate overboss!<br/><br/>Designed by Aaron Mesburne and using the same basic system as the hit game Overboss, this fast-paced game combines drafting, set collection, puzzly tile laying, and messing up plans. It's set in the retro-inspired pixel art world of Brotherwise Games' best-selling Boss Monster, with many of the same familiar characters.<br/><br/>Build your map by drafting Icy Peaks, Towns, Sunken Cities, Spawning Grounds, Roads, and Dungeon Entrances. Each terrain type has a different point value and unique ability. Some abilities even allow you to move tiles across the overworld, stealing from your opponents or giving them your unwanted tiles. Players must balance optimal placement, set values, and board space. You'll also need to manage monsters, which award points when grouped together or placed on matching terrain.<br/><br/>The game includes everything needed for a 2 player game: over 65 terrain tiles, over 80* monster and hero tokens, 1 double-sided 2-player board, a scorepad, and more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pastiche: The Birth of a Masterpiece &mdash; first released as ラミネートラミー (Laminate Rummy) &mdash; is a rummy card game in which players need to publish dissertations, then have their work peer-reviewed in order to score...although sometimes the peer will be yourself!<br/><br/>In the deck of 49 cards, the cards are in seven suits with one suit going from 1-7, the next 2-8, and so on up to the final suit of 7-13. The game also includes dissertation cards that show various combinations of cards: numerical straights of length 5, 7, 9, and 11; three pairs; four pairs; three- or five-of-a-kind; and so on, with multiple copies of some dissertations. Players are dealt 3-5 cards based on player order, with everyone then discarding down to three cards in hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, take one of three possible actions:<br/><br/>&bull; Research: Either draw two cards, add one to your hand, then discard the other; or add the top card of the discard pile to your hand.<br/>&bull; Present a dissertation: Take cards from your hand that satisfy the requirements of a dissertation, then place those cards on display in front of you, placing the dissertation on top. You can claim a specific dissertation at most once.<br/>&bull; Conduct a peer review: Select a published dissertation (from any player) that has two or more cards underneath it, then add one of the cards to your hand. If a dissertation has only one card underneath it, the paper has been accepted and (1) it is now worth points for its author and (2) it can be cited by future dissertations.<br/><br/>How do you cite an accepted dissertation? You present a new dissertation and pretend that the card under the accepted dissertation is one of the cards that you played; you can cite multiple cards in a dissertation, but you must play at least one card from your hand. For example, you can play two pairs of cards from your hand, say 3s and 8s, then &quot;cite&quot; a 6 from one of your accepted dissertations and a different 6 from another player's dissertation. You'd then claim the &quot;three pairs&quot; dissertation and place only the 3s and 8s underneath it. When you cite another player's dissertation, you must give them a card from your hand &mdash; ideally something useless! &mdash; as a thank you for their previous work.<br/><br/>Accepted dissertations are worth 1-9 points, and when a player has 15+ points, the end of the game is signaled. If this player has any cards in hand, they claim the &quot;end flag&quot; dissertation that's worth 1 point, then place one card from their hand underneath it. (If they have no cards, the game end is still triggered; they just miss out on the bonus point.) Continue play until each other player has completed two turns and the person who triggered the ending has completed one turn. The player with the most points from accepted dissertations wins; in the event of a tie, the tied player with the fewest accepted dissertations wins.<br/><br/>",

By the 10th edition, published in 1750, the book included chapters on Quadrille, Piquet, Chess and Back-Gammon. At least 20 different versions of Hoyle's have been published over the years, making it the best-selling series of books about games in history and giving rise to the popular phrase, according to Hoyle.<br/><br/>The title page of an edition published around 1900 reads as follows:<br/><br/>&quot;Hoyle's Games. America's Complete Hand-Book of Games, containing all the card games played in the United States, with their rules, regulations, technicalities, etc., adapted to the American mode of playing, from the text of Hoyle, and the best modern authorities. Also comprising Backgammon, Chess, Checkers, Billiards, Pool, Bagatelle, Bowls, etc., with numerous diagrams and engravings. Complete edition. Revised, corrected, and enlarged.&quot;<br/><br/>One confusing aspect about this book is that there is no trademark on the name Hoyle (just like there is no trademark on the name Webster's for dictionaries), so referring to a book as Hoyle's Games could refer to a number of different volumes.  The popular Hoyle's Games was first published in 1907, with at least ten editions published in the twentieth century.  Each edition added to, edited, and clarified what had been presented in the earlier edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "4th Street Software Pro Football is a dice, chart and card simulation of NFL football. The game combines detailed individualized players cards for every player position with specific offensive and defensive play calls to generate action.<br/><br/>Here is a brief description of play from the manufacturer's web-site:<br/><br/>First, let&rsquo;s set the scene. It&rsquo;s the first round of the playoffs, with Miami hosting New England. Miami&rsquo;s got the ball on the New England 37 yard line with 4:23 to go in the fourth quarter. They&rsquo;re down by a touchdown.<br/><br/>The Miami coach selects a passing play, &ldquo;F1 Cross&rdquo; (F1 is the flanker, and he&rsquo;s running a crossing pattern over the middle of the field).<br/><br/>The play card is essentially a 3&rdquo; x 5&rdquo; card filled with information about the ensuing play. The larger letters (s, T, G, C, Q, etc.) represent offensive players. The boxes and ovals represent defensive zones which may or may not be occupied by one or more defensive players. The lines represent the routes each of the offensive players takes after the snap. The red line represents the route taken by the intended receiver. Blue lines represent secondary receivers, while black lines represent the motion taken by blockers.<br/><br/>The smaller letters are the player ratings, which are followed by a number or range of numbers, which correspond to a 20-sided (d20) die.<br/><br/>So let&rsquo;s roll the dice and see what happens&hellip;<br/><br/>20 sided die = 2 <br/>12 sided die = 6<br/>2 six sided die roll = 1+3 = 4<br/><br/>The d20 roll (2) tells us what the matchup is. In this case, the left guard is matched up against the defender in the zone opposite him (in this case, the right defensive tackle).<br/><br/>Here are the two players involved on the play:<br/><br/>J. Buckley [G - Miami 97]<br/>Hen. Thomas [DT - New England 97]<br/><br/>The offensive player&rsquo;s &ldquo;D&rdquo; rating (pass blocking) is now compared to the &ldquo;B&rdquo; rating (pass rush) of the defensive player&rsquo;s. These two ratings are subtracted (6 &ndash; 4 = 2) and compared to the d10 (in this case, a 6 was rolled). Since 6 is larger than 2, the defensive player wins the matchup.<br/><br/>Now, the two d6 are added together (1 + 3 = 4). Since Thomas won the matchup, we look under his &ldquo;B&rdquo; column across from &ldquo;4&rdquo; and find the result code of &ldquo;47&rdquo;. This is a sack! (Result codes are listed on the field&hellip;there are approximately 90 of them.)<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s it! All other plays are completed in a similar fashion.<br/><br/>",

You're just an honest contractor trying to get by, only without scruples and not overly concerned with safety precautions or work conditions. You take a very special kind of pride in always running in head first, literally, no questions asked. Just enjoying the thrill of the moment and the luxury of not having to make plans further ahead than a couple of hours. What&rsquo;s so terribly wrong about that?<br/><br/>Goons is a euro-style strategy board game in which the players will try out new thrilling careers as henchmen throwing themselves right into the heat of the fire! The goal is to cleverly manage your energy, earn as much cash as possible, get cool new gear, increase your reputation on the streets, and back the villains that will be the most beneficial for you in order to get as much victory points as possible.<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn they will combine two actions by drafting an action cube from the game board and place it on an action space on their crib board. Actions include going to The Dojo to increase your energy, shopping for new gear at The Supermarket, earn a little extra at the local Diner, or mixing things up on the game board at The Nightclub. Players can also go hustling on the streets and advance on different hustle tracks for all sorts of rewards and compete for the top spot.<br/><br/>But most importantly, players will use their actions to commit to different daring villain schemes by placing energy markers on them to increase the chances of success and rewards. Each villain has a unique deck of schemes with a special theme and game mechanic offering different risk and rewards for every round. So players will have to consider carefully which ones to support&hellip; Will you take a risk with Kid Random's schemes for a potential bigger reward, go trade with Jolly Butcher, or play it safe with The Doctor? It's up to you!<br/><br/>The game is divided into 3 rounds and the goon with the most victory points at the end of the game is really awesome and wins the game!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

With three cards, one of each type, they create a sentence trying to convey, as best they can, the emotion they received, then they give the sentence to the player on their left. The sentences are then read, and everyone other than the person who created each particular sentence can then discuss them, attempting to guess what the intended emotion was. If they guess the right emotion, move the complicity token forward; if not, move the Discord token forward. The game continues until Harmony or Discord reaches the end of the track.<br/><br/>",

When the game ends, the player who has played the most cards of a certain girl &quot;becomes&quot; that girl. Each different girl has a completely different way of scoring, so you need to adapt to the other player's play rapidly.<br/><br/>(The title is an allusion to a novel set in a distant future in which girls around the world start manifesting supernatural powers, and they are more or less treated as threats to humanity.)<br/><br/>",

Well, it's not much of a fight really, as the player removes one character from the room and places it in a line with other removed characters. Once a single character remains, the round ends. The first two characters removed are worth zero points, while the third through eleventh characters are worth 1-9 points; the character that remains in the house is worth ten points. Each player collects points only for his most valuable character.<br/><br/>Cthulhu in the House differs from its predecessor, Rumble in the House, thanks to two types of tokens that are placed in some locations. One type switches a character into a different room, possibly causing a fight in the process, while another type is an abyss, which switches which character would be removed from play.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

When time is up, each player takes a turn reading their comic to the group (or, in the suggested 'professional mode,' the other players read the player's manga amongst themselves without the artist being allowed to give explanation). Based on the other players' judgement, each player earns 2 Fame Tokens for following each of the three core rules: (1) express your Themes (2) use 3 or fewer Word Balloons and (3) draw something recognizable in every Panel.<br/><br/>Beginning with round 2, Trend Cards appear, putting more Fame in play. Trend cards (examples: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Shojo Manga, Sports, Destruction, Subtlety, etc.) provide new victory conditions in the form of instructions and a corresponding reward of Fame Tokens. Some Trend rewards can be claimed by every player simultaneously, others can only be claimed by one or two winners (such as &quot;Eager Audience,&quot; which rewards Fame to the first player to finish drawing before time runs out).<br/><br/>In addition, each round after the 1st, the Comic Pages become denser, requiring the players to draw more Panels in the same amount of time. Round 1 is 2 Panels; round 2 is 4 Panels; round 3 is 6 Panels; round 4 is 8 Panels. The number of Trends also goes up from round to round. Round 2 has 1 Trend; round 3 has 2 Trends; round 4 has 4 Trends.<br/><br/>When round 4 ends, the winner (the most successful comic artist) is the one with the most Fame.<br/><br/>",

The captain has rounded you all up because you're all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid. That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!<br/><br/>In game terms, each round players secretly stack three of their ten action cards, then they take turns revealing and playing those actions one by one no matter what's gone wrong between the planning and the doing. If you plan to have a pirate shove someone off the plank on your third move and all he sees are his own best mates, he will still shove away! Some cards bear a skull on them, and these powerful cards must remain on the table the round after they're played, but otherwise players then pick up their action cards and start a new round. As soon as two or fewer pirates remain on board, the game ends and the owner (or owners) of these pirates win! Watch out, though, as sometimes every pirate will end up in the drink, which means that no one wins other than the sharks circling in the water below...<br/><br/>This all new limited edition tin edition features a reworked version of the rules, all new artwork (by Felideus Bubastis), screen printed meeples, the Ghost Meeple mini-expansion (with rules), and a 26 card promo pack.<br/><br/>The promo pack features a summary card and 5x cards each each of  the five player colors, which now give each player 15 cards to choose from rather than the 10 cards featured in the original  or the deluxe tin editions.<br/><br/>The new cards are:<br/><br/>Skeleton<br/>Scallywag<br/>Parlay<br/>Ghost Pirate<br/>Dynamite<br/><br/>",

Usually this ritual took only seconds before the crystal power kicked in. Not today &hellip; it took him minutes to obtain the desired power required to load his wand for the adventurous travel ahead of him. While waiting for the blessing of the crystal power he noticed something dark. Something was lurking in the mist absorbing the essential and much needed crystal power from the crystal fragments orbiting around their world, Amanaar. In light of the immense threat to their habitat, Orly decided to set off on a journey, visiting some of the remarkable creatures of Amanaar in order to seek out the dark power that threatens their very lives. Never in his humble existence would he have imagined that some of his friends would turn against him in a battle for the Lost Lights of Amanaar ...<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>In Lost Lights, two players battle with their party of diverse animalistic characters for control over the Regions of Amanaar. In the beginning each player drafts 10 out of 27 beautifully and individually illustrated cards. On your turn you play a card from your hand and take a number of actions equal to the action point value on the card.<br/><br/>Actions allow you to reinforce your party with new followers or to move your followers between the Areas on the map. In Areas where both parties meet, you&rsquo;ll battle each other. To resolve battles both of you secretly choose one character card from your hand as a leader in this battle, using their special ability. After the special abilities are resolved, your combined battle strength is added up. If you lose the battle, remove your party from the contested area. If you win you are now the dominant force in that area.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately if one of you has no party members left on the map or if both of you run out of cards. When the game ends you add up your scores for each Area. Whoever achieved the higher score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is the third game in the series that began with Guelphs and Ghibellines.<br/><br/>In Braccio da Montone there are no turns but a continuous series of Condottiero (Leader) activations. A Condottiero's &quot;Command Capacity&quot; is the number of order points that a Condottiero receives when he is activated. He uses these order points to move, fire and attack with his in-command units of his own &ldquo;Battaglia&rdquo; and it emphasizes the fatigue of the armies during the course of the battle. This system is integrated with ad hoc rules needed to reflect the different tactics invented and used by Braccio da Montone (the so-called Scuola Braccesca. The Victory Level mechanic gives uncertainty as to how much further the game has to go.<br/><br/>The game simulates the two major battles fought by the condottiero: Sant'Egidio (July 12, 1416), whereby he became Lord of Perugia and l'Aquila (June 2, 1424), in which he was defeated and mortally wounded.<br/><br/>Components: <br/><br/><br/>    Two maps 84x60 cm; <br/>    176 5/8&rdquo; and 140 1/2&rdquo; die-cut counters; <br/>    Three Player Aid Carts; <br/>    A rule booklet with scenarios and an historical background. <br/><br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/><br/>    1 hex: 100 meters (about 110 yards) <br/>    1 strengh point: <br/>        100-200 men for the cavalry, <br/>        250-500 men for infantry, <br/>        750-1,000 men for the militia <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Players use colorful dice to represent armies of different fantasy species which battle to control essential terrain in this fast-rolling game. Although primarily played as a 2-player game, any number of players can join the struggle. The first player to capture two terrains immediately wins the game, or you may try to obliterate your opponent's dice. Spells and layered strategies benefit certain races as you try to control the odds in this dynamic game full of surprises!<br/><br/>Players build their initial forces based on a point system; 24, 30, 36, and 60 points are common point systems, with most standard constructed tournaments using 36 point army builds. Forces are composed of small (1-point), medium (2-point), and large (3-point) 6-sided units and 10-sided monsters (4-point), with 2 terrain dice representing the terrains being battled over, and a summoning pool with dragons, dragonkin, and minor terrains which can all be summoned into play during battle.<br/><br/>'CHANGES IN FOURTH EDITION'<br/>This game system entry is for the fourth edition of the rules. The game is backwards compatible with all past dice releases except for the King's Die, the first promo die to be retired from the game. Here is a summary of changes from prior versions of the rules.<br/>- Charge and Routing rules have been removed.<br/>- Species abilities have been aligned according to the elements that make up a species and matching it with the elements of the terrain the units are at.<br/>- Death species abilities are now tied to having dead units in the Dead Unit Area (DUA)<br/>- Changes to Species abilities (see current rules for details)<br/>- Revised minor rules. Minors can be brought in if only one element matches the major terrain, and elements present in the minor terrain contribute to species abilities.<br/>- Overhaul of spells and Special Action Icons (SAIs). See the latest spells and SAI reference pages in the rules for new spells and SAI effects.<br/>- New dice have been added such as hybrid dragons and white dragons, new minor terrains, new major terrains, and new species.<br/>- The order of steps in a round has been revised.<br/>- Many force build rules have been removed. There is no longer a limit to the number of magic units or Eldarim Champions allowed in a build.<br/>- Army point costs to include items have been reduced.<br/>- Magic ID doubling has been removed.<br/>- 8th Face bonuses changed to double all ID results (and only ID results.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is a dark time.  The Old Gods have deserted the world. A new dark pantheon of Gods watches over the earth and feeds upon the spoils of war; a banquet of souls slain on the wretched battlefields of Chronopia.<br/><br/>Once you have chosen your army it will be time to select the troops that you will lead into battle.  Chronopia isn't a game that relies on the strengths of only one model, but rather the abilities of a diverse collection of warriors all working towards a common goal.  You will populate your army with warbands of close combat warriors, soldiers trained in all manner of weaponry from swords to axes; missile weapon warbands that will rain death down upon their enemies in great volleys; and Individuals like spell casters or fearsome monsters or even mighty war chariots.  Whatever the case, you will create a diverse army with which to recreate the epic struggles of the Empires of the Fourth Age of Chronopia.  You will populate your forces with miniatures and models available from Excelsior Entertainment.<br/><br/>These models will represent your own style of waging war and will be selected for your tastes.  Once you have chosen your warriors you will need to paint them.  A well-painted army will bring your games to life and seize your imagination with the epic battles you will recreate.  There are many resources to help you learn how to paint your miniatures and we recommend that you practice and try new techniques- the results will well be worth it.<br/><br/>You will need a few things to begin your epic journey into the realms of Chronopia.  Most important are this rule book, some Chronopia miniatures from the extensive Chronopia line, Warband Unit Cards (which come with each model), a twenty-sided die (d20), a ruler or measuring tape, and a pen.  In addition to these items you may need some of the counters and templates found in the back of this book.  You will also need a place to engage your armies in battle.  This can be an inspiring custom war game table that you have spent a great amount of time creating or it can be as simple as a dining room table or a stretch of floor.  The site of a well-designed table however, with your armies spread out before you will do wonders to fire the imaginations and invigorate your play.  There are numerous resources for how to create battlefields and just as many manufactured resources to draw upon.  Excelsior also makes a line of battlefield accessories that can be used in your game<br/><br/>",

Players try to draw a network of canals that connect houses, parks, markets and ships. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     &quot;Shanghai&quot; uses the same basic mechanisms for dice drafting, but is played on a 6x6 grid and introduces completely new rules for scoring. One new building is the skyscraper. When activated, you either add another floor to the skyscraper, or finalize the building by drawing a road in its space. You then score 1 point per floor multiplied by the number of connected parks. When you score points, all other players must cross out this point value on their sheets, so each value can be scored by only one player throughout the game. <br/><br/><br/>Shanghai also has hotels, with which you score points for the length of the road passing through the hotel (as in Doodle City), but again, each value can be scored by only one player.<br/><br/>There are no &quot;wildcard dice&quot; in Shanghai. Instead, when you choose dice that activate a park, you can draw in any space in that park's row; doing so costs you a tree.<br/><br/>At game's end, players score points for having made a large network of taxis and buses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s been a ruff day and your dogs are barking. As one of the local dog walkers, it&rsquo;s time to get these pooches back to their homes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it sounds like the friendly neighborhood mutt is on the loose again and he loves to play! If you want to get home before everyone else, you&rsquo;ll need to give that good boy a bone to distract him or wind up chasing your dogs all over the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The game is played over three rounds (for a faster game, just play one round). Each round, you&rsquo;ll take turns playing cards until someone goes out by playing their last card.<br/><br/>Each turn, you must play either a dog that matches the number, color, and/or breed of the dog previously played, or an action card. If you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll have to draw a card! If you are quick, you&rsquo;ll even be able to play certain cards when it&rsquo;s not your turn! At the end of each round, points are tallied for cards remaining in each player&rsquo;s hand. After three rounds, the player with the fewest points wins and is chosen as The Most Paw-some Dog Walker!<br/><br/>It's a howling good time for everyone!<br/><br/>",

The rumble on the street is the big guys in the big cities are pulling the big dough, and you want to be the most prestigious of them all.<br/><br/>Crimopolis is a fast-paced strategy board game about bean-shooters, chippies, and sugar in a city where nothing counts but underground influence. Recruit criminals, explore the city, execute illicit jobs, ambush others, and take over their assets. Grow your skills and abilities, so you can counteract when reporters and enemies get in the way.<br/><br/>Players explore a city area by moving gangsters further and further away from their headquarters. Tiles feature streets and city blocks with parks, banks, graveyards, churches, lakes, etc. Players assemble gangsters and execute jobs. The trickier the job the more prestige they earn. Taking over other players' assets also gains prestige as well as end game contributions such as city influence, body count, and hidden skills. The player with the most prestige wins.<br/><br/>Crimopolis is a mixture of a Eurogame featuring strategy with multiple winning paths and downplaying luck, and an Amerigame allowing for an immersive 1920s gangster theme with direct player conflict and highly intuitive rules. The game length can be freely adjusted: shorter games increase luck, longer games deepen gameplays. The recommended game length balances both and allows for family game nights with players of different ages.<br/><br/>Crimopolis was awarded Best Physical Game of 2020 by NZ Games Festival.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Politics is always a risky business, but in the Wild West, where even the smallest slight could call for blood, being a politician was a particularly dangerous career choice.<br/><br/>In Outlaws: Last Man Standing, you take on the role of a Governor in the Far West seeking to best his rivals by any means necessary. With the help of your supporters, keep your Governor safe as you seek to outmaneuver your opponent in this card-based game of bluff and deduction.<br/><br/>Each player controls a set of 10 cards representing the Governor&rsquo;s constituents (or unscrupulous individuals in it for the gold), each with a different ability. These characters are lined up facing one another, their identities hidden from their opponent. During the game, the characters will move up and down the table, revealing their identity to collect tokens and use their abilities.<br/><br/>Players must cleverly manage the information that they obtain and reveal, baiting and trapping their opponent to accomplish one of the three win conditions. The first player to do so will attain the power and glory of the White House, leaving his opponent with only the taste of bitter defeat.<br/><br/>There are three ways to win the game:<br/><br/><br/>    The &quot;Good&quot; way: Win the election fair and square. Some of the facedown tokens are &quot;votes&quot; that you can use to get your Governor elected. If you have more votes than your opponent, then you can use your Governor to start an election and win the game.<br/>    The &quot;Bad&quot; way: If you can find your opponent&rsquo;s Governor and assassinate him with your Hitman, you can win the election by default. A dead man can&rsquo;t be President, it&rsquo;s as simple as that.<br/>    The &quot;Ugly&quot; Way: If you suspect that your opponent is after your Governor, you can attempt to arrest them with your Sheriff. If a Sheriff can foil an assassination attempt and arrest the Hitman, his employer&rsquo;s reputation will be left in tatters. A scandal will destroy a man just as surely as a bullet... <br/><br/><br/>Your objective is to hide your Governor amongst your other cards whilst you search for a way to win the game. You and your opponent will be able to look at each other&rsquo;s cards, move them around, and even lock some of them up! You&rsquo;ll need to use as much deception and bluff as you can to win because, whether it be by silver or lead, only one of you will make it out of this unscathed!<br/><br/>",

Or play solo/cooperatively as a team to fight enemies, complete objectives, and survive!<br/><br/>Every character is represented by a detailed 32mm-scale miniature, possessing their own rich history and personality, as well as powerful cybernetic abilities! Play the competitive or solo/cooperative modes through various narrative scenarios to survive the crisis! With innovative game mechanics like the Action Store and Luck Tokens, every game is thrilling and exciting. Enjoy a deeply tactical game in under an hour and introduce your gaming friends to skirmish games with Omicron Protocol!<br/><br/><br/>In the game, you play with a squad of 1-4 characters, either competitively against another player/team, solo, or cooperatively with friends. Each round consists of spending a shared pool of action points on your characters, activating them one-by-one, and using movement and tactics to survive the onslaught of the Cyber-Memetic Sociopaths (CyMS). All games are based on scenarios derived from the lore of the world (120K+ word collection of stories), and the game can be linked together into a light campaign in both competitive and cooperative modes.<br/><br/>In competitive scenarios, the team that scores the most victory points wins. In solo/cooperative scenarios, the players win if they reach the VP goal within a specified number of rounds.<br/><br/><br/>Background:<br/><br/>Everything can change in a month. The cutting edge West Coast city of San Lazaro had been the epicenter of a cybernetics tech revolution in 2044, ushering all of humanity into the future...but in the year 2050, a mysterious viral menace the likes of which the world had never seen toppled the utopian city in a sea of infection and death. The disease could not be stopped; it evolved to surpass any countermeasure, mutated to answer any cure. In mere days San Lazaro was overwhelmed by the infected.<br/><br/>Martial law descended on the city immediately. Barricades and armed soldiers divided its streets into isolated sectors. Efforts to contain the outbreak were as useless as the attempts to control the surging numbers of mysteriously insane and violent residents, a second catastrophe on the heels of the first.. Dubbed &lsquo;Cyber-Memetic Sociopaths&rsquo; by the media, with their actions being blamed on an over-immersion in virtual reality, these &lsquo;CyMS&rsquo; were spreading across the city in a wave of mindless, indiscriminate violence. With the infection spreading and the murderous CyMS rampaging, the government abandoned San Lazaro and its people after a mere two weeks.<br/><br/>All that remains of the city now is a twisted hellscape. The few survivors have banded together in hopes of escaping, while gangs once suppressed by the government have seized control. The CyMS have grown into a constant threat on the streets, sowing fear and terror in their path. In this waking nightmare, your only chance of salvation is to join a faction powerful enough to dominate the foes that stand in your way.  <br/><br/><br/>",

You take on the role of a clan leader and explore the landscape, discover new tools and offer to holy places. All this to gather as much status as possible.<br/><br/>Epoch: Early Inventors is very thematic and tries to stay as close to reality as possible.<br/><br/>Before starting the game you build a landscape of hexagonal playing cards and holy places.<br/><br/>In your turn you can carry out 1 action and/or develop 1 card and/or offer to 1 holy place.<br/><br/>You can choose between the following actions: gather food, fish (for food), hunt for deer, butcher deer, explore adjacent cards or work to get raw material.<br/><br/>You need food to move around the game board and develop cards. Gathering food and fishing are basically the same actions, but depending on the tools you have, the one action might give you more food than the other.<br/><br/>You need raw materials to develop cards and offer to the holy places. Sometimes raw materials can help you to heighten the proceeds of actions. The action &quot;Work&quot; can get you raw materials. The type of landscape you are currently standing on determines how much work it is to get hold of a certain raw material. Raw materials used in the game are: wood, flax, stone, flint, clay and iron ore.<br/><br/>Butchering animals can not only get you food, but also skins, bones and tendons.<br/><br/>Exploring cards adds to your status. It also opens up more cards to be developed.<br/><br/>To develop a card, you need to &quot;pay&quot; the food and materials depicted on the card.<br/><br/>Once you have developed a card, you can use the tool, equipment or knowledge of this card to your advantage. E.g. Rope Making allows you to turn 2 flax into 3 ropes. Sowing gives you 2-4 extra food, when gathering food. An axe makes it easier to chop wood.<br/><br/>By cleverly using your own cards and those of your opponents, you try to offer materials to as many holy places as you can, thereby increasing your status even more.<br/><br/>After 14-20 rounds the game is over. The player that has collected the most status has won.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To celebrate King Louis' birthday, royal p&acirc;tissiers are busy preparing macaron gift boxes for the royal family and guests. At the end of the celebration, the p&acirc;tissier who has made the most boxes will win and become the most prestigious p&acirc;tissier in France &mdash; so you must be watchful for dark currents underneath the cheerful p&acirc;tissiers and colorful macarons as an allergen might slip into your box and ruin the pastry. Are you ready to make some macarons?<br/><br/>In the 1-5 player trick-taking game Macaron, players are French p&acirc;tissiers preparing macaron gift boxes. In every game, a number of rounds will be played, and each round ends when thirteen tricks have been played or a player has prepared at least eight boxes. Players receive victory points (VPs) at the end of the round based on the number of boxes prepared.<br/><br/>In more detail, the deck will contain 5-7 suits of macarons based on the number of players, and these macarons are put together into 3-4 groups, e.g., almond and pistachio are in group A, while strawberry and blueberry are in group B. Each round, one group will be determined to be &quot;royal&quot;, and the 1-2 suits in that group are trump for the round. In addition, one flavor (not group) of macarons will be the allergen for the round.<br/><br/>Standard trick-taking rules are used, with the leading player being allowed to play anything and with other players needing to follow suit. Whoever wins the trick scores 1 box &mdash; or 3 boxes if the trick was won with a 1. If a trick contains an allergen, then no boxes are scored, except if the trick also contains a 2, which negates the allergen. Players track boxes won on a scoring track, and they also use this board at the start of a round to bet on the number of tricks they expect to win, with players winning or losing points based on how well their bet matches reality.<br/><br/>Macaron lasts a number of rounds until someone passes the VP threshold established at the start of the game. The solo rules have you compete against an AI player, Emma, who follows particular rules for deciding what to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forgotten Pacific Battles is a simulation of the US invasions of Micronesia from February to October 1944. Specifically, this game includes the invasion of Tinian, Engebi, Parry, Eniwetok, Guam, and Angaur Island as part of the U.S. goal of establishing bases that would allow American bombers, for the first time, to launch within range of the Japanese home islands.  Accordingly, the Japanese intended to deny the islands to the Americans, or at least make cost prohibitively expensive in terms of lives, as well as buy Japan as much time as possible to allow the Japanese home islands to be continually strengthened and fortified for the inevitable invasion that the Japanese leadership anticipated.<br/><br/>Forgotten Pacific Battles, while developed as a solitaire game, it can be just as easily played as a two-player game, using the standard Fire &amp; Movement (F&amp;M) rules and a series of exclusive rules covering each scenario.<br/><br/>There are individual scenarios for the islands of Engebi, Eniwetok, Parry, Guam, Tinian and Angaur. Each scenario can be played separately or as part of two different campaign games.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: variable from 1 to multiple days<br/>    Hex: 0.3 miles / 500 meters for all scenarios (except Guam 1 mile / 1.61 kilometer)<br/>    Units: Platoon to Battalion<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>    One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 30 minutes to 3 hours<br/><br/>Published in &quot;World At War&quot; magazine issue #71 (April/May 2020)<br/><br/>",

Transport whales are seen soaring above the thick mist, transporting citizens and cargo from port to port. Mistwind is growing rapidly and our leaders are looking to connect with neighbouring nations to expand trade networks that will be beneficial for many years to come. You are the head of a trade company, with a chance to make a name for yourself. You've trained your transport whales well and now you need to gather resources to build your outposts and maximize your network efficiency while keeping up with the supply and demands of the local capitals.<br/><br/>Mistwind is a strategic game of building networks and meeting the demands of each nation. Players will gain resources to build outposts or train transport whales, gather and deliver cargo to fulfill territory demands and complete networking contracts with neighbouring nations in an effort to become the most Trusted Trader in Mistwind.<br/><br/>Players will have a hand of action disks numbered 1-5 but at the beginning of every round, you must choose one to discard and not use for that round. The game board will have 4 sections, each with their own spots numbers 1-5 where players will play their matching numbered action disk. Each spot on the board only allows one action disk. Players take turns placing their action disks until each player has used all 4 disks, thus ending the round. The game consists of only 4 rounds so players must choose carefully when and where to spend their actions to maximize their turns.<br/><br/>Players will earn points from, among other things, completing network cards, delivering resources to capitals, and overall majority of Demand Tokens from each region. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sword &amp; Spear is a set of wargames rules for Ancients and Medieval battles. They are suitable for any scale figures and any basing standard, the only requirement being that figures are organized into units of equal frontage. A typical game has around 8&mdash;15 units on each side, and games take around two to three hours. The rules are designed from a top-down perspective, focusing on outcomes rather than detail.<br/> Sword &amp; Spear features a clever and innovative system for activating units that creates interesting and challenging decisions, keeps both players involved at all times, and has a lot of depth and subtlety. Each turn is split into phases, where players each receive a number of action dice, which are rolled and then used to activate their units. The number shown on each dice determines which units can activate (with better quality units being easier to activate), what the unit can do when activated, and also determine the activation sequence. Certain dice also give bonuses to combat, movement distance, or shooting range. So there is a lot to think about, and allocating the action dice well is the key to success (although rolling lots of sixes helps as well!).<br/> The rules are relatively straightforward, and there are no &quot;to hit&quot; tables, charts, or lists of dieroll modifiers. They can be played using only the one-sided Quick Reference Sheet, with very little reference to the rulebook after the first couple of games.<br/> Army lists are available as free downloads online, covering a wide range of Ancient and Medieval armies. These include points for each unit, so that players can play relatively balanced games by building armies to a set points total. There are currently over 40 army lists, including many of the most popular armies, and more are being added each week, with the aim to have over 100 lists available. The rules also include guidelines to help in recreating historic battles, and there are three generic scenarios included as alternatives to the pitched battle.<br/> The strengths of the game are that it gives an exciting, interesting and challenging experience, plays relatively quickly for the size of battle that is being depicted, and the rules are straightforward to learn, whilst having the depth to retain interest after repeated play.<br/><br/>",

The Japanese and Germans have slightly higher Victory Point value as their loss is tougher on them than the Allies.<br/><br/>This boxed bookcase style game (and a STOUT box at that!) weighing OVER a kilo contains the following components:<br/><br/>     One 22.5&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; dark blue MOUNTED map.<br/>     Two cut out islands - one is Savo in the old traditional daylight hour&rsquo;s style and Kolombangara in nighttime shades.<br/>     Two FULL countersheets.

It is upon the Heroes to explore the dungeons, fight back waves of Monsters and assault Monster encampments.<br/><br/>Dungeon Crawl features a vast, flexible game system with many different play modes.  Play through the 35 Adventure Campaign with the Dungeon Lord, who fields and plays as the Monsters during the Campaign.  Pit your Heroes against your friends' own characters in the Deathblow Arena.  Play solo or with friends in randomly generated dungeons that don't require a game master, and fight mighty and cruel bosses that will test the Heroes like no other Monster has.<br/><br/>Combat, the bread and butter of any dungeon crawler, is quick and simple, requiring only two rolls (attack and defense) to figure out if the player has hit, and how much damage he caused.  Gameplay is streamlined for quick play, so you don't have to sit around for hours on end on a single scenario.  Each player can take their turn in just seconds, so you don't have to constantly wait for minutes for someone to make up their minds.<br/><br/>Players advance in levels to learn Skills, chosen from a list based on the Hero's Race and Class.  Try different Race and Class combinations for interesting skill sets!  Heroes can join Guilds to earn benefits, and must face trials to advance in Guild rank.<br/><br/>Dungeons are built from 20 available dungeon tiles, each complete with rooms and corridors.  In the dungeons the players will search for treasures in all sorts of different furniture, and fight over 50 different monsters.  Roll on charts or use the included cards to search for treasure or lay out the dungeons.<br/><br/>Customize your games with a slew of optional rules.  Don't like the Heroes walking around with 50,000 gold in their pockets?  Bring in the Load rules.  Decided that traveling five weeks to another city shouldn't be a cakewalk?  Invoke the Travel rules to add some peril to their journey.<br/><br/>Think your gaming group might not be up to more advanced modes of play?  Dungeon Crawl comes with Dungeon Crawl Basic, an even lighter-rules version of Dungeon Crawl, designed to get new players acquainted with the game.<br/><br/>Dungeon Crawl is a Print-and-Play game, and it comes with several print options, to make your game as pretty or as economical as you'd like.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The Battle of Grunwald (15 July 1410) was one of the biggest, and most decisive, engagements of the middle ages. The myth of Teutonic invulnerability - already wobbly after the Battle on the Ice - was shattered by the combined might of Poland, Lithuania, and their allies. Though both sides fielded some infantry, and the Teutonic Order some cannon, cavalry predominated. The sudden withdrawal of the Lithuanian forces left the Poles vulnerable, and their dramatic re-entry onto the battlefield may have been decisive in turning the tide against the Germans. Poland is still immensely proud of their victory over six hundred years later, and the Germans were still feeling sore about it into the twentieth century.<br/><br/>This first title in the revamped SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series lets two players refight this dynamic and exciting battle. With lots of horsies on both sides, it's a tense contest of maneuver and tempo. The Teutonic Player must protect his camp at all costs, and use every opportunity to slow the enemy's headlong advance. But blocking him here can open a hole over there - knowing where and when to leave a hole is key. His opponent must decide when to remove the Lithuanians from the battlefield, and when to bring them back on - there's a right time and wrong time for both, but in each case it's heavily contextual and dependent on the current game state, on his own strategy, and on his opponent's. The result is an unusually replayable medieval battle game that you, your friends, and your family can revisit again and again.<br/><br/>The SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series builds on, and improves, the Shields &amp; Swords series of games (We Happy Few, Stamford Bridge, A Hill Near Hastings, and Our Royal Bones), with a greater variety of unit types, revised suppression rules, and a new D8-based CRT.<br/><br/>",

Disturbing stories that surround Bedeville can send shivers down your spine. One of them, often considered the most real, tells a tale of Mr. Carl - a grave keeper and a grim owner of a local theme park.Mr. Carl arrived in Bedeville back when life and happiness bloomed in every corner of this little town. As a juggler and later - grave digger in a nearby graveyard, he barely made the ends meet. How did he get the fortune that let him create a theme park? We will probably never learn. Some think that he made a pact with a malignant, and fun-loving Trickster. That&rsquo;s the only explanation for what happened next, including the nightmare, that led Bedeville to its downfall. Citizens were forced to leave this grim place while Mr. Carl ended up doomed to eternal torment. What kind of torment? Having his theme park be visited by &ldquo;unique&rdquo; guests like the undead from the nearby graveyard. Additionally, to make Mr. Carl even angrier, they&rsquo;re invited every night by the ticket seller, who opens the grounds of Bedeville Carnival when dusk arrives.<br/><br/>This is where your adventure begins. As corpses from the nearby graveyard, you will visit the crazy attractions of the theme park. It doesn&rsquo;t matter when and how you ended up in this burial ground. Each night an eerie force makes you wake up from the eternal slumber and feel alive again. Each night you will discover new attractions and collect Souvenirs before they&rsquo;ll get grabbed by grave digger&rsquo;s mean cat called Fleabag. But beware! Mr. Carl can catch you anytime and chase you back to the cemetery.<br/><br/>The game is played in consecutive player turns. Each player has the goal of collecting the most Joy Markers and Souvenirs sold in the local Booths. When all Souvenirs end up being sold to the players - the game concludes. The player, who at the end has the most victory points awarded for their Joy Markers and Souvenirs collected, becomes the winner.<br/><br/>Every Player picks their favorite undead unafraid of any, even the most dangerous Attractions. Next, you draw the crazy Attractions that the characters will move through during the game. By visiting more and more Attractions and performing Actions from the Attractions you will attempt to outsmart your graveyard friends. By using Actions in a smart way a Player will attempt to hold their position on a specific Attraction. Only this way they will be able to buy Souvenirs next turn. At the end of each turn, a player draws one Trickster&rsquo;s token from the bag and checks what destiny has for them in-store. Attractions generate Noise Markers. The more Noise, the bigger the chance that the Attractions will make the grave keeper arrive and chase the player&rsquo;s character back to the graveyard.<br/><br/>",

You must therefore construct prosperous cities and magnificent temples at different levels on the mountain by skillfully moving your resources closer to the summit. Gaining the favor of the gods at just the right moment will help you complete your task, but there is limited space on the mountain...<br/><br/>In Mytikas, you play as builders who must construct cities and temples on Mount Olympus. The higher up you construct them, the more prestige you gain. You need to produce resources, then move them up the levels of Mount Olympus. When you make offerings to the gods, you gain their favor and benefit from their special abilities.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you calculate your points based on where your buildings are constructed, as well as from any deity cards you control. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins and earns the title of Chief Builder for the Gods.<br/><br/>Starting with the first player, take turns clockwise until one of the following 3 conditions are met, which all immediately trigger the end of the game:<br/><br/>     3 out of 4 levels are complete on Mount Olympus, <br/>     One of the players takes the last Lock token, <br/>     One of the players has built all their constructions.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

To set up the game, adjust the deck so that it contains twenty cards per player, with the cards being chosen at random. The full deck contains one hundred cards, with 25 cards for each symbol numbered 1-25.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player draws a card from the deck, then (if possible) you write the number on that card in the column matching the depicted symbol. Numbers must be placed in columns in ascending order so that within each column each number is higher than whatever is below it and lower than whatever is above it, but you can skip spaces in the columns when entering a number.<br/><br/>If you can't place your card's number on your player sheet in the proper column &mdash; e.g., you draw a blue 14 and you have no open spaces between a blue 11 and a blue 15 &mdash; announce this to everyone before they write down the number on their own card and place your card in the center of the table. After they write their own number, they can also write your number on their score sheet, if possible.<br/><br/>If you complete a row of symbols, then you immediately get the bonus shown on the left edge of the player sheet, either a number (5, 10, 15, 20) that you can write in any valid column or a symbol that you can fill with any valid number.<br/><br/>At game's end, for each column you score points equal to your longest connected sequence of filled-in spaces. In the advanced variant, you draw two of the eight bonus cards, each of which shows one of the rows on the player sheet; for each of these two rows that you fill in completely, you score bonus points.<br/><br/>",

But how was the map drawn? How did the wise stranger learn of all these dire warnings? In Overworld, you are the hero's mysterious mentor. All those years before you sent the hero to the underworld, you mapped the Overworld!<br/><br/>By laying tiles, you will seek to claim regions of Forests or Mountains with your Bird meeples, and regions of Reefs or Whirlpools with your Ship meeples. When the tiles form a hole in the world, the player who explored the most tiles there will place a Dungeon Door meeple into the hole.<br/><br/>Can you foresee uncertain spots in the geography, indeterminate in the distance? Will you uncover a dungeon... or wander the repeating pixel textures forever?<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY: Players in Overworld will take turns placing L-shaped tiles, one at a time, drawn from a bag. Place it land-side up or water-side up, but water and land may not be adjacent. Or instead, play a Coast tile that connects land to water. When an empty gap is enclosed with tiles, the birds and ships which can enter the gap, without leaving their terrain type, will compete to let their player place a Dungeon Door there.<br/><br/>The player whose Dungeon Door meeples are the farthest apart has discovered the largest and most valuable dungeon!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The world became a hostile place after the gods had abandoned men, embittered by their weakness. The elements appeared to conspire against the mortals and their heritage, bringing pain, hunger and destruction. And when the end of the human race seemed close at hand, an idea emerged amidst the deserted lands, and breathed hope into the surviving few. An idea of great power shimmering in a man about to fight for his own life. Thus began the era of the warrior; a warrior who, defiant to all, challenged heavens themselves. It was then that the wastelands saw the first Arenas, places endowed with mystic character, where the daring fought to death trying to single out the mightiest of them all. Some claimed that he was to win back gods&rsquo; favor; others that he was to become their equal and finally challenge even them. New habitats started to emerge around the Arenas, suddenly all vibrant with life and ruled, singlehandedly, by a Warlord, the best of the warriors. A Warlord sovereign, drawing passionate gaze of women and envious glances of men. A Warlord supreme, who thanks to his triumphs seemed to put humanity on a pedestal. A Warlord absolute, whose place could be taken by anybody willing to issue a challenge. The Warlord of the Arena.<br/><br/>Warlord of the Arena (Władca Areny) is a tactical board game that simulates a duel of barbarian heroes.<br/><br/>Players will create a unique warrior by distributing a number of points between six skills. Those skills will determine a warrior's agility, toughness, speed, sword mastery, etc. Warriors created this way will gain access to a vast armory. Various medieval weapons raging from daggers to heavy two handed axes await their test in battle. Throwing knives and crossbows, poisoned blades and big hunting dogs - all of this deadly weaponry varies in dealt damage, weight and special abilities, changing players' strategies for the fight. The strongest of warriors will be able to clad themselves in heavy plate armors, while the weaker ones will have to survive wearing only leather. Once warriors spent all of their gold, the players will build the arena. Even though the Arena is divided in several dangerous spaces, delivering special effects and fighting modification, players will be allowed to bring some extra mayhem to this place. Snakes, deadly spikes and a powerful chained beast wandering all over the arena are waiting to be bought for special points by the players to influence their tactics even further. Once the warriors and the arena are ready the duel begins. Each player can choose from arange of fighting moves (both defensive and offensive) to defeat his opponent. Chance of successful move attempt will be determined by your position on the arena, chosen weapon and position of your opponent. Lure your opponent out to the slippery floor and then jump him from behind to gain advantage ! Players will quickly exchange moves dancing in a sophisticated sword fight, using elements of the environment in order to win. There are 3 ways to win the duel. You can defeat your opponent by dealing one powerful blow which will kill him instantly or several minor ones that will cause him to bleed to his death! You may also poison him, which will cause them to lose consciousness and grant you victory. You can also try to deal a injury so painful that the opponent warrior will surrender, fearing for his life. All this brutal mayhem awaits you in Warlords of the Arena.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules: &quot;For decades, reporters from around the world have been on the hunt for the Loch Ness monster.  But lately reports of sightings of Nessie have been increasing.<br/><br/>&quot;Such reports naturally have drawn such reporters as the attractive Belinda Viewing from New York, the half-Belgian Claude McMirror, the clever Filosa Sharp, as well as her Londoner competitor Jack Nesstee, and even Nils the Blitzen from Denmark to the Loch.  Equipped with the most modern equipment and techniques, these daring reporters have traveled to Scotland, in order to capture the elusive Nessie on film for their newspapers.<br/><br/>&quot;But the 5 will experience some surprises . . .&quot;<br/><br/>In Loch Ness, players compete to get pictures of Nessie.  In turn order, players place or move their photographers on the board as they try to anticipate the movement of the Loch Ness monster.  The movement of the monster is determined randomly by drawing move cards from the first three players, each card having a number from 1 to 5.  The cards are not revealed until after the photographers have been placed.  When they are revealed, the monster moves the total number of spaces and players score points based on the value of their photographers placed in the area where Nessie emerged.  In addition, the players whose photographers were directly in front of Nessie select photo cards that will award points at the end of the game, especially if sets are created.<br/><br/>Beginning in the second round, players will select an action space each round that gives them a unique power to use for for the round.  Placement also gets more challenging from the second round onward as a player is required to move a photographer, perhaps opening up spots for opponents.  Each round, some of the players do have a limited knowledge of how Nessie will move each round.  When a player draws a movement card before positioning his photographers, he is allowed to look at it, giving him one-third of the movement for that round.  However, movement varies tremendously and only three players draw movement cards each round.<br/><br/>The game ends after the round in which a mini Nessie figure reaches space 65 on the score track.  This figure moves the same number of spaces as the main Nessie figure in the game board each round.  The player with the most points, scored during the game and from the photo cards at the end, wins the game.  The rules include two optional variants that can be added individually or together with the base game.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with the 2010 Walter Obert game with the same theme, Loch Ness.<br/><br/>",

Then the dawning of the Gods arrived, and more celestial beings came into existence. It was then the Jade Emperor of the heavenly realm produced ten rebellious children who turned themselves into scorching suns in a bid to end the world. This was a good thing, for you drew solar power from the ten suns, making you invincible.<br/><br/>Alas, a mortal hero called Hou Yi appeared and began shooting the Suns down one by one with his golden bow. With the demise of each Sun, your power fades. You realize your seat of absolute power is at risk. In order to stay at the top, you must quickly form alliances with the Gods, build grand palaces in your name, influence lands to worship you and repel mythical monsters to gain prestige - all before the suns disappear forever! Welcome to Ten Suns!<br/><br/>This is a 'blind bidding' game that revolves around the legendary archer from China, Hou Yi, who shot down 9 Suns and saved China from scorching heat. Players are Primordials who draw their energy from the 10 Suns. Before the Suns all disappear, players rush to gain enough prestige to secure a permanent position among the Gods. The game features famous locations in China like the Great Wall, Xi An, and many others. It also features other Gods and legends of ancient China, including Chang'E and the Jade Rabbit.<br/><br/>At the start of every turn players have a specific amount of energy to bid with, towards an ever-changing pool of cards known as the Mortal Plane. This amount is equal to the current number of Suns in the sky. However each time Hou Yi appears, more Suns will be shot down and players will have lesser and lesser energy to bid with. Players can tap on other forms of energy, such as Lunar energy from the moon, or other Gods - basically engine building.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are Shipwrecked... to survive, you must compete head-to-head in a bid for food, shelter, water, and friends. These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.<br/>   <br/>This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don't want the item.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GAME IDEA<br/>The game is played in 12 rounds in which the dice fall anew each time. All see the same result but everybody from another perspective. Each player always tries to find the best scoring category for him. <br/>But attention: <br/>Each category is available only once per game! So far so easy, if only the dice would not always disappear under the cup again so fast &hellip; Who has grasped the best result in the short term? And in which category would eventually have been more to achieve?<br/><br/>GOAL OF THE GAME<br/>The player with the highest total score in the end wins the DICE CUP-Challenge!<br/><br/>PREPARATION<br/>Put the dice in the cup. Each player gets a scoring sheet and a pen &ndash; and writes down his name on the up right line intended for it. Now a starting player is chosen and off we go!<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/>The starting player starts rolling the dice but still everybody plays always simultaneously.<br/>Each round consists of 8 steps:<br/><br/>     Put all dice in the cup.<br/>     Your hand above it and shake it well.<br/>     Turn around the cup with the dice and overthrow it on the table so all dice are hidden underneath the cup.<br/>     Lift up the cup for about 3 seconds (to measure the time, slowly say the following slogan: &bdquo;Lift the cup &ndash; eyes up&ldquo;). The dice must be clearly visible for everybody for the same amount of time.<br/>     Then the cup is put over the dice again carefully so that they are not turned over accidentally.<br/>     Now each player sets a cross in the little circle of the box in the category he wants to value. You can use your hand as a sight screen. Once the cross is set it may not be changed anymore.<br/>     When everybody is ready the player lifts the cup again and puts it aside so the dice result is visible for all players again.<br/>     Now everybody values his result and writes the points in the corresponding field (Example Kim see valuation). Pass the cup on in clockwise direction. The next round starts. Important: Sometimes the dice lie on top of each other. Then the dice roll must be repeated immediately!<br/><br/><br/>VALUATION AND EXAMPLES<br/><br/>     Who has chosen &bdquo;count fours only&ldquo; in the upper part, multiplies the number of fours with 4 (of fives with 5, of sixes with 6). E.g. three time 4: 3 x 4 = 12 points <br/>     Who has set a cross for a colour, e.g. &bdquo;blue&ldquo;, in the middle part, only counts the eyes of the two dice in this colour and notes down the sum. Scoring of Kim 5 + 6 = 11 points <br/>     Who has chosen &bdquo;double&ldquo;, may note down 10 points for each &bdquo;double&ldquo; of the same colour. E.g. one &bdquo;double&ldquo; (red) = 10 points<br/>     Who has marked &bdquo;all ones, twos and threes&ldquo;, adds all dice pips which show ones, twos and threes. E.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 13 points <br/>     Who has chosen &bdquo;DICE CUP&ldquo;, adds the pips of all dice and<br/><br/><br/>notes down the sum. E.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 +5 + 6 = 36 points After each valuation the respective selected category * The dot next to the red square is used for better is of course dropped for the current game.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The game ends after 12 played rounds. In the last round the cup can be left aside after the third playing step, and the last valuation (for the respective individual last category) is done at once. Afterwards every player adds the points of the three parts on his scoring sheet, transmits the sum into the fields provided for this purpose and calculates the total amount.<br/>The player with the highest total amount wins the DICE CUP-Challenge!<br/><br/>VARIATIONS:<br/>The &bdquo;Eyes up time&ldquo; may vary as the players like or by experience. Pro players can shorten the time to 2 seconds, for example. Beginners and younger players may extend it. All players always have the same length of time available &hellip; It is also much fun to play several games simultaneously. The players have two or more columns in each category to fill in and value.<br/><br/>Have fun playing!<br/><br/>",

It postulates that this War in West Germany could occur without a massive strategic nuclear holocaust. Essentially, the game progresses from &quot;M,&quot; the day' the Warsaw Feet decides to launch an offensive, to day &quot;M + 50,&quot; when a decision of some type (even a stalemated war) is assumed to have been reached. The game may be played starting with &quot;M + 1,&quot; with the forces as they actually are in peacetime, or at &quot;M + 31,&quot; after both sides have reached planned strength.<br/>The increment of forces, as NATO transfers its scattered strength and Warsaw Pact sends forth additional member and Russian garrison divisions, is fully charted between the 'two game-versions. NATO depicts the essential elements of modern warfare (even Future warfare) with unusual elements such as Air-transportable units, Airmobile units and the newly proposed US Army Tricap (triple capability) divisions.<br/><br/>Two basic scenarios (4 if nukes are used in two of them) and three variants (Warsaw Pact Unreliability, NATO Neutrality and Chinese Intervention).<br/><br/>The map portrays Europe from East Germany to France and from Denmark to Switzerland.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 10 miles / 16 kilometers<br/>Units: Brigade to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; four color map<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 10-page rulebook<br/>One player aid fold-out sheet<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>",

The tanks fire ammunition that can damage the other tanks, but are non-lethal. Though it takes place in modern day, it uses World War II tanks.<br/><br/>Each player has a group of tanks and characters they control, which vary by scenario. The tanks have values for movement, attack modifier, size modifer, movement points, and front/side/rear armor. Characters give have special limited-use abilities and modifiers for the tanks they're with.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 5 cards, and draws 1 each turn. They use the cards to determine what actions they use each turn, such as movement (sometimes one tank, sometimes many), fire, a combination of both (with different modifiers), or other abilties. Other cards may be used as reactions to a card played by the other player, and some are special effects that happen upon drawing the card.<br/><br/>Game system is based on World Tank Battles.<br/>A sequel Panzer Vor Ausf. 2 was published in 2016.<br/><br/>",

The Land Run of Oklahoma has just taken place, and now you and your opponent strive to get your Boomers the largest homesteads &mdash; but that can be harder than it looks!<br/><br/>Each player has three Boomers. On a turn, a player moves one Boomer in a straight line on the game board grid, moving it as many spaces as they wish. After this, he may use this Boomer and one of the opponent's Boomers to place cornerstones on the game board; these cornerstones are placed on the intersections where these two Boomers would meet, should they move toward one another. (If one of the Boomers couldn't reach an intersection point due to another piece being in the way, that cornerstone is not placed.)<br/><br/>Chains of cornerstones form borders on the game board, and at some point these borders will close off certain areas from the rest of the game board.

Don't worry &mdash; it's normal because surviving the apocalypse is anything but easy. Every attempt will teach you a little more about the game mechanisms and strategic priorities. Until Daylight is a game in which every action counts and where time will be very cruel. In some phases you will have only a few seconds to react before the horde falls on you. You win the game if the following three conditions are met:<br/><br/><br/>    All characters survived the ten rounds of the game.<br/>    All enemies revealed in the game were eliminated.<br/>    The group saved at least one survivor.<br/><br/><br/>Until Daylight is a co-operative game, but of course players might disagree on which strategy to adopt.

It is played in rounds of 12 points and the first side to take two rounds wins. For each hand, players are dealt three cards from a French 32-card deck. A hand is initially worth one point, but the active player may propose a raise in stakes before answering each trick. A hand is won by taking the majority of tricks or by making the opponent(s) fold to a raise. Only ranks of cards are important in Le Truc, not suits. If two cards of the same rank are played in a trick it is &quot;spoiled&quot; and not counted for either side. The first trick of a hand is particularly important, because it acts as a tiebreaker when both sides win an equal number of tricks.<br/><br/>There is a Brazilian variant know as Truco that also includes a card value to have higher in-game value than others. This value changes at each trick by drawing a card.<br/><br/>",

Despite the catastrophe in Russia, all is not lost for Napoleon.<br/><br/>On the European mainland, only Russia is openly at war with France. In theory, the other powers, Austria, Prussia and the German States, still remain allies. Can the Emperor recruit a new army and secure sufficient military success to persuade his allies to stand firm; or bolstered by the Russian advance, will they turn against the French? &ldquo;1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; simulates this fascinating campaign which determined the shape of nineteenth-century Europe.  ﻿<br/><br/>The Game (designed by Steve Pole)<br/><br/>1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; is strategic in scope. Combat units represent all the divisions (categorised as veterans, line or conscripts) which took part to the campaign, together with the most important commanders. The game presents strategic options corresponding to those available to Napoleon and the Coalition forces, and replicates the consequences which flow from each. At the same time, it captures the essence of campaign warfare during this period &ndash; sweeping manoeuvres, feints and deceptions, forced marches, and the greater flexibility and cohesion of seasoned troops &ndash; as well as the crucial matter of logistics. The Basic Rules are simple and can be learnt very quickly minimising the amount of time players need to spend consulting the Rulebook. Optional Rules and Advanced Rules (including cards) add even more realism and sense of period. <br/>   <br/>The &ldquo;1813: Napoleon&rsquo;s Nemesis&rdquo; is the second volume of a projected series of games at the same scale (the first being &quot;The Invasion of Russia (1812)&quot;), covering all the major campaign of the Napoleonic Wars at a strategic level.﻿<br/><br/>",

The Chinese, in common with many other Asian people, believe that every person will demonstrate in their lives those qualities of temperament of the special animal which controls the year of their birth.<br/>Players can discover what Animal Year they were born in by looking for their year of birth around each animal picture on the board. The Chinese Year, unlike the Western Year, runs from February to January, so remember this as you discover your animal sign. For example, a person born in January 1956 would be a goat, whereas a person born in February 1956 would be a Monkey.<br/>Operation of the Tile Dispenser<br/>Tiles are drawn one by one from the Dispenser by firmly pushing down on the lever on the side of the Dispenser. Occasionally, and especially when very few tiles are left in the Dispenser, no tile will be dealt on the first push of the lever. Simply push again, until a tile appears.<br/>Game set up<br/>Put all of the tiles in the Dispenser and place the lid on top. Gently shake the Dispenser and place it in the center of the board. Each player chooses a Mandarin and places it on the board on the center Chinese Character space of their own animal sign. If two or more players share the same sign, simply place the Mandarins side by side on the same space.<br/>Object of the Game<br/>Players collect tiles and place them in the appropriate places on their Collection Cards. The game ends when one player has collected at least one tile of each animal type, or all 6 tiles of one animal set. The first player to do this is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Every time you play, a new galaxy is created by randomly arranging the galactic hexes. You will claim trade routes over the course of play, each specifying systems you may want to bring into your network. The better you can fulfill these trade routes, the more lucrative the deal is and the more credits you will gain. Connecting planets to your network will require resources, which, of course, you &quot;acquire&quot; from the planets where you already have agents.<br/><br/>During play, you'll get to perform one core action each turn, which is then used up until you take a Deploy turn to reclaim all your spent action markers. The actions start out simple, but by gaining techs you can upgrade them. Cleverly upgrading some of your actions and leaning on them more heavily is crucial to success. By using your techs well, and excuting special bonus actions you can access by infiltrating trade guilds with your agents, you can outmaneuver your opponents and wind up with an enviable pile of Galactic Credits.<br/><br/>",

The race is on to present to the Vampire Council the most organized plans for the city to renovate Transylvania into Siliconvania!<br/><br/>In SiliconVania, players bid on building tiles and multi-use specialists that provide either one-time bonuses or end-of-game scoring. Players take the building tiles they win, and place them in their 4x4 city grids, juggling different scoring opportunities, and collecting vampire and pet meeples that are looking for places to live! Each round you:<br/><br/><br/>     Bid on a pair of building tiles to add to your grid. Be careful as once they're down, they're hard to move.<br/>     Bid a specialist card for its ability and to get a new specialist card.

You score points for having each of the seven building types, a wide network of blood banks, and proper housing for the vampire meeples your specialists bring to town. The vampires also want to make sure all this technological advancement doesn't destroy the biodiversity of their home, so you get points for having a variety of animals and animal meeples on your tiles.<br/><br/>Your specialists also provide special scoring conditions.

Everything you will need to play the game comes inside a box of Emergents: Genesis.<br/><br/>In Emergents: Genesis, players take on the role of powerful superheroes who discovered their powers during adolescence&mdash;known in this world as Emergents&mdash;and battle against the other players to be the last one standing.<br/><br/>Players customize their decks based on four classes of superpowers in a fast-paced game that can be played by two to four players. Designed by Urban Island Games and Top8Magic, Emergents: Genesis introduces innovative, interactive mechanics to the deckbuilding game that will appeal to all fans of both the superhero genre and interactive card games.<br/><br/>Gameplay Description<br/><br/>Players are dealt two Emergents face down and choose one of the heroes to start the game with. The object of the game is reduce all of the other players' heroes to zero health by attacking them while also building your deck and customizing your Emergent's superpowers.<br/><br/>Each player begins with a deck containing nine Skill cards and three Attack cards. Cards that generate Skill are used to purchase additional cards while cards that generate Attack are used to defeat your opponents.<br/><br/>Each player shuffles their deck and draws six cards. They can purchase basic cards that advance their Emergent's class strategy or purchase more expensive cards that are available dealt face-up from the deck. Cards that are purchased get put in the player's discard pile and whenever a player can't draw a card they shuffle their deck. At the end of each turn, a player discards their hand and draws six cards from their deck.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players will ideally create a deck that showcases their heroes' unique abilities and allows them to be the last player standing. While many deckbuilding games are points races, where someone crosses a finish line and wins, Emergents: Genesis requires you to defeat your opponents, which means you can defend yourself if you have purchased the right cards along the way.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Napoleonic 20 #18<br/><br/>Following his failed invasion of Portugal in 1810, French Marshal Andr&eacute; Mass&eacute;na fell back into Spain with Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese Army in cautious pursuit. Assuming the wretched state of the French would allow him time to capture the key border fortress of Almeida, Wellington settled in for a leisurely siege. But Mass&eacute;na quickly reorganized his forces and advanced on the British positions in an effort to resupply the beleaguered fortress.<br/><br/>Advancing on Almeida on 3 May, 1811, Mass&eacute;na encountered Wellington's army in strong defensive positions along the Dos Casas River. Heavy fighting erupted, with the British barely managing to hang on to the key terrain. The next day, Mass&eacute;na scouted the area and discovered that the British right was dangerously weak; that evening he conducted a daring night march that put strong forces into position to roll up Wellington's flank. When the French attack struck on the morning of 5 May, the British right nearly collapsed, and only the sacrifice of the British cavalry and heroic performance of Craufurd's Light Division barely managed to save the day. The savage nature of the fighting and the peril to the British position was revealed in Wellington's statement after the battle, &quot;If Boney had been there, we should have been beaten.&quot;<br/><br/>Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro 20, by designers R. Nicasio Garcia and Jack Gill, allows players to examine this tension-filled battle of the Peninsular Campaign, fought along the Spanish-Portuguese Border. Featuring the same system as GMT's popular &quot;Fading Glory&quot; game, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro 20 has low unit density (20 pieces or less on the game map) and modest complexity. The game focuses on dramatic, fast-playing turns and creates a strong historical narrative through the use of random event cards and the tracking of army morale providing a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of Napoleonic grand battle. Lead your troops forward into action to see if you can break your opponent's morale at bayonet-point before he puts your army to flight.<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/>Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 7 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 division, each hex is 1 mile from end to end, and each turn roughly 3-4 hours of real time.<br/><br/>",

Capture the winning pieces by causing eruptions!<br/><br/>Using the same erupt-and-capture mechanism as Volcano, Caldera changes just about everything else.  The following play summary requires no prior knowledge of Volcano, but does assume a basic knowledge of Looney Pyramids.<br/><br/>Using 6 rainbow stashes, four of the colors in each stash are set up on a Volcano board in nests.  Since there are only 24 nests, the center of the board is left empty.  The 5th color of each stash is used for caps (generally black, the opaque color).  The players move caps to cause eruptions to capture pieces, but also have the option each turn to execute a Power Play: return a previously captured piece to the board.  The game ends when one player has captured 3 monochrome trios--that player wins.<br/><br/>Although Caldera originated as a variant of Volcano, its &quot;Fiesta Caldera&quot; variant is now the canonical version of Volcano.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game tries to recreate the Midgard role playing feeling in a boardgame. It addresses former Midgard RPG players, who don't find the time for role playing anymore, as well as fans of fantasy boardgames. As the complexity level is rather high and the game offers multiple options for players, Midgard is rather successful in achieving it's goal. The difficulty is still light to medium, despite dozens of cards that influence the game and the characters.<br/><br/>The game is based on tiles (major cities of Midgard) players move across, collecting rare items and fulfilling adventures. Often this ends in the local city jail or in clashes with monsters. Additional threats like terror cards or riots pop up in cities during the game.<br/><br/>Tests are made with a 20-sided die and the mechanics are just the same as in the Midgard RPG. Movement and actions are controlled by action cards from a four-card-hand which allows tactical gaming. Each action card has different abilities and some may even interrupt another player's turn.<br/><br/>Players may form groups for the duration of a game turn to help each other solve adventures or make difficult tests. Sticking together earns each player of a group experience points and treasure cards. As only one player can finally win the game, forming groups is a two-edged sword as it helps your opponents too. The goal of the game is to get 3 treasure rewards, rise to character level 3 and find 2 artifacts first. If you deliver the treasures and artifacts to the correct city you have won the game.<br/><br/>Included are pre-generated characters like Sorcerer or Warrior but players will be able to create their own characters in the final release version.<br/><br/>This information is derived from the website of Phantastische-Spielewelten.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "There were three emperors at Austerlitz.  Two of those emperors were the product of hidebound tradition and court intrigue; the other was the product of an insatiable ambition for glory coupled with a limitless appetite for hard work.  Two saw their armies in terms of being a regal adornment of colour, martial airs, and ceremonial drill; the other knew his army down to the last pot of axle grease and the face of every soldier aspiring to win a marshal&rsquo;s baton.  Two dallied with war; for the other, war was his stock-in-trade.<br/><br/>On December 2nd 1805, in a very ordinary part of Moravia, the mettle of all of them was put to the test.<br/><br/>Trafalgar Editions&rsquo; Austerlitz is a miniatures-orientated rendering of Napoleon Bonaparte&rsquo;s greatest triumph.  Using an adaptation of the system first seen in Waterloo 1815: Napoleon&rsquo;s Last Battle, Austerlitz offers a larger battlefield for manoeuvre, the early morning effects of fog (hidden movement and the chance that forces will blunder into each other), and opposing armies of contrasting strengths and abilities.<br/><br/>The battle is played out on a beautiful and entirely grid-less rendering of the historical terrain, upon which players will deploy and move their forces.  Those forces are represented by tokens of various size, depicting infantry in all the key Napoleonic formations, as well as cavalry in both column and line, and foot and horse artillery.  Combining modern design sophistication with the practice and look of traditional kriegspiel, this is Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory rendered the way the emperor himself would appreciate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HappyCorp, the richest company in the world, has just unleashed its most evil plan yet: turning Mercury City into an entirely corporate-run metropolis. From the schools to the sidewalks, everything will be owned and run by HappyCorp, and every resident will become a HappyCorp employee. There will be no more minimum wage, no more public services, and no more unions. HappyCorp has already begun unleashing its Smile Drones to convert the city&rsquo;s infrastructure, crush protests, and ensure every resident watches its Commercial Breaks.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of the Strike Council to lead a city-wide rebellion of workers against HappyCorp&rsquo;s take over, while also fighting for better livelihoods for all. Players will grow their ranks, mobilize their workers, and launch strikes around Mercury City. As the Strike Council scores victories for workers, they will gain the support of more allies, from the dockworkers to the teachers, and build new bases of support from the manufacturing district to the university.<br/><br/>Players takes on one of eight unique characters, such as Valentina the Factory Worker and Candace the Firefighter, each who has their own stats and two unique combination of powers. On their turn, players will add four actions to their character boards in order to add new Strikers to the board, stop HappyCrop, and complete &quot;STRIKE!&quot; cards in their hands, such as &quot;Take over the Bridge&quot; and &quot;Block HappyCorp Delivery Trucks.&quot; They will also play Ally Cards, which will give them more energy to defend themselves from HappyCorp and aid other players' efforts.  At the end of each players' turn, however, they will have to draw a Commercial Break card - which will cause them to remove Strikers, lose resources, and add new drones to the board.<br/><br/>Players win collectively if they score 15 points, thereby abolishing HappyCorp from Mercury City. HappyCorp wins if it reaches 15 points of its own, or if it gets 5 of its feared MegaDrones on the board.<br/><br/>The core gameplay is centered around collaboration: figuring out how and when to best work together to stop HappyCorp and build your city-wide strike. Do you work towards completing the Striker cards in your own hand, or do you set up a teammate to make a big move on their turn? Do you want to disassemble that MegaDrone so another player can strike, or do you want to increase your own character&rsquo;s energy? Either way, HappyCorp will be constantly deploying its drones and playing Commercial Breaks - so act quickly!<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to lead the worker rebellion to defeat HappyCorp? Or will you soon be an employee of HappyCity?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players each have a set of colored strips, with each strip containing a couple black bars across them, with the goal of solving puzzles by aligning the black bars on those strips.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, each player takes a board which limits the placement of strips.  The board also shows eight groupings of strips that may be used for the round (3 strips for a beginner game, and 4 strips for the advanced game).  A player then rolls an 8 sided die which dictates which grouping must be used for the round, and then players race to fit the strips onto their boards in a way that creates a continuous black bar across all of them by ordering and lining the strips up properly.<br/><br/>The first player to finish gets to roll 4 dice, the results of which allow the player to advance down a scoring track.  The second player to finish gets to roll 3 dice, and all other players who complete the puzzle in the time limit get to roll 2 dice.  So, finishing early means a better chance to advance further on the score track, but does not guarantee victory due to the luck element.<br/><br/>Once a player advances to the end of the score track, the game is complete and that player wins!<br/><br/>",

You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the 40 scenarios.  Design is by Panzer Grenadier veteran Mike Perryman (Workers and Peasants among many others).<br/><br/>In this game the German Army wields new weapons for its long-planned offensive. Panther tanks, Ferdinand tank destroyers, Goliath explosive tanks and more are in the German arsenal. The Soviets counter with masses of the excellent T-34 medium tank, plus Lend-Lease Churchill tanks, T-70 light tanks and much more.<br/><br/>There are four semi-rigid mapboards, just like those found in August 1914 or 1940 - The Fall of France. Plus 517 scorchless and sootless playing pieces. And 40 scenarios.<br/><br/>This game and its companion, Kursk - South Flank are exactly the games for which the Panzer Grenadier series was intended.

This round's Captain wants to find the most obvious link between this central word and one of the outer words. The Captain indicates their choice on their answer wheel, and all other players try to guess the Captain's choice. Each player who guesses correctly wins a star, and the Captain collects a star as long as at least one player earned a star this round.<br/><br/>For the next round, the player to the Captain's left becomes the new Captain. They flip over the word card matching the previous Captain's choice, place it in the center of the game board, then everyone guesses how the new Captain will link this newly revealed word to one of the remaining words on the perimeter.<br/><br/>After eleven rounds, the game ends, and players tally their stars to determine the success level of the team. The best possible score is 11 times the number of players. How did you do?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On 9 September 1940, the Italian 10th Army marched across the Egyptian frontier with visions of Roman glory quickening their step. Six months later, General Erwin Rommel would push German troops to restore all that the Italians lost, and then capture those parts of Egypt that were part of the original Axis plan. The British and their Commonwealth allies recovered and twice forced Rommel back to his starting point. The armies of both sides maneuvered and intertwined in ferocious battles at soon to become famous locations, including Tobruk, Gazala, Halfaya Pass, Buq Buq, El Alamein and others. The pace of mechanized warfare would sweep the Western Desert no less than 5 times in what would be defined as the most elastic theater of operations in WWII, where supply drove the tempo, and the open flank beckoned one more offensive!<br/><br/>Desert Victory: North Africa, 1940-1942 is a low-complexity, high-detailed wargame set in eastern Libya and western Egypt during the formative years of WWII. Following on the heels of Battle for Kursk: The Tigers are Burning, 1943 found in C3iNr34, it is the second volume of the C3i Combined Arms Series and uses many of the same mechanics. In DV players manage their supplies and maneuver their forces to achieve victory in a game where both sides rapidly switch between offense and defense. Not familiar with the Western Desert campaign? No problem, as the Turn Record Track shows exactly what happened historically, allowing players to learn history and compare their game progress to actual results. Of paramount importance is the capture of coastal towns that allow a side to move their Supply Head forward to enable more efficient movement and combat. Furthermore, displacing an opponent&rsquo;s Supply Head may frustrate their plans and capture much needed fuel. Supply, reinforcements, and replacements are all set at historical levels, and it&rsquo;s up to the players to assess the correlation of forces and decide the opportune moment to press forward in search of the elusive automatic win; can you formulate a plan to achieve Desert Victory before your offensive power expires?<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Units: Brigade, Division or Corps <br/>Map: 1 Hex = 25 miles <br/>Turns: Quarterly Turns (three months per turn)<br/>Playing Time: 2 to 3 hours<br/><br/>",

In medieval England times are hard, and to feed your family you will be forced to trek into the countryside, where you hope to slay the mysterious beasts that seem to be plaguing the tiny town of Hamlet. You have heard tales of the wretched creatures regurgitated from the Hamletsmaw, and though travellers shout of their horror, they also whisper through drink-numbed lips of the treasures that may be found within their guts.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple; be the player with the most loot once every player is dead. The journey there is not such a simple one though.<br/><br/>Each round of gameplay consists of a day and night phase. Creatures are drawn from a deck and placed in a grid at the centre of the table, where during the day players will choose which to face. Many things will affect the outcome of this combat, such as ammunition type equipped, creature health, defence, and number of attacks, and player health and items. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, and if the player survives they may receive a loot reward. These rewards can be sold for gold, crafted into better items that will be worth more in the future, or eaten to stave off death.<br/><br/>While players have control during the day, once the sun sets and night settles across the land, the creatures in play will follow them back to camp, setting upon the doomed adventurers. No loot can be won during the chaos of night, leaving survival the only reward to a successful defence.<br/><br/>At the same time, all players are competing to become the richest hero, so back-stabbing, betrayal, theft, and murder will be in abundance. The most important thing to remember is that death is inevitable, so take joy in your friend's suffering, and race to meet them on the other side!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ecologies: Bizarre Biomes is the second game in the series. It is playable as a stand alone game or used in combination with the original Ecologies card game. Designed by a biology teacher, the game includes 77 unique organisms, 7 biomes, and beautiful vintage Victorian art. (108 cards total). Gameplay is rooted in authentic science, as it is used in the classroom to teach real concepts to biology students. While it is scientific enough for the classroom, it is also strategic enough for any game night.<br/><br/>This game is a sequel AND an expansion. When using the game as an expansion, you can customize the deck to include cards from both games, including cards you love and excluding ones you don&rsquo;t. Some players love aggressive &ldquo;take that&rdquo; mechanics, while others find them stressful. Some players love particular healthy ecology bonuses, while others feel they are overpowered. With multiple decks, you can create a customized experience to fit your group. If you&rsquo;d like to maintain the same game length and feel, we recommend choosing 10 factor cards and 7 different biomes.<br/><br/>Players build and maintain food webs in diverse environments. Healthy ecologies reward you with bonus powers and perks. Watch out though, as others may decide it&rsquo;s easier to disturb and degrade your ecosystem than nurture their own.<br/><br/>Cards are arranged with plants on the bottom and predators on top. Players negotiate trades and use biotic and abiotic factor cards to affect their webs and the webs of players around them. It is a race to get to 12 victory points, with players using different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or disrupting other ecologies.<br/><br/>The points system is based on ecological trophic levels. The producers (plants) are worth less and as you make your way up the pyramid organisms are worth more, as it takes a lot of energy to sustain them. In real life only roughly 10% of the energy makes it from one level to the next, meaning you have to have acres of land and hundreds of animals just to sustain one apex predator.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With two players, one takes on the role of General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, while the other player assumes the role of General George C. Meade, commander of the Union Army of the Potomac.  With more players, each assumes command of one or more corps.  According to the publisher, the game is most enjoyable with between four and six players.<br/><br/>While not overly simple, the game is not complex, and experienced wargamers will have little difficulty with the mechanics of play.  There are six scenarios, including a campaign scenario that simulates all three days of the battle.  The publisher suggests that the four-turn &quot;Assault on the Round Tops&quot; scenario be played first in order to become familiar with the game turn sequence and the line-of-sight rules.  Depending on the scenario selected, playing time is between 2 and 18 hours.  <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Decision Games' website:)<br/><br/>Throughout the mid-5th century AD, Attila's Huns terrorized Europe. The skill of the Hun horsemen, particularly their accuracy with the composite bow while mounted, made them a veritable shock army. They continued to bring victory after victory to Attila, making him the master of Central Europe. After years of conquest, oppression and extortion, however, Attila's recent invasion of Western Europe would be challenged: a remnant Roman army, under the command of Flavius Aetius, was sent to stop him on a field known as the Catalaunian Plain, near the village of Chalons. The Battle of Chalons would decide the fate of Europe.<br/><br/>Chalons utilizes the tried-and-true Battles of the Ancient World system, providing a simple yet accurate portrayal of ancient warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all of the details that characterized warfare in the era of sword and shield. Various units may simply be swordsmen, while others may be archers or javelin throwers, horsemen, etc. The system includes rules for leaders, charges, melee, diversionary attacks, demoralization and more. A group of barbarians, for example, may be ordered to charge an enemy phalanx that had already hurled their javelins. As the barbarians near the phalanx, however, they may be ambushed by enemy ballistas hidden behind the ranks and waiting to disrupt just such a charge.<br/><br/>In Chalons the traditional design of the classic Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the true strictures of ancient warfare. Famous leaders, such as Attila, also influence combat, replicating the importance of their presence during battle. Winning will depend on deployment, maneuver and opportunity, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    17 x 22&quot; (43 x 56 cm) terrain map<br/>    100 die-cut counters<br/>    One Standard Rules booklet for this series<br/>    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title<br/><br/><br/>",

The goods are a set collection objective where you get more points for having multiple different types of goods. (this means that you have to travel to the multiple islands or trade with another merchant for them) <br/>Magical Compasses-A player is also awarded points at the end of the game for each &quot;magical compass&quot; that they possess. All the players are given these through out the game but they can also gain these in trades from other players. <br/>Debt-Each player is deducted points based on the amount of debt that they have gained throughout the game. A player will obtain debt any time that they come into contact with pirates and are unable to bribe them with a good. In this instance the pirates attach the ship and the player gains debt which represents the price that they had to pay for repairs <br/>The player with the total highest score wins. In the case of a tie, the player with the most magical compasses left wins.<br/><br/>Game Play: Players take turns in clockwise fashion. They will draw two cards and add them to their hand. They then choose to play a card (a treasure map, port city, or action card) these will commonly affect the active player (Exceptions would include some action cards). The player then chooses to discard a card. The card discarded allows the player to choose a pirate on the map and move it accordingly<br/><br/>Player Powers: Each player has a unique player power that allows for new strategies and replayability!<br/><br/>Action Cards: Allow the player to preform more complex combos or implement some take that upon the other players.<br/><br/>Event Cards: These are cards that are dispersed throughout the draw deck. When they appear they do not count as one of your draws or plays but they are played immediately and affect all players.<br/><br/>Treasure Islands: The game starts with one treasure island in the middle of the board. When a player sails across a treasure island they have now discovered it and found the treasure. That treasure island will disappear off the map and a new treasure island location will be randomly generated. Event cards such as &quot;Tales of More Treasure&quot; cause new treasure islands to be generated onto the board so that by the end of the game there are multiple options of islands that you can choose to sail towards.<br/><br/>The Pirates: There are four pirate ships that can be moved across the board according to each players discard. You can use the pirates to discover the treasure islands (the pirate would get the treasure) if an opponent is getting to close to it for comfort. You can also sail the pirate into another player forcing them to lose a good or accumulate debt. You may also place a pirate on the port cities to help blockade your opponent merchants from gathering the goods from that city.<br/><br/>Game End: The game end can be triggered in two ways. When a player has collected 3 treasures or when the pirates have collected 6 treasures. When the game end is triggered, the players finish the round and then calculate final scoring.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scoundrel is a single player rogue-like card game for use with a standard deck of playing cards. It was developed by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg.<br/><br/>All Jokers, red face cards, and red aces are removed from the deck. The remaining cards serve as monsters (spades and clubs), weapons (diamonds), and health potions (hearts) valued from 2-14 (Two through Ace). The rooms of the dungeon are created by laying out cards in groups of four. Progress is made through the dungeon by playing three of the four dungeon cards. The fourth card serves as the foundation for a new room. Rooms can be reset in their entirety as many times as needed but never twice in a row.<br/><br/>Weapons may be equipped to attack multiple monsters in descending order of their value with damage being dealt to the player for monster values in excess of the equipped weapon. The weapon breaks if it is used to attack a monster of equal or greater value than the previous monster. Attacking a monster without an equipped weapon depletes the players health for the full attack value of the monster. Health potions may be used to increase life points up to the maximum starting value of 20. Playing a second potion in succession nullifies the effect of the second potion.<br/><br/>The game ends when life points reach zero or the player has progressed through the entire dungeon.<br/><br/>",

Submissive people served their idols, who sought to gain more and more power through the blind faith of their followers. However, the arrogance of the gods and their incessant confrontations led to their decline and almost extinction. The last survivors hid in oblivion waiting to return, more powerful than ever.<br/><br/>In the years that followed, humanity was thirsty for knowledge and understanding. This triggered the awakening of the gods who demanded eternal faith and obedience in order to regain their power. Soon, epic battles between gods spread throughout the world and humanity descended into chaos.<br/><br/>The Dark Ages returned more tyrannical than ever. The gods, along with their followers, are fighting to be the only ones to rule. Who will be the last god to control humanity?

On their turn a player must first draw a card and then perform 1 main action:<br/><br/>Use the Ability of a card (e.g. Activate an Altar, draw additional cards, destroy enemy Altars etc.), Perform a Ritual to build a Shrine and place it on their god&rsquo;s Realm or Worship a god. When worshipping a follower is placed face-up next to their god&rsquo;s realm to show where they activate their abilities and protect against the enemy gods. In addition to the main action, a player may take any number of free actions.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player builds at least one Shrine and discovers and activates all the Altars on their god's Realm.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Eagle Day is a two- player wargame covering the most critical period of the Battle of Britain. The Luftwaffe player must move bombers and their escorts to attack targets in Britain, while the RAF player must utilize interceptors to stop them.<br/><br/>Each player moves units representing historic wings and groups. All the famous aircraft are here, including Spitfires, Hurricanes, Me-109s, Ju-88s, He-111s and many more. Each unit is rated for air superiority, bombing and speed. The game uses a new and unique system that facilitates aerial operations, dispensing with record keeping.<br/><br/>Eagle Day is part of the Air Wars mini-game series. Each player has a deck of Campaign Cards. They generate a range of events, including Fuehrer Directives, the Empire Rallies, and critical morale checks. Certain cards can be played in combination to gain operational advantage, leading to tense decision making. There are special rules for radar, fog of war, and the infamous Stukas.<br/><br/>",

This game is based upon the typical life of a late medieval English court. Many Kings came under the influence of a select inner group of courtiers who used their influence to gain gifts of land, titles, money etc.<br/><br/>This game recreates the desperate race to get the best and the most gifts for yourself. The game is played over three rounds; each round the King visits a royal castle or house (The Kings Progress). Your aim is to gain the most prestige for your family by collecting courtier cards, melding them to build your influence and thus gain control of the courtiers, advancing those courtiers to the royal castle and then using the courtiers to select various gifts for yourself. Gifts and courtier control gain victory points at the end of each round. As the game progresses gifts become more valuable. Each courtier also has a character ability which can be used by the player in control to gain extra actions or other advantages.<br/><br/>",

As you fight your way throughout the South Atlantic and potentially the Indian Ocean, you will encounter various Allied warships, merchantmen, and unexpected opportunities and objectives. German ships in the game are shown in detail with the Allied ships shown in a more abstract manner. Each turn represents one full day. Nautical spaces are about 100 nautical miles apart with the game system using point to point movement. Most warship counters represent one ship each.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Old School Tactical is the first in a dynamic series of fresh, tactical war games. OST simulates, through an easily-learned game system, small unit engagements on the Eastern Front during 1941-42.<br/><br/>Two players contest each scenario using counters representing the soldiers, guns, and vehicles that fought these desperate battles. On each turn play goes back and forth between the sides as Impulse Points are spent to enable a player's forces to act. When the battle is over, casualty and victory points are tallied and a victor is declared.<br/><br/>Infantry target other soft units and attack using their Firepower value against the target&rsquo;s Defense value.  The attack can be modified by Leadership, support weapons and terrain effects. And when things get intense, Assault moves into enemy hexes result in deadly Close Combat.  Dice rolls are made using the Infantry Combat Table and results are implemented.  Attacking armored vehicles requires a roll to Hit the vehicle at range.  If a Hit is scored, the Firepower value of the attacker&rsquo;s gun is used against the target&rsquo;s front or flank Defense value.  Dice rolls are made using the Vehicle Combat Table and results are enforced. Vehicles may also use their HE Firepower value and secondary armaments directly against soft targets using the Infantry Combat Table.<br/><br/>Old School Tactical (OST) Vol I is the game that started the Old School Tactical train rolling. With its huge maps, straightforward play, and realistic feel, the game was an instant hit. So much of a hit that it sold out. Sold out and was reprinted and then the reprint sold out, but now...<br/>Now it&rsquo;s back in the ring, to take another swing. Not a reprint, but a full up 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s new? The art. The counter art.<br/><br/>Shayne has redone the illustrations for all the soldiers (infantry units) for both sides, and enhanced the drawings of the vehicles.<br/><br/>The rules. Old School Tactical Vol I 2nd Edition comes with the absolute latest, bleeding edge OST rules. OST version.<br/><br/>The player aids. The Vol I Player Aid Cards have been brought up to the latest standards that includes the latest Vehicle Combat Table, which changed after the original printing.<br/><br/>Scenarios. The scenarios include corrections necessitated by errata, as well as a layout upgrade to bring them in line with Vol II and Vol III. Additionally, the game boosts 2 new tutorial scenarios, playable by newbies and grognards alike.<br/><br/>--description from publisher<br/><br/>",

This removes a lot of the standard openings of chess and means you have to adapt your strategy to the board each time you play.<br/><br/>Colour Chess won a Family and Education Award from Imagination Gaming and has an annual World Championships as part of the Mind Sports Olympiad in London.

        "description": "&quot;Goeben, 1914&quot; is a wargame simulation which puts you in command of the SMS Goeben, the German battlecruiser that made a historically epic voyage through the Mediterranean during the opening days of World War One. This is a solitaire wargame in which the player must accomplish a specific &ldquo;objective&rdquo; to win the game, which will be generated at random at the start of the scenario. The player must manage the various outfittings and functions of the SMS Goeben and its escorting light cruiser, the SMS Breslau. As you fight your way through the Mediterranean, you will encounter various Allied warships, merchantmen for raiding, and unexpected opportunities and objectives. These are represented by &ldquo;Incident&rdquo; chits.<br/><br/>German ships in the game are shown in detail. Allied ships are shown in a more abstract way because you, the player, are seeing the situation from the standpoint of Admiral Souchon, the fleet commander of the German Mediterranean Division. The possibility of running into enemy warships will be increased via the &ldquo;Alert Level&rdquo;, which represents how much the Royal Navy&rsquo;s Admiralty is concentrating its resources against your task force. The game can be played with two players, one in command of the Goeben, the other in command of the Breslau.<br/> Each game turn represents about one day, and each sea spaces are approximately 100 miles apart. Most warship counters represent one ship each, although some counters represent flotillas, such as destroyer and convoy chits.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Harvest of Death: The Second Day at Gettysburg is an excellent Tactical level &quot;mini-wargame&rdquo; released in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #129. Depicts the often designed fighting in, on and around &quot;Little Round Top&quot; during the Rebel assault in the late afternoon of the 2nd day of Gettysburg. Players receive points for destroying enemy brigades as well as several geographical features of the battlefield such as Little Round Top, Devil's Den, the Peach Orchard, the infamous Wheat Field and the Angle. Silhouette style counters depicting Union and Rebel troops in the traditional Blue and Gray colors add to the feel of the ebb and flow of the fighting. The map is quite small but is more than useful and never seems to get crowded.<br/><br/>One huge bonus... the game can be played solitaire, as rules have been added so a solo player can take control of the advancing Confederates, whilst the game mechanics take care of the defending Union brigades.<br/><br/>One wishes that more &quot;smaller&rdquo; scale and sized wargames had been produced over the years, I recommend this game to all ACW wargamers and anyone who likes solo wargaming.<br/><br/>Nominee for the 1989 Charles S. Roberts awards for Best Pre-World War II Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards).<br/><br/>",

Players control an organization with the resources and intent to explore, develop, and colonize the worlds beyond Earth. Organizations that practice careful planning and resource management, with a healthy dose of technology research will succeed. Destination: Neptune moves through four generations of space exploration. Players earn Victory Points by building large commercial outposts and colonies, as well as from fame and outright purchases. After four generations, the player with the most Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>This is a card driven game in which most Cards have an action that happens immediately, and another action for all of the players (including the player who played the card). Players can also sell cards in exchange for currency. When you sell a card, it goes to an Opportunity Track and is placed to the side of the board. If the Opportunity Track already has as many cards as players, the rightmost card is discarded. You may not change the order of the cards in the Opportunity Track. Players can play cards from the Opportunity Track as if they were in their hands.<br/><br/>Players must use the cards to gain currency and fuel in order to launch space missions to establish bases, factories and colonies on various locations within our solar system. Careful hand and resource management is key to winning the game. In addition, players also need to research certain technologies in order to build on most locations. Technologies are researched through card play and paying currency. The cards are separated into 4 piles which are separate generations. At the end of each generation, each player scores points for the various structures they've built. The game ends when all generation piles have been exhausted.<br/><br/>",

So you do not know the exact strength of the opposing piece, only its strength relative to your own piece (and so too your opponent does not know the exact strength of the piece you used to attack with).  This feature makes the game quite a bit more interesting than standard Stratego.<br/><br/>&middot; Instead of moving one of your pieces on your turn, you can &ldquo;probe&rdquo; an opposing piece to find its strength.  You will not be given its exact strength, but instead what &ldquo;class&rdquo; it is in (8-9, 5-7, or all else)<br/><br/>&middot; Bombs are no longer playing pieces but are hidden features on your side of the board that are programmed into the game.  You secretly select six spaces in which to place the bombs.  Your own pieces can move through these spaces unharmed, but any enemy pieces (except a Miner) landing on these spaces will be destroyed!<br/><br/>&middot; Scouts can move and strike diagonally, and can strike from a distance.<br/><br/>The player who finds and captures his opponent's flag first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

His goal was Warsaw, but it was only a passing phase. After conquering Poland, the aim was to export the revolution to Germany and then to all of Europe. However, Piłsudski, the commander of the Polish army, ordered a desperate counterattack against the southern flank of the Western Front, which was created by the delay in the advance of the Southwestern Front. With this blow, the Western Front collapsed, and the dying Poland was saved by the &quot;Miracle of the Wisła River&quot;.<br/>Warsaw 1920 is a two-player strategy game based on the Polish-Soviet War. One player is in charge of the Russian army, aiming to take control of Poland. The other player is in charge of the Polish army, protecting the newly independent country from the red tsunami.<br/>The game system is a typical &quot;IGO-UGO&quot; with both players alternating turns, but each player can combine up to three movement or combat phases, and the Russians are constrained by supply, so players will have a lot of decisions to make.<br/><br/>",

Movement consists of either <br/>a) a straight pass flight (no altitude change)<br/>b) a climb (increasing the height of the piece by adding an additional ring) or <br/>c) a dive (losing height to make a sequence of moves by removing one ring per descent height). <br/>Pieces are captured when they are in the line of fire of two or more enemy planes. Clouds block line of fire and provide strategic cover during play.<br/><br/>If a player is reduced to having only one plane, he's shot from the sky (i.e., is eliminated from the game). A player wins when he reduces the only remaining opponent to only one plane. Games are brutal, fast, and fun.<br/><br/>The base game includes components for a 2-player game. If you wish to add more players you'll need the expansion (one per additional player).<br/><br/>COMPONENTS (NESTORGAMES edition)<br/><br/>Base game (2 players): Board (2 pads), 16 foam clouds, 40 altitude rings (laser cut 8mm 'ice' acrylic), 2 small plastic boxes, 5 red biplanes, 5 green biplanes, carrying case.<br/><br/>Expansion (per extra player): 5 biplanes (orange or yellow), 20 altitude counters, carrying case. Please indicate colour if you purchase one set only. You can see the biplanes in the pictures below.<br/><br/>",

If you correctly identify the image, you can then bid some amount of poker chips to answer a trivia question relating to the object named on the card, or you can auction off the right to answer a trivia question. Questions come in three varieties &mdash; true/false, multiple choice, and open ended &mdash; and the payouts are higher for the tougher questions: 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1. Answer correctly, and you collect more chips as well as the card; collecting sets of cards gives you bonus points, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The game board and play resembles that of Checkers, but captured pieces remain on the board and can possibly be freed later in the game.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game on the 7x7 board with eleven soldiers. On a turn, a player moves one soldier diagonally forward one space. If a capture is available, then the player must make that capture, trapping the captured piece underneath the capturing one; if the newly captured piece had previously had one or more pieces underneath it, then those pieces are now free to move in future turns. If a soldier reaches the opponent's back row, it's flipped and promoted to an officer, which can move diagonally in all directions. The game continues until either a player can't move or a player has no pieces remaining on the board. In both cases, this player loses the game.<br/><br/>Laska was influenced by Bashni.<br/><br/>",

There are three shapes in three colors, 54 tiles total, one shape per tile. The board is a tilted easel; you slide your tile down one of the 7 grooves till it reaches the lowest available spot. After that it can't be moved. The four-in-a-row may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. The trick is to concentrate on your objective (color or shape) while keeping an eye on what your move does for your opponent.

        "description": "Mia is an ancient bluffing dice game using two dice and a cup to conceal the dice. There are affinities with Perudo (and the card game Cheat), but also some interesting differences. Mia is often purported to have been played by the Vikings.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling the dice beneath a cup and announcing a higher roll than the previous roll.  This announcement can be challenged, with the roller losing a life if caught lying, and the challenger losing a life if the roller was truthful (players typically start with three lives).  There is also the option (instead of rolling the dice oneself or challenging the previous roller) of  passing your turn (without viewing the roll under the cup) to the next player.  In this case the passer assumes responsibility for the roll as if he or she had rolled it him- or herself.  (Thus, if the next player challenges the announced value, it is the passer who stands to lose a life if the value under the cup is not that which was announced.)<br/><br/>One interesting feature of Mia is the non-standard ordering of rolls. &quot;21&quot; is &quot;Mia&quot;, the highest roll.  Next come the doubles in ascending order: 11 is the second best roll, then 22, 33, 44, 55, 66.  From there the numbers descend, with the higher die always naming the tens value and the lower die naming the ones value:  65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 54, 53, 52, 51, 43, 42, 41, 32, and 31 as the lowest value.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object is to win the game by ridding yourself of all cards in your hand before your opponent<samp>.<br/><br/>Game Summary<br/><br/>Decide on a scorekeeper. Once the cards have been shuffled, the scorekeeper deals 3 cards face down to each player, along with an equal number of white dice, called a stash. The scorekeeper places the remaining cards face down off to one side of the table to form a deck.<br/><br/>The scorekeeper begins the game by rolling two dice (1 black &amp; 1 white) in the center of the table. If no one scores, play rotates clockwise to the next player who rolls two dice. Any two die, including the black die can be rolled (see below). Before each roll players examine their cards to see what dice combinations will be needed to match a card in their hand.<br/><br/>Two white dice from your stash, or. <br/>One die from your stash, and one (previously rolled) die from the table, or<br/>Two (previously rolled) dice from the table.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s take turns rolling until someone shouts STRUT! indicating a player believes they have won the round. A round is won when you match a card in your hand with a dice combination on the table. Let&rsquo;s say you have a 4 of a Kind (card) in your hand. There are 8 dice on the table 1,3,4,6 and four 5&rsquo;s: 5, 5, 5. You quickly shout Strut! believing your dice combination (four 5&rsquo;s) matches the card (4 of a Kind) in your hand, thus winning the round. But have you? You have if one of your 5&rsquo;s is the black die. The black die must always be part of the score.<br/><br/>Keeping score is very simple. All dice on the table are scored. The black die counts face value [1]=1 point, [2]= 2 points [3]=3 points, etc. White dice count 1 point each. In the example above, you scored a total of 12 points (5 points for the black die and 7 points for the white dice.)<br/><br/>After each round the winner&rsquo;s points are totaled by the scorekeeper. After the scorekeeper has recorded the points, the winner discards his/her winning card, placing it &ldquo;face up&rdquo; under the deck. If the winner&rsquo;s accumulated score totals less than 30 points then he/she must draw one new card from the deck. If the winner has accumulated 30 or more points, no card is drawn allowing that player to begin ridding his/her hand of cards in an attempt to win the game. (Re-Action cards are an exception to the &ldquo;30 points&rdquo; rule.) All other players keep their cards. Dice on the table are evenly redistributed. Note: As you will see as the game progresses, tactics and strategies become a big part of each round.<br/><br/>The winner begins the next round by rolling 1 black and 1 white die. Play continues until someone shouts Strut! The first player to accumulate 30 or more points with no cards remaining in their hand wins the game.<br/><br/>The Black Rooster<br/><br/>If an opponent throws the Black Rooster card down on your winning card, it spells disaster! You must turn in all the cards in your hand, and draw 3 replacements. Plus, you lose all your accumulated points.<br/><br/>",

In addition, players may flee from the scene, betraying the others to win the game on their own or be turned into zombies themselves.<br/><br/>Zombies have different abilities, like stealing a die from the players when in play. They all require different die values and numbers to be rolled to be discarded. Some will be attracted by players, who attack them, others ignore them and stay focused on the bus. Each zombie attacking a player reduces their capability to reroll by one. If this is decreased to zero, the player is turned into a Zombie him- or herself and will stay in front of the bus for the rest of the game, eliminated unless another player finds a cure. Whenever there are four or more zombies next to the bus at the end of a turn (including players turned into zombies), the players lose. So distracting zombies from the bus, is sometimes a necessity. In addition, player gain loot tokens, whenever a zombie is killed in front of them.<br/><br/>However, the winning condition is not killing the zombies, but rescuing all cheerleaders from the bus. For this, rolling star symbols is required. Cheerleaders are tokens, placed in two stacks on the bus, each showing two to four stars. Only cheerleaders on top of a stack can be rescued any given time, rolling the corresponding numbers of stars. Some zombies make use of stars impossible, while they are in play.<br/><br/>In addition to the stars and different symbols, required to kill the zombies, there is also a die face with half a bullseye. One die rolled on that side is worthless, but two could be used as a wild for any symbol to kill a zombie.<br/><br/>Players also have a special character ability, e.g. one gets two loot tokens instead of one for a zombie killed in front of them, one can ignore the &quot;no star&quot; restriction of particular zombies, etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Match magic symbols to summon elder gods, demons, and mythological monsters, then use them to attack your opponents.<br/><br/>You start with two decks of cards: SPELLS and SUMMONS. Spell cards each have 4-6 different magic symbols on them. Each player starts with 2 Spell cards and then draws 1 new card every turn. You can never have more than 6 Spell cards in your hand at once though. The goal is to pair up matching symbols across your Spell cards to create hands, sort of like a weird, alternate universe version of poker. Once you've matched up a complete Spell hand, you trade it in to draw Summon cards. How many Summon cards you can draw in a turn depends on the complexity of the hand you trade in for it.Summon cards depict a deity, demon, or monster from a variety of mythological, religious, literary, or just plain made-up sources. Each Summon card has an ability that you can play against your competitors to make them lose turns, discard spell cards, or other nefarious setbacks. Each and every Summon card you play puts you one step closer to victory, until...<br/><br/>For a 30-45 minute game, the first person to play 7 Summon cards wins! Want a longer game? Really challenge yourself and play to 13 Summon cards. That's the basics. Pretty simple, huh? Oh, one little twist I forgot to mention...<br/><br/>Included in the Summon deck are the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They're extremely powerful cards by themselves, but if by some unholy fluke you manage to draw and play all four of them in a game, you win instantly, no matter how many other Summon cards you've played.<br/><br/>And... shuffled into the Spell card deck are also Curse cards, which can totally throw off even the best player's strategy. They can make YOU lose turns, give other players cards, or other setbacks, so watch out! The tables can turn at any time and nobody is ever safe for long.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the back of the box:)<br/><br/>War in Europe is the largest single strategy game ever professionally published. This update of the revered SPI &quot;monster&quot; game is a simulation of World War II at the division/corps level. There are nine 22&quot; x 34&quot; map sections covering an area from the North Cape of Norway to the deserts of Libya and the Middle East and from the British Isles to the city of Stalingrad. Each hex represents 33 kilometers of ground and each Game Turn represents one week of actual time.<br/><br/>War in Europe's most striking feature is the map. Over 25 countries are delineated with their industrial and resource centers, major and minor ports, significant cities, rivers and other fascinating geographic features. All of this has been beautifully rendered using satellite photography and state of the art graphic design techniques.<br/><br/>The rules have been painstakingly updated and many new optional rules and variants are featured along with carefully revised charts and tables. In addition to War in Europe's original 3600 die-cut counters, representing the armed forces of over 20 nations, there are 480 new counters in this updated edition (optional units that might have been assembled to allow exploration of some historical &quot;what ifs?&quot;) . You'll be campaigning with artillery units for all sides, German motorized units, U.S. Marines, additional Soviet Guard Tank and Mechanized units, and more French armored should you decide to build them using the game's fascinating production system.<br/><br/>All sides must manage their own war economies. Players must make choices within certain broad limits what combat units to build. For example, you must choose whether to build relatively expensive strategic units such as Air Points, Airborne capability, U-boats, Strategic Bombers, Naval units, or the more common ground combat units like infantry and armor. The routine of production is executed every four Game Turns (weeks) during a &quot;Strategic Cycle&quot; that also features Reinforcement, the U-boat War, and Strategic Bombing.<br/><br/>Although War in Europe is a big game, its complexity is not high. It can easily be played solitaire, but is most enjoyable with two or three players or teams. Players represent the leadership of the Western Allies (Commonwealth and USA), the German-dominated Axis, or the Soviet Union. Play moves back and forth over the map for nearly six years in the full Campaign Game (or for less time in the numerous scenarios provided), as the fortunes of the Axis Player rise and fall in the face of the increasing Allied and Soviet strength.<br/><br/>War in Europe also features numerous Campaign Scenarios that pick up play at historic watersheds like D-Day or the start of Barbarossa. There are even more abbreviated games in the form of limited historical scenarios using just one to four maps. These dispense with the Strategic cycle in its entirety and simulate the major events of the war, such as the Fall of France, the Invasion of Italy, or the Stalingrad Campaign. Physically, they are much easier to play than a full campaign and are complete games within themselves. Players may also focus on just the Eastern or Western Front for individual scenarios as well as the whole war.<br/><br/>A three-cornered diplomatic situation also arises from the strategic situation. While early on the Allies and Soviets share the common goal of defeating the Axis, as Germany's defeat becomes more certain there is less ground for cooperation and more chance of their alliances falling apart. Victory is determined by the relative territorial stance of the Players at game's end so, ultimately, it's an every-man-for-himself game.<br/><br/>So, it's back, and better than ever. War in Europe is not just for collectors anymore. This second edition version is for you, the strategy game lover who wants to fight &quot;The Big One&quot; with The Big One of gaming.<br/><br/>War in Europe: it's not just for collectors anymore.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    4080 backprinted, full color die cut counters<br/>    3 Production Displays<br/>    3 Reinforcement &amp; Air Displays<br/>    3 Player Aid Charts &amp; Tables<br/>    2 48 page Rulebook<br/>    9 34&quot; x 22&quot; full color maps<br/>    2 dice &amp; Storage bags<br/><br/><br/>",

Each character also has a power and defensive value.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards and placing them face up or face down in front of them. During their turns, players then attack each others' characters. By rule, you have to attack face up characters before attacking face down characters. This makes finding and killing the King more difficult had all the characters started in the face up position. Once you've attacked a face down character, it flips up assuming it survives the attack. If it remains on the table on your next turn, you have the option of placing it face down again and shuffle its position.<br/><br/>This game is NOT Bruno Faidutti's Mascarade.<br/><br/>",

The map scale is 10 miles per hex, turns cover one month each, while units are mostly regiments and brigades, with specialist battalions and a few Italian and Vichy French divisions. The turn sequence is built around a pair of move-fight impulses for each player, with separate phases for events altering the situation (like the frequent Commonwealth campaigns elsewhere in the Middle East), application of air and naval power, and initiative determination. Logistics is the paramount consideration given the vast distances.

The estimated gameplay time is 15 &ndash; 30 minutes.<br/>Participants play the roles of the eponymous kingpins &ndash; mafia bosses. The objective of the game is to defeat the enemy mafia, led by the opponent.<br/><br/>In Kingpin, players choose between three different crime syndicates: the Italian Mafia, the Russian Mob, and the Yakuza. Each organization has different pieces, changing the style of each game. The Yakuza prefers quiet assassinations, the Russian Mob overcomes its opponents with sheer firepower, and the Mafia specializes in swift drive-by shootings. The game &quot;neo noir&quot; theme borrows heavily from cult gangster movies and graphic novels, such as the works of Quentin Tarantino or Frank Miller.<br/><br/>Three important features of the game are: a two-sided game board featuring two different maps, three victory conditions available for the players, and the lack of randomness during play. The authors describe it as a fast-paced game of nerves, somewhere between a Mexican standoff and a game of chess where the rooks and bishops run around with Tommy-guns.<br/><br/>Because of the suggestive theme, the publisher considered this title unsuitable for children.<br/><br/>The game contains the following components:<br/><br/>- double-sided board,<br/>- 24 gangster tiles,<br/>- 3 action tokens,<br/>- 12 fire tokens,<br/>- game rules.<br/><br/>",

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.<br/><br/>From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).<br/><br/>It works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Slouch Hats and Eggshells: The Allied Invasion of Syria &amp; Lebanon - 1941, recreates the World War II campaign in French-held Syria and Lebanon, historically from early June 1941 through mid-July 1941. One player will control the Axis forces (Vichy French, French colonial troops, and Germans), while his opponent controls the Allied forces (British, Commonwealth, Free French, etc). The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated in the campaign and the map represents the terrain over which those units fought. The players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. One player wins by capturing certain specified objectives while his opponent wins by avoiding those victory conditions.<br/><br/>When Free French leader Gen. de Gaulle visited the Middle East in April 1941 he forced a political crisis by demanding the occupation of Syria. As a result London ordered an offensive to place all of Syria and Lebanon under Free French control. Sadly, such posturing caused Allied command staffs to hold unrealistic views of what the ensuing occupation would look like. Certain authorities believed the Vichy French in Syria would offer only token resistance and their defense would collapse like an eggshell. The thinking held that Vichy forces could be won over with wine and coffee along with displays of the Australian slouch hat. Instead, the Vichy-led troops fought ferociously from the start.<br/><br/>Players should feel free to combine play of this game with that of Rommel's War, published by L2 Design Group. Both games include the same historical moment, have identical scales, and have some of the same historical units. It is natural that players would want to explore more historical alternatives with combined play. To facilitate such game play, this game uses many of the same rules, charts, and tables found in Rommel's War.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 10 days<br/>Hex: 10 miles / 16 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (96 -  0.6&quot; &amp; 20 -  1.2&quot; counters)<br/>One 28-page rulebook<br/>Two 4-page Player Aid Cards (CRT/TEC, etc)<br/>Four 1-page Player Aid Cards (Turn Sequence, Set-up, Counter Information)<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/>Seven plastic storage bags<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium-High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 2 (or medium high solitaire)<br/>Playing Time: 4-6 Hours<br/><br/>",

You may play any number of cards on your turn, but must be careful as you can only replenish your hand with a certain amount of cards regardless of how many you played. Whether or not you want to reduce your hand size to push on farther and beat your competition to a castle is just one of the decisions you'll find yourself making every turn.<br/><br/>Merchants must build paths wisely, for if you can't fully make use of the tiles you play, there is a chance that a competing merchant might be able to speed past you on the path and make his delivery to the castle first. Merchants must also be wary of possible rock slides that can make a path impassable and force them to have to change their plans and find a way around the obstruction.

        "description": "Trolley Car companies of Cleveland, Ohio. This is an 18xx style train game that begins in 1848 and ends in 1980.  There are nine public trolley car companies and one government controlled company.  The game also includes eight private companies that are auctioned off at the beginning of the game.  Players struggle to keep their trolley car companies from falling into the government controlled railroad.  The game ends when the $12,000 bank runs out of funds.  The player with the most personal money plus stock share value wins the game.<br/><br/>The game has eight phases. The first permanent trolley car is the '8'.  Phases 4 and 5 represent the Great Depression and revenue declines during this period of the game in which brown tiles are available.  Brown tiles only contain one station space.  Upgrading a two station space green tile to a single station space brown tile removes a station marker from the board, which simulates trolley companies shrinking during these two phases.<br/><br/>Another unique feature is that a board of directors (3 players) controls the government railroad, which is determined by the player that controls the priority deal card from the previous stock round.  This will change at the end of each stock round assuming a different player holds the priority deal card.<br/><br/>",

Originally published by the OUP in two volumes, Board And Table Games 1 (1960), Board And Table Games 2 (1969), the revised edition in 1979 brought both books together.<br/><br/>Robert Bell wrote the definitive scholastic text on pretty much every ancient abstract board, tile, race and dice game you've heard of, and more you never knew about. With simple illustrations and some b&amp;w photos, the rules and history of each game is quickly and briefly studied. There are even biographies of noted gamers, such as Hoyle.<br/><br/>This is an academic work, for students not children, but even dipping into it will bring great pleasure to any gamer. And Bell constantly encourages the reader to make and play the games shown.<br/><br/>ISBN 0-486-23855-5<br/><br/>",

You live dreaming the life of a film star &mdash; until a telegram announces an unexpected inheritance: two million dollars and the property of a shed on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Will you turn this barren land into the studio of a major film producer &mdash; or squander your fortune fading in the golden dust of the California desert like so many others before you?<br/><br/>The Producer: 1940-1944 is a board game inspired by the great Hollywood movies. The aim of the game is to score more points by winning awards for actors and film directing, building the structures of their studio, or producing more films of different genres. The player must decide which strategy to follow early in the game based on the script and cast with which depart.<br/><br/>The game consists of three or five rounds corresponding to three years. Every year, each player will fish and play in turns six cards event that will simulate the intervention of professionals to improve their own films or sabotage others', or the occurrence of historical facts, such as Pearl Harbor, the invention of the computer, the skirmishes between the Mafia and the FBI. For each card played you will place its own &quot;Producer&quot; (worker) to activate areas on your dashboard (the studios) or different locations on the main scoreboard that represent Hollywood.<br/><br/>You can buy scripts, engage the biggest movie star of the time, young players with a great future and legendary directors. At the time of producing each film, it will extract from a pool of tokens representing the potential audience for that year and the choice of which films produce must be made according to specific strategies to meet the latent demand.<br/><br/>If the production of the film will procure players the money to expand own activities, the award ceremony at the end of each year will give them the necessary points for the win, making the economic aspect important but not relevant to the final score.<br/><br/>At the end of the third year in the base game (or in the case of the fifth game to experts), it will award bonuses and the Reckoning will be to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Every aspect of the game: dynamic production, events, characters, scripts, have been played so historical in order to give movie fans a reproduction as faithful as possible of Hollywood of the 1940s. Every script and character shows in addition to game information, rumors, gossip and curiosity that will delight even the players less competitive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Highlight Maker Hoops is a Basketball sports-replay game that distils the action into the key highlights so a game can be completed in about 20 minutes. It uses a fast action card (FAC) system where each card drawn indicates what kind of action is taking place. Each quarter, you'll draw up to 10 FACs that generate scoring opportunities, rebound possibilities, free throws and player substitutions. Once you understand what each type of action does, the gameplay is pretty quick. Each FAC will usually ask you to check whether the active player on the home or away team has a particular quality. If they do, the team will either score on offence or prevent a score on defence. Once a quarter is completed, the number of scoring successes for each team will then generate a match score that tallies up with normal basketball scoring. After four quarters, if the scores are less than four apart, there is a Final minute phase where furious action can take place to derive a final score. Otherwise, if the score isn't close, you ignore the Final Minute phase.<br/><br/>",

One will be used for definitions, and each player writes their name on top of it; the other will be used for guesses.  One of the players takes the dictionary and looks for an obscure word that they think none of the players will know (i.e. eguzla, exarch or jabot).  That player spells out the word and announces what kind of word it is (verb, name, adjective, etc).<br/><br/>Each player must now imagine and write down a plausible and convincing definition for this word.  The player with the dictionary writes the true definition.  When all players have written their definition down, the player with the dictionary takes all sheets, shuffles them and reads aloud all the definitions.  If necessary, definitions may be repeated. Each player apart from the announcer must then write on their guess sheet who, in his opinion, has written each definition.<br/><br/>When all players have written their definitions, the player with the dictionary unveils the truth and tells who wrote what.  Each player scores:<br/><br/>     2 points if they chose the dictionary definition<br/>     1 point for each other player they correctly identified<br/>     1 point for each player who was tricked into thinking their definition was the dictionary's one<br/>     If no one guessed what the true definition was, the player with the dictionary scores as many points as there are players.<br/><br/><br/>When all players have scored their points, the player with the dictionary gives it to the player on his left.

        "description": "In this fun, light children's game that translates to &quot;In the Devil's Kitchen&quot;, players move little devils in chefs' caps around the underworld, collecting pots, trying to be the first to collect 10 points worth of dishes.  Before the game starts, each player secretly assigns a value of 1, 3, 5 or 'milk' to each of the four pots of his color, then players take turns placing their pots on the board.    Each player's turn consists of rolling dice and moving his devils appropriately, either trying to get to another player's pot, or carrying one back to the kitchen.  If a devil brings milk to the kitchen, it explodes, and the devil carrying it is removed from the game.  A large plastic stove in the middle of the board is the game's exciting gimmick, and comes into play when two opposing devils share the same space and start dueling.  Each player takes turns pushing the plunger that forms the oven's stovepipe, and eventually a large devil pops out, deciding the winner!<br/><br/>Is a rethemed and slightly altered version of the author's earlier Top Secret (1985) and  Spion & Spion (1987).<br/><br/>",

All three were designed by Bruno Cathala.<br/>War &amp; Sheep, the lightest of the three, is about sheep grazing grass - but beware of the magic grass - and trying to avoid wolves.<br/><br/>Two warring factions of sheep are contending for the same paddock.  Win the game by eliminating the other player's sheep or eating the most (and best) grass.<br/><br/>On each player's turn they can move and possibly eat grass, recon (peek to see what's under some grass), camouflage a sheep, use an action card or shift the wolf.<br/><br/>Each clump of grass eaten is worth 1,3, or 5 points.  1 point grass lets you pick up an action card for use in a later turn , 5 point grass is so good your sheep must spend the rest of the game digesting it and 3 point grass is, well it's just 3 point grass.  But beware!  Under each clump of grass a wolf may be lurking, if you try to eat grass over a wolf he will eat your sheep!<br/><br/>Part of the Eurogames Games for 2 Series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Doublehead Kids is a card game for four (or more persons), which depicts the &ldquo;Doppelkopf&rdquo; normal game with cards suitable for children. The game is suitable for players from about 6 years (the numbers from 1 to 20 must be read and recognized independently) and lasts about 30-45 minutes or 60-90 minutes, depending on the chosen winning score.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Doppelkopf&rdquo;-Game is one of the most popular German card games, which finds more and more enthusiastic fans and supporters, who organize themselves in clubs and even in a German umbrella organization (DDV). Doppelkopf even manages to replace the extremely popular game Skat as the favourite card game of the Germans. Doppelkopf probably originated from the game &ldquo;Schafkopf&rdquo;, which already had a set of rules since 1895. Doppelkopf got its name from the fact that all cards in the game are doubled. DOUBLEHEAD KIDS for 4 players consists of 48 playing cards. The playing cards have differently displayed strengths (shield symbol at the top left), which determine the ranking of the card and silver winning coins, which represent the winning value of a card. Furthermore the cards are assigned to four different family coats of arms (colours): the royal family with the red crown sign (26 cards), the black princely families with cross and spades signs (8 cards each) and the red princely family with the heart sign (6 cards). The royal family&rsquo;s cards are trumps.<br/><br/>The four players form two teams: the players with the princesses/prince pair and the players without the princesses/prince pair. As a game goal, each team tries to bag more silver winning coins than the opposing team. A total of 240 silver winning coins can be collected in a game round with 12 duels (tricks). The team with at least 121 silver winning coins wins the round and receives victory points in the form of gold coins. Furthermore, additional victory points can be gained through special points.<br/><br/>The special attraction of the double-headed game is that at the beginning of a new round the players do not know with whom they are playing. Only when the princess and the prince are laid out bit by bit, the picture becomes clearer for the players and the other players recognize in which team they are playing. Each game round is different and takes place in different player combinations. It is forbidden to signal to other players whether you are playing together in a team by verbal utterances or sign language. It is very well allowed to send playful signals to your fellow players by tactically laying out cards (e.g. deliberately re-buttering silver winning points into a duel or not). Bluffing is also allowed here, of course, to create confusion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game comes with 20 All-time great golfers along with the DC Metro Golf Course (Congressional).<br/><br/>The course has been painstakingly designed for the utmost accuracy and depiction.  Like all of our updated games, the instructions and boards are combined in a handy spiral bound 7 1/2&quot; x 10&quot; booklet.  The course comes in its own booklet!  The course booklet is roughly the size of the Baseball and Football Master Game booklets.  Also, we've printed the course holes on a coated stock that allows us to eliminate the use of the old golf markers.  Now you can mark your holes with a fine tip wipe marker (included) with its own eraser!  That's right no more bumping the table and accidentally moving the markers.<br/><br/>The current add-on courses available from APBA are Magnolia (Augusta National), Badger Links (Whistling Straits) and NY Empire State (Bethpage Black).<br/><br/>",

Alliances have worn thin, and the thirst for power has driven them to war with each other.  But they are not the only forces vying for power.  The Malador, foreign marauders, have taken advantage of the chaos to satisfy their lust for conquest and plunder by ravaging the land.<br/><br/>In War of Kings, you will assume the role of one of the rival kings.  Immediately, you will be faced with decisions on every round of play about how best to expand your realm.  During the Construction Phase, in which all players play simultaneously, you will generate resources, collect gold, build settlements, fortify them, and raise armies.  The combat system provides many opportunities for tactical and strategic decisions.  Wage war with our custom combat dice using a mechanic that engages both the attacking and defending player.  You must also contend with the Maladorian Marauders, an evil horde controlled by a card-based mechanic that allows the players to decide how best to wreak havoc on the other kingdoms of Arowyth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Time heals all wounds, they say, but the sudden death of a loved one sometimes shakes those who are left behind so much that their faith wavers. To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.<br/><br/>The UNDO series combines the theme of time travel with emotional, extraordinary stories that players must assemble piece by piece. Each time jump gives them another choice in how they can change the past &mdash; and not every change is a turn for the better!<br/><br/>In UNDO: Forbidden Knowledge, tragedy strikes on a graveyard in a swamp, in 1923&rsquo;s City of Arkham: A man, standing by an open crypt, realizes the existence of something so terrifying that, in shock, he suffers an immediate cardiac arrest. Set in the mythical world of H.P. Lovecraft, players of this UNDO case are bound to cross paths with otherworldly horrors.<br/><br/>A cemetery in the swamp, July 1923: A man is his twenties is standing next to an open crypt, a horrified expression on his face. Next to him are a backpack, a spade, and a portable telephone, the wire of which leads down the stairs into the darkness. &quot;Get out! Push back the grave slab and RUN!&quot; cries a panicked voice through the receiver. &quot;I can't leave you, Harley,&quot; the man answers in a trembling voice, &quot;Harley, can you hear me?&quot; A crackling noise from the receiver makes him pause &mdash; then a hollow, gelatinous, disembodied voice echoes through the receiver: &quot;YOU FOOL, HARLEY IS DEAD.&quot; The man begins laughing hysterically. To protect his sanity, his heart stops, and he drops dead...<br/><br/>",

It takes about 10 minutes per player to play, and it takes less than a minute to &quot;build.&quot; (Only 1 set of double-six dominoes is needed for a 2-player game. Two double-six dominoes sets are needed for the 3-4 -player game.)<br/><br/>How does it differ from your ordinary, garden-variety game of dominoes? Players of Euronimoes are trying to play their dominoes in their own personal area in such a way as to minimize their point count at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The pips in any column must form one or more sequential runs &ndash; at the end of the game, the value of a run is equal to its smallest number. A run of 6-5-4-3, for example, is worth 3; a run of 4-3-2-1-0 is worth 0. And again, players don&rsquo;t want points.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that, of course, since players also have to buy the dominoes they play, but that&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a simple game, but there&rsquo;s a lot going on. Players of Euronimoes will quickly find that it takes plenty of planning, quite a lot of strategy, and at least a little luck to come out on top.<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoys puzzle games should definitely give it a try.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>",

Fratricide is one such issue that is included in the game mechanics and discussed in the historical notes included with the game.<br/><br/>The game box is rather heavy because of the historical notes included with the game. Other extras include optional rules for up to eleven players. This adds the complexity of having to coordinate with other players for use of limited supply routes and coordinating attacks.<br/><br/>",

Haunting Cards trap players in rooms, where they must follow the card's instructions and terrorize visiting players.

But as you run out of awards to win and crew members to toast, there's one question on everyone's mind: can you pull it off a second time?<br/><br/>The director says she wants the next film to be bolder, riskier, and more challenging to the audience. You're skeptical, but she assures you there's no reason to worry: if it doesn't test well, we can fix it with a secret weapon she likes to call &quot;reshoots.&quot;<br/><br/>The cameras are rolling on our newest blockbuster: Moving Pictures: Dinosaur Outbreak! This cooperative game for 2 players was designed by Chris Klimowski and is sure to be a big hit.<br/><br/>In Moving Pictures: Dinosaur Outbreak! players take turns placing numbered scene cards from their hand into the shared Timeline row in hopes of getting all 6 cards in order. The catch? They can't speak or signal to each other, so they'll have to watch each other's play closely for clues. Each card also has an effect listed which can impact placement, swap cards around, or even allow players a rare opportunity to share information.<br/><br/>Getting it right once is a feat in itself but a full game of Moving Pictures: Dinosaur Outbreak! is played over 3 Acts. The Timeline grows with each Act, making each round harder than the one before. Thankfully you also have access to 2 Deleted Scenes: if the round would end with scenes out of order, you can spend a Deleted Scene to hide one card. These Deleted Scenes don&rsquo;t refresh, meaning that you only get 2 mistakes before the credits roll.<br/><br/>COMBINING GAMES<br/>Dinosaur Outbreak! can be  combined with another Moving Pictures game. If combining, choose one scene card each numbered 1-16 to play with, and any two Deleted Scene cards.<br/><br/>",

They enjoy their time, spread the word to others, and word about your fine establishment gets around. Unfortunately, the beaches are visited repeatedly by sharks &ndash; and if a bather gets injured by a shark, well, naturally your visitor count (and subsequent business) will be injured as well.<br/><br/>Thus, you want to send as many swimmers as possible into the water when no sharks are about &ndash; and if sharks do happen to be swimming nearby and eager to taste a tourist or two, you need to ensure that as many swimmers as possible come out of the water unharmed. You'll receive points for both satisfied swimmers in the water and those who flee successfully from sharks.<br/><br/>Shark Attacks! is limited to a production run of 500 copies.<br/><br/>",

This game incorporates an unabstracted level of detail and, therefore, both air and naval operations, as well as all facets of land operations (operational and strategic). While it is to be assumed that the British had already lost the eponymous Battle of Britain, the RAF is not completely out of the fight just yet, and the Royal Navy still presents a credible threat to the Germans&rsquo; amphibious landings and supply conduits across the English Channel. On the ground, the Germans have operational superiority, but the British Army can rely on their interior lines of communication and defensible terrain, including a crude network of hastily constructed fortifications that had been built before the invasion.<br/><br/>Components: 22x34 inch map, 280 die-cut counters.<br/><br/>World at War #52 - February-March 2017 issue.<br/><br/>",

The game board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles that make up the labyrinth slide in and out of the rows created by the tiles that are locked in place. One tile always remains outside the labyrinth, and players take turns taking this extra tile and sliding it into a row of the labyrinth, moving all those tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board; this newly removed tile becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.<br/><br/>Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures. Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to their home space wins!<br/><br/>What's new with 3D Labyrinth is that the game board has a 3D element, with players needing to go up and down levels as they travel through the maze, but a player can't jump more than one level at a time, so sometimes you'll be blocked from a treasure not due to a wall, but due to it being at the wrong height &mdash; or maybe you're at the wrong height. Either way, you need to figure out how to manipulate the maze to get the two of you together.<br/><br/>Note that 3D Labyrinth is not the same as Labyrinth, which doesn't have a height element in the gameplay and which is aimed at younger audiences.<br/><br/>",

The Duke had taken the initiative to move one of his two regiments south from the vital crossroads of Quatre-Bras, in the rolling countryside of Flanders, to delay the lead elements of the French advance.<br/><br/>The French horsemen found the village of Frasnes occupied by a regiment of 1500 Orange-Nassau infantry. The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.<br/><br/>The Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.<br/>At the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.<br/><br/>By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, alerting the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.<br/><br/>Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French.

This gets more and more difficult as the winter swiftly approaches. And on top of all that, there&rsquo;s this big terrifying polar bear&hellip;<br/><br/>The game uses an innovative worker placement mechanism combined with resource management and a bit of bluffing. It uses dice in a few interesting ways but none of them require you to roll them. ;-)<br/><br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>Every round players build a new landscape out of the 6 double sided land cards. As they do, they place their two camps along the way. Numbers on the chosen land cards determine the player order for the next round.<br/><br/>Every land card is divided in half, so you do not choose a single card, but you have to combine two of them to form the complete location for your camp.<br/><br/>At the start of the round, players secretly send their polar bear to one of the land cards and since you try to avoid the bear and want to get the best card at the same time, it brings a small bluffing aspect to the game.<br/><br/>After completing the landscape, players resolve their camps. One of the camps serve as a &quot;day camp&quot; and the other as a &quot;night camp&quot; and each of them has a bit different purpose.<br/><br/>While resolving a camp you can use all the resources shown on its location, but you have to fit them into your inventory to be able to use them later in the game. You can even build useful tools, but they take up space in your inventory as well. <br/> Scoring is resolved every round in your night camp and consists of feeding your Inuit and keeping him warm.<br/><br/>The land cards serve also as a timer. One of them is flipped &quot;winter&quot; side up every round and the game ends when all the land cards get flipped.<br/><br/><br/>The game was designed for the 2017 9-Card Nanogame P&amp;P Design Contest and it achieved the following awards:<br/><br/>1st place - Best Overall Game<br/><br/>1st Place - Best 2 player Game<br/>1st place - Best Thematic Game<br/>1st place - Best Written Rules<br/>1st place - Best Artwork<br/>2nd place - Most Innovative Mechanic<br/><br/>",

You can use multiple actions on your turn based on the amount of action cubes you have.<br/><br/>After each individual player's turn, one of 36 Titanic tiles are flooded, creating a fast paced game that forces you to continually race to the top, lest you end up submerged in the icy depths of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Your choices will involve deciding which items to pick when you enter rooms, and navigating the maze that is the Titanic to chart a quick path to give you the most points. You can earn points through saving passengers and playing star cards - but you won't know what cards you'll get until you draw them.

        "description": "Designed by former major league player Ethan Allen and introduced in 1941, All-Star Baseball became one of the most popular sports games of all time.  The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabilty of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball.  Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately.  The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number.  The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense.  Thus a hitter's result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details.  Results of each play are recorded on the field using plastic pegs for the base runners, while runs and outs are tallied on a rotating scoreboard.  Cumulative runs scored are tallied on paper score sheets. Strategy discs are included that enable plays like sacrifice flies, stealing bases, bunting, hit and run, etc. The team with the most runs after nine innings (or extra innings, if needed) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Firmly rooted in SPI wargaming - along with the usual complexity and breadth of rules. One notable about the game is that it has simultaneous plotted movement - manageable since each player only controls 3 - 12 warriors. There are many scenarios and a campaign as well.<br/><br/>Designer's Note:<br/>As people who are familiar with the Dunnigan treatment of 20th Century tactical combat in Sniper! and Patrol will note, the broad outlines of StarSoldier have much in common with those two earlier SPI games.<br/><br/><br/>Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with StarForce and Outreach.<br/><br/>",

But each patrol, each convoy mission, each amphibious landing you make to pursue victory risks full-scale battle with the AI squadron &ndash; a battle that could leave you triumphant or shattered in a matter of hours. A dynamic card-driven AI opponent assigns enemy missions, refits and launches new ships, and plots raids on your supply routes and coastlines.<br/><br/>Your objective: Control Lake Ontario by the end of the summer campaign, without losing your own squadron. The AI squadron's strategic objectives and battle tactics react dynamically to your moves.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Make decisions about ship missions and assignment zones. Scout and shadow enemy forces to identify them. Intercept detected enemy forces. Make amphibious assaults. Attack and defend supply convoys.<br/><br/>What's special about this game:<br/><br/>1. The only operational age-of-sail game that&rsquo;s below monster size, playable in approximately four hours, and requires no specialized knowledge of ship-handling or period tactics.<br/><br/>2. This campaign has never before been the specific focus of a wargame. (To the extent that it appears at all in wargames, it&rsquo;s either been part of a full-war strategic game, or a small scenario within tactical naval games that cover the general Napoleonic period.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Season 2 box will include all of the new stuff from Gamefound campaign: Private Eye Case, Divorce Case, Casino Heist, and Solo Mode as they will not be printed separately like the expansions were for Season 1.<br/><br/>It will also include extra prosecution/defense decks along with additional tokens to make this version standalone/playable without the Season 1 box. If you own both boxes, you will also have enough base decks to play the 2v2 variant as well.<br/><br/>Casino Heist:<br/>A team of thieves and swindlers have taken the Majestic Casino for all its worth. The suspects were rounded up easy enough, but proving their guilt conclusively will be difficult. The defendants seem overly confident within the court room. Is it just a fa&ccedil;ade as their scheme crumbles down around them? Or do they have one last trick up their sleeves?<br/><br/>In the Heist case, the prosecution is attempting to convict a majority of the gang responsible for the heist while the defense is doing their best to get as many swindlers exonerated as possible. These defendants are running the long con! Throughout the case they will be dealt double-sided Con cards. Players will be competing to assign these Cons to defendants and flip them to the side that benefits them the most. A defendant's trial is resolved and scored when they complete their long con and are dealt 3 Con cards. It is essential to deal the final Con to the defendant's you're winning to score them. The player who convicts or exonerates the most defendants wins.<br/><br/>The Divorce:<br/>The Divorce case expansion focuses on a high profile celebrity divorce case between a billionaire tech CEO and 90s Television Star. This is a more symmetrical case with each player taking on the role of one of the celebrities of the marriage. You can play as a Sam, the super rich tech CEO or as Adrian, the TV celebrity. Both Sam and Adrian's cards are dual-sided male/female so you can create any kind of marriage/relationship that you prefer.<br/><br/>One of the new mechanics in this case are secret Attitude cards. Each of these cards represents the emotional state of each partner and matches one of the bias symbols in the game. It's possible for your attitude to change throughout the course of the divorce proceedings but each one gives you extra victory points for marital assets with the matching bias symbol on them.<br/><br/>The other big change for the Divorce case is that you'll be fighting over (and swaying) marital asset cards rather than the jury. Each Asset card is double-sided and has an asymmetrical track where you can spend influence to sway bias. The victory point values on each asset are scored by the player who wins the asset (if in their color) but assets can also be shared between players. This allows the Divorce case to be played competitively or cooperatively based on the strategies chosen by each side leading to amicable splits, financial victories, or spiteful losses. Will you compromise for the sake of the children or drag each other through the mud to get the most assets?<br/><br/>The Private Eye:<br/>The Private Eye Case expansion sees the defense take on the role of private investigator in a 1950s Hollywood noir setting where they have been framed for the murder of a popular film star. The private eye will need to divide their time between investigating clues to solve the real murder and defending themselves in court. The prosecution works with conspirators and ring leaders to gain red herrings to hinder this investigation.<br/><br/>This case features a lot of new mechanics that shake up the core game. As the defense, you will be working to reveal cards from clue decks to discover WHO murdered the starlet with WHAT weapon WHERE in the city. Like the game Clue, each clue card eliminates one of the possibilities. The dilemma is that in order to investigate and reveal clues, you will need to play evidence cards for their Investigation effect instead of using them in the courtroom to influence the jury. If the Private Eye is able to correctly guess the murderer, weapon and crime scene they will win the game, but they need to make sure that they don't ignore the trial where the chips are stacked against them.<br/><br/>The prosecution represents a vast conspiracy of witnesses trying to frame the private investigator. Their goal is clearly focused on winning the trial and they will do their best to draft and utilize planted evidence in the courtroom. The prosecution will earn Red Herring tokens as they sway and manipulate the jury which they can place on the clue decks to hinder the PI's investigation.<br/><br/>Solo Expansion:<br/>The Solo Expansion expands on the solo mode in the base game by adding a new solo base deck, a bias die, Automa personality cards, and case-specific card effects that work with every case released thus far. If you're a player looking to get into the nitty gritty of the rules, read on!<br/><br/>The new Solo Base Deck is shuffled together with the drafted case cards for the Automa. All the effects on these cards have been written with solo play in mind. The Automa's procedures act like traps that players will have to work around.<br/><br/>The Automa is further expanded with additional cards that let players build an Automa player. By selecting a Personality card, a Discovery card, and the Questioning card corresponding to the Automa&rsquo;s role in the selected case, there are tons of unique Automa effects and combinations to explore.<br/><br/>The new Automa rules reduce die rolling and create unique puzzles to work around each witness as players will want to avoid triggering procedures and sidebar abilities that can set them back.<br/><br/>",

Certain Biblical scholars have described how closely these prophecies correlate to our modern times and put forward scenarios for this climactic battle.<br/><br/>The Battle of Armageddon - Deluxe is a 2 to 6 player game dealing with this final battle. The game brings together the forces of the World into the ultimate battle for control of the Earth:<br/><br/>Israel: the children of the Holy Land, promised peace by the Antichrist and betrayed by the World (1 Thessalonians 5:3)<br/><br/>Arabs: the King of the South, including Cush (Arab Africa), Put (Black Africa), and Persia (Iran) (Daniel 11:40, Ezekiel 38:5)<br/><br/>Magog: from the extreme northern parts, along with Gomer and Togarmah led by Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal (Ezekiel 38:1-6)<br/><br/>Revived Roman Empire: a European empire of 10 nations, led by the Antichrist, shall gather the armies of the World to battle (Revelation 16: 13-15)<br/><br/>United States: who dwell safely in the isles (Ezekiel 39: 6).<br/><br/>Kings of the East: an army 200 million strong (Revelation 9: 16)<br/><br/>The 19 x 33&Prime; game map represents the battleground, stretching from Egypt to Iran. The 216 5/8&Prime; counters (die-cut and back-printed) represent the armies of Israel, the Arabs, Magog (Russia), the Revived Roman Empire (Europe), USA and the Kings of the East (China). The 149 playing cards capture apocalyptic events (7 seals, 7 trumpets, 7 vials), special powers (e.g. the Anitchrist, Gog of Magog, etc.), nuclear weapons (tactical, theatre, and strategic) and homeland populations. Battle dice are used to resolve all battles.<br/><br/>Players maneuver their armies across the map and resolve battles using the battle dice. Event cards are drawn each turn, giving players special powers or weapons of mass destruction, but they can also bring on apocalyptic events. Ultimately, the player who best manages the chaos and controls Jerusalem at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>The Battle of Armageddon provides a simple but challenging game system suitable for both seasoned and casual players. Players are forced to adjust their strategy depending on rapidly changing conditions as dictated by the event cards. Combat is bloody, yet managed quickly and decisively through the battle dice. Players must manipulate allies and opponents to achieve the goal of capturing the Holy Land.<br/><br/>Six battle games are included which allow 2-3 players to play an hour-long game.<br/><br/>Product information:<br/><br/><br/>        Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>        Solitaire Suitability: average<br/>        Time Scale: 1 Turn = 1 Week<br/>        Map Scale: 100 km per hex<br/>        Unit Scale: armies of varied size<br/>        Players: 2 to 6 players<br/>        Playing Time: 2 to 4 hours<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/><br/>        one MOUNTED 19&Prime; x 33&Prime; game board<br/>        216 large counters (5/8&Prime; playing pieces)<br/>        149 playing cards<br/>        Rules booklet<br/>        6 scenarios and a Campaign Game<br/>        four battle dice (1 blue, 3 white)<br/>        Game box<br/><br/><br/>Game Credits:<br/><br/><br/>        Designer: Kerry Anderson<br/>        Artist: Nadir Elfarra<br/><br/><br/>",

In ancient times, when humans were nothing more than slaves, the Isle served as the main gateway between Midgard and the Old Worlds.<br/><br/>The first Summoners rose up to lead the humans in the battle that pushed the Old Ones back into their own realms, and &ndash; at great cost of life &ndash; the Summoners closed the gateway. It is believed that the enormous sacrifice of our ancestors is the reason why spirit energy remains so abundant on Summoner&rsquo;s Isle today.<br/><br/>Capable of absorbing spirit energy and using it to call forth wondrous creatures, Summoners travel the land to where they are most needed, to repel raiders, push back the native wild beasts, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; to siphon off spirit energy where it starts to gather.  For if too much spirit energy pools, it forms a Well, a passageway to the Old Worlds, where monsters and god-like beings still dwell, ready to make Midgard their own again, and enslave humankind once more.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Summoner&rsquo;s Isle you are an unproven adept, competing in a rite of passage to prove that you have full command over your creatures. To do so you must apply careful strategy, prove yourself in combat and most importantly, demonstrate your ability to absorb large quantities of spirit energy. Only once you have achieved all three will you graduate to the mainland to take your place among the exalted ranks of the Summoners.<br/><br/>",

Fight out science fiction battles for fun, free of adherence to specific model ranges, canonical settings or ever-expanding supplements.<br/><br/>Armies are typically composed of around 30-50 models. Most players prefer to field 28mm models, although other scales are just as playable. You can use any miniatures you wish, rather than 'official' ones.<br/><br/>Xenos Rampant is a completely standalone set of rules, but retains the simplicity, feel, and ease of play of Lion Rampant. Richard originally built Xenos Rampant as an unofficial variant based on Daniel&rsquo;s Origins-nominated system, and we have worked together to develop the idea. The basic rules should be familiar to players of Lion Rampant, although the very different nature of futuristic warfare has necessitated some changes to the rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You may not give specific clues about what you have chosen or how it relates to one or both of the image cards in front of you; only a vague sense of how the choice feels to you.<br/><br/>One more image card is on display than the number of players, and once you've chosen your target image, you indicate this choice on a numbered secret dial. Once all players have chosen, they reveal their choices. If you're the only one who picked an image, then you take that image card and cover one of the two images in front of you. If everyone chose different cards, then you win the round! If, however, not everyone chose different cards, then you lose the round and everyone who chose &quot;incorrectly&quot; draws a new image card at random from the deck to replace one of theirs. Sweep any remaining image cards from the center, then reveal the appropriate number of image cards to start a new round.<br/><br/>If you lose a round for the third time, you lose the game; if you manage to complete a number of rounds (7-10) based on the player count before this happens, then you win! You can adjust the difficulty of the game in several ways to make it more or less difficult.<br/><br/>",

To achieve this, you need as many votes for yourself as possible, but more importantly, you need to have better relations with other parties than they have with each other.<br/><br/>Each turn, you play &quot;idea cards&quot; that move the parties' positions on one of the eight political scales (high tax/low tax, immigration/nationalism etc). Parties who move in concert may strengthen their relation; parties who don't risk weakening theirs. Every move gives the parties more or less favor with the eight voter groups (old/young, men/women etc), which determines the votes cast by the game's sixteen voters (representing every combination of the four voter groups).<br/><br/>The game is an act of balances: Stick out your neck enough to keep a clear profile and win voters that give you political weight, but co-operate enough to place this weight in the right position of the winning coalition.<br/><br/>",

On their turn, each player places one of their god&rsquo;s followers on one of the buildings in the village.  Each god has the same two types of followers: Tsukumogami (Spirit Objects), household items possessing a soul that animates them and Zashiki-warashi (Kid Ghosts), playful child-like spirits.   Each follower has a strength value and once a building has five followers placed on it, the total strengths of each god&rsquo;s followers placed there are then compared.  Spirit Objects have a number that represents their strength, while Kid Ghosts have strengths that can vary through powerful special abilities which are triggered by the arrangement of other spirits at the same building.  If the strength of your faction is greater, you place one of your god&rsquo;s possession markers on the building.  Using clever placement of your followers to better capitalize on each Zashiki-warashi&rsquo;s special ability is key to victory in Fan and Mallet.  The first player to place all seven of their possession markers wins the game.<br/><br/>",

You score points by connecting your path (or stream) to as many sides of the square as possible, and by isolating your opponent's stream (or path). As you may have to place tiles that not only help you (and hinder your opponent), but also tiles that may hinder you (and help your opponent), there is a depth of strategy that is belied by whimsical art of the cardboard tiles.

Pooling their resources, experts from all walks of life converge to find the best path forward &ndash; and the team they&rsquo;ll need to follow it.<br/><br/>The story and gameplay of Converge spans across 3 sets. Each one comes in their own wallet and includes 3 unique 6-card skillsets. All 3 sets can be played individually as standalone games, or players can combine any 3 skillsets from multiple sets to create a new combination.<br/><br/><br/>     Converge: Catalysts of Change<br/>     Converge: Sparks of Hope<br/>     Converge: Engines of Progress<br/><br/><br/>Converge: Engines of Progress includes the stoic Protectors, friendly Merchants, and ambitious Searchers. Protectors often Lead team members to important strategic areas, turning a team member to a goal, while the Merchants&rsquo; Trade exchanges team members from one side to another. The Searchers, meanwhile, discover ancient technology that allows them to add a card from the deck to play.<br/><br/><br/>In Converge, players are competing to build the best team that meets the current goals, though goals and teams can shift with each play. So can control of the powerful artifact which gives an advantage to those who possess it.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns to play a single card from their hand.<br/><br/>Every card has 2 parts: a character with a skillset, rank and special ability, and a goal, each of which has a star value for fulfilling its requirement. These goals apply to both players while the card is in the central area, with fulfilled goals remaining in play.<br/><br/>Cards can be discarded for their special ability, played to the player&rsquo;s team to fulfill goals using its suit and value, or as a new shared goal.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, players count their current star value. The player with the most stars gains control of the artifact. If they already had control of the artifact, they win! If no player can secure victory by the time all cards have been played, then the player who holds the artifact is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Egypt mythology includes 2 pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + 33 cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + 40 cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings).<br/><br/>Each player in War of the Myths III needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each installment increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bitskrieg is a tank battle game, designed to be simple enough to be played with children or grandchildren, while still providing enough tactical challenge to interest wargaming adults. With fewer than forty counters and a single page of rules, Bitskrieg packs a lot of punch in a tiny package.<br/><br/>Terrain is arranged randomly on an eight-by-eight square grid, and players choose sides. You choose your force of five tanks from four different types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses: light, medium, and heavy tanks, and tank destroyers. Place your two flags and the battle is on! You win by destroying all enemy tanks or by capturing both enemy flags.<br/><br/>Play in Bitskrieg alternates with each player activating one tank to move or fire, or using their turn to refresh all their previously-activated tanks. Fire involves simple counting of range and rolling a die to hit, then rolling a die for penetration after a successful hit to destroy the target.<br/><br/>Optional advanced rules include flanking, ramming, bounding fire, stun, terrain types, and more. Bitskrieg handicaps easily, so if luck is not enough for your young one to turn the tables on you, you can customize the experience to find the right balance.<br/><br/>",

Morale and oxygen levels need to be constantly monitored.<br/><br/>Each challenge deck tells a different sci-fi story. The base set comes with a 2001: A Space Odyssey style &quot;AI&quot; deck.<br/><br/>During a turn players receive movement cards allowing them to position their crew throughout the ship. Crew in specific locations can then activate ship systems or crew specific abilities in order to, for example, generate oxygen, raise morale, or repair the ship. The crew's locations can also complete certain missions such as when searching the ship or realigning the solar panels.<br/><br/>Throughout the game the overall threat is represented by a challenge deck. Some of the cards of the challenge deck will generate missions representing the crew dealing with the problems presented by the deck. Crew will vote on engaging with such missions, balancing their ability to complete the missions and earn their rewards with the risk of failing and suffering the consequent punishments. If the mission is not voted for it is aborted but may arise again. The challenge deck represents a specific narrative threat that players must progress through. The deck supplied with the base set of the game tells the story of the ship's AI having wiped out the original crew, attempting to kill off the players' rescue mission by suffocation or dumping the crew into space.<br/><br/>Players need to communicate movement options to efficiently use the limited space of the ship and work together to activate and complete missions. Meanwhile they must be constantly aware that with a limited shared oxygen supply and victory being available to each player individually, betrayal to extend limited supplies is a constant threat. The game is won by the challenge deck being exhausted and lost by players running out of crew. Although players need to work together in a co-operative fashion to complete missions and maintain the ship, they win or lose as individuals.<br/><br/>Although the game does not require players to work against each other via betrayal mechanics oxygen supplies are shared such that an individual players personal odds of success rise as other players' crew are eliminated thus offering a semi-co-op experience. The game can be played in an entirely co-op fashion however depending on players taste.<br/><br/>",

The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.<br/><br/>Ingenious Extreme features the same gameplay as Ingenious, but with the domino-style tiles consisting of two conjoined octagons instead of two conjoined hexes. Since the pieces in Ingenious had six colors on them, 'Ingenious Extreme features eight colors, giving players more to juggle as they try to score well across the board while shutting out opponents.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two empty octagon spaces of the game board. For each octagon on this tile, they score one point in that color for each octagon of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each octagon in a straight line from it. (In all you must check for scoring in seven directions from each half of the tile; you never look back from one half of the tile through the other half.) If a player brings the score of a color to 13, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)<br/><br/>When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 13 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Great Pacific War is Avalanche Press' strategic-level game of the War in the Pacific. The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.<br/><br/>The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.<br/><br/>The facts:<br/><br/><br/>     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.<br/>     The game system is built around players drawing impulse &quot;chits&quot; to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).<br/><br/><br/>The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.<br/><br/>In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japan&Iacute;s lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.<br/><br/>In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>3 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; maps<br/>2 countersheets consisting of 560 counters<br/>1 rulebook...separated into 2 booklets<br/>2 scenario booklets<br/>1 &quot;Policial Maker Explanations&quot; booklet<br/>1 Off-Map Movement and Sea Zones Chart 11&quot; x 17&quot;<br/>1 Chart with US Entry/Russian Winter Table/Mud Table<br/>1 Chart with Sequence of Play/Alliance &amp; Individual Victory Tables/Construction and Repair Costs<br/>1 Terrain Effects Chart<br/>1 Turn Impulse Track<br/>1 Production Costs<br/>9 Force Pool Charts(Netherlands,Britain,Soviet Union,Nationalist China,Communist China,United States(x2),Japan(x2))<br/><br/><br/>Note: <br/>The maps are not mounted like those in JP's Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. <br/> The game marries up with JP's Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lander is a 2-4 player, space-themed strategy game that emphasises area control (resource collection), tableau building (crew development) and set collection (missions). You and your friends will assume the roles of corporations, competing to prepare Kaimas-2 (the first planet outside of our solar system capable of supporting human life) for a large-scale colonization effort. The corporation that contributes the most will become the market leader going forward!<br/><br/>The game includes three distinct game styles with the following victory conditions:<br/>​<br/><br/>     Basic Simulation &ndash; the first player to reach 7 Mission Stars wins.<br/>     Early Arrival &ndash; the last year is triggered when a player reaches 10 Mission Stars. The player with the most stars at the end of that year wins.<br/>     Planned Arrival &ndash; the player with the most Mission Stars after 5 years wins.<br/><br/><br/>To earn Mission Stars, you must expand your resource base and develop your crew with specific combinations of traits and classes. Unlike many euro style games where players focus on their own playing area and can only affect each other indirectly, Lander enables players to directly impact each other's strategies through various game mechanics, such as take that and variable player powers.<br/><br/>At it's core, Lander is a game of options. On any given turn, you'll have many potential directions to go in, which gives you a lot of flexibility in how you plan your strategy. It also enables you to pivot when something unanticipated happens (e.g. acid rain reduces the colony's food production, a rival corporation relocates one of your structures, the mission you were working towards gets completed just before you can grab it!). This means that no matter how bleak things may seem, there's almost always a way back in!<br/><br/>Unique leadership abilities and action cards can be used to pull back your opponents or further your own interests, while event cards will force you to make difficult choices that can impact yourself or the entire colony. Lander is like life. You will experience highs and lows and be faced with a series of challenges that will force you to solve problems and pivot your strategy. It's not meant to be easy (think Matt Damon in the Martian). You are self-interested corporations, struggling to survive on a foreign planet - don't be surprised if the planetary conditions change or your colleagues put something toxic in your soup.<br/><br/>While some orders in the game are commonly used across game styles and player counts, others are more situational. For example, negotiation provides a novel framework for trading resources and cards between corporations with the use of a timer and collateral. Typically, a 2-player game won't see any negotiation, but it can become very common in a 3 or 4-player game, especially if one player starts to pull away. Observations are often used sparingly in the first couple years, but can become quite strategic in later years, as you study your opponents' actions and try to time your moves just right.<br/><br/>Lander is a game that often requires a few plays for you to really start appreciating its depth. As you get familiar with the mechanics and cards, you'll start to see there is a game within a game, whereby the study of your opponents' actions is crucial for developing your own strategy. Similar to poker, players can study their opponents' hands, crew and orders to predict what they might be trying do. The interplay between reading your opponents, using your observations, bluffing and playing your action cards becomes the game within the game. Knowing how and when to employ these different tactics is of course, up to you to master...<br/><br/>Your story begins here!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Tarleton's Quarter!&quot; is a game about the British attempt to win the American Revolution by invading the Southern colonies, The game covers the period from the British landing in Georgia in 1778 to October of 1781 (the historical end of the siege of Yorktown and the surrender of Cornwallis' army). The object of British efforts in the South was to bring the four southern colonies - Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia-back under British sway after almost four years of uninterrupted Continental control. Ideally, the English wanted to &quot;restore civil government,&quot; i.e., to return the South to its status ante-bellum with British governors, taxes paid to the Crown, and no expensive garrison to enforce the situation.<br/><br/>&quot;Tarleton's Quarter!&quot; highlights some salient aspects of the British campaign in the south. First and foremost was the effect of leadership, and the difficulty both sides had in finding leaders who were bold without being rash. Rarely did energy and sound judgment come in the same package. Another vital factor was the terrain of the southern colonies, or rather, one feature of it: water. The reason that water &mdash; in the form of rivers and swamps &mdash; is the dominant terrain feature is &mdash; surprise! &mdash; it rained a lot, particularly in the Carolinas. These facts &quot;on the ground&quot; raise the amount of non-combat losses, like those caused by disease, which made just keeping an army intact such a headache at the time. (There's nothing romantic about losing large numbers of men to something beyond a player's control.) As to why so many people lived in North and South Carolinas' pestilential swamps, it was because those swampy areas were precisely where rice and indigo grew best, and in the 18th century in the Carolinas, that was where the money was; cotton was a much later development.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important factor of all was the continuing British belief in an untapped reservoir of loyalist support in the south. Those in command of the British army knew they didn't have enough manpower to control even the southern half of the American colonies on their own. They were relying on the appearance of a &quot;silent majority&quot; of loyal, but previously suppressed, American subjects who would take control of those provinces swept of Continental forces. Appropriately, you are allowed to indulge in as much over-confidence as your red coat will allow.<br/><br/>",

Different challenges give you three rolls of the dice, or one, or an unlimited number to attempt your challenge. Various cards let you set dice aside and re-roll the remaining ones--while some cards dictate that you only get a single roll. If the dice don't go your way, you can cash in your chips for an extra roll, an extra turn, or perhaps a new card.

After movement morale is checked and then melee combat may occur.  Combat results are calculated by percentile dice on a CRT.  Losses are imposed by &quot;line&quot; of which units start with 2, 3, or 7.  When a unit loses all its lines it is eliminated.

The Vikings hid the island&rsquo;s location from the rest of the known world, killing all those who stumbled upon it. Soon after, many great clans established settlements across the island. Then the true master of the island revealed himself: Deep below the earth&rsquo;s surface lay Ymir, the powerful Jotunn of old, slumbering since time began. Sensing the Vikings&rsquo; trespass, the giant awoke enraged and emerged a juggernaut of destruction as he rampaged across the island.<br/><br/>Sk&aacute;lds from the various settlements soon discovered how to control Ymir in a limited way. Though the Jotunn was weak of mind, he was strong in will and his appetite for destruction unquenchable. Consumed with greed, rival Sk&aacute;lds turned the lumbering colossus against their enemies in a race to conquer the island and seize the riches of the other settlements.<br/><br/>Rampaging Jotunn is a competitive fast paced board game for 2 players in which each both players create the island they will be playing on where they will populate it with opposing villages and armies.  Each player controls an army of Vikings trying to protect their villages while trying to destroy their opponents villages, at the same time the Jotunn rampages across the island destroying everything in sight.<br/><br/>Players use cards to influence the giant and direct him towards your opponents armies and villages.  They also use cards to move their armies into battle across the island. The last player with villages on the board wins!  Rampaging Jotunn is a half hour long game and is for players 8 and up!<br/><br/>Rampaging Jotunn features illustrations by the award winning artist, Nicolas Giancondino.<br/><br/>",

That is, during the course of the game the players purchase cards from an open card pool to build their own deck. And like Dominion, the goal is to collect victory points, which at the end of the game will decide the winner. The main difference is you can attack other players with your armies to gain land.<br/><br/>The players take the roles of daimyos - local warlords - during &quot;Sengoku jidai&quot; (warring states period in Japanese history). While holding a balance between fighting the other warlords and control of their own realm, the players strive to become the most powerful warlord under the heavens of Japan. Are you going to use your resources to build castles, armies or cannons? Or do you establish a town of fine arts?  Famous generals from the Sengoku jidai period will have an appearance, with the only slight difference being that they appear as cute girls.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Kunitori!

Eight types of candies, each in four colors, are hidden in the central 6x6 field, along with four special tiles: three money tiles and one empty package. All tiles in the center of the table are square.<br/><br/>Each player receives four round tiles at random from a set of 32 that match the candy and color options on the square tiles. On your turn, you turn over one of your round tiles and a square tile. If they match in both candy and color, both tiles stay face up and you take another turn; if not, you turn both tiles face down again.<br/><br/>The little twist is that on your turn you can rob candies from your opponents. If you turn over a square tile along with a matching round tile in an opponent's possession, you get to keep that face-up round tile and give the opponent one of your face-down round tiles in exchange. Sweet!<br/><br/>In addition, if you reveal the empty package, leave that tile face up and add another round tile to the ones you already have; now you must reveal five tiles instead of four.

        "description": "Around 800BC China was blossoming as a civilization. The Zhou emperor sat on the throne of a feudal China and ruled through wise philosophers, able warlords, and a strong army. The Chinese world was making huge cultural, scientific, and philosophical strides.<br/><br/>But a single generation later, those same advisors and lords rose up against the throne, and each other, to claim hegemony for their philosophy and way of life. Welcome to the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China.<br/><br/>Spring and Autumn: Story of China is a 4X civilization game in which you take control of one of the pre-eminent states of the time to explore the world around you, expand your borders, research powerful advancements, build up your economy, and bring honor upon your name. Your goal is to establish a true dynasty in China.<br/><br/>Spring and Autumn: Story of China expands on the system from in Hellenica: Story of Greece, introducing all-new gameplay elements like a philosophy system, diplomacy, enhanced combat, honor, expanded victory conditions, the Great Wall, and did we mention Chinese dragons? As with all &quot;Story of&quot; games, Spring and Autumn: Story of China will include the best AI and solo play system available in a 4x game.<br/><br/>Can you guide your civilization during these turbulent times? Will your vision of Chinese civilization be remembered for all time, or will you merely be a stepping stone for another&hellip;?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Redemption(&trade;) is a Bible-based collectible card game (CCG). Created in 1995 by Rob Anderson of Cactus Game Design Inc. as a Christian faith alternative to Magic the Gathering, Redemption (&trade;) is the 2nd-longest running CCG in existence (after Magic). As of 2023, 6 starter sets and 24 expansion sets have been released, along with many promotional cards. There are over 4500 unique Redemption cards in print - including variants and reprints.<br/><br/>For all of the impressive numbers, what is even more impressive is that every single Redemption card is based on a character, event, or concept from the Bible and has its own identifying Bible verse(s). Moreover, most cards&rsquo; special abilities tie directly into their verse&rsquo;s meaning or topic.<br/><br/>Going further - the game is a simple-to-learn, complex-to-master strategy game. Unlike most other CCGs, it is 2-sided: each player plays offense and defense, and will build each into their customized deck.<br/><br/>So how do you play? In a nutshell, the first player to rescue 5 lost souls (in &ldquo;Type 1&rdquo; format, or 7 Lost Souls in Type 2 format) is the winner. Lost Souls are rescued by using Heroes on offense, and strategically overcoming your opponent&rsquo;s defensive villains, called Evil Characters. Each time you do that, you rescue 1 Lost Soul card, and the turn is passed for your opponent to play offense with their Heroes and against your defensive Evil Characters. Hundreds of unique special abilities create endless play combinations and deep strategy, for extremely high replay value for the game. Once you get into Redemption, you&rsquo;ll always enjoy tweaking - or completely scrapping and starting over - decks, acquiring new cards, trying new strategies, and testing yourself against opponents in casual and tournament settings.<br/><br/>Speaking of tournaments, every year there is a long tournament season, filled with local, district, state, and regional tournaments, as well as a national tournament, that anyone can attend. The national tournament, known within the community as &quot;Nationals&quot;, is usually hosted in the summer months of July or August. This event is a 3 day tournament where every legal category is played to determine a National Champion of that category for the year. Also, at this point, the annual ranking system for players which awards points for top 3 finishes in sanctioned tournaments throughout the year is finalized and the winners are announced. All National winners and winners of a category in the annual ranking system for a category receive special National Winner Promos. These are some of the coolest looking cards in the game and are highly sought after as playable collectibles.<br/><br/>Though of course far from perfect, being a Christian game in which most players who play are Christians, there is also a wonderful community that has been established over the past 25 years. So many players are welcoming and encouraging to newcomers and veterans alike, and there is an online message board and Discord channel in which conversation goes on daily. This is a community in which players feel just as natural about asking a strategy question about the game as sharing a personal prayer topic - trusting that they will be treated with respect and care no matter what. This active community of Redemption players, which includes the team of Elders (the game's leadership group), have really worked hard to make it about as easy to join the game as can be. There are tremendous community driven resources to provide plenty of engagement with new and active players alike. In addition to the message boards and Discord, the game has an active subreddit, a blog site with contributions from the broad community of players, active Youtubers and even two podcasts - One a weekly source of content spanning various topics of the game and the other a biweekly dive into high level competitive gameplay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game of tactics, strategy and confrontation is set in a fantasy world after the Great Depression. Each player runs a company of special agents, and their agents become teams in threes. The aim of the game is transporting the crystals and leftover artifacts (guns and transporting means!) from the mine to your own campsite and from the campsite to your home. The transport will succeed only if the team is strong and fast enough, and if you can use the transporting capacity of your men optimally. However, nobody is left alone with their problems. The competition and the robbers ensure interaction and surprises&hellip;<br/><br/>The basic game consists of 5 rounds. Players try gaining crystals and artifacts from the central mining project (bidding for the best bunch of crystals), then in the tactically most important phase they choose their 3-card &quot;teams&quot; to take actions in order of their speed. On your turn you can go to the mine to take crystals to your camp; you can attack others' camps for crystals and you can transport your crystals home or to the bank from your camp. You can also collect or use the artifacts found: they can help in increasing your transporting capacity or battle power, but if you don't use them they can mean lots of points in the end of the game. At the end of the game, whoever has the most points (from crystals and artifacts at home and points from the bank) wins.<br/><br/>Krysis website and rules<br/><br/>",

Troop definitions are provided for Romans, Carthaginians, Greeks, Gauls, Iberians, Italians, and Macedonians, but the rules are intended to have wider applicability and the rules provides design rules to create your own troop profiles.<br/><br/>The game aims to provide a solid tactical combat system to represent raids, scouting and many other types of small actions.<br/><br/>The armies are made of line troops gathered in groups of 6-10 figures and a few characters that direct the action. Works with 28 or 15mm figures. Individually based figures are preferred, specific basing is not required.<br/><br/>The system is based on resource management, you have to manage the character command points to activate the units but more importantly you have to manage the fatigue on your units for them to be combat effective.<br/><br/>Combat mechanics are based on D6, rolling high is always good.<br/><br/>The rulebook includes pick up game scenarios and two flexible formats to build armies.<br/><br/>",

Let's have flowers on the mountain and sheep at the houses, while laying rails to link people in villages with the most prosperous village being named after the flower Alpenzian.<br/><br/>Alpenzian is a reimplementation of the game Sunflower Valley, with this re-design originating from the Japanese publisher's discussions with designer Wouter van Strien. In addition to changes in the components, such as an original die with icons and different player sheets with new patterns to allow players to adjust the balance of the game, the gameplay has changed, with updated scoring rules and added variant rules for solitaire play.<br/><br/>In more detail, Alpenzian incorporates dice-drafting and drawing systems into a fun game. Draw pictures on your player sheet according to the icons on your chosen dice rolls, and gradually build up your village with flowers on the mountains and rails linked all over the place. After all the players have filled their player sheets (i.e., their villages), they tally their score, which depends on the combinations of icons.<br/><br/>Aside from the score, it is most important for each player to complete and build their wonderful village. You are free to draw however you like, according to each icon.

        "description": "The Imposter Kings is a 2-4 player card game designed to be quick to pick up, yet challenging to master. A typical round takes around 10-20 minutes, depending on the number of players and experience.<br/><br/>Each card has a value in your hand (1-9), and you can typically only play cards of equal or higher value. It's not often a straightforward path from 1 to 9, so the real strategy comes from knowing what cards can best counter your best opponent, and secure your place on the Throne. For example:<br/><br/>The Assassin has a low value of 2. But as a trained killer, she immediately can assassinate any King she can find. Thankfully, there are other cards to help, such as the King's Hand (by stepping in the way) or Inquisitor (who can preemptively force the Assassin out of the darkness with a pointed finger).<br/><br/>The Soldier has a middle of the pack value of 5. They tirelessly fight for the King throughout their lives, and now they're confused to which King to serve. If they follow their leads and prove their suspicions, they grow more potent on the Throne.<br/><br/>The Queen/Princess sits comfortably in the upper echelon of society with the highest value of 9. They push around all members of the Court with their thoughts, and very few can stand up to them. However, characters like the Elder (value 3) can remind the Court that no one is above the law. Or perhaps an Oathbound (value 6) will step up to the Throne. These mysterious beings are the Kingdom's most revered members and may brush anyone aside to share their agenda. And of course, the King can always take matters into his own hands...<br/><br/>Fight viciously with your allies! Bluff and deceive others about what you may have! Assassinate all that stand in your way! Foil plans by forcing your opponents hand! There are a fantastic amount of possibilities, and you have to try to fulfill your objective while hindering others.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Rapid fire cannons and machine guns usher in a new and deadlier form of warfare. The major powers had prepared for years, building up massive armies and navies. It was supposed to end quickly. War was now too expensive, too deadly. But they would fight on to the death.<br/><br/>The War begins with sweeping invasions. Great armies marching to the largest battles yet seen. Murderous fire produces unimaginable casualties. Exhausted, they dig in. The Armies develop Siege Howitzers, Poison Gas, Tanks, and Combat Aircraft. New tactics attempt to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare. Mass Tank Attacks, Storm Troopers, Drumfire Barrages. The war is on multiple fronts. Belgium, France, Italy, Austria, Serbia, Greece, Turkey, Poland, Russia, Romania, Palestine, Mesopotamia. The conflict is much broader than just the battlefields. Factories must be supplied and people fed. Produce the guns, shells and bullets the armies need, or face disaster.<br/><br/>The Grand Campaign combines all of the Der Weltkrieg series titles (not a stand alone product).

        "description": "&quot;Alexandre contre la Perse&quot; is a tactical level board wargame which presents the first three battles in the &quot;Au Fil de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e&quot; Antiquity series. They bring onto the stage the greatest conqueror of Antiquity in the course of the mighty confrontations which enabled him to bring Persia to its knees.<br/><br/>GRANICUS - In 334 BC, after crushing a revolt by the city of Thebes, the young King Alexander of Macedonia turned toward the east and set out on his conquest of Asia. He crossed the Hellespont with 35,000 men. On the banks of the Granicus River he came up against an army of 40,000 men commanded by Memnon, a Greek who was in the pay of Persia. Thanks to a vigorous attack by his Companion cavalry, Alexander succeeded in dispersing the enemy horsemen and crushing Memnon&rsquo;s Greek mercenaries. This brilliant victory opened the door to Asia Minor.<br/><br/>ISSOS - A year later on the coast of Syria the King of Kings, Darius III, determined to assemble a great army and intercept Alexander. The two armies met at Issos. While repelling an attack on his left by the Persian cavalry, Alexander and his right wing charged across the river under a rain of enemy arrows. By hurling himself into a breach on the Persian left flank, Alexander brought about its collapse and the flight of Darius. The Macedonian phalanx advanced inexorably in the center of the battlefield and completed Alexander&rsquo;s victory, with the result that he could go on to invade Egypt unhindered.<br/><br/>GAUGAMELA - The final clash between Alexander and Darius took place at Gaugamela in 331 B.C. The King of Kings had mobilized impressive forces from the eastern part of his empire. His army, unusually numerous, included elephants as well as war chariots. He compelled Alexander to fight in a vast plain where the 40,000 Macedonians risked being encircled. Once again the king of Macedonia opened the battle with a cavalry attack on his right. The phalanx meanwhile suffered severely from Persian attacks, especially on its left wing where Parmenion was in command. Alexander nevertheless forestalled the enemy by making Darius himself the target of the Companions&rsquo; charge. Once they had opened a breach, the Macedonian cavalrymen passed through it and struck the Persians from the rear, causing them to rout. This occurred in the nick of time, because Parmenion&rsquo;s contingents were by then on the point of breaking. Darius fled in the direction of Arbela. Alexander caught up with him, but by then he was already dead, assassinated by a group of his generals.<br/><br/>Alexandre contre la Perse puts the players either at the head of the Macedonian army, at whose core the cavalry and the phalangites played complementary roles, or in command of the Persian army, consisting of highly varied troops collected from all over the empire. The three battles were increasingly important chronologically, in terms of the numbers involved and their complexity. Will you, as Alexander, be able to bring down a multi-national army by means of only three battles? Will you, in the role of the King of Kings, succeed in foiling Alexander&rsquo;s maneuvers and vanquishing the Macedonians?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One player takes the role of Julius Caesar and controls the Roman forces, their Gallic allies and German mercenaries. The other player takes on the interests of those Gallic tribes trying to defend their independence.<br/><br/>Bellum Gallicum contains several independent scenarios and a campaign game which covers the whole of the Gallic Wars.<br/><br/>Each of the 9 scenarios covers one annual campaign in its historical context.<br/><br/>The campaign game covers the whole of the Gallic Wars and runs as a series of annual campaigns.

        "description": "Bounty hunter &ldquo;Deadeye&rdquo; Dinah Reeves never gets mail, and certainly not from her little brother turned-Deputy-Marshal. But sure enough, the letter in your hands ain&rsquo;t no lie:<br/><br/>Dear Dinah,<br/>I need your help finding these men. They been making hell for me all over the Arkansas Territory, and now I hear they done run to Texas. I can&rsquo;t keep chasing these cusses. So I&rsquo;m asking you, just this once. There ain&rsquo;t nobody you can&rsquo;t catch. You know I don&rsquo;t beg, but I can&rsquo;t do nothing else now. Just this once, Dinah. Please.<br/>Love, Bass<br/><br/>Again you check the stack of wanted posters stuffed in his envelope. No mention of a bounty. Twelve years since you last heard from him, and the great Bass Reeves can&rsquo;t spare a dime. Well, you reckon, he&rsquo;s still kin. May-hap you can do your dear brother a favor&mdash;just this once. <br/><br/>As bounty hunter &ldquo;Deadeye&rdquo; Dinah Reeves, track down each crime boss through a stack of scene cards. A scene may be a peril or shootout. Use your kit cards to overcome each scene card and add it to your kit. You can play a kit card as a bullet to shoot other folk&rsquo;s hats. Or you can play the same card as an item for a special benefit. But outlaws can shoot the hat of any kit card you play, losing you that card. If you ever run out of kit cards, you fail and star t the job over. Reach the boss card to duel the boss. Shoot their hat before they slip away, and you capture them, earning reputation that grows your legend. If you fail, try again. You win the entire campaign by completing all 8 jobs: capture all 8 bosses and bring them to Bass.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>In this in-hand solitaire Western campaign game, bounty hunter &quot;Deadeye&quot; Dinah Reeves is taking down a ring of crime bosses as a favor for her lawman little brother. Aim impossible shots, brave fearsome perils, and stretch scant supplies in your hunt to bring in each crime boss, dead or alive (most likely dead). As you progress, your legend will grow, striking fear into your enemies and granting you an edge...which you'll need, 'cause you've set your sights on the toughest, meanest pack of varmints this side o' the Wild West. Good thing you never miss.<br/><br/>Deadeye Dinah features an in-hand, cards-only microgame campaign with 8 unique missions, each lasting 4-6 encounters, and persistent character progression through each mission. Each mission, or &quot;job,&quot; is hunting down 1 crime boss.<br/><br/>Players start a job by setting up the deck for the boss they want to pursue. To track down the boss, they play kit cards (Dinah's equipment) to overcome each scene card (the trials she faces) stacked on top of the boss card. A scene card can be an environmental peril or a shootout with hired thugs. Each kit card is played as either a bullet to shoot or an item to use for special effects, but playing kit cards also leaves Dinah open to being shot and losing cards. If Dinah overcomes a scene, the player adds the scene card to Dinah's kit cards. If she can't overcome the scene, she must escape and lose cards. If Dinah ever runs out of kit cards, and the player can't add any more, she fails the job and must start over.<br/><br/>If Dinah overcomes all the scenes and reaches the boss, she must duel the boss by playing a bullet to shoot the boss while avoiding getting shot herself. If she doesn't fulfill both those conditions, the boss slips away and Dinah fails the job. But if both conditions are fulfilled, Dinah wins the duel, captures the boss, and completes the job, earning reputation in the crime ring's new territory. As Dinah earns reputation, the player upgrades her legend effect, a passive benefit she carries into each job.<br/><br/>This game was first published as an entry in the 2021 9-Card Nanogame Print and Play Design Contest, where it won several awards:<br/><br/><br/>    #1 Best Solitaire Game<br/>    #1 Best Original Artwork<br/>    #1 Best Cards-Only Game<br/>    #2 Most Innovative Mechanism<br/>    #3 Best Overall Game<br/><br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Originally titled Bitter Victory and desktop published by BSO games.<br/><br/>It is 1943, the Allies have driven the Axis out of Africa and have begun preparations for the invasion of Europe. Unable to launch the invasion of France in 1943, and needing to keep the pressure up in order to prevent German troops being sent to the East Front, the Allies opt to invade Sicily as a stepping stone to Italy. Operation Husky is the code name of the Allied Invasion of Sicily.<br/><br/>Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. MedWar Sicily has a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or heavy weapons). No CRTs.<br/><br/>The game also uses opportunity cards for each player, whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player to enhance the game. Resource points are used acquire opportunity cards or refit units. Players are limited in their resource points. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.<br/><br/>Playing time for MedWar Sicily 2 to 3 hours. The rules have a section on Solitaire play.<br/><br/>Game comes with a 34&quot; x 22&quot; mapsheet, full color counters, rules, dice, player aid charts, and box.<br/><br/>This is an excellent 1 to 4 player game.  In a 2 player game one player is Axis/ one Allied.  In a 3 player game one player is Axis/ one British, one American.  In a 4 player game one player is Italian, one is German/ one is British, one is American.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Bark Side, you can be a bad doggie as much as you want &mdash; as long as you're not the one caught in the end.<br/><br/>The game consists of a sixty-card deck, with five copies each of the numbers 1-12. At the start of a round, each player is dealt a hand of ten cards (or in later rounds, each player receives an equal number of cards with any remaining cards being set aside). Each player chooses two cards to pass face down to their right-hand neighbor, then the round begins. In the first round, choose a starting player at random; in later rounds, the loser of the previous round begins.<br/><br/>The starting player chooses one card from their hand and plays it into the center of the table. Each player in turn must play a card of the same strength or higher; if a player can't play higher or doesn't want to, then they must discard their single lowest card. This is called a &quot;tail-tucking move&quot;.<br/><br/>After each player has played a card, whoever has played the highest card (with later-played cards breaking a tie), leads a card to the next round. If at least one player has performed a tail-tucking move, then you can play a set of cards of the same strength (from two- to five-of-a-kind) instead of a single card. If you do, in turn, each player must play a set of the same strength of higher; if they can't or won't, then they must discard a number of their lowest cards equal to the number of cards in the set.<br/><br/>A player cannot play a set that would leave them with no cards in hand, which means that the final trick of the round must be with a single card. Whoever plays the highest single card loses the round, and they collect their card and the two lowest-valued cards, then place those cards in the doghouse in front of them. You scoop any cards not in doghouses, then shuffle and deal the next round.<br/><br/>When a player collects seven different types of cards in front of themselves, the game ends and they lose. (Alternatively, the game ends if so many cards have been placed in doghouses that you can't deal at least five cards to each player.) When the game ends, whoever has collected the fewest cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to have the most points by the end of the game (containing as many rounds as the number of the players).<br/><br/>At the beginning of the round cards are dealt equally to the players (10 cards each by 6 players, 12 by 5 players etc.). Each player chooses cards from the hand and places them face down in the middle of the table (3/4/5/6 players 4/3/2/2 cards). After turning them up, each player picks cards from the table (3/4/5/6 players 4/3/2/2 cards).<br/><br/>The player on turn plays a card. The player on left must play a card of the same colour as the card of the player that started the round (but no trick compulsion). If he does not have such a card, he can play any card. Other players play a card according to the above mentioned rules as well in clockwise direction.<br/><br/>The player whose card has the highest rank of the led colour gets the trick. He puts the trick onto his pile (face down). The round ends when players are out of cards.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>Each trick is worth 6/8/10/12 points by 3/4/5/6 players. Each red dragon card taken in a trick scores as many penalty point against the player winning the trick, as the rank of the card, except for the &bdquo;red dragon 11&rdquo; that costs 26 penalty points. If any of the player manage to do the slam, i.e. to take all the tricks he immediately wins the whole game.<br/><br/>Players who take no tricks in a deal gain points depending on the number of the players and the number of the players taking no tricks either in the round.<br/><br/>",

By 1945 it had, for all practical purposes, swept the German air force (Luftwaffe) from the skies, and was bombing targets throughout the shrinking Third Reich almost with impunity. But getting to that point was no easy task&hellip;<br/><br/>You, as commander, 8th Air Force, have a very full plate! Early on, insure victory in the Battle of the Atlantic by bombing submarine bases in western France, then support the eventual Allied invasion of occupied France by bombing railroads and river crossings throughout France and western Germany. Failure in these critical bombing campaigns is not acceptable. Long-term, you&rsquo;ll need to pulverize Germany&rsquo;s aircraft factories and oil facilities to reduce the Luftwaffe&rsquo;s aircraft production and support, and win the war by blasting Germany&rsquo;s heavy industry. There will be more challenges along the way, from providing heavy support for the D-Day invasion and Normandy breakout, to suppressing the demoralizing V1 and V2 attacks on England, to assisting your Soviet ally by attacking German army staging areas in the east.

        "description": "For the casual reader who looks into the &ldquo;100 Days&rdquo; and the Waterloo Campaign, one of the early questions is, &ldquo;Who (the heck) is Grouchy?&rdquo; Followed up by wondering why (on earth) Napoleon would give this guy a third of his army and depend on him to keep Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Prussians far from Wellington.<br/><br/>In context of Grouchy&rsquo;s performance then, it&rsquo;s a very reasonable question. But the answer goes back to February,1814, where - at the Battle of Vauchamps &ndash; then-Cavalry-General Grouchy showed he could be extremely good at chasing Bl&uuml;cher.<br/><br/>Vauchamps is one of those interesting battles mostly lost in the blur of &ldquo;the 1814 Campaign,&rdquo; where Napoleon kept giving bloody noses to the advancing allied armies but never quite had the strength for a decisive victory. Few Allied noses were as far out in front as that of Marshal Bl&uuml;cher. There, in a small chapter called the &ldquo;Six Days Campaign,&rdquo; Napoleon dealt the &ldquo;Army of Silesia&rdquo; defeat after defeat. Reeling from this, Bl&uuml;cher tried to disengage from Napoleon&rsquo;s personal attention and attack an isolated corps under Marmont, with a mostly infantry force that included the names Zieten, Pirch, and Kleist that we would see in 1815.)<br/><br/>But &ldquo;Boney&rdquo; anticipated that move and turned the tables on Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Prussians and Russians, who were advancing with little cavalry. For one time in 1814, Napoleon had more horses engaged and used them well.<br/><br/>The Battle of Vauchamps can be seen in three phases...Bl&uuml;cher advancing while Marmont falls back toward reinforcement, Marmont&rsquo;s counterattack, and Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s shock at discovering &ldquo;the Ogre&rdquo; again confronting him and falling back. Phase 3 is a long pursuit action - French cavalry hounding Allied squares (and breaking several!) Had the ground been less muddy (allowing the French horse artillery to stay closer), things would have been even worse for the Allies. As it was, in the final count, Allied losses may have been greater than 10-1 over the French, and Bl&uuml;cher (once again) was very nearly captured.<br/>[publisher's description]<br/><br/>La Bataille de Vauchamps is the 2013 ATO Annual. Designed by the original Marshal Enterprises team of Monte Matteson, Dennis Spors and James Soto, it comes with a full color, 17&quot; x 44&quot; map board and over 400 colorful, die-cut counters, plus rules, charts and everything you need. Vauchamps serves as a good intro or entry level game to the &ldquo;La Bataille&rdquo; system, made popular with Clash of Arms Games and with fans all over the world. Our Annual also includes a deluxe-sized magazine with even more articles and interesting stories. Learn more about this intriguing battle, and other items of military history as well.<br/><br/>",

The main differences from other titles are associated with how the canal companies fade away as the rail companies come to dominate.<br/><br/>The game begins in the Canal Age. In stock rounds, players auction the Private Companies and the Minor Companies. In operating rounds, the Privates pay a fixed income and the Minors lay track, earn revenues, and buy boats.<br/><br/>In due course, the game enters the Railway Age. In stock rounds, players may buy shares in Public Companies (which start as 5-share). In operating rounds, Publics lay track, place station markers, earn revenues, and buy trains. If they have reached their destination, they may grow into a 10-share company. Minors become fixed-income like Privates, and may be acquired by Publics.<br/><br/>The game ends when a Public share price exceeds a certain value. The player with the highest worth (cash + shares) wins.<br/><br/>",

The two new alien species are unable or unwilling to converse with the humans from the base game. We call them The Hive and The Storm, who knows what they call themselves. The Hive have organic ships that rapidly heal and spew out a seemingly endless stream of parasitic boarding pods that can quickly destroy a ship from the inside out. The Storm's fleet wields incredible firepower, are very manoeuvrable, and their shield generators are more resilient than our own. Though they are generally weaker in defence and tend to swoop in to attack before retreating to a safe distance. Flick your ships into position and then flick dice from them at your opponents' ships to damage them and degrade their systems.<br/><br/>As with the base game and previous expansions, there is a deluxe and standard version.

In each turn, you get a number of island cards and a few blanks, and you place them face-down in the different slots at the strip, either above or below. The blank cards are used so you don't give away which slots you are using. When all players are done, everyone reveals the first card and compares the first value (size), and the player with the highest number wins. In the second slot, the smallest size wins, etc.<br/>After each trick, the winning player sorts cards they won by ocean. At the end of the game, whoever has most cards for a given ocean scores for that ocean, ohter players discard their cards for that ocean. The player who has most cards afterwards, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Omega Chess is a variant of Chess, played on an expanded board with two new types of pieces.<br/>It mostly follows the rules of traditional chess.<br/><br/>The whole chessboard has 10x10+4 squares: it consists of one large expanded 10x10 square with ten rows and ten columns of squares, as well as four additional squares which are located diagonally to each corner.<br/><br/>Those outmost corners are the opening position for the Wizards, one new kind of piece in Omega Chess. The other new kind of piece are the Champions, which are located in the corners of the 10x10 square, with a Pawn in front of them (there are ten in total) and a Tower to their side. The remaining pieces - that are also found on a traditional 8x8 square - are between the Champions and their Pawn, arranged as usual.<br/><br/>Similarly to the Knight, the new pieces are classified as leapers, which allows them to jump over pieces. A Champion can jump two squares in all eight directions. The Wizard can either jump three squares straight and then one square to either side, or move one square diagonally. Except for Pawns, standard pieces move as usual. Pawns are also allowed to move three squares from their initial position. As with moving two squares at once, they can be captured en passant when doing so.<br/><br/>",

You and your friends pit your imaginations against each other as you dream up ways to overcome unlikely challenges (...now an eerily well-coordinated horde of angry jelly fish begins to rock the boat until it tips precariously from side to side...) with an even unlikelier set of resources (...and all you have is an ice axe, ten coconuts, a set of snow tires, one pound of leg hair, and a complete collection of Hitchcock films).<br/><br/>In each round, the players are all presented with the same challenging situation, but each player has different objects that they can use as their resources to resolve the situation. Each player comes up with a story about how they'll solve the situation using exactly three of the five objects in their hand, and then everyone takes a turn pitching their story to a judge. A winning story is selected, a new player becomes the judge, and the next round begins.<br/><br/>",

But when is the best time to score...?<br/><br/>The card deck consists of 55 double-sided cards. The digits 0-10 appear in every combination on these cards, with the digits always differing. Players start with 7-8 cards in hand depending on the player count. On a turn, you do one of two things, looking only at the side of the cards facing you:<br/><br/><br/>    Discard a straight of exactly three cards with consecutive numbers, or<br/>    Discard one or more cards of the same value.<br/><br/><br/>End your turn by drawing one card from the deck and adding it to your hand. If you have played exactly three cards with the same number, each other player must flip a zero in their hand to the other side or draw a card from the deck.<br/><br/>Each time you draw a card, you can place it in your hand with the already revealed side facing you or flip it to the other side, after which you can't flip it back.<br/><br/>If a player has only zeroes in their hand at the end of their turn, they reveal them to end the round immediately. Otherwise, a player can choose to knock to end the round, after which each other player can take one final turn. No matter how the round ends, players then sum the value of cards in their hand. The player with the lowest sum scores 0 points, while everyone else scores their sum; if a player knocked, then didn't have the lowest sum, they score a 5-point penalty in addition to their sum.<br/><br/>Play multiple rounds until a player has 50+ points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Will you take a risk and guess early? Or will you acquire more cards to make your guess more certain? If you guess correctly, you win! If you&rsquo;re wrong, <br/>you&rsquo;re out!<br/><br/>In Concluzio, each player has 5 cards in hand and a 6th card facing outward towards the other players, this is each player's secret card. It's up to each player to correctly guess the 3 attributes of their secret card correctly, to win the game. On a player's turn, a player will play a card down in front of them and ask the player to their left if the card played, has any matching attributes of the secret card that player is holding. If there's a match, the other player will honestly say, yes or no. The asking player then draws another card from the draw deck. It's then up to the asking player to organize and deduce which 3 elements are on their secret card. Eventually through deduction, a player will think they have figured out what their secret card is. When a player is confident they know what their secret card is, instead of playing a card and asking, they will announce the 3 attributes on their card. For instance, &quot;I think my secret card is a 7, black solid circle.&quot; If they are the first player to correctly guess, they win! If the player guesses any of the attributes incorrectly, they lose and are out of the game.

Roles can be viewed and switched several times before all is said and done, then the final vote takes place.<br/><br/>As in One Night Ultimate Werewolf, your goal is to figure out the secret roles of your opponents as well as your own role by the end of the game.

In addition to the 3-7 players, three staff members roam the castle, and each of them also has a secret role.
