        "description": "Mobile Armour Jousting pits two mobile armours - the agile mechanoid suits you see on the news putting down Jovian revolts and guarding the President - against each other in one-on-one combat. The aim isn't so much to kill your opponent as to force them out of the ring, sumo-style; once you damage their engines a bit they'll probably do it themselves just by accident, MAs are hard enough to control at the best of times.<br/><br/>A lot of colonists think that the MAJ circuit is their ticket Earthside, and the prizes are certainly magnificent. But the tricks you learn docking with fuel ships or dodging bandits under the rings of Saturn don't prepare you for a Mobile Armour. There's nothing like it; these beasts are as twitchy as they are powerful. And that's not to mention that the Extra-Solar Tournament is the only open tourney that unranked knights from the colonies can even enter, and that's held right the way out in the Reaches where you're just as likely to be hit by a lump of floating rock as a missile from your opponent...<br/><br/>MAJESTY - Mobile Armour Jousting: Extra-Solar Tournament - is a dexterity game in which you move little cardboard tokens around on a hex map. Players take turns to flick discs on their control boards - one for Throttle and one for Manoeuvre thrusters - which determine whether their Mobile Armour executes a perfect slide behind the enemy mecha to deliver a solid shot to the rear or spins wildly in place before careening off in the wrong direction. Players' mecha retain momentum from previous turns' acceleration, and half the challenge is to stay in the arena while being buffeted by cannon fire and homing missiles.<br/><br/>The use of small control boards means that unlike many dexterity games, MAJESTY doesn't require a large, flat and smooth surface upon which to play.<br/><br/>",

The Jokers need to be distinguished as strong (&quot;red&quot;) and weak (&quot;black&quot;).<br/><br/>The cards are ranked from the strong Joker, weak Joker, all the twos, Aces, Kings etc down to the threes. There is no difference between cards of the same denomination. Jokers are completely wild and can replace any card in forming a meld. Twos are partly wild and can be used to represent a card of equal denomination to another. Twos can never be used in a single sequence.<br/><br/>The object of the game for all the players is to discard all their cards. The dealer initially leads and can play any meld. Players wishing to play must play the same number and type of meld, but higher ranking (e.g. a pair of fours above a pair of threes) or they may pass. It is not compulsory to play cards if a player can do so. Play continues until all players pass. The last person who played can then proceed again with any meld he chooses. If the player who played last goes out (and all the other players have passed) then the player to his left proceeds.<br/><br/>The dealer shuffles the cards and deals them to his left (any cutting of the cards is entirely optional and is left to the choice of the dealer). All the cards are dealt and there should be 11 cards for all players except for the dealer who has 10. In the first hand the dealer is chosen at random, usually the first person to turn up a Jack.<br/><br/>Pits is a corrupt version of the Chinese game Zhēng Sh&agrave;ngy&oacute;u.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "41 (or Forty-One) is a traditional card game commonly played in Syria and Lebanon.  It is a partnership trick-taking game, in the same family as Whist and Boston, with a substantial difference from most such games: players bid and score individually.<br/><br/>Bidding and play is counter-clockwise, and traditionally trumps are always Hearts.  In turn, each player bids a number of tricks they expect to take.  The dealer, who bids last, can potentially cause the hand to be re-dealt by the next player if the total bid score count is less than 11.  Play is as in most trick-taking games: match suit if possible, otherwise trump if desired or  throw off; highest card of the suit led wins, unless trump is played, in which case highest trump wins, and winner leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>A player scores a number of points equal to their bid if they get at least that many tricks on their own (so 3 points for bidding 3 and winning 3 or more tricks), and loses that many points if they fail to get their bid (so -3 points for bidding 3 and winning 2 or fewer tricks).  A bid of 7 or above is for double stakes (14/-14 for 7, 16/-16 for 8) and guarantees that the hand is played.<br/><br/>The winning partnership is the first to have a player reach at least 41 with their partner's score above 0.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is 100 A.D. The present emperor is Trajan; one of Rome's greatest generals, leading Rome's greatest military expansion. He has ruled for two glorious years. The senate is largely perfunctory, but those in power still seek the Emperor's ear in order to push their own agendas. This game is about trying to gain Trajan's favor and rule Rome from the shadows.<br/><br/>In 100 A.D. players are members of a secret cabal attempting to control the Senate from behind the scenes. By manipulating the system, passing Bills that improve their status, and gaining influence over the city's factions, the players gain control over various aspects of Rome. Victory points are earned by having influence over the Senate, factions, Senators, and Emperor's Favor. At the end of the game, the player with the most extensive power structure (i.e. victory points) wins.<br/><br/>Throughout the game players take various actions to impact three different portions of the game board in order to accumulate victory points. Players can control the Emperor's Favor, the Senate, or the various factions of the game (or some combination thereof). Players also need to manage their corruption, as too much will lose them points. Generally, players have only one action per turn, but various cards and tokens can be used to gain additional actions.<br/><br/>Each round starts with the Orator, who advances the round token one space and takes an action. During a player's turn, he or she takes one action play then passes clockwise. The actions a player can take on their turn are: Call in a Favor (by playing a faction card); Contact a Faction (by placing influence tokens on a faction space and drawing the appropriate card); Control a Senator (by buying their seat); Remove Influence (withdrawing influence tokens from factions); or Subterfuge (a special action that can vary depending on the circumstances).<br/><br/>When all players have taken a turn, the round is over. At three different times during the game (after rounds 5, 10, and 15) Recess is called and victory points are tallied. Recess is also where players adjust their faction points, and vote on Bills. Players need to be keenly aware of how little time they have before the game is over.<br/><br/>",

But you have to get past other races in order to obtain it. Hailed by its alpha testers as the Magic: The Gathering of sci-fi, this game breaks traditional card game mechanics and rearranges them into something that feels new and fresh!<br/><br/>In Conquest at Kismet, you play as one of two races vying for control of the Kismet sector in the Raccroc Galaxy. This simple game uses a lottery-like method of resolving battle, something that's never been used in a card game before. This allows for a very small table footprint while having a healthy mix of tactics and luck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Air Raid - Pearl Harbor! is a detailed simulation and study of an iconic event in U.S. and, indeed, world history. It is an extensively researched wargame inspired by the nearly life-long interest of the designer in the subject matter. Units are individual ships and also individual aircraft, although these are amalgamated into various counters by aircraft type. There is area movement for some portions of the map, and the areas of particular interest are modeled using 250-yard-wide hexes. The simulation is detailed but not overly complex and includes various subsystems to render results for air-to-air, air-to-ground/ship, anti-aircraft, and also anti-submarine operations, to engage any full-size and/or midget Japanese submarines brought into action.<br/><br/>The initial scenario may be played by two players, although it is designed to be a solitaire introduction to the system and also a way to let players experience and study this historic battle, to give insight into much of what happened and why. The likelihood is that you will achieve the historical result, a Japanese Tactical Victory. The standard scenario presents all of the forces available to both sides and allows the Japanese player to modify his or her deployment and attack plans up to and including the composition of the two attack waves. If you think you can plan a more successful attack than Minoru Genda did, you have here the tools to try. Conversely, the U.S. player has the opportunity to fight back to the best of his or her ability, and various optional rules - particularly variations in the initial Alert Level - give the U.S. player more assets with which to fight and more assets to save through evacuation.<br/><br/>There is also a scenario which has one or two American aircraft carriers in port and your initial thought is probably that this is a huge bonus toward Strategic Victory for the Japanese. However, the main Japanese player dilemma of this simulation is that the Japanese have a finite amount of aircraft and ordnance, and more targets are not necessarily a guarantee of victory. You will find that you need to target appropriately and generally roll for damage well in order to successfully hit everything you need to hit. The options allowing a third strike later in the day or the next day are a gamble - you can strike again, but at a fully alerted, albeit weakened, set of targets and you risk losing more aircraft, which equal Victory Points for the U.S.<br/><br/>",

You either win or become rabbit food.<br/><br/>This game uses the Looney Pyramids, some dice and a checkerboard to recreate the sense of total victory of your crop surviving while others fail.<br/><br/>Included with the Kickstarter shipment of Pyramid Arcade as one of the twelve bonus Looney Pyramid cards created for $333 level backers.<br/><br/>Number of Players: 2 or 4<br/><br/>Equipment: Timer (optional), 8x8 board, a rainbow stash per player (up to four), a Pyramid die and a Color die<br/><br/>Who Starts: The player who has spent the most time in a garden goes first. If it is a tie, rock-paper-scissors to see who goes first.<br/><br/>Setup: For a two player game, set up the a chessboard with one red trio and one yellow trio on one corner of the board just off the side of the board (they represent the carrots) &amp; one green trio and one blue trio on the opposite corner of the board just off the side of the board (they represent the broccoli). Place the remaining red, yellow, green, and blue pyramids off the board at a neutral corner.<br/><br/>On the diagonal of the board in between the two players, form a line of random black pyramids. One pyramid per space. There should be an empty square at the corners of the board. The black pyramids represent the garden wall. For a four player game, set up the chessboard with each color at a corner just off the board. Form an x of black pyramids in the middle of the board. One pyramid per space. There should be an empty square at the corners of the board.<br/><br/>Each of the open spaces represents a part of the backyard. Place two of the same color trios off each side of the board near the opening of each of the x sections, touching the edge. The remaining trios should be accessible to the other players off the side of the board.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The first player rolls the Color and the Pyramid die. The player selects the pyramid based on the color and size rolled on the dice. If the dice roll shows two pieces, select one of the two pieces. If the dice roll shows the atom (*), select any color. You may place that pyramid any square on the board that does not have a pyramid already. This represents planting the seed in the garden.<br/><br/>If you roll black, you may move one of the black pyramids from the wall that matches the pyramid from the other dice. The black pyramid can only be moved one orthogonal space and must be no more than two squares away from the other black pyramids.<br/><br/>If your roll matches a combination that is already on the board, you may move one of the pyramids one square orthogonally on the board. If there is already a pyramid on that square, a player can not move into that square. If the pyramid was moved by the previous player, it can not be moved this turn.<br/><br/>Winning: During a two player game, the player wins when they have ten of their pyramids in their corner of the chessboard. All of the pieces must be orthogonally touching with one of the pieces in the corner of the board. In addition, all of the pieces must be on the same side of the wall. If a piece in on the wall line, it does not count as being on your side of the wall.<br/><br/>During a four player game, the player wins when they have ten of their pyramids in their side of the yard. All of the pieces must be orthogonally touching. In addition, all of the pieces must be on the same side of the wall. If a piece in on the wall line, it does not count as being on your side of the wall.<br/><br/>",

The sender may lie if it is a bomb and say any value, but if it is a number card, they cannot lie and must say the actual value of the card.

        "description": "Great Comics Adventure is a tabletop card game celebrating the history of Comic Book Characters from the Golden Age. The deck includes 90 Triumph Cards and 18 City Cards. Several major cities are represented in 'The Great Comic Adventure' (GCA) all featured as post-cards. On the back of each post-card is the sequence of cards required to 'claim' that city. Once the five cards in your hands match the post-card, it is then claimed. Once you claim a city you will grab another, and once you claim three cities you win the round!<br/><br/>All the characters and images used in this game are from the Public Domain, so they belong to all of us! In general, works published after 1977 will not fall into the public domain until 70 years after the death of author, or, for corporate works, anonymous works, or works for hire, 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever expires first. Pre-1978 works what are in the public domain because they were published without proper copyright notice, or, in the case of pre-1964 works, were not timely renewed, do not receive retroactive protection under the CTEA. Similarly, works published before 1923, do not receive retroactive protection, and remain in the public domain. All of these comic books were published in the Golden Age of Comic Book History which all started with one super hero, Superman. The Golden Age could be given a specific start time thank to Superman #14 (Feb. 1942), this is when we ushered in the Golden Age of Comic Books. The Golden Age of Comic Books describes an era of American comic books from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. During this time, modern comic books were first published and rapidly increased in popularity. All the comics in the game feature comics from the 1940's and 1950's along with the post card designs featured as well.<br/><br/>",

Choose your character and begin your adventure into the wilds! But watch out! The curse which brought Ilkannon to ruin is still housed within its walls! Restore the city - but make sure you don&rsquo;t unleash corruption upon the world!<br/><br/>You play one of four characters: An adventurer, a politician, a scholar, or a mechanic. Each person has their own goals within the city, and each one has their own faults that make them susceptible to various curses. The ultimate end goal is to find four power crystals to revitalize the city or to find one item to bring back to tell of their great discovery!<br/><br/>There are four main stats which each character has: Corruption Resistance, Movement, Restoration, and Ingenuity.  Corruption Resistance is how susceptible a character is to the dark forces still at work in Ilkannon.  This is used mostly during events.  Movement is how far the character can move on their turn.  Restoration is how many tiles a character can restore on their turn.  Ingenuity is used for events, and is based on how well the character deals with certain situations outside of their normal state.  Corruption Resistance and Ingenuity affect how many dice the character rolls during certain events.<br/><br/>The city of Ilkannon is composed of sixteen tiles, laid out in a grid of four by four.  These tiles are double sided, with one side being Wilderness and the other side being the Restored city.<br/><br/>Turn order is as follows:<br/><br/>1) Move or Restore<br/>2) Draw an Event<br/>3) Corruption activates. This only happens once part of Ilkannon is Restored. If no tiles are Restored, Corruption sleeps.<br/><br/>",

Players compete to see who can achieve victory, or at least to see who will be the last one alive...<br/><br/>Inspired by the possibilities found in Munchkin but frustration with its gameplay relying on random luck, &quot;Where's My Chainsaw?&quot; is a strategy-based evolution that minimizes randomness and emphasizes social interaction.  You'll also find many added game mechanics we've loved over the years, such as varying win conditions, multiple forms of currency, and a strong comeback mechanic to ensure everyone stays in the game.  Are you curious what a &quot;take-that&quot; game would be like if it was designed for serious gamers?  So were we!<br/><br/>Gameplay occurs as the players take turns accumulating Special cards (actions) and Weapons, and then battling various enemies.  Strategy is very flexible and social interaction is key, as alliances and betrayals are the driving forces behind whether you will succeed or fail in combat.<br/><br/>Each character has a slightly different goal to achieve victory, although anyone can win by being the only player who hasn't died yet.  This allows gaming groups to adjust their approach as players try to find a balance between cooperation and competition.  Other ways to win include collecting items, a high combat score, or defeated enemies (depending on your character).  A new comeback mechanic ensures that no player is ever out of the game, so everyone can continue to compete and win even after dying multiple times.<br/><br/>Where's My Chainsaw? includes over 200 unique full-color cards, beautifully and hilariously illustrated by Paul Dozier.  This cooperative and competitive game supports 4 to 8 players and lasts 60-90 minutes.  If you're looking for a great social game where your decisions and tabletalk determine the outcome, you're in the right place!<br/><br/>",

Food is running low for you and your fellow pirates, and there won&rsquo;t be a rescue any time soon. To make matters worse, there seems to be a group of cannibals on board, making their way through the crew at night, one by one&hellip;<br/><br/>Osprey Adrift is a card game of deduction, deception, and cannibalism for 4 to 12 players, set aboard the cursed One Winged Osprey during the golden age of piracy.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, each player is given the role of one of the hardened and storied pirates of the Osprey. In addition to their public Role card, each player is given a secret Identity card: Sane or Cannibal. If you&rsquo;re Sane, it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out who the Cannibals are so you can force them to walk the plank. And if you&rsquo;re a Cannibal? Convince the Sane that you&rsquo;re one of them so you can turn them into your next dinner&hellip;<br/><br/>Osprey Adrift's gameplay centers around a dual pronged flow of eliminations: The Cannibals eliminate one of the Sane each round, and the entire crew votes to eliminate one more player each round (with the Sane hoping they're getting rid of a Cannibal).<br/><br/>Players draw cards off the Scavenge deck to stock their hands with Food (needed to stay in the game), Coins (used to bid on the right to be Captain each round, and as victory points should the player survive to the end of the game), Actions (used to perform special feats to help or hinder players), and Resources (needed to power many of the Actions). Or, if a player knows they need specific cards, they can dare to ask their fellow crewmates if they'd like to make a trade - in a separate room from the rest of the players, where a pirate's parley can be formed.<br/><br/>",

You read that right, IT vs Zombies. This isn't your typical card game. Get ready for a fast paced, trash talking, turn on a dime, army building card game. It starts like this; choose your IT Champion, cards are dealt, you're fighting against the other players, and the evil Der Magicker a diabolical hacker. You see Der Magicker is building his army of zombies to take over the world and more importantly beat you and the other players. Champions must gather or steal weapons, troops, and strategically play cards to beat Der Magicker and the other players. There are many ways to gather your army, draw a card, attack another player, kill a higher powered zombie, etc. Pay close attention because one card will change the game entirely or can be a win card with the correct gameplay. No sleeping allowed! Let the game begin, if you dare......<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing planets and stars with energy as powerful as God.

Freedom of Speech is a hilarious card&nbsp;game&nbsp;that almost guarantees that you will laugh and have a good time. The game comes with a deck of 400 cards, each containing a bizarre and silly word, a timer and instructions. Every other person around the table is on the same team and the rotation moves counter-clockwise. The deck stays at the center of the table and whoever has their turn draws from the deck. The aim is to get your teammates to guess the word on the card before the timer runs out. However, you cannot say the word that is on the card. In addition, there are other rules, like no rhyming or pointing, that you can find in the full instructions on the website. Finally, once your team guesses the word, the play moves to the other team immediately. The first team to guess 21 cards correctly wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The player (child) can explore at most one new tile per turn. You lose if the monster catches you or if the monster exits the maze before you do.<br/><br/>かくされた部屋 (Kakusareta heya) is 'Hidden Rooms', a solitaire game where your objective is to escape from the dark room you are trapped in with a random monster. If you escape, you get a point. If the monster catches you, or the monster walks to the end of its path: you fail. Get 2 points for victory in the game, or fail 3 times and you lose.<br/><br/>The monster is determined randomly at the beginning of a round. The game has a small booklet, showing the monsters and their paths. The monster's movement depends on the monster's type, different monsters move differently. Although the monster has predetermined 'movement path', when the player is in close range of the monster, it ignores the path and starts to chase, until the player gets out of sight of the monster.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of the following phases: monster moves (2 steps), player moves (2 steps), player searches (1 tile). Monster moves are mandatory, the player's moves or searches are optional.<br/><br/>On the monsters turn, when in close range, monster moves to chase the player. Or else, it follows the predetermined path.<br/><br/>On the player's turn, first, you may move up to 2 tiles. Then, you may do a search. To search, you draw a tile from a face-down shuffled pile of tiles. If the tile drawn may be legally connected to the tile you are standing on, you may place that tile. It is legal when: the tile colors are the same or the number is greater than the tile you are on.<br/><br/>If you fail to connect, the tile drawn must be placed on a 'memory area'. In further turns, you may draw a tile from this area instead of drawing from the pile. But this area has a max capacity of 5, whenever you placed the 6th tile, it spills. You must then place all the 'memory tiles' back in the pile, face-down, and shuffle them.<br/><br/>You start from the bottom-right tile. You escape if you successfully reach the top-left tile. You fail when the monster catches you, or the monster reaches the end of its track.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>「かくされた部屋」&rdquo;Hidden Rooms&rdquo;は、1人プレイ専用のすこし変わったボードゲームです。<br/><br/>ゲームの目的は、あなたを封じ込める忌まわしい暗闇から抜け出すこと。<br/>あなたに与えられた行動範囲は、はじめこそ僅かなものですが、手番を消費し探索を行うことで、徐々にこれを拡張していくことが出来ます。<br/>幸いゴールがどこかはわかっています、しかし注意してください。ただ出口を目指して突き進むだけでは、足元をすくわれることになるかもしれません。<br/><br/>なぜならこの空間にはもう一つの徘徊者が存在し、それはあなたを捉えようと蠢いているのです。<br/>かれを振り切るには、ときには脇道を探し、自由に動ける空間を確保する必要があるでしょう。<br/>あなたの知恵と勇気、機転と運を駆使して、光を掴み取るのです！<br/><br/>&quot;Kakusareta Heya&quot;(Hidden Rooms) is a unique solitaire board game.<br/><br/>Your objective is to get out of this hideous darkness. You may only move in a limited range at first, but by spending your &quot;search actions&quot; may expand your mobility. Fortunately, you know where the goal is. Unfortunately, rushing towards the goal may swipe your feet.<br/><br/>In this void however, there is also a prowler, wriggling around to get you. To outrun them, you may need to find some sideways, and secure some area to freely move around. Gather all your wisdom and might, wits and luck, to grasp the light and flee from darkness!<br/><br/>",

Your simple goal is to be a better railroad baron than your opponent. You do this by winning contracts to build track which connects one USA city to another in a series of competitions. The major elements you need are materials, labor and cash, although interesting people (contacts, investors, etc.) and effects such as material shortages and labor unrest will come your way. Engaging in a little trickery won&rsquo;t hurt you, either.<br/><br/>A game of 1859 is played over eleven competitions (rounds). At the beginning of each competition, one player will choose a card from two which show the possible routes to be contested. Each player has a hand of five cards.<br/><br/>After a player plays a card, a replacement is drawn from the deck, replenishing his hand back to five cards. After a number of competitions, usually eleven, the game ends. The player who earned the most profits wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If you like classic trick taking games like Spades, Euchre or Hearts, you will love the extra strategy in Court which includes special card powers, varying objectives and set collection.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of cards, they take turns playing a card into the &quot;trick&quot; like traditional trick taking games highest card played wins the trick and a crown worth -2 points at the end of the game but in Court the lowest card played in the trick gets to trigger its card power. Winning tricks is powerful but sometimes you want to come in last to trigger that special power just at the right moment to swing the game. You have to watch out for the powerful character cards though, when played they not only win the trick but also get to use their power.<br/><br/>After a trick is completed the winner gets to distribute the cards played to the &quot;Court&quot; in front of each player, the court serves two purposes, first the cards in each players court at the end of the hand is the players score for the round. Second after scoring each player picks up the cards in their court and that is their hand for the next round.<br/><br/>There is also random special objectives in play rewarding players with negative points for getting specific card combinations in their court.<br/><br/>The game is played over 3 rounds. At the end of three rounds the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

You get extra points for matching the dealer most of the time, so you have to think about what they'll write. If all the background colors match, matching the dealer doesn't give you an advantage, but all points are tripled! Some cards have a star on them that means points are doubled, but they might be harder to give a single name to than the other cards...<br/><br/>The rules are in Japanese and many of the cards are chosen with relevance to Japanese culture or language, but you don't need to read or understand Japanese to use them.

The story behind Homia is that Nigeria is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious country and the player must create a family regardless of the culture or religion. It&rsquo;s designed to be easy to play. You choose a family and build the family.<br/><br/>Homia is a Memory-style game, where you look at a face down card and try to remember what kind it is. Until you find a homestead tile (also called a &quot;family pad&quot;), you will only memorize where the various tiles are, and put them back face down on the table. Once you finally discover a family pad, you take it into your area. The family pad has various symbols that represent different parts of a household, such as fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, and pets. The color of the symbol tells you what kind of other cards you will need to complete your family pad. If your family pad has a green symbol, for example, you need to collect one &quot;father&quot; (green background) card to add to your family pad. If there are three yellow symbols on the family pad card, it means he has three daughters, so you'll need to find three of the &quot;daughter&quot; (yellow background) cards to complete your family. If you have a good memory of the cards you looked at before finding your family pad, it will be much easier to find the members of the household required to complete your family pad. Whoever completes their family pad first is the winner!<br/><br/>",

The rules feature scenarios for the battles of Fleurus, 1622 and Cheriton, 1644.<br/><br/>All measurements in the game are based on a scale choosen by the players, the base width. Movement distances, weapon ranges, etc, are then multiples of whatever base width has been chosen. The base width is half of the frontage of whatever you wish to use as a unit. Therefore any size of figure and also any basing scheme can be used with the rules. Units represent between 1000 and 2000 infantry or 500 to 800 cavalry, depending on the type of unit.<br/> Battles can be fought to a conclusion in a reasonable amount of time, most in around 4 hours. Most battles are suitable for a single player a side if you wish. Using a unit frontage of 80 to 120mm means most battles are played on a table 120 to 180cm wide (4 to 6'). The system is simple and innovative. It concentrates on you being a high level commander and bringing out the characteristics of the various troop types.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Then the starting player will take their turn and play clockwise.<br/><br/>On Your Turn, you must do one of the following:<br/><br/>1. Place a token on top of a letter on a card, you will place that card in front of you until the end of the round.  It may help you gain points, or cause you to lose points, depending on the outcome of the round.<br/><br/>2.

For each section, check which player has the greater value of frogs. The player who has dominated more sections wins the game.<br/><br/>「カエルの王国」は２～４人用の対戦陣取りゲームです。基本は２人対戦ですが、３，４人で遊べるさまざまなルールも用意しています。<br/>正方形の盤面が5つのエリアに分かれています。盤面はタイルを組み合わせることによって毎回変わります。プレイヤーは複数積まれた手駒を「配置」または「展開」します。双方「配置」も「展開」もできなくなったらゲーム終了です。エリアごとに判定し、ポイントの多い方がそのエリアを制します。5つのエリアをより多く征したプレイヤーの勝利です。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

Avoid the seven deadly sins, embrace the seven heavenly virtues, and you&rsquo;ll be victorious!<br/><br/>In Capital Vices players take actions in order to distribute colored resources of food and money. Doing so will earn you virtues but be sure not to generate a sin penalty! Ending a round with sin will omit you from scoring that round. Have the most virtue and earn a bonus point. The first player to have 7 points at the end of a round is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player turns over one card.  The player with the higher card can take that card and any other or the lower card and two of the remaining face-down cards.  Opponent gets the remaining cards.<br/><br/>Electoral College Combat is designed to simulate the wild swings and uncertainties of election night.  A sound strategy--like a well-run campaign--does not guarantee results.  That's all part of the fun.  While not a gambling game, Electoral College Combat finds its roots in video slots/poker where the wild cards activate bonus rounds.<br/><br/>Each wild card has specific rules.  A player who turns over a second wild card in the same hand wins the remaining cards.<br/><br/>There are twelve hands.  In the 11th and 12th hands each player has only three cards remaining.  When their turn arrives, players must add two cards of the cards they've collected to their hand:  their highest card and another of their choice, shuffle the cards, and place them in front of their opponent.  Play continues as before. When play is concluded, the player with 270 or more electoral college votes wins the presidency.  2nd prize?  Hindsight and book deal.

(As a climbing game, Commander shares some features of its play in common with other climbing games such as President, Tichu, The Great Dalmuti, and Haggis.) Four players play in two partnerships. Six players can play in two teams of three or in three partnerships; eight players can play in two teams of four or in four partnerships.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to shed your cards sooner than opposing team members can shed their cards.  The sooner you shed, the more points you score for your team.<br/><br/>Prior to the start of each hand, a unique blind bidding mechanism elects one player per team as that team's &quot;commander&quot; and also decides which of the newly-chosen commanders has the privilege of playing first. The commander of a team is expected to be the first of the team to shed all their cards -- and ideally, is expected to shed their cards before the other commanders can do so.  Otherwise, a commander faces a penalty that reduces their team's score.<br/><br/>For a complete set of rules to Commander, see the files section or the forum posting in the rules forum. (Note that the playing chips described in these rules and pictured in the representative image are primarily for scoring convenience. The game can also be played with a few spare coins and pen and paper scoring.)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These campaigns revolved around the regions of Manchukuo (Manchuria) and Menjiang (Inner Mongolia), and culminated in the Japanese invasion of China proper, taking the capital at Peiping (Peking). There was also the possibility of Soviet intervention. The game has two players: the Japanese Empire and the Republic of China. The Japanese objective is to gain control of northern China to provide a strategic advantage for the ensuing Sino-Japanese War which commenced in July 1937. The Chinese objective is to retain control of strategic regions of northern China, thereby forestalling a larger Japanese invasion. Each hex on the map represents 75 kilometers across. Each turn of play represents one year of operations. Japanese ground units are divisions and brigades. Allied Japanese, as well as most Chinese units, are at the army and corps level, representing shifting arrays of forces. Air units represent various numbers of sorties needed to accomplish missions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Backdoors &amp; Breaches, an Incident Response Card Game, from Black Hills Information Security and Active Countermeasures contains 52 unique cards to help you conduct incident response tabletop exercises and learn attack tactics, tools, and methods.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the Incident Master will create an incident scenario by selecting an Initial Compromise, C2 and Exfil, Persistence, and Pivot and Escalate cards and give a narrative of the incident to the Responders. Responders will have access to a set of four documented Procedures and will begin to take actions to try and investigate and resolve the incident. For every action, the Responder team rolls a d20 with any available advantages or disadvantages to see if they are successful. Successful actions will lead to revealing additional cards in the scenario.<br/><br/>If all of the scenario cards are revealed or if the Responders take 10 rolls without revealing a new card, the game is over. When the game is complete, the team can discuss their successes and failures and apply what they have learned to their real-life incident response program.<br/><br/>",

Race to find hidden treasures in this fast-paced game of visual perception!<br/><br/>Each card has an object on one side and then an intricate picture on the other. Each player gets 5 cards/scenes to start with and then you flip the top card of the deck to see which object needs to be found. The first player to find the object on one of their cards &quot;wins&quot; that round and then flips the card they just used to reveal the next object to search for. Once a player finds that object on one of their cards, they flip it over to reveal the next object, etc. This continues until one player has flipped all five of their cards, and they are the winner.<br/><br/>An example would be: the first object to find is a barrel. I find a barrel in one of my scenes that takes place in the Wild West. I show everyone the barrel, they confirm it's correct, and then I flip my Wild West card over - the object shown on the back of that card is flowers. I find a garden of flowers on another card that I have, a scene in Medieval Times. Again, I show everyone to confirm and then flip the card over. The next object, on the back of this card, is a bird. Another player is the first to find a bird on their card, they reveal / we confirm, and they flip that card over to reveal the next object we must look for. This continues until one player has found five objects (one on each of their cards that they started with).<br/><br/>",

There will be challenges along the way, but you can overcome them and then find your way back to the surface.<br/><br/>Players first find a cave entrance, then explore cave passages, overcome challenges, and exit the cave safely to end. Score points by tallying the lengths of cave passage explored; get bonus points for specializing in one or more areas of cave research such as geology, biology, or cartography. Each of 104 cards is illustrated and based on accurate depictions of the formations, animals, and equipment that cavers encounter in the underground world. On each turn, a player draws a card and plays or discards a card. They may: play a card in their own play area to gain points or skills or to resolve a challenge;<br/>or play a challenge in another player&rsquo;s area; or discard a card with no effect.<br/><br/>A large portion of the proceeds from the game benefit the National Speleological Society (NSS).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Help the world fight the deadly virus by finding the best possible vaccine!<br/><br/>Each turn you pick one of the face up Vaccine Tiles and add it to your Science Lab (player board). When completing a row or a column in your Science Lab, you make breakthroughs and can complete objectives on Research Cards to gain Vaccine Points. Breakthroughs also let you gain valuable knowledge by secretly looking at a Disease Card - showing you which traits you should try to avoid on the Vaccine Tiles you pick in the future.<br/><br/>All players will start the game with asynchronous information (you all know something, but none of you know the same), so keeping an eye on the other player's choices can increase your chances of picking the best Vaccine Tiles!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the weaknesses of the virus is revealed and final scoring commences - It's time to see how many final Vaccine Points each player scores, for having potent Vaccine Tiles to counter the weaknesses. The player with the most Vaccine Points in total is the winner!<br/><br/>Released as a free Print &amp; Play during March, 2020.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>     Many people world wide are isolated in their homes to prevent spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019). If making and playing a simple board game can keep people indoor for even just a little while longer, we can add that to the prevention of the spreading of the virus.<br/>     Scientists are working hard to find the best possible vaccine for the virus. If, or when, the time comes to administer the vaccines, the number of vaccinated people will directly impact its effectiveness. It&rsquo;s a scientific fact that people fear what they don&rsquo;t know. By educating - even just a little bit on vaccines through play - we&rsquo;ll be able to reduce that fear and make the vaccines more effective.<br/>     On a personal level, this is my contribution to help the global COVID-19 crisis (and similar in the future).

        "description": "A &quot;judge chooses best&quot; ADULT card game full of crazy questions (225 in the first edition to be exact)that incite some long, out of this world conversations. Players choose responses from cards in their hand which were acquired from a random draw pile.  A &quot;judge&quot; asks a question from on of their hand cards and then chooses a best response from all the responses that the other players played from cards in their hand.  Players use their &quot;ducking high&quot; mind to think of funny, exaggerated and out of their mind but brilliant brilliant answers to mind bending questions.  The game requires very little set up whose game length can be tailored to the players time constraints with a typical game allowing for each player to be &quot;the judge&quot;.  Game length depends on the number of players but is best with a group of three or more.  An average game length is about 30 minutes, however, it has an addictive random response effect that can be entertaining for hours.  Due to the nature of the game, obscenities and scenarios this game is recommended for adult groups.<br/><br/>",

Each monarch of the Tudor period has their own section requiring clever use of the dice you roll to score the most points. Crown spaces allow you to reroll the dice and flag spaces must be landed on or your rivals will advance on the English throne!<br/><br/>The timeline starts in 1485 and once you get to the end of the Tudor timeline in 1603 you've completed the game and you add up your total score. The game takes 15-25 minutes to play and you can play again to try and beat your best score!<br/><br/>Tudor Trail requires logic and reading skills as well as basic sorting and simple maths.

The game comes with four rulesets for different games to play with these unique cards.<br/><br/>In TrumPen Poker, you mark 5 cards while trying to avoid duplicating cards with the other players. If the same cards are written by multiple players, the player with stronger hands will be eliminated from the game. Among the remaining players, the player with the strongest hands wins.<br/><br/>In TrumPen Blackjack, you collect played cards so that the sum of the numbers you have is as close to 21 as possible. You score points depending on the sum of the numbers you have. The winner is decided after 3 rounds.<br/><br/>In TrumPen Trick Taking, you play 3 tricks per round for 3 rounds, therefore you play 9 tricks in total and score the points.  Write down the numbers to 3 cards when they are dealt, then write the suit when you play. This is a trick-taking game with must-follow, no trump, and no bidding.<br/><br/>In TrumPen Speed, you play your cards in a way that cards are stacked in sequential order as quickly as possible. The player who played all of their cards first wins.<br/><br/>",

Through this strategy game, you will embody one of these thieves whose goal is to steal crowns in the city and return with them in the rainforest. But watch out: both the city guards and your fellow robbers will try to stop you! Fights, arrow shots and action cards will animate the game...<br/><br/>Gadianton is a board game. To win, you have to be the first to bring back all your stolen crowns in the lush forest surrounding the city. By choosing the number of crowns, you control the duration of the game.<br/><br/>Players move their thief figure and depending on the result of the dice, one of the city guards during the same turn. They can attack in hand-to-hand combat or by shooting an arrow to prevent another thief from fleeing with his crown and taking the advantage. Action cards spice up the game: break your opponent's bow to prevent him from shooting at you!<br/><br/>A bit of strategic thinking, surprises, dynamism and a lot of interactions between players for a successful game and good moments shared by up to 4 players.<br/><br/>An instruction booklet in English /French / German is included in the box. It can also be downloaded in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. However, the action cards have no text on them: the illustration is clear enough, so language will not be a problem when playing. And kids can play even if they can&rsquo;t read yet.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ashes is an annihilation game for two players played on a hexhex board with stackable pieces of two colors. The board starts out empty. Still, all you ever do in Ashes is move stacks. This is accomplished by the help of a very liberal understanding of &quot;stack&quot;: A single piece is considered a stack of size 1, and an empty cell is considered to contain a stack of size 0.<br/><br/>The basic principle of movement is simple: A stack may move to a cell it can see &ndash; i.e. one that is adjacent or joins it in flanking a line of empty cells &ndash; if this cell is not occupied by a bigger stack.<br/><br/>It is important that, every time you remove a stack from the board, whether it was one of yours of an enemy stack, you keep one of its pieces in a designated area (off the board) as a reminder. I'll get back to why you need to keep count of removed stacks.<br/><br/>There is an economy to moving whole stacks, which is responsible for stack's coming into and going out of existence (rules for moving proper parts of stacks are given farther down):<br/><br/>Outward movement gains you:<br/>When a move increases the number of steps away from the center cell the moved stack is, it grows by the addition of 1 piece per step further away it ends up. Pieces initially only come onto the board by moving a stack of size 0 at least 1 step away from the center cell.<br/><br/>Non-outward movement costs you:<br/>When a move does not increase the number of steps away from the center cell the moved stack is, it shrinks by the removal of 1 more than 1 piece per step closer it ends up. This means that a stack not moving outward can travel no farther inward than 1 less than its size.<br/><br/>Reproduction tax:<br/>If you increase the number of stacks you own, the resulting size of the newly created stack must be big enough to pay a reproduction tax equal to the number of stacks you have removed from the board (whether friendly or not). For each removed stack, you must subtract a piece from the newly created stack, and the gross size of the stack must be bigger than the number of stacks you have lost, so that its net size is at least 1. If white's reproduction tax is 2, moving a 0-stack three steps away from the center will only result in a 1-stack.<br/><br/>Splitting stacks:<br/>Instead of moving a whole stack, you may move a proper part of a stack. Only the reproduction tax applies to the moving of proper stack parts. This means that a splitting move can get you places a whole stack move can't.<br/><br/>Splitting a stack can (and normally does) increase the number of stacks you own. When it does, a reproduction tax must be paid.<br/><br/>There is no free passing in Ashes. If you can move, you must. This ensures that stacks must eventually (if they are not captured before that) spend all their pieces moving &quot;non-outward&quot;, and the reproduction tax will eventually be too high to enter a new stack on the board. The game is over as soon as one player has no stacks on the board and is unable to grow a new stack.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The polar ice caps are also melting.<br/><br/>In Volle Scholle, you have to pull your penguins across the melting ice to the finish line as quickly as possible. But watch out! If you risk too much, you'll swim.<br/><br/>Each player receives two game pieces (penguins). A player may roll the dice as many times as he wants. The numbers 3 to 6 each bring one movement point - if a player stops, he may distribute the movement points earned among his two penguins. On a 1 or 2, all points are lost and it is the next player's turn. After each round the ice melts, penguins standing on melted ice fall into the water and are out of the game. The winner is the player who gets the most penguins to the finish line, in case of a tie the fastest penguin.<br/><br/>The special thing about it: the game consists of only one postcard and can be sent. All other materials needed can be found in a well sorted household. :)<br/><br/>",

Players have no idea which True Identity card the other players hold, meaning that a Kira player could very well pass himself off as L, getting his hand on the Death Note in the process.

Each round, each player receives five cards. They get a moment to study their cards, and then exchange them with their partners. Then, each player plays one card facedown (with the intention to pick one that matches the one their partner will play). The played cards are then turned face-up. A team scores two points if both the color and the character on their cards match, and one point if either the color or the character matches. The first team to reach twelve points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each player plays against the other player and also a single shared &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; who is considered a player in its own right but whose cards are played by both. The goal is to capture tricks so that one&rsquo;s total captured card-points are either the highest or the lowest of the two humans and dummy--that is, avoiding being in the middle.  After each hand the top and bottom slots earn sticks (positive game points) while the middle slot earns potatoes (negative game pts). As both players compete against each other over eight hands to earn the most sticks, the Winner must also ensure the Dummy doesn&rsquo;t beat them both--because if it wins, both humans lose, equally.

The act, known as the Defenestration of Prague, marked the beginning of 30 bloody years of warfare&mdash;the Thirty Years War.<br/><br/>Cuius Regio explores the operational military aspects of this pivotal period in European history and focuses on the maneuvers and battles that shook Europe for three decades.<br/><br/>The game includes scenarios covering the Bohemian Revolt, the Danish intervention, the Swedish intervention, the French intervention, and a Thirty Years War campaign of 31 turns lasting from 1618 to 1648. Each scenario has a unique character, and the game can be played in as little as an hour and a half (for a short scenario) or can be a multi-session game for the full campaign.<br/><br/>The turns are divided into two seasons (summer and winter), and each turn has a variable duration that depends on the number of armies activated. In addition, armies can conduct operations several times but become less effective as they accumulate fatigue during each action.<br/><br/>Combat is an integrated system for field battles and sieges and is resolved by a die roll, modified by each army's leadership, composition, and condition, on a simple Battle Results Table.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each tribe will have its own actions and skills (most of the actions will be resolved by rolling dice and their success will depend of the cavemen characteristics). The game has different ways to counterbalance the randomness of the dice (rage token to reroll dice, idea cards with special actions that can be activated if you meet specific condition, etc.).

        "description": "In this solitaire game that aims to recreate fictitious events of 18th century France you will roam around the city of Paris looking for targets, followers of the order. For this you will need to carefully navigate the streets and rooftops, avoiding guards or neutralizing them from the back. But be careful, don&rsquo;t look ahead or ignore your action grid and you will find yourself cornered and you will have to flee. Your goal is to assassinate as many targets as you can before getting to the end of the deck.<br/><br/>To start the game you will gather the map cards into deck in front of you. All cards are face-up and oriented upright. These are the cards you will be moving through throughout the game.<br/>Behind this deck of cards you will place the action tracker card, sideways and with the action grid visible..<br/>These cards you will hold in the palm of your left hand. Using your left index finger to keep track of the game's rounds and your right thumb will be held onto the last used action on the action grid (this is important for later on).<br/><br/>The map cards:<br/>The map cards are the cards your character will be traversing. Your position on the cards must be remembered when playing in-hand. Each map card has one target and many guards, all of which can be assassinated. However the target is of course... the target. And you will gain points depending on how many targets you have assassinated at the end of the game.<br/>The map cards are divided into squares, and most of these squares have one of two &quot;heights&quot;, ground level or rooftop. Movement through connecting squares of the same height is unlimited, however to change height or do other parkour maneuvers you will have to use the action grid.<br/><br/>The action grid:<br/>The action grid contains 4 possible actions, of which you may perform one each round. The catch is that you can never do the same action 2 rounds in a row, and you can only do an action that is connected via an arrow (or line without arrow) to the last used action.<br/><br/>A summary of the actions:<br/><br/>     Jumping. Take a run-up of one square to jump from one over a ground square in the same direction as the run-up.<br/>     Descending. Go down a height.<br/>     Climbing. Go up a level.<br/>     Assassinating. Assassinate a target to claim that card as a point. Or assassinate guards to open up new paths.<br/><br/><br/>These actions are explained in greater detail in the game's rulebook.<br/><br/>Game end:<br/>As explained above you attempt to beat each card by assassinating the target, thus getting a point. Or getting caught by a guard and having to flee to the next card.<br/>You play until you've finished the deck and then tally up your points to see how skilled an assassin you are.<br/><br/>Welcome to the sisterhood!<br/><br/>",

Laid out in a square grid, the buildings of Cartref possess magical effects that vary depending on their residents. Use your wits and magic to amass the greatest wealth in the budding city of Cartref.<br/><br/>On your turn, take 2 actions from the following options. (A) Build a new building and invoke the magic of adjacent goblin buildings. (B) Fulfill a guild Mandate and invoke the magic of bigfolk (human) buildings. (C) Impel the gnomes in one of your gnomish buildings to use their magic. (D) Purify the bad karma (pollution) emitted by the buildings so that you can invoke them again.<br/><br/>Players score Mandates (objective cards) twice -- once when initially fulfilled and again at the game's end. This creates the tension of a race while also provides a framework for strategic planning through the very last turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wortwiesel is a speed word-building game (German language). Each card has 2 letters. There are three types of cards: Cards with 2 consonants, cards with 2 vowels, and cards with 1 consonant and 1 vowel.<br/><br/>Two things are special:<br/>- The cards can be placed next to each other or partially overlapping, so that one letter is covered. Just by smart placement of your cards you can cover and replace letters with those of another card. The combinatorics of just a few cards are breathtaking, and it is this puzzle effect which creates most of the fun. <br/>- The sand timer does NOT define an upper time limit for finishing an action. Instead, the timer defines lower(!) time limit i.e. the period before the next drawing of cards is triggered. It is merely an option: You do not have to trigger drawing immediately once the timer is finished! Instead, it is perfectly fine to take it easy and to grant yourselves more time before taking the next card.<br/><br/>The game starts by flipping the sand timer. Players race to build words out of their cards, using as many letters as possible. Individual letters which are in the way must be covered by other cards, but no card may be covered completely. <br/>Each player has four tiles with which to cover letters at the end or at the beginning of a word, and one wild card tile which can be used for any letter. These tiles can only be used once in the game.<br/>When the sand timer runs out, any player can announce that they are drawing an additional card. All other players must then also draw another card. After a player shouts &ldquo;stop&rdquo;, the sand timer is started one last time. The other players may try to improve their word in that time. The round ends when the timer runs through again. Players mark their words on a score sheet &ndash; the longer a word is, the more points are awarded. <br/>Play three rounds. Deduct points for unused cards, get bonus points for unused tiles. The player with the highest combined score wins.<br/><br/>There's a significant learning curve involved: The more experienced you get the faster you will play. That's when the sand timer kicks in and becomes a tactical element: You can decide whether to rush to a solution or to trigger the next drawing right before your counterpart(s) can finish and conclude the round.<br/><br/>NOTE: The present version Wortwiesel (2023) is designed for German language. Based on the combination of letters and letter frequencies, it ist not directly playable in most other languages. <br/>NOTE by Author: Other language versions are in preparation<br/><br/>",

They are all placed in a pile face down in the centre of the table and, in turn, each player decides which of the possible actions to take: trick, treat or disenchant.<br/>Deal: the player takes two treasures (cards) from the central pile and places them face up in his or her playing area in view of the other players.<br/>Truco: the player enchants (steals) one of the cards from any player's playing area and takes it to his or her playing area but enchanted (horizontally and face up).<br/>Unenchant: the player places all the cards in his or her playing area face up and vertically.<br/>If the player has chosen trick or treat as an action, at the end of the trick or treat, he/she can score in groups of three cards that have the same type of treasure or the same colour, but only the cards that are disenchanted (vertically). Then, in groups of three, he will place them face down forming a pile that will be his treasures already obtained and that nobody will be able to steal from him.<br/>The game ends when the central deck is exhausted and, at that moment, all the face-up cards of each player (enchanted or not) will automatically become part of the scoring deck (face down) of the player on the left. The player with the most face-down cards will be the goblin who has collected the most treasure on Halloween night and, therefore, will have won the game.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Demuestra que eres el duende m&aacute;s ingenioso en la noche de Halloween y acapara el mayor n&uacute;mero de cartas al final de la partida siguiendo las caprichosas normas que gu&iacute;an su avaricia.

        "description": "You are the top agent for undercover operations for the FBI, so it's no surprise that one morning you're called out of bed to infiltrate the maximum security Brooklyn prison incognito.<br/><br/>Your task: Find out who killed Liam O'Reilly. The member of a notorious New York gang was willing to work with the cops and had to pay for it with his life &mdash; but who is behind the murder? To find out, you go deep into the abyss of the American prison system.<br/><br/>To play Masters of Crime: Incognito, you'll use traditional apps like Google Maps or Wikipedia to gather information, while also collecting evidence, investigating crime scenes, and interrogating suspects. Emails, detailed web pages, and cellphone calls are also part of the immersive gaming experience.<br/><br/>In more detail, Incognito is a co-operative deductive murder mystery game in which players must solve puzzles, follow clues, and make decisions to solve a case. They do this using the included deck of cards, twelve hidden realistic clue documents, and the Internet. Through a choose-your-own-adventure mechanism, players make decisions that influence the course of the game and lead to solving the case in the end. One by one, they enter different realistically-designed locations and encounter the various suspects, then they choose from three different ways to deal with the situation and receive points based on their decisions. Complex puzzles and escape room elements must be solved in order to progress further in the case.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tokkuri Taking is a game in which you will use the cards in your hands as either tokkuris, a traditional sake drinking vessel, or to drain some of the sake from the tokkuris on the table.<br/><br/>On your turn, either play a card face down as a tokkuri, or face up. If you play it face up, you must lower the sake level in tokkuri on the table corresponding to the number(s) on the card you played. A round ends once all players have played all of the cards in their hands.<br/><br/>Players will earn positive points for tokkuri they emptied and lose points for those in front of themselves that have too much still in them. The player with the lowest score then takes points equal to the difference between their score and each other player's score - from the other players!<br/><br/>",

The pieces have normal starting positions. The standard plastic chess pieces are ivory white, black and gold. There are eight pawns each.<br/><br/>Movement is somewhat complicated:<br/><br/>     The king and rook can move in 6 directions - onto adjacent hexes that share a side.<br/>     The &quot;diagonal&quot; moves of the queen and bishop involve skipping over the two adjacent hexes of the other colours onto the hex beyond of the same colour. The bishop can thus move in 6 directions, the queen in 12.<br/>     The knight can also moves onto 12 possible hexes - it moves two hexes forward and one to the side, always onto adjacent hexes that share a side.<br/>     The pawn moves one diagonal hex forward and captures moving two adjacent hexes forward (these are the two hexes on either side of the one it could move to).<br/><br/><br/>There are a few other special rules to deal with castling, pawn promotion and whether a diagonal move can pass between two occupied hexes.<br/><br/>Note that despite the identical name and designer, this game is not identical to Tri-Chess from 1975.<br/><br/>",

If they wish to do so, that&rsquo;ll cost the team 1 minute, or otherwise said, one action card. This means that there's no dominant player who influences the others and that players need to be resourceful and rely on the judgment of the team members.<br/>If a team succeeds in escaping the room, the amount of remaining action cards state how many minutes were left to go. In that way, teams can challenge each other in having time records.<br/><br/>There are 4 possible actions:<br/><br/>     Solve a puzzle: place a corresponding trait card (i.e. 'perceptive', 'dexterous', 'talkative', 'tenacious' or 'logical') next to puzzle.<br/>     Move to another puzzle: choose and discard a trait/action card from your hand and move to any visible puzzle.<br/>     Replenish cards: Fill up your hand to 5 cards and then discard a card.<br/>     Ask a question: Discard the top card from the draw pile and ask a closed-ended question.<br/><br/><br/>With adapted rules for 2 players and solo mode!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To regain momentum on the Eastern flank the 1st Canadian Division was given the task of capturing the strategically important city of Ortona. Resistance was expected to be light. However torrential rain turned the countryside into a quagmire and the Allied artillery maps proved inaccurate. The Germans had dug in along the length of a gully outside Ortona and were reinforced by the elite 1st Parachute Division. The battle for the gully lasted 10 days with Germans fighting for every inch of ground and inflicting severe casualties before falling back to Ortona. Once again the Germans dug in.<br/><br/>Ortona is an operational game of the Allied drive on the city of Ortona in December 1943. The Allied player must attack two heavily fortified positions manned by excellent troops. The German player must conserve his small force, and time retreats and counterattacks with skill.&quot;<br/><br/>Turns are 1 day long, units are company sized, and each hex is 170 meters across.<br/><br/>",

At their disposal &ndash; all the fighting techniques of sailing ships: <br/>- 100-gun First Rate Ships, <br/>- fast and furious frigates, <br/>- firepower of galleons <br/>- maneuverability of brigs. <br/>Use also advantages of enemy ships boarding, fire-ships (i.e., ships-bombs) and naval mines! <br/>Please dive into the period of 3 centuries when sailing ships were masters of the seas and oceans!<br/><br/>Despite all of this diversity, the game can be quickly mastered by both experienced players and those who are only acquainted with the fascinating world of naval strategic board games. To do this, the game has several levels of difficulty that help to master the most complex techniques according to real conditions of naval battles of the epoch.<br/><br/>Various game scenarios are also available. They will allow to play either direct confrontation of naval armada or hunt for the gold fleet or assault pirate port!<br/><br/>Short description and advantages of the Game:<br/>1.    Romantic (not cruel) naval game about &lsquo;sail epoch&rsquo; for meeting and communication of all the family or other good company (starting from 6-8 years till 99, 8+ recommended).<br/>2.    Different levels of difficulty and different scenarios (impact on number of participants [2-6, 3-4 recommended), age, time [30-120 minutes, 80 is average for experienced players], goal of the game [resources collection, opponents defeat]).<br/>3.    Game mechanics closely related to the naval story, usage of wind direction and strength (determined with a weathercock) as one of the main drivers of uncertainty!<br/>4.    Very nice miniatures of warships (you will enjoy their fun and easy construction (no glue!) and, if you wish, recolor them according to your tastes or tastes of you children) PLUS usage of magnets for small elements of playing cards for your convenience.<br/>5.    The rules with separate not obligatory for reading chapter on history of the &lsquo;sail epoch&rsquo;, written in a romantic manner.<br/>6.    A map can be configured by means of overlay components according to the scenario and will of the players.<br/>7.    The game was tested in different countries by 6-10 years children [incl.girls], 15-40 year men and women, and board game geeks. And was admired by most of them, and purchased after testing by some of them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the cooperative party game Show Me Your Sound for 2-8 players, you listen to an online sound, then give a clue to other players as to whether that sound is more or less related to a certain picture, trying to help them remove the right cards from play.<br/><br/>In more detail, one player is the clue giver, while all others are the guessers. Randomly draw nine picture cards from the deck and place them face up. One of these cards is the &quot;trap&quot; picture, and only the clue giver knows which one.<br/><br/>On a turn, the clue giver plays a sound from their mobile phone or from the dedicated website, letting everyone else hear it, then states whether the sound is MORE or LESS related to the trap picture--possibly using a hint tile while doing so. The guessers consult with one another, then flip over a picture card. If the flipped picture was not the trap, the game continues with a new sound for the next turn. Clear all eight pictures and avoid the trap to win!<br/><br/>",

Battles between a few ships can be played in a couple of minutes or massive fleet battles can be played in about an hour.  <br/> This is an expansion to Imperial Crusade Armada that adds two more factions to the Imperial Crusade universe.  It is also a stand alone game that does not require Imperial Crusade Armada to play.  The Freetrade Coalition uses drone fighters and mines to destroy their enemies.

        "description": "1936: What If?, Historically, the French refrained from intervening to block Hitler's 1936 remilitarization of the Rhineland. Their cabinet made that decision based on a report from the Finance Ministry stating the cost of such a move would force them to take the franc off the gold standard and let it float. When the US and British governments, along with those two nations' banking industries, declined to extend the line of credit that would've been needed in order to head off such a potentially panic-inducing economic development, the French decided they couldn't afford to act. The alternative outcome examined here, then, is based on the idea the French either got the loan they needed, or perhaps simply decided the Nazi regime in Germany represented too large a threat to the future of their own republic for it to be allowed to go on unchecked.<br/><br/>More particularly, the scenario starts with the French having mobilized and marched across the Rhineland, stopping at the river. (Historically, the German forces involved in the remilitarization moved across the Rhine bridges with orders to turn about and withdraw immediately if the French advanced.) The further idea is that, within a few hours or days of the French advance, Hitler and his cronies are either dead, jailed or in hiding, due to a Putsch headed by elements within the German military high command. The Nazi Party breaks into factions and starts to war against itself, or simply falls apart into political incoherency. The concentration camps are soon opened by riots among the prisoners within, or perhaps are liberated by angry mobs from without. Either way, the upshot is that all the earlier-imprisoned leaders of Germany's left-wing parties are suddenly back on the political stage.<br/><br/>In Moscow, Stalin quickly comes to understand the opportunity -- likely to be brief -- being presented to him. He announces to the Supreme Soviet the era of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; has ended just as suddenly as it began. The time has instead come to forge the iron of international revolution while it is newly hot. &quot;On to Berlin and Socialist World Revolution!&quot; becomes the new slogan of the day. Of course, the Poles resist the effort of the Red Army to cut through their country on its way west.<br/><br/>Thus, within a month or so after their initial intervention, the French must reconcile themselves to the fact that, having come in for a sou they are now irretrievably in for a franc. As the German army begins to fall apart into warring camps (the &quot;Reds&quot; and the &quot;Nationalists&quot;), Paris sends forward its ponderous Rhineland Army Group this time headed for Berlin, there to create a dictat settlement with a new German government of French choosing.<br/><br/>The orders of battle for all participants in the game are accurate as to their historic composition in the early spring of 1936. The only Soviet corps left out are the one they then had in the Trans-Caucasus and the two in the Far East. Further, the Red Army purges hadn't yet begun, so three large mechanized corps are available, along with he world's first paratroop unit as well as its largest cavalry arm.<br/><br/>The first three panzer divisions (all with only Mark I Panzers) start in their countryside training areas, as does the experimental 4th Assault Gun Brigade, which was then dedicated solely to infantry support. The dozen German infantry corps, all of which had historically just completed a rushed year of training (literally and figuratively conducted at &quot;double-time&quot; over the normal two-year cycle), after Hitler's nullification of the army's size limit set by Versailles, are in their Wehrkreis mobilization centers.

You'll roll twelve-sided dice aiming to score sets or runs while not busting along the way. Highest score wins, but it's not all luck. You'll need to decide which numbers to pursue and when you've scored enough to keep ahead of the other players. You'll even be able to pick a lucky number that will get you a few extra points on other players' turns!<br/><br/>Designed by Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation, creator of Coyote &amp; Crow) with art from Wolf Tomoyaketu (Comanche and Apache) and development by Daryl Andrews, Naasii brings the mischievous spirt of both Coyote and Crow to life in this fast paced, high-spirited game for the whole family.<br/><br/>In addition, the dice in the game can serve as a full recommended playset of dice for the Coyote &amp; Crow roleplaying game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Play as a bunny furiously trying to decorate for the party and have the honor of hosting.<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s the catch - two players win this game! So helping out your neighbor can be very beneficial.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, players will draw 2 cards (3 on the first turn) and a trade token. Then, each player tidies a card by discarding it, or giving it to another player at the cost of a trade token. Each player then drafts a villager to help them decorate the for the party for that turn (villagers may help get you more cards, trade tokens, or other benefits). After each player has a villager visit them, it's time to play cards. Item cards are played in front of players and events have have a one time effect and are then discarded. Each player plays cards one at a time until no one has any cards left in their hand, which means you'll have to play your cards even if they aren't so great (like an ugly family heirloom!) After all cards have been played, two players may trade items in front of them if each of them spends a trade token to do so. Two types of items, moon and star decorations, are very important items because they are the victory condition, so be careful how you trade them.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, if a player has at least 5 moon or 5 star decorations, and has the most, the party starts and that player wins! If no player has 5, or if the players with the most are tied, the game continues another turn. However, when the party starts, two players win! If a player starts the party with stars, the player to their left also wins. And if a player wins with moons, the player to their right also wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Special units and chromy bits include: variable-strength Red and White Guard units; Armored Trains; the spring thaw that occurred midway through the war; peace negotiations, German intervention and Russian withdrawal (including the Future Guilt Clause!); General Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim; guerrillas; purges; and the Swedish Talent Agency.<br/><br/>Was available for free download at designer's personal webpage from end of 2009, but in October 2012 the designer concluded an agreement with Compass Games for them to publish this game in Paper Wars magazine.

South of Cairo, tens of thousands of workers erected the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty on the shores of the Nile. The pyramid construction for the Pharaohs Sahure],  Nefirirkare, and Niuserre begin. The building material is the white limestone from the quarries in what is today Ma&rsquo;asara. For pillars and doorways, rose granite from Aswan is sent by ship. The valley of the Pharaohs lies before the players &ndash; although no pyramids are built yet. But the seven planned building sites are already marked. The job is to transport the proper stones from wharves on the Nile and build the pyramids with them. And in the process push the competition out of the way.<br/><br/>",

The arsenal of clothing and weapons has been expanded into accessories that are suitable for wizards.<br/>3. The hero can throw battle dice which belong to specific magic and thus increasing the amount of dice which the hero can throw from 2 to 3-5.<br/><br/>        The main advantage of this expansion is the additional fighting options for the game. It adds colorfulness and interest to the game and increased the possibilities that the hero has. It includes extra new cards or magic such as: ILLUSION MIRROR which allows the hero to do more actions in his turn.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>We also added 4 magic dice to improve the hero's power.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The 2005 Season was one of the closest Points races in the history of the sport.  The top 3 drivers were separated by a mere 32 points, and the top 10 in points were separated by an amazing 442 points.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Anything that can happen in a real life drag racing event; can and will happen with the same frequency in Championship Drag Racing. Drivers will red-light, have tremendous reaction times, blow up their engines, and even crash with the same frequency as the year represented. And as with any replay game that is worth its salt there are allowances made within the confines of realistic frequency for ANYTHING to truly happen.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In general, your results will be very close to the on-the-track action of the season represented. However, keep in mind, that this game simulates hundreds of variables that can occur in any race. As with any sport, sometimes pure luck can be the deciding factor. That&rsquo;s no exception with Championship Drag Racing. On the whole, you&rsquo;ll experience very realistic results. But, within the confines of a single qualifying run or elimination race, anything can truly happen!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Championship Drag Racing: Funny Car Edition gives you every Funny Car Racer that made a qualifying attempt in 2005. You also get all 23 circuits rated by lane making the lane choice strategy just as important as real life. A full schedule, complete points standings, complete final ladders for each event, as well as a list of drivers that attempted to make every field are included.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game is all about the art of the wrestling promo. Two players assume the guise of professional wrestlers and go head-to-head for verbal supremacy while a third player dictates the action as a Producer. Everyone not competing in the current turn (which we call a Segment) is the Audience and gets to choose the victor of the round!<br/><br/>When a round starts, each Wrestler draws one name card from each of the two Name card decks. This is their wrestling persona. The Producer then draws a Segment card. This tells the Wrestlers where they are and what they are fighting about. The Producer then draws three Smack cards to play on either Wrestler during their promo. These cards dictate the action and can be played on either Wrestler during their promos.Each Wrestler has 45 seconds to cut their promo. After which, the Audience votes for the victor. If only three people are playing, the Producer decides.<br/><br/>",

The battle is fought at regimental level on an attractive mounted mapboard (55x41cm) at a scale of 250m per hex, and in 30-minute game turns. Losses are recorded on roster sheets, and the rules, in French, are of medium complexity (12 pages of system rules and an 8-page scenario booklet).<br/><br/>Game System:<br/>scale = 250 m/hex; <br/>time = 30 min/GT; <br/>strength = 600 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)<br/><br/>",

This is the time of year when the mayor awards medals to everyday folks for building and launching rockets using the abundant scrap lying around town.  Everyone loves Rocket Festival, but no one loves it more than those hungry little gremlins.  That's because there are tons of tasty rockets to munch!  As soon as you think you have a prize-winning rocket, a horde of ravenous gremlins just might sweep through and leave you with nothing!  So launch those rockets fast, because when the festival ends, whoever has the best medal collection wins!<br/><br/>No Good Gremlins is a family card game for two to five players.  Use your turn to start construction on new rockets or build up the ones you already have.  Completed rockets can be launched for points, but the bigger the rocket, the more points it will earn.  Be careful though!  The longer you wait to launch a rocket, the greater the chance it will be eaten by gremlins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blue Chip (also published as Dow Jones) is a very simplistic stock market game with an interesting twist (sliding pegboards).  There are 12 companies divided into Industrials (such as GM), Railroads (such as Union Pacific), and Utilities (such as AT&amp;T).  There are four of each type, and each type has a peg board of a different primary color.<br/><br/>On your turn you may take one and only one action.  An action is either buying or selling stock in one company.  (You don't have to sell all when you sell.)<br/><br/>When you buy stock in a company, you move its individual peg up one, two or three spaces depending on how many shares you buy.  Likewise when you sell: you move the stock price down one, two, or three spaces.<br/><br/>After each action, draw a card and see what happens.  Many of the cards refer to the stock just transacted: a split, or all players holding the stock collect a dividend, or are assessed a fine, or the company goes bankrupt, etc.  (Yes, it's as fierce as the dot.coms a few years ago: five of the twelve companies will be bankrupt by the game's end!)<br/><br/>Other cards are general and refer to the whole board.  Sometimes you roll dice which affect all industrials or railroads or utilities.  In that case, you slide the whole peg board for that particular color up or down as necessary.  There are dice in three colors with sides of +2, +4, +6, -2, -4, -6 on them.<br/><br/>",

While based on Chu Shogi (Middle Shogi), Tenjiku boasts a menagerie of  wonderfully powerful pieces which make it a far more dynamic and fast paced game than the other large variants. It really stands out from the other great Shogi variants and deserves its name of &quot;exotic&quot;. The exotic pieces include range jumpers which can jump over any number of pieces in order make a capture, and the Fire Demon which can &quot;burn&quot; all enemy pieces on the squares adjacent to where it lands!<br/><br/>Unlike in most other Shogi variants, tactics in Tenjiku are critical right from the first move of the game.  Despite the large board, the power of the pieces can mean that careless play is rewarded with a lost game in only a few moves.<br/><br/>",

The races must band together (under a banner of temporary truce) in order to stop this new threat.<br/><br/>Each turn, water minions will be summoned at the top of the board. Each minion is equipped with a specific weapon or spell (associated to the color of its base) and follows simple rules to move and attack the players. If players survive long enough, the ancient foe will present itself. With its death comes freedom for the land.<br/><br/>The expansion includes:<br/><br/>     Double sided enemy cards, allowing the minions to &quot;level up&quot; upon reaching the 11th round.<br/>     3 sets of Round cards (depending on the player count) with 3 possibilities of minions to spawn.<br/>     Power cards which are drawn each turn to effect the players or minions.<br/>     Deadly Apocalypse cards which can severely shift power in battle.<br/>     A giant dragon miniature measuring roughly 130mm in height.<br/>     A special set of 10 battle cards which allow you to use the dragon miniature during competitive games. <br/><br/><br/>Players will have to work together, conserve resources, and make terrible choices if they expect to live to see the ancient foe... much less kill it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Checkers make chess moves based on the roll of a special pair of dice. One die -- the Numbers Die -- is a standard D6. The other -- the Chess Die -- has the 6 chess symbols.<br/><br/>Roll a King, Knight or Pawn and pick ANY checker -- including your King Checker -- to move as King, Pawn or Knight. The Numbers Die does not matter on these rolls. Roll a Queen, Bishop or Rook and Numbers Die tells you how far the checker MUST move as a Queen, Bishop or Rook. So, if you roll a BISHOP 6, the checker you select must move diagonally for 6 spaces, unless it makes a capture, hits the edge of the board or is blocked by a fellow piece.<br/><br/>Again, any checker can be moved by any roll of the dice. So, the King Checker may move as a Knight or a Pawn or even a Queen 6 if desired. But no checker retains any chess rank after the completion of the turn. Every roll of the dice wipes the slate clean. For the length of the turn, the selected pieces behave as chess pieces. But pawns do not get 2 spaces on their first turn. They don't get promoted for reaching the opposite side of the board. But they do still capture diagonally. There is no check or checkmate or castling. Just capture the king.<br/><br/>Roll a King on your first turn, and you may flip your King Checker over. This hides your king -- STEALTH MODE -- and your opponent has to keep track of it to capture it and win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Irish tafl game variously spelled Fidhchell or fitchneal or fithcheall is the subject of much debate. The variance of spelling simply reflects the non-standardization of Old Irish [Gaelic] pronunciation and therefore spelling. When pronouncing these names, one should realize that a e or i which occurs in combination with another vowel is generally not pronounced separately but indicates only that the adjacent consonant is slender, which is to say palatalized. The h is used as a mark of lenition (a kind of consonant mutation that appears in many languages) or aspiration and hence th becomes roughly pronounced like the same letters in English &quot;think&quot; and the ch as in Scottish &quot;loch&quot;. Just to add to the confusion of names, the name in modern Irish Gaelic means Chess.<br/><br/>Some scholars say the name referred not to any tafl game but in fact to a form of Latrunculorum. Others say that the name was used for the diceless form of Tawl-Bwrdd, a Welsh game believed by some to have included dice.<br/><br/>If this name does refer to a separate game, it would be a game played on 9x9 not 7x7 grid. The basic rules are described  here but this site leaves out several details. Namely, if the king is by the center square so that an opposing piece cannot be placed on that side of the king, the the king can be captured by being surrounded on only three sides rather than four and similarly, if the king is beside a defender, the attacker can do same thing, i.e., simply place pieces on three sides in order to capture the king. The site does mention that only the king can either land on or pass through the center square but not that attackers move first. There is also a stub article <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitchneal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitchneal</a> on wikipedia which concurs on the initial placement of pieces. Notably the corners are occupied which emphasizes that the king need only reach an edge of the board, not necessarily a corner, for the player playing the defenders to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There were mixed feelings among the few people in the British government or military high command who heard of Churchill establishing the SOE -- Special Operations Executive HQ. While many approved of the idea of consolidating efforts that had been scattered among at least four small, unfunded departments, not everyone agreed with the whole idea.<br/><br/>Churchill's directive, &quot;Set Europe Ablaze,&quot; had grand sound to it, but many felt that the diversion of crack military personnel would be a waste -- Churchill's penchant for disastrous side-shows pre-dated Gallipoli -- while others wondered at the relative value and morality of arming civilians... something not recognized by the Geneva Convention. The fact that SOE took some of its ideas from the IRA's efforts in Ireland just emphasizes the shocking reminder that those we see as brave Resistance fighters might be viewed as &quot;terrorists&quot; through a different lens. Having seen how the Germans handled &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; in 1870 and 1914, none would suppose that these Germans would be less ruthless. But, faced with propaganda about the &quot;Thousand Year Reich,&quot; the Allies felt compelled to create a &quot;second front&quot; of some sort, long before Normandy.<br/><br/>Set Europe Ablaze captures the spirit and complex choices involved in Occupied Western Europe. Award-winning designer John Prados, who last gave us Beyond Waterloo, again focuses on action in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Prados brings us a card-driven game pitting the Occupying Axis forces against the combination of Allied intelligence efforts and brave local citizens, fighting the shadow war that made &quot;the Maquis&quot; a name to remember proudly.<br/><br/>Unlike many board strategy games, the focus is not on movement and combat by military units but on political-economic strategy. The Axis player wants to extract as much raw materials and finished goods as possible, to aid the war effort, and the Allied player seeks to avert this. Allied tactics include sabotage, interdiction, and intelligence gathering.<br/><br/>Axis responses include partisan sweeps, counterintelligence operations, and labor pool mobilization to repair damage. Turns abstractly represent about six months each, with rounds within each turn varying according to cards played. While there is no &quot;combat&quot; in a literal sense, there are competitions for resolving actions that have both players rolling dice.

As if it was a race, we combine colour sticks of different lengths which simulate the routes of the wall that was built at the beginning of the game. Who will be the first to conquer the climbing wall?<br/><br/>Roc&oacute;dromo has two game modes: Basic and Advanced. The differences between them are the difficulty and the levels of the wall that we set to climb: <br/><br/>     In Basic mode, the wall to be climbed will have three levels. <br/>     In Advanced mode, the wall can have more levels, a different shape or it can include some special settings. <br/><br/><br/>If it&rsquo;s the first time you play, we recommend the Basic mode; once you know the mechanics, we encourage you to follow the rules to set up the game in Advanced mode.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Vast armies fought with musket and bayonet on rain-soaked fields, half-blinded by acrid smoke and deafened by the ceaseless barrage of distant artillery. Men fell in great swathes, marching to death or glory to the rhythmic beat of drums.<br/><br/>Waterloo is a tabletop miniatures game for two or more players, set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars. With these rules you are the general, with an army of miniatures at your command, representing the forces of France, Britain, Prussia or their allies. This rulebook is focussed on the campaign and battle of Waterloo, the climax of the Napoleonic Wars, but the rules within allow you to recreate battles from across the entire period (1792-1815) and even beyond.<br/><br/>This 288 page hardback book contains all the information you need to get started, including full rules for fighting tabletop battles in the Napoleonic era, army lists and historical orders of battle, a brief history of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, a complete campaign to get you started, and a hobby section detailing how to collect, assemble and paint your army of miniatures. In addition, you will find an inspirational showcase of beautifully painted models and lavish illustrations.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The dread dragon Niddhoggr has devoured the roots of the World Ash, Yggdrasil, and the great tree has toppled onto its side, crashing the realms of mortal and supernatural together. With the gods dead and the fires of ruin consuming the world, your war clan of Viking warriors know what they must do to survive the destruction of the Nine Realms and restore order: they must become the new gods!<br/><br/>Ragnarok is a campaign-driven skirmish game in which players form a Viking war clan seeking to prove itself worthy of becoming the new pantheon. The use of a mechanic called Godspark means that battles are no longer determined by merely striking an opponent and dealing damage. Instead, warriors will be pushing, throwing, and crashing their opponents around the battlefield, making their very environment a weapon. As the war clans develop, they may gain glorious new powers that will bring them closer to godhood, or win the respect of the denizens of the realms, allowing them to bring dire wolves, dwarves, and even the dreaded giants into their war clans. With strategic gameplay and epic storytelling, players must write their own sagas and tell of how their war clans have, through blood and steel, clawed their way up from ruin to stand before the halls of Valhalla.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inspired by the historic city of Hampi in southern India, Hampi is a tile-laying game in which players build the landscape of Hampi from tiles that depict farms, roads, temples, ponds, markets and tiny villages. Each new tile placed creates an ever-expanding board on which players gather the support of the local people who know the secrets of the land. Players score points by completing the landscape. The player who makes the most strategic placements of tiles and gains the required support of the locals suiting the condition of the mystery Jewel wins the game.<br/><br/>The wise people of Hampi help in the searching for the Jewel. There are the miners, the priests, the elders, the merchants, the farmers, and the women. They express their support on the tile. Each tile scores support points differently, so, one needs to plan the placement of the tile carefully to gather the right support which determines the winner. You have a limited number of wooden markers that you use to complete your zone. Once placed, you don't get them back until the zone they're on is completed. You'll need to consider whether to go for small zones of quick support or work toward support points that really matter for you to win the Jewel.<br/><br/>Early in the game, one seeker gets the Sun Jewel. But true to its nature, the Sun Jewel passes among the players and finally reaches its true seeker who has the right support of locals. So it is not about maximizing points but being mindful of whose support will lead you towards winning. Hampi provides plenty of ways to use your wit and outsmart fellow seekers.<br/><br/>As the landscape grows, so does the opportunity for players to disrupt each other&rsquo;s plans. Everyone is adding to the same landscape and only seekers with the right support matching the condition of the Jewel will win. With its simple yet rich game mechanics and 96 tiles that can be configured into numerous combinations and possibilities.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Sketch illustrious animals that you discover, trade in the cities for local goods and visit the many temples to pay your respects.<br/><br/>Kathmandu is played in rounds in which each player uses 3 of their 5 dice to gain resources and move around the landscape boards. The end goal is visiting Kathmandu. Along the way players gain points through different means: Visiting temples, trading for goods in the cities, discovering each landscape, and drawing the many unique animals that call Nepal their home.<br/><br/>The players need to be efficient in their turns, to achieve as much as possible but to also not waste much time, since a storm is coming! Always be in front of the storm and don&rsquo;t lose sight of Kathmandu, since reaching it before the game ends yields many extra points!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Modern War #19, Sept-Oct 2015<br/><br/>It was the Chinese scholar-historian Wei Yuan, writing in the mid-19th century, who first formally identified his nation&rsquo;s apparently inescapable cycles of &ldquo;chaos and humiliation&rdquo; (quru), followed by &ldquo;rejuvenation&rdquo; (fuxiang), followed by &ldquo;wealth and power&rdquo; (fuqiang), and then back to quru to start again. More recently, Queens College futurist and sometimes-CIA analyst Dr. Bruce Bueno de Mosquita wrote concerning China that he sees no factors in the present-day environment working to end or deflect that same cycle. It was the shared conclusions of those two men, working over a century-and-a-half apart, which inspired me to design this wargame modeling the military parameters and possibilities inherent in the next phase of Chinese quru &ndash; civil war.<br/><br/>The likely starting points for such a conflict would either be the collapse of the Chinese real estate bubble &ndash; which is already broadly predicted to be inescapable and will constitute the largest financial collapse in world history &ndash; or the growing potable water crisis. (A third of the water consumed by the Chinese is undrinkable by US standards.) Beyond those factors, or in combination with them, there&rsquo;s also the gender imbalance, the fossil fuel air pollution crisis, the increasingly endemic corruption, the aging population structure, the expanding rural-urban economic gap, as well as the general collapse of ideology and the resultant moral lapse throughout the populace. One, some, or all of these factors may eventually lead to a crisis in China, as so often occurs in history, resulting in a civil war.<br/><br/>Each turn equals two months, probably starting sometime late in this decade or early in the next. The game is designed for two players, but it is adaptable for solitaire. Each hexagon on the 34x22&rdquo; map represents 80 miles from side to opposite side. Units of maneuver are brigades, divisions and group armies and air corps (in the form of 176 large-size NATO-style counters).<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters.<br/><br/>",

On or around April 12th, the North Vietnamese began a 7,000 round a day bombardment and launched attacks beginning on April 13th. Under attack by two NVA and one Vietcong division (a total of about 35,000), the ARVN 5th Division along with ARVN airborne and ranger units, which numbered about 7,500, held off the continued assault by infantry and tanks with the help of US airstrikes and B-52 arclight bombings.<br/><br/>The game uses area movement and interesting chrome such as NVA sappers, variable applications for artillery bombardment and of course airstrikes as the ARVN is hard pressed to duplicate the efforts of the 5th Infantry.<br/><br/>The NVA Player has just a few turns to take enough of the ARVN controlled areas and gain victory while the ARVN Player must maintain the ARVN Resistance Level or be forced to withdraw and lose the game.

To make the best use of the land, the smartest among them resorted to a cultivation method that incorporates the dimension of height and creates naturally grown floors: agroforestry.<br/>And so the forest gardeners were born. The players assume this role and are faced with the task of transforming their fallow land into a productive garden of culinary trees and shrubs.<br/>When selecting woody plants, they must take into account the light and space requirements of the plants, as well as the timing of their flowering and fruit maturity.<br/>A garden that provides leafy vegetables, colourful flowers or diverse fruits can also be beneficial in this regard.<br/>It is also important whether one or the other specimen needs a partner for fertilization, because otherwise the desired fruit harvest will not come...<br/>Whoever has put together the most valuable forest garden at the end wins.<br/><br/>Gaining the right cards, and placing or discarding them at the right time will lead to your horticultural success!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Andromeda Fight League (AFL) is a two player expandable game (with a four player variant)  that takes the best elements of battle card games, tactical board games and chess and adds the concept of team drafting and management similar to Fantasy Sports.<br/><br/>The random elements built into AFL expand its replay ability and the Draft, Setup and Battle phases add to the depth of the AFL experience. The rules are straightforward and easy to learn, but gameplay is deep.<br/><br/>There are three Phases to the game:<br/><br/>DRAFT PHASE: Assemble your Fight team through a draft, including (10)  Fighter Cards, (8) Magic Cards (which modify attacks, defenses and terrains) and (2) double sided Terrain Boards.<br/><br/>SETUP PHASE:  Strategically select and place a starting lineup of five Fighters face down on customized Terrain Board locations.<br/><br/>BATTLE PHASE: Tactically move and position your Fighters to destroy your opponent's Fighters by utilizing their Special Powers and Abilities and playing Magic cards...its kind of like chess meets a battle card game...<br/><br/>This is called a Skirmish. (Each Skirmish lasts 15-20 minutes.) When a player destroys all five of their opponent's Fighters, the destroying player has won the Skirmish. Best two out of three Skirmishes wins the match.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NEPPAGames: European Theater of Operations or ETO is a World War II Game of Grand Strategy Created by NEPPAGames.  Do not mix it up with another game by the same name from TSR/ SPI or the latter Decision Games.<br/><br/>NEPPAGames: ETO's historical simulation of the European Theater during World War II provides the framework where players are free to pursue their own strategic course of action. Each action has both short term and long term economic and military consequences. How players react to these consequences in relation to their own strategy will ultimately decide their fate.<br/><br/>Six different games (three Campaigns and three Scenarios) are available right out of the box, allowing players to select a game based upon their interests and available time. Game turns are seasonal, each representing a three month period. The map board, hard-mounted, depicts the WWII battlegrounds of Europe from France to Russia, and from Norway to North Africa to the Middle East.<br/><br/>While the interaction of all the different aspects of NEPPAGames: ETO is complex, the game is designed with simplicity and maximum playability in mind. On an Avalon Hill complexity rating, ETO's complexity would be about 7.<br/><br/>NEPPAGames: ETO&trade; uses a zone-based area movement system for ground and air units. The use of a zone or area-based mapboard significantly increases playability. Since each hex covers less ground than a zone or area, hexed base games require more playing pieces.  More playing pieces require more time to move them around, which is what the game wanted to avoid in the first place.  The mapboard measures approximately 2ft x 3ft (or 24&quot;x36&quot;).<br/><br/>Stacking limits are imposed. Terrain effects on combat are considered. Terrain and map features include mountains, swamps, beaches, fortresses,overwater crossings, ports (both beach and coastal), capital cities, special Russian defense and factory zones, oil, and more. Warfare Production Points or WPP's (Pronounced whips) are the currency of NEPPAGames: ETO. WPPs pay for everything from Declarations of War to Unit Construction.  Something that is similar in concept of Building Resources Points (BRPs) in Third Reich, The Rise and Fall of from Avalon Hill.<br/><br/>Represented in NEPPAGames: ETO are the forces of Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Russia, the United States, the Axis Minor Allies, and the armies of almost all neutral countries are depicted in the game. Each country's army is unique, with a fixed force pool of various unit types which are either available at start or available but unbuilt. Additional units may become available at historically appropriate times. Units include infantry, artillery, armor, air, naval, airborne, and U-boats. Each unit has different capabilities and differing attack and defense values. The units that will come with the game will be cardboard counters.<br/><br/>Ground combat features both normal combat and armored breakthrough and exploitation. Air units within range of a battle can lend their weight both on the attack and in defense. Air superiority is most often a requirement for success on the battlefield. Attacks can be made in the face of a heavy defense, but success is not guaranteed, and often, a heavy price must be paid.<br/><br/>Naval units are required for amphibious invasion, transport, shipping of troops and currency, shore bombardment, and strategic warfare. German U-boats can launch attacks against the steady stream of incoming convoys bound for Britain or attempt to sever the Murmansk convoy routes. As time passes, Allied ASW forces gain in both numbers and effectiveness.<br/><br/>NEPPAGames: ETO will have you engaged in a titanic clash between Allied and Axis forces on old and perhaps new battlefields of WWII. The outcome is up to you.<br/><br/>The design goal was to combine the best elements of several existing board games (including but not limited to Axis and Allies, Third Reich, Advanced Third Reich, General Patton, etc) into a very playable, very historical package. The game will have appeal to several categories of gamers:<br/><br/>1) Current Axis and Allies players looking for more historical and less ahistorical play (i.e. &quot;the stack&quot;),<br/>2) Former Avalon Hill gamers who enjoyed the historical accuracy and gameplay but wished for less complexity and more playability, and<br/>3) New gamers wanting to play a great new WWII strategy game.<br/><br/>Game components include:<br/>2ft x 3ft Beautifully Rendered Mounted Map Board<br/>20 page Game Manual<br/>8 page Campaign and Scenario Booklet that includes six different games you can play right out of the box<br/>442 Superbly Detailed Die-Cut Counters<br/>9 Counter Bags<br/>18 Force Pool Cards for use with the appropriate Campaign or Scenario<br/>1 Turn Sequence Sheet<br/>2 Dice<br/>Game Box<br/><br/>",

Arrive at your destination, verify the conditions and then set up a long range communication array to deliver your findings back to your superiors.  Easy, right?  Your visit to Earth is supposed to just be a quick investigation into how the planet is doing.<br/><br/>As you enter the atmosphere massively destructive storms make it hard to navigate.  Giant volcanoes, earthquakes, thermal gas explosions and flooding are rampant and tearing the Earth apart and what happens next? You and your crew are shot at by some natives claiming that you are violating their air space.  As your ship tears itself apart and plummets to the desert floor you know that your only chance of survival will be to pick up the pieces of your communications array that are now conveniently scattered across the driest most self-destructing climate you have ever seen.<br/><br/>All you have to do is find and set up the four parts of the communications array and signal the mother ship to come heal this planet and get you out of here.  You will have to navigate around the perilous hazards, avoid snipers who want you gone, secret agents who are stealing your technology, crazy mad scientists who want to perform experiments on you, and a completely different alien race who may even abduct you.  Work together efficiently as a team and you will avoid a Naturally Disastrous fate! If you become mutated, you turn against your former allies.<br/><br/>The game is played on a randomized map, with randomly placed tokens. Each turn, the active player must roll to activate a disaster, and then has 3 actions per turn (move, probe, etc.) Combat is resolved with dice. As each part of the communications array is found, it must be transported to one of the corners of the map.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Can you say the right things in Traitor Word and not be caught &mdash; or trick someone into accusing you of trying to do this?<br/><br/>Each player gets a handful of word cards, with each card featuring two words. Choose a start player, then flip a card from the deck to determine the starting word. The start player has a bit of time to say a single word that's related to the starting word, then the next player must say a word related to the first player's word, and so on.<br/><br/>Ideally a player can say a word on one of their cards. If they do &mdash; and no one has accused them of doing so by their next turn &mdash; the player reveals the card showing this word, then scores it for 1 point. If someone correctly accuses a player of saying a word held by that player, then the accuser scores that card as 1 point; if the accusation was wrong, then the accused scores 1 point.<br/><br/>The first player to collect 5 points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Operation R&ouml;sselsprung&quot; is an anti-partisan operation launched by German forces against the Yugoslav resistance between May 25 and June 3, 1944. This combined operation between the air and ground forces aims to seize - dead or alive - the chief of the resistance Josip Broz known as &quot;Tito&quot;, whose hiding place was located in the village of Drvar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The operational plan, which mobilizes 20,000 soldiers, is the responsibility of the XV Mountain Corps as well as the air forces. The first phase of the raid is led by airborne troops (paratroopers and gliders), the SS-fallschirmj&auml;ger battalion 500, a sort of disciplinary battalion. The second phase notably involved the 7th SS Prinz Eugen division, the Brandenburg regiment and its Chetnik subordinates, several reconnaissance Kampfgruppe as well as Croatian forces.<br/><br/>&quot;Operation R&ouml;sselsprung 1944&quot; is a solitaire tactical wargame appearing in the French Vae Victis magazine #151 (special game edition). The game is edited under ziplock and contains an A3-size map depicting Drvar (in Bosnia-Herzegovinia) and surroundings, 108 counters (25 counters representing the SS-fallschirmj&auml;ger bataillion 500 &ndash;- and 54 counters for the communist partisans). The rules are included in a separate 16 pages A5-sized booklet.<br/><br/>The systems uses the improved rules of the &quot;Bruneval 1942&quot; (VaeVictis #104) and &quot;Commando 4 in action: Dieppe 1942&quot; (VaeVictis #131) to simulate the airborne phase of the operation.<br/><br/>This game system developed for the &quot;Raids&quot; series is only playable in solo ; very easy to learn and fun to play ! The &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; automatically manages Yugoslav actions while the player is in charge of German actions.<br/><br/>The map is point-to-point, one to several hundred meters apart. A game turn is equivalent to 2 hours during the day and 5 hours at night, the scenario begins at 6:00 am on May 25, 1944 and ends at 12:00 am on May 26, that is 12 game turns. One counter represents a full strenght, 35 to 40 German paratroopers, a company of 20 to 100 Yugoslav partisans, an officer, two anti-aircraft machine guns, or two Italian tanks L3-35.<br/><br/>Would you be smart enough to capture Tito, maximize the prizes and minimize your losses ? It&rsquo;s up to you Captain !<br/><br/>",

Don't worry, you can stab them in the back and take all their points if you &quot;know people&quot; in the Industry.  After all, it's showbiz.<br/><br/>What The Film?! is a fun party game where you get to come up with crazy movie ideas based on the hand you're dealt. On a player's turn from their hand, a player lays down an actor, set, and plot card. With 300 cards the mashups are endless. Not only are you competing with your friends, you are also fighting the clock. After cards have been played, you have exactly 36 seconds to pitch your movie magic to the table.<br/><br/>Voting is done simultaneously, so you don't have the time to persuade anyone at the table, no one like beggars in the film industry! On the count of three, everyone hands their colored award token to who they thought had the best movie. The player with the most points keeps their cards as points, everyone else discards the cards they played.<br/><br/>We know not everyone is a director at heart, for that reason we added Industry Cards. There are two types of Play Immediately's and Play and Discard and contain good and bad things that can occur on your turn or someone else's. For instance, one card can have you stealing the rounds points or another, causing you to pay union dues, which cause you to lose cards.<br/><br/>After six rounds, the person with the most points is declared the winner, and just like that, you're ready to receive your director of the year award!<br/><br/>",

Starting on 22 June, huge Soviet offensives pierced the thinly held German front in many places. Soviet reserves were introduced into the breaches, aiming deep into the German rear area to trap the German Fourth and Ninth Armies. The drive of Third Belorussian Front, spearheaded by Fifth Guards Tank Army and Eleventh Guards Army, was aimed at crossings over the Berezina River, and the transportation center of Minsk. The German Fourth army deployed an agglomeration of shattered units plus the fresh 5th Panzer Division to hold open the escape route through Minsk long enough for the rest of the broken front-line units to escape.<br/><br/>A two-player (Soviet versus German) operational level game, with division as the primary maneuver unit, and also includes air units, untried units, blown bridge markers, and headquarters units. The colorful map features the area of the Third Belorussian Front during Operation Bagration, with each hex representing approximately 2 miles across, and includes such prominent locations as Berezina and the transportation center of Minsk.<br/><br/>The game utilizes the classic quad series rules&rsquo; mechanics and a retreat-emphasizing differential combat system to encourage encirclement tactics, so typical of Soviet armor strategy during World War II.<br/><br/>The rules entail a variety of standard and unique rules, such as Railroad Movement, &ldquo;What if&rdquo; Optional Reinforcements, Blowing Bridges, Untried Units, and the full range of historical unit formations, such as 5th Guards Tank Army, and the 505th Heavy Armor unit, etc.<br/><br/>Victory in the game is determined by the accumulation of VPs for control of important hexes, as well as evacuating friendly units.<br/><br/>Originally published in World at War magazine #22, Feb-Mar 2012.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2.1 miles / 3.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (228 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Minsk '44 rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4<br/><br/>",

Eventually this gives players enough information to deduce what is on their own cards and winning a point.<br/><br/>The cards that the players have to guess show different numbers. Variations of the game uses letters (What's That on My Head? &amp; Egghead) and numbers combined with colors (Code 777). This results in a different question set.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Code 777<br/>    What's That on My Head?<br/>    Egghead<br/>    Figure It<br/>    Amnesia<br/>    Guess What I Am!<br/>    Coyote<br/>    Pow Wow<br/>    Am I a Banana?<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Just like the real Flea Market, you need to buy low and sell high.  Is the porcelain vase really from the Ming Dynasty or from Joe Bob's Ceramic Creations?  Can you tell?  If you think a seller is a black-hearted pirate, you can challenge the scoundrel.  If you're right you get the goods for free!  But, if you wrongfully accuse an honest merchant, you will pay dearly.  What's your selling style?<br/><br/>The object of the game is to make money.  You do this by renting spaces and selling your Big Deal cards.  Once a player has sold all of his Big Deal cards, it's Closing Time --any Big Deal cards leftover in other players' hands are deducted from their score.<br/><br/>Big Deal cards are displayed for all to see during play, with the Fair Price hidden on the back.  There are duplicates of each item, with sometimes wildly different fair prices.  Sets of four Big Deal cards of the same colour can be cashed in when passing the Wholesaler (Start Space).  You bargain for Big Deal cards when you land on a seller's space.  Only two offers and two counter-offers are allowed, to limit bargaining time.  The agreed-upon price is multiplied by the number of cards of that colour the buyer already holds (but never more than four times).<br/><br/>If you think the seller was asking for more than the Fair Price, you may call a Challenge.  You are secretly shown the Fair Price to resolve the challenge.  If you were right, you get the card; otherwise, you must pay the Fair Price multiplied by *twice* the number of cards of that colour you already hold.<br/><br/>Of course, role-playing (haggling) is encouraged.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is very similar to Monopoly. Players go around the board and buy cities, with infantry, subs, generals etc (rather than money). Once they have a set of any 2 cities in a county they can then build forts, which enables the fort owner to receive military units from other players who land on that city.<br/><br/>The game appears to originate from New Zealand during the war years. It was promoted in local and National New Zealand papers from 1941 to about 1947. The rules were printed by the Evening Post which was a New Zealand Newspaper publisher company. The advertised examples suggest that small coloured moulded playing pieces were included, although other metal button type tokens have been recorded. These may have been an austerity measure during the war<br/><br/>",

Choose safer waters or attempt to navigate shorter but riskier waters, grown the size of your Humpback family, and play Bonus cards at the right time to ensure your survival or save them to earn additional points at game end.<br/><br/>But this game is more than about winning where you also learn about these majestic creatures. All Hazard and Bonus cards have carefully researched 'Whale Facts' that help you learn about other life forms and be sensitive to environments beyond what you readily know. There are also opportunities to help other players' whales, such as those that have been beached, which give you additional bonus cards and further the survival of the species as a whole. Whales further ahead in the game can choose to 'wait' and encourage the survival of more whales before returning to their home waters (which immediately ends the game)<br/><br/>The environmental group Green Peace has promoted this game and part of the profits go to helping save whales.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>The main objective is Whale Survival through the accumulation of points. You roll the die then navigate your whale pod (family) along the paths starting at the Home Waters heading south to warmer waters for the winter, into family waters to find a mate and give birth to young, then head back north again to the Home Waters attempting to end on the same specific location you started from.<br/><br/>Along the way you encounter Hazards (cards you draw) which hinder your progress and also obtain 'Bonus' cards which may help you move along faster or avoid Hazards later in the game.<br/><br/>The larger your family (up to 4 members) plus bonuses from unused cards and finishing first help determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Svenskt br&auml;dspel (Swedish Tables), more commonly known as just Br&auml;dspel or Br&auml;de, is a Backgammon relative native to Sweden. It's the last surviving member of the 17th-century Verkehren/Revertier family of games, that mainly differ from Backgammon in forbidding the closing of the first eleven points - making it possible to win by &quot;locking out&quot; one's opponent, called jan in the Swedish terminology. Br&auml;dspel adds to Verkehren a third objective - arranging one's pieces in one of four preset patterns - and rules for hitting a closed point under special circumstances.<br/><br/>A Br&auml;dspel table was brought aboard the warship Vasa on her ill-fated maiden voyage in 1628. When the ship was salvaged in 1961, that board rekindled interest in the game, helping it survive where other Verkehren games died out. Today, the game is governed by the Swedish Tables Association of the Vasa Museum, which holds annual championships right next to old Vasa.<br/><br/>RULES: <br/>(Slight variants may exist. These rules are based on the (lengthier, complete) rules used in the Swedish Championships.)<br/><br/>The game consists of a board (similar to a backgammon board), 15 checkers (game pieces) each of two colours for a total of 30 pieces, and 2 regular dice.<br/>A full match is usually played as best out of a predetermined odd number of games. Winning a single game gives 1-4 points as described below.<br/><br/>The fields are called tongues and are numbered from 1-24 for each player, starting with 1 at the top right tongue as seen from the player, and going counterclockwise around the board with 24 in the lower right corner. Tongue number 1 is called  a player&rsquo;s &rdquo;home&rdquo; and number 12 is referred to as &quot;huk&quot;. Fields 1-6 constitute the first quarter, 7-12 the second, 13-18 the third, and 19-24 the fourth.<br/><br/>Preparations: Each player choses one color and places all his/her 15 checkers on his/her home tongue in the upper, right corner. The starting order for the first game is determined by rolling one die each after which the player with the lowest result goes first. In consecutive games the loser of the previous game starts.<br/><br/>Gameplay: <br/>The players take turns throwing the dice and (if possible) moving their pieces. The game pieces are moved counter-clockwise according to the dice. If a player is able to make a move it is obligatory to do so. If only one die can be used it is mandatory to do so. The player can choose to move the same piece for both dice or move a different piece for each die. If moving the same piece for both dice it is forbidden to add up the the numbers and land immediately on the field corresponding to the sum. The piece has to be moved first according to either of the dice and then according to the other. If both dice show the same number they are counted double, e.g. if two fives are thrown the player moves 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 steps and the player can distribute these four moves freely on 1-4 game pieces.<br/><br/>There must never be game pieces of opposite colors on the same tongue. A player may have no more than one game piece each on tongues nr 2-11, and once the home has been reduced to one game piece the same applies to that field. On tongues 12-24 the number of the player's own game pieces is unlimited. If a game piece lands on a tongue with a single opponent piece, that piece is &rdquo;beaten,&rdquo; meaning that it is temporarily taken out and has to re-enter the game by landing on a tongue in the first quarter that is either vacant or has a single piece of the opponent&rsquo;s colour. (See exception under blasting &ndash; b below) No other moves are allowed for a player with one or more beaten pieces until they are all back in play.<br/><br/>Two or more pieces of the same colour on a tongue are referred to as bands. A game piece may normally not land on one of the opponent's bands. (Exception explained under &rdquo;blasting&rdquo; a-b below.)<br/><br/>Blasting: <br/>Though it is not normally allowed to land on a field containing a band of the opposite colour there are two exceptions. Beating more than one piece at once like this is called blasting. <br/>a) If a player has bands on six or more consequtive fields the opponent may beat all the pieces on one of these fields by landing on it.<br/>b) If the opponent has bands in a player&rsquo;s first quarter and the player&rsquo;s only opportunity to get all his beaten pieces back into play is by landing on one or more of the opponent&rsquo;s bands he is allowed to do so, blasting the opponent&rsquo;s pieces.<br/>If a player has exited all pieces but one from the game it is no longer allowed to blast with that last piece.<br/><br/>Winning conditions:<br/>There are several different winning conditions (five if counted as below) plus the possibility for a player to surrender a game. A surrendered game gives one point to the winner. A player can surrender at any time as long as he has not yet formed any band in his third or fourth quarter. After doing so surrendering is no longer allowed, even if the band(s) has/have since been broken.<br/><br/>1. &quot;Home play&quot; Exiting the board with all 15 checkers. (1 point for winner)<br/>Once all of a player&rsquo;s pieces are in the fourth quarter he can start taking them out of the game by throwing at least the number required to reach an imaginary 25th tongue. (If a piece is beaten at this stage it has to re-enter and move all the way into the fourth quarter before any furher pieces of that colour can exit.)<br/><br/>2 &rdquo;Beautiful game&rdquo; (1 point for  winner)<br/>There are four different winning conditions referred to as &quot;beautiful game&quot; which are all obtained by arranging the game pieces in specific patterns in the fourth quarter. They all give one point to the winner. Both dice must be counted, i.e. a player can not win this way by only moving for one of the two numbers thrown. However, if a player can win through &rdquo;beautiful game&rdquo; by casting one die only he may chose to do so. In case of failiure he may only cast one die on each of his two following turns. The four variants of beautiful game are:<br/>2a. Three pieces each on tongues 20-24 <br/>2b. Five pieces each on tongues 22-24<br/>2c. Three pieces on tongue 22, five pieces on tonge 23, and seven pieces on tongue 24<br/>2d. All fifteen pieces on tongue 24.<br/><br/>3. &quot;Monk&quot; (2 points for winner)<br/>3a) &rdquo;Homeplay with monk&quot; Winning by homeplay while the opponent has at least one beaten checker not yet back into gameplay.<br/>3b) &quot;Beautiful game with monk&quot; Winning by beautiful game while the opponent has at least one beaten checker not yet back into gameplay.<br/><br/>4. &quot;Jan&quot; (2 points for winner)<br/>If a player beats more of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces than can possibly re-enter the game (due to a lack of available tongues in the first quarter) that player wins the game. This is called &rdquo;making the opponent Jan&rdquo;<br/><br/>5. &quot;Blast-Jan&quot; (4 points for winner) <br/>Making the opponent Jan by blasting a band.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On the Ides of March (15 March) 44BC, ruler of Rome, Gaius Julius Caesar was assassinated in the Senate house by a small group of disaffected senators.  After a brief period of confusion, three factions began to emerge to fill the vacuum left by Caesar&rsquo;s death.  The Tyrannicides led by Marcus Junius Brutus and assisted by Gaius Cassius Longinus left Rome and took provinces in the East to govern, there to bide their time, gather strength, and hopefully complete the restoration of the Republic.  A second faction under Marcus Antonius, Senior Consul and Caesar&rsquo;s chief lieutenant, and supported by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, initially attempted to come to an accommodation with the Tyrannicides with the intent securing a power-base in Cisalpine Gaul and subsequently to seize control in Rome.  The third faction under Gaius Octavius, Caesar&rsquo;s nephew and adopted son, was intent upon claiming his inheritance and assuming the position that was Caesar&rsquo;s in the state.  Initially making common cause with Decimus Brutus (a tyrannicide) and the Senate, he attempted to check Antony&rsquo;s ambitions whilst pursuing a dual agenda of avenging Caesar and assuming primacy in the state.  By 30BC, Octavius (later Augustus Caesar) had eliminated all competition and become the undisputed Leader of Rome.<br/><br/>Ides of March is a three-player simulation representing the end of the Roman Republic, with each faction vying for control of the state through both political and military means.  As the Leader of one of the three major factions, you control the Leaders, forces, and political resources of your faction in a struggle to win personal control of the machinery of state and thus become &ldquo;Princeps&rdquo;, or undeclared Emperor of the Roman World.  Rules to play the game with two-players are found at the end of this rulebook.<br/><br/>A shorter Rubicon Module simulates the earlier struggle between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great who was backed by the Senate that ultimately led to Caesar&rsquo;s victory and assumption of the position of Dictator-for-Life.  Each separate game shares a common set of Strategy Cards, with cards specific to period of civil war added the common deck for the play of that module.  Players share a force pool of land  and special Units, as well as factional naval forces and major Leaders/generals.<br/><br/>",

It can be played on graph paper (by marking off a 27 x 27 area) using coloured pencils to indicate the placement of watchtowers, or miradors, each of which will occupy a 2 x 2 square.<br/><br/>Several factors combine to make this a very fast and unusual game: line-of-sight connection (which is a feature of Sid Sackson's game Network); graded placement (incorporating the use of micro squares); and equivalent goals - that is, either player can win by connecting the board edges either from north to south or from east to west.<br/><br/>A significant feature of the game is that players can use their opponent's placements to facilitate their own connections. So, in trying to win the race to connect, you must check that the next move you plan to make doesn't inadvertently improve your opponent's chances more than yours.<br/><br/>",

In order to pass, they have to find the correct island and then grab a pirate ship as quickly as possible. If you correctly add up the numbers on the die and are the first to find the matching number of treasure holes on the islands, you win the most precious jewels and become master pirate.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>All players try to pass the pirate exam simultaneously. The hunt for jewels starts as soon as the two dice have been thrown. The sum of the numbers on the dice tells the players which island they have to find. Each island (cardboard square) consists of two halves. Each island half has 0 to 6 &quot;treasure holes&quot; on the underside which can be felt by touch. All players try to find and put together an island with the same number of holes as the sum of the numbers on the dice. They are not allowed to look at the holes - they have to count by touch only. As soon as a player thinks they have the correct island, they grab a pirate ship. There is always one ship fewer than there are players, and the ships are in different colors. The first player who thinks they have an island with the correct number of holes grabs the red ship, the second one the blue ship, and the third one the green ship. When the last ship has been claimed, the round ends and the number of holes on the islands are counted. If the number is correct, the player earns a jewel in the color of the ship. If not, the ship is passed on to the next player. The jewels are worth a different number of points (red = worth most), and the player with the most precious jewels (= player with the most points) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game features a resources management aspect in the building of the base and its staff as an effective task force, plus a detailed handling of casualties according to their medial triage level, having to be treated in different medical modules.<br/><br/>The game prototype is currently playable as print-and-play or using a Vassal Game Engine Module (see Files section). The Vassal Module supports an Observer player for a tutorial session or online shared play.<br/><br/>During the game, the player will recruit new personnel for the base, also improving its installations. The game engine will challenge the player with events and the need to fulfill missions to score points. The scarcity of resources will test your judgement as the base commander, having to prioritize, push-your-luck and even to make hard sacrifices.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>Nha Trang, Vietnam. November 1967. Orders come from Long Binh HQ.<br/>You are assigned to 498th Medical Company, 55th Medical Group, 44th Medical Brigade, as Battalion Surgeon with the rank of Captain (O-3). Your duty is to set up and manage a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), to be deployed as part of the Counteroffensive Phase III Campaign.<br/>In order to do so, you will be recruiting Personnel (specialist operatives and general personnel), and commissioning new buildings and vehicles (installations). With those assets, you will face threats to your facilities (events) and be called upon to participate in military operations (missions).<br/>Sometimes you will be ordered to take wounded people into treatment in your Base. Wounded people will also flow your way as a result of enemy opposition during missions, and sometimes in the case of security, health or supplies threats to your Base. Having a poorly managed Base, forfeiting missions, and suffering casualties will reduce your promotion merits. Stay sharp, or your men will suffer and you&rsquo;ll never make it to Major (O-4).<br/>Taking part on the campaign operations (your combat readiness), along with an overall good security, healthiness and supplies situation in your Base will grant you promotion merits (victory points).<br/>Godspeed, Captain!<br/><br/>",

With Frog Menu, you should eat as many insects as possible, and to do this you must jump from insect to insect, eating non-stop. Be sure not to get isolated while doing so!<br/><br/>To start, shuffle 2-4 starting tiles with a bunch of insect tiles, then lay out the tiles face up in a 6x6, 7x7, or 8x8 square (based on the number of players). Each player starts with two random power tiles (fish, egg, tongue), with each type of tile having a different special action. Each player starts on the board wherever their starting tile turns up.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player jumps their frog based on the possible move shown on the tile where that frog is currently located; the player can rotate the tile to use the move in one of four directions, claiming this tile and removing it from the board. As tiles are removed, the board gets holes in it, and players can jump their frogs over these holes. Once a frog is isolated, that player takes no further turns. Once every frog is isolated, players claim the tile under their frog, then tally their points.<br/><br/>Players score based on the types and quantities of insects they've collected, with the game including seven types of insects. A player's starting tile counts as an insect of their choice. The scores for the different groupings of insects are:<br/><br/><br/>    5 insects of the same species, 50.<br/>    5 different insects, 40.<br/>    4 insects of the same species, 30.<br/>    3 insects of the same species + 2 insects of the same species, 20.<br/>    3 insects of the same species, 10.<br/>    2 insects of the same species, 5.<br/><br/><br/>Whoever has the most points wins, with ties being broken by whoever has the combination of insects with the most value.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Original Doshboardgolf is a golf strategy board game. A mathematical model coupled with a professional course design creates an experience that rivals the real thing. The winning player will be the one whom manages risk v.s. reward and the conditions in the most favorable way.<br/><br/>Doshboardgolf uses a hex-based board to simulate a 9 hole golf course. Players have the choice of 12 directions to shoot from each hex and can even plan for fade and slice!<br/>This course has everything a real course would; straight fairways; water and trees as hazards; elevation changes and even simulated wind conditions.<br/><br/>The game is different every time &ndash; there are 60 different wind settings and 32 different clubs. Four 12-sided dice establish the strategic variability expected with ace runs, doinked putts, roll-aways, out-of-bounds, elevation change, lost clubs, and difficult lies. You will feel the joy of an excellent shot and the defeat of a poor decision. Doshboardgolf is all the strategy of golf on your table.<br/><br/>In Doshboardgolf, each player selects a set of 8 club cards that have differing distance and hook numbers. Players will have all the clubs they need, from the maximum distance driver and mid-range approach club down to the putter which will be used when holing out.<br/>The distance will be determined by rolling a blue die, and the hook determined by the red die only after consulting the players chosen club card.<br/><br/>Using advanced rules, a black die is introduced to simulate roll-aways when you land next to a downhill hex. Also making the game more realistic is elevation changes and penalties when having to shoot out of a hex containing trees.<br/><br/>During a turn, each player in order will:<br/>1. Plan a shot direction using one orange pawn as a directional marker on the board. Players have the ability to execute planned fade and slice to overcome obstructions on the board such as trees, water hazards and elevation changes<br/>2. Select a club card from your 8 available options and place it face up for all players to see<br/>3. Execute the shot by rolling the blue and red dice. After consulting the chosen club card, the blue die determines the distanced travelled, and the red die determines the hook which will happen after the distance is calculated<br/>4. Place your player token in the new lie or if you have successfully holed out, mark your score on the included scorecard<br/>Play continues in this way with the player furthest from the hole always going next.<br/>As in real golf, the player with the lowest score at the end of the 9 hole round is the winner!<br/><br/>",

It consists of 40 pieces of tiles: 12 pieces of 3 pieces of tiles for sushi, 12 pieces of wasabi tiles, 12 pieces of rice tiles and 4 pieces of special tiles, green tea tiles.<br/>To play the game, first place all the 40 tiles face down on the table. The starting player chooses one tile and turns it over. If he/she succeeds in turning the rice-wasabi-material tile in order, one sushi is completed and the three tiles are taken by the player. If one of them fails, the turn is immediately passed on to the next player. If you turn over a green tea tile, take that tile and turn over another tile again. The obtained green tea tile can be used to inspect another tile at any time during the player's turn. When one player completes the number of sushi set according to the number of people, one round ends, and the person who earned the specified goal round score first wins the game.<br/>Sushi holic comes in two editions: 'Maguro edition' and 'Tamago edition' which have different material tiles but same rule. The two editions can be combined to play with up to 8 players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They can make teams skip turns or lose points.<br/><br/>If a troll card or trap card is played, the answering team has the opportunity to play defense with a trench card. Trench cards can negate troll and trap cards, award extra points or give extra turns.<br/><br/>Once all troll, trap, or trench cards have been played for the round.

The video is used as a timer, adding a sense of urgency to the game, and the Gatekeeper's appearances on the screen are both thrilling and chilling (and loud!).<br/><br/>One of the standout features of the 30th Anniversary Edition is the addition of new event cards, which bring a fresh level of unpredictability to the game. These cards can affect players in various ways, such as forcing them to swap places, lose turns, or face challenges that can alter the course of the game. The combination of the video, cards, and unique character abilities creates a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience that keeps players on their toes and eager for more.<br/><br/>Theme and Atmosphere:<br/>Atmosfear is all about creating a spooky and immersive atmosphere, and the 30th Anniversary Edition does not disappoint. The game's theme of horror and suspense is brought to life through the video, which features the iconic Gatekeeper, who taunts and challenges players throughout the game. The game board is richly illustrated with dark and eerie artwork that adds to the overall ambiance. The combination of the components, gameplay, and theme work together seamlessly to create an immersive and thrilling experience that will keep players on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Fun Factor:<br/>Atmosfear 30th Anniversary Edition is an absolute blast to play.

The cards come in five different colours, and you draw as many cards as the number of colours in the sequence number you have played. In other words, you can reduce the number of cards in your hand by making a sequence of cards of the same colour as far as possible. When the hand is reduced to one card, it is revealed, the number is scored and the game continues by drawing the same number of cards as the number. The player who scores a total of 11 points wins the game.<br/><br/>数字の描かれたカードで連番を作り、手札を減らしていくゲームです。カードは5種類の色があり、出した連番の中に含まれる色の数だけカードを引きます。つまり、なるべく同じ色で連番を作った方がカードをたくさん減らすことができます。手札が１枚になったら公開し、その数字が得点になり、その数字と同じ枚数のカードを引いてゲームを続けます。合計で１１点獲得したプレイヤーの勝利です。<br/>--description by publisher<br/><br/>",

All the games are designed to share components and be able to be played quickly by 2 players in a compact space. Deck includes all cards to play each game, cards which are the game boards, and rules. Designed for print and play fans of Aether Captains (printable on standard 8.5&quot; x 11' paper), also available as an Artscow order.<br/><br/>The Games:<br/><br/>Intrigue (27 cards including rules): a 2 player game of area control across the city states of Arkady, using 24 eurocube style markers per player. Players take on the role of Grand Council members, vying for influence in the city states. Players use groups of matching cards to place 1-3 markers in each city state during their turns, trying for a majority, or can use cards to remove an opponent's influence. The game is played in 2 rounds, scoring each round, and takes 10-20 minutes.<br/><br/>Zeppelin Derby (12 cards including rules): a simple 2 player race game in the skies over Thoia. Players roll 5d6 and use cards as roll modifiers to race across a 3 card course. Cards include Dirty Tricks and Engineering bonuses. 5-10 minutes.<br/><br/>Celinian Trader (14 cards including rules): a pick up and deliver style game of trade on the Celinian Sea for 1 or 2 players. Needed are 14 eurocube style markers per player and 5d6. Players fill their holds with different types of goods - copper, glass, coal and linen - as they sail from port to port buying and selling goods, amassing their fortunes. The game is played over 4 rounds whose length is determined by a series of events both players are subject to. Different values for buying and selling are set by a Trade Market that changes prices from round to round. Competing for victory points, players may also purchase upgrades to their ships. This game is also suitable for solitaire play and takes 20-30 minutes.<br/><br/>All three games are designed  to be quickly learned, easy to play and fun.<br/><br/>",

(There is also an animated TV show and so forth.)<br/><br/>from the Bohnanza entry:<br/>As card games go, this one is quite revolutionary. Perhaps its oddest feature is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them. The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them. To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.<br/><br/>The game is not identical to Bohnanza. The deck does not include an equivalent to the Garden Beans (6s), and from two to five of each type of horse are foals. When a foal is turned up as one of the cards to be traded, if there is only one player breeding that kind of horse they get it automatically. If a paddock has a foal on top when it is scored, it is worth nothing.<br/><br/>Other differences include the lack of the ability to buy a third paddock (field), the lack of a rule prohibiting scoring a paddock with a single horse under some circumstances, and the inclusion of rules for two players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "13 cards can be arranged in over 6 Billion possible combinations ... 6,227,020,800 to be exact.<br/><br/>A version of this game is said to have been found at a UFO site in Texas back in the 1980s. With its mysterious origin, we are still unclear as to the strange effects of achieving the &quot;13&quot; result. Some say it sharpens intuition, improves focus, and intelligence.<br/><br/>But who knows....<br/><br/>&quot;13&quot; is primarily a solo card game, but more can play as well, using just 13 cards. It can be played by yourself just trying to get the highest score, break the code per say, or you could play it with two or more people as a betting game to see who can come up with the highest score over a three round match.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/><br/>The cards are mixed and dealt out randomly and face up in this configuration:<br/><br/>X X X X X <br/>    X X X<br/>X X X X X <br/><br/>Cards will have either an arrow/arrows showing in which direction they may affect another card. These arrows only affect cards immediately next to them, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The arrow on the activated card must be pointing to a card immediately adjacent to it, otherwise there is no effect. Some cards will have simple written instructions. When a card refers to &ldquo;first position&rdquo; or &ldquo;last position&rdquo; they are referring to the original dealt out top left position &ldquo;1&rdquo; or the original dealt out bottom right position &ldquo;13&rdquo; exactly. If the cards in those specific positions have been removed (the space is empty) then nothing happens.<br/><br/>So once the cards are shuffled and dealt out, you will &ldquo;activate&rdquo; one card and remove both the card activated and the card it affects from the tableau.<br/><br/>The objective is to remain with one card in the end, otherwise it&rsquo;s an automatic loss. Remaining with one card in the end is usually possible, so avoiding mistakes is crucial. You&rsquo;re shooting to remain with the highest value card in the end, preferably the &ldquo;13&rdquo;.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.DualBrainGames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.DualBrainGames.com</a><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/131\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.thegamecrafter.com/games/131</a><br/><br/>",

Cards collected in two suits are worth positive points, and the other two suits are negative points.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a small hand, then the top card of the deck is flipped face up. The players compete in a must-follow trick-taking game, with the winner of each trick taking the face-up card from the deck in their hand, and the other player doing the same with a face-down card from the top of the deck. After the round, the players' points are converted to a type of meta points by moving a pawn on a red carpet.<br/><br/>In subsequent rounds, the player who is behind in meta points begins the round by setting cards aside from their hand to create a small private deck; they will draw from this deck once the main draw pile is exhausted.<br/><br/>",

Based on the strength of those movement cards, each player places bets on his horse. Bets can be to Win, Place or Show on a player's own horse. The players have the option to place a Daily Double bet, which in this game is betting that the player's own horse will win the first two races. The players, one at a time, play a movement card.  Most of the movement cards specify a number of spaces to move the player's horse pawn. Some of the movement cards state, &quot;Ask Jockey&quot;.  &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; means that the player turns over the top card of the &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; deck.  The Ask Jockey cards are marked on their backs with a blue dot if the card has advantages for the player, red dot for disadvantages for the player, question marks ?? for instructions that may or may not affect the player that plays it.  Holding an Ask Jockey card until that deck has a card with a blue dot on top is ideal. After the players have put into play and discarded all of the cards dealt, the entire movement deck is shuffled and four more cards are dealt to each player. &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; cards can require a player to give a number of his movement cards to another player or just discard them without using them.  Therefore, players may use more or less than four movement cards per hand dealt. After the second race is complete, the Program cards are shuffled and dealt for each race.  The race track board is proportionally marked for all of the common lengths of horse races.  A game is complete after an agreed upon number of races and the instructions recommend 8 races.

        "description": "Leningrad &rsquo;41: What If Manstein had Attacked? (L&rsquo;41), designed by Joseph Miranda, is a two-player alternative history wargame of intermediate complexity that simulates a hypothetical German attempt to seize the city of Leningrad in late July through August 1941. The assumption is Manstein, rather than pausing for two weeks as he did historically, simply charged ahead into the city immediately upon crossing the Luga River.<br/><br/>To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander&rsquo;s-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length. The German player is generally on the offensive, trying to clear the Soviet defending force from the city prior to the end of the game. L&rsquo;41 uses the system originally created for our earlier published Manila&rsquo;45 game.<br/><br/>Each game turn equals three days. Each hexagon on the map represents 0.3 miles (0.5 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for the Germans are mainly battalions, while those for the Soviets range from battalions to regiments and brigades. Thus each unit may represent anywhere from 100 to 5,000 men and their equipment.<br/><br/>Special rules cover such things as: fog of war, replacements, reinforcements, defensive fire, indirect fire, combat air support, command control, leaders, fanaticism, gunboats, the cruiser Aurora, the Komsomol, the metro, and optional German airborne assault. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. German Player Turn<br/>A. German Replacement &amp; Reinforcement Phase<br/>B. German Air Strike Phase<br/>C. German Movement &amp; Soviet Defensive Phase<br/>D. German Offensive Fire Phase<br/><br/>II. Soviet Player Turn<br/>A. Soviet Reinforcement Phase (skip on Game Turn 1)<br/>B.

        "description": "Final Lap: the card game is a standalone card game that challenges up to 6 players (can be played solo) to lead their team to victory in the racing championship. A challenging card game with a great balance of skill and luck, and lots of interesting card combinations. Average play time is around 10 minutes per race, with the players deciding how many races they want to play in order to decide the championship winner, allowing Final Lap to be played as a time filler, or an entire evening of entertainment.<br/><br/>Players each manage a racing team of two cars and compete in a number of races through to see who can accumulate the most championship points and become the champion. In each race players need to correctly manage their hand of cards, reaping the biggest rewards possible from their good cards, and reducing the negative imapct suffered from their bad ones, to ensure the cars in their team score as many championship points as possible.<br/><br/>Championship points are only scored in a race by the cars that finish in the top 6 positions.  At the beginning of each race the cars are laid out in the reverse finishing order from the previous race.  Each player is dealt a hand of cards and during a race a player must use all of the cards in their hand.   As a car finishing in last place will ensure that it begins qualifying in the following race in first position, it is therefore beneficial for cars to finish as low as possible in a race if they do not finish in the top 6 positions, which results some very interesting and tactical game play.<br/><br/>After the cars are laid out in order at the beginning of a race, and players have received their hand of cards, qualifying will take place.  Certain cards can be used during qualifying or during a race.  If a player uses a card during qualifying to improve the qualifying order of one or both of their cars, they will discard the card and draw a random card to replace it.  Since players must use all of the cards in their hand during a race, they will need to evaluate whether they can afford to use such cards during qualifying as it may result it them drawing a very bad card as a replacement.<br/><br/>During a race players can have their cars take pit stops.  When a car takes it pit stop it allows the players to discard a card from their hand without having to play it, which acts as an outlet to remove bad cards from a players hand.  Pit stops need to be managed effectively as they can only be taken by cars that require them, and any cards not discarded through pit stops must be played even if they have severely negative consequences for your cars.<br/><br/>Excellent hand management is crucial in this game.  After you receive your hand of cards you need to formulate a race plan, working out how to get the most out of the cards you&rsquo;ve been dealt.  Adaptability is also key, being able to change a race plan or abandon it altogether as interactions with other players may not go as expected.<br/><br/>Final Lap is a hugely flavourful card game, with a whole range of racing events covered by cards, including qualifying, pit stops, crashes, oil spills, spin outs, tyre punctures, yellow flags, team orders, defensive lines, slip streaming, car setup, racing strategies, repairs and mechanical problems with engines and gear boxes.<br/><br/>",

If you end up on a Bouncy Crater you can make haste and bounce all the way to the cockpit, soaring past the other spaceters. Ending up on a Yoghurt Pool gives you special powers, but the Space Yoghurt is wacky strong and must be handled with care. It might win you the game, sending other players' spaceters home or be so bitter that you must go home and rest for a while. Easy rules, fast play and big wins!

The smaller the die, the weaker, but quicker. There are roughly two types of places to place, either material-gathering places, which number varies depending on number of players, and the University, which allows players to play upgrade cards from their hand. The four-sided worker allows the player to take the selected action 3 times, the 6-sided twice, and the 8-sided just once. However, the player can strain the worker in order to perform certain extra actions, and this will lower the endurance of the worker &ndash; a worker with just 1 endurance cannot be placed. Being pushed out by another player's larger worker will also lower a worker's endurance.<br/><br/>The game is played in 3 &quot;years&quot;, each year being divided into the above first phase of gathering of materials and playing cards, and the second phase of completing the tasks of the year. Once a player starts completing tasks, they cannot go back to gather materials, but first to the mill gets more points.<br/><br/>The special upgrade cards that players play when placing a worker on the University customizes the player's various abilities, giving their workers or the laboratory improved or new functions.<br/><br/>Ater 3 years, the collected VP for completing tasks is tallied with bonus points for various things, and most VP wins.<br/><br/>",

Combine cards, launch devastating attacks, and defend against a barrage of creativity!<br/><br/>In Ultimate Battle, the goal is to utterly destroy your opponent. In this creativity-fueled game it's one-hit destruction, so players must plan attacks and defenses carefully.<br/><br/>The gameplay centers around two to four players each drawing from a deck of Ultimate Battle Cards. These fully illustrated cards contain everything from powerful weapons and creatures (like sharks and poison) to more mundane objects (like a brick). Using their imaginations, players must illustrate attacks against their opponents on a large sheet of paper rolled out between both players. The attacking player uses any combination of cards in their hand to launch their attack. The defending player must then use cards from their hand to defend.<br/><br/>If players disagree on whether an attack or defense is valid a Disagreement Card is drawn, which quickly resolves any qualms. This gets the group back to playing as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>If a player can't defend an attack, or loses a disagreement when trying to defend, he or she is destroyed! Whether a world-class artist or a stick-figure impresario, everyone can draw out wild attacks in Ultimate Battle. Think quick, sketch even quicker, and may the best battler win!<br/><br/>",

With the theme of communication, memory, and comprehension, this work is a board game using the educational toy Mini Geofix.<br/>Let's tell other players the theme made of triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons in 1 minute. that? But it's hard because I don't know how to tell you! It is difficult for the listener to understand what he is saying. However, if you don't make it according to the theme, you won't get points unless you make it according to the theme, so let's turn your head! It's a recommended game that can be enjoyed by children and adults who can't help but laugh because they don't understand what they're telling or listening to.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "They Died With Their Boots On, Volume 1: Custer's Last Stand is part of the first volume of &quot;They Died With Their Boots On&quot;, which uses an interactive game turn in which both players command an overall force made up of several sub-commands. During each turn, players alternate picking &quot;command markers,&quot; which designate the sub-command within their force they may then use to conduct operations. The player then moves units of that sub-command and, at the completion of its movement, conducts attacks with units of that same sub-command. Play then passes to the other player, who similarly picks a marker and moves and fights. That procedure continues until all command markers have been picked. Additionally, certain events cause players to pick &quot;heroism markers&quot; at random, which may generate anything from mad, impetuous charges to abject surrenders.<br/><br/>The rules are divided into the standard rules, which are common to all games in the system, and the scenario rules, which provide deployment and reinforcement instructions, as well as victory conditions, for each specific battle game.<br/><br/>In this game, each turn represents from three days to three weeks, depending on the level of intensity of campaigning, and each hexagon on the map represents 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) across. US Army units are battalions (actually task-organized sub-divisions of regiments). Indian 'units' each represent groups of warriors, with about 80-120 individual per strength point.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;re in shock, hungry and disoriented. The shore is littered with debris from the crash, but what to do first? Food? Fire? Explore the island? Help!<br/><br/>Expert survivors will accrue more points during their time on Isla Tetra through cunning inventory expansion, clever health management, and successful completion of a set number of survival tasks. The game is played solo, or as a survival competition against the clock between 2 players - yes, it didn&rsquo;t take long for an argument to break out over scarce supplies and resources, and now it&rsquo;s a race to simply stay alive.<br/><br/>You might think you can get by, simply walking the sun-kissed sands hunting for red snapper, allowing the hypnotic effect of the crashing waves to ease your injuries, but as you soak up the sun events back home are taking a turn for the worse: As the months tick by, the search for your downed plane is eventually called off, your job is readvertised, and your car has been sold to keep up with the bills. After two years of waiting, your family holds a memorial service and your partner is now returning to a social life as a single person.<br/><br/>Players must strike a balance between plundering the island&rsquo;s resources for points while ensuring they&rsquo;re not last off the island to face the worst news once home (and the most penalty points). Each day you&rsquo;ll beachcomb the golden sands to see what has been gifted to you from the azure, salty brine. Use this flotsam and jetsam, such as rusty cans and broken umbrellas, represented by chunky, 3D DriftCube shapes, to build a shelter, craft essential tools and a fishing spear; then explore deep into the island's heart. Link the same DriftCubes together on your playmat to &lsquo;build&rsquo; action grids, such as exploring, fishing, and foraging for food. In these instances DriftCube shapes represent time as opposed to raw materials.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a race for survival. It&rsquo;s a race to get home...<br/><br/>&quot;It's Ubongo meets Lost&quot; - review comment<br/><br/>",

        "description": "About the Game<br/><br/>M.I.N.D is a tactical strategy board game set in a sci-fi setting in which players are in control of a colony and have to manage and expand it while facing different crisis and invaders. M.I.N.D can be played solo or in two players, but also with up to four players with the help of an extra copy. The goal is to build your colony and complete the set of five achievements required by the game before the last turn ends. Players can play as a purely cooperative game where everyone wins or loses together. Or they can play competitively, in which case they can sabotage or attack their opponents.<br/><br/>Players build new sectors, train new citizens and manage their command to do as many actions as they can to maximize production of credits, influence, equipment or overpower while also progressing. The game requires lots of planning since there are many things that can intervene and ruin your plan if not paying attention. Players interact and can either help or sabotage each other. Units can be sent to start fires, break structures, close doors, start an epidemic or even unpower structures. To resolve all these players need to assign command to their units and use them to repair, build or interact with different things from the colony. Players can improve their units by equipping them with items or assigning them influence thus enabling them access to the faction's unique super power.<br/><br/>If you like strategy games, games that can be played solo, games that have confrontation or simply that let you cooperate with a friend while facing a great challenge then M.I.N.D may be the perfect choice for you.<br/><br/>",

In return, you should do everything you can to get rid of the coronas. Whoever got rid of all of their coronas first wins the game.<br/><br/>There are 60 action cards in the game. One action card is played per round. If you demonstrate strategic skill, you win the card game at the end.<br/><br/>As soon as a player falls below 0 nerve cards, he is eliminated. So you always have to have at least one of these nerve cards in hand.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, you have the option of using your action cards to have an effect on all players or only on a certain player - you can assign them even more coronas or take away nerves. After you have played an action card, you draw a new one. You continue to play until the stack of cards is used up or a player has already got rid of all his coronas or all others have lost their nerve.<br/><br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/><br/>Bei CORONA NERVT! starten alle MitspielerInnen mit 5 Nerv-, 5 Corona- und 5 Spielkarten. Die Aufgabe ist es nun Coronas loszuwerden, dabei die Nerven beisammenzuhalten und dies mit den eigenen Spielkarten geschickt zu steuern.<br/><br/>Wenn mich beispielsweise meine MitspielerInnen besuchen, setzen wir uns alle einem bewussten Risiko aus und erhalten daher alle eine Coronakarte und m&uuml;ssen eine Nervkarte abgeben. Nur nicht die Nerven verlieren und Corona wieder loswerden. Das ist die Strategie!<br/><br/>Es ist doch echt frustrierend, da hat schon wieder jemand beim Niesen nicht den Ellenbogen davorgehalten und im Bus tr&auml;gt der Sitznachbar die Maske unter der Nase! Zack wieder drei Coronas gesammelt und drei Nerven verloren. Aber da! Ein Lichtblick! Impfstofflieferung in Sicht und endlich Sommer!<br/><br/>Ein schnelles Spiel in dem man nicht nur die eigenen Karten im Blick behalten muss, sondern auch die der MitspielerInnen. Kann ich mit der n&auml;chsten Karte eine/n MitspielerIn rausschmei&szlig;en? Wer ist fast geheilt und braucht dringend mal wieder eine Schippe Corona? Werde deine Coronas los, behalte die Nerven und bring die anderen zur Verzweiflung.<br/><br/>Dieses spannende Spiel, vers&uuml;&szlig; die Zeit nicht nur im Lockdown und l&auml;sst uns &uuml;ber Corona und seine Auswirkungen auch mal schmunzeln!<br/><br/>Wer gute Nerven beweist und alle eigenen Coronas besiegt, gewinnt das Spiel. Wir sagen DANKE Jana!!<br/><br/>",

It was reprinted in February 2012 and given away to people who spent $75 or more at the publisher's online store. Starting on March 6th, 2012 it briefly became available for purchase at the online store. So what had once been a highly collectible item due to its rarity, was now just another piece of Munchkin merchandise.<br/><br/>The handbag is a standard handbag, colored pink and with a picture of the Sparkly Good Fairy from the Munchkin Fairy Dust booster pack. As a handbag, it's nothing exceptional, but it also comes with a special rule for use in any Munchkin card game that includes the Munchkin Fairy Dust expansion. The rule allows you to take a card from the Fairy Dust deck's discard pile, once per game (see the corresponding board game version for details).<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reckless rabbit rascals penetrate the Carrot Yard (&quot;R&eacute;p&aacute;skert&quot;). The rabbits are trying to loot as many carrots as they can, competing with each other. But their hardest challenge is to avoid the two hostile mastiffs chasing them among the bushes.<br/><br/>Players control their own rabbit, and they also move the dogs. Their objective is to collect as many carrots as possible and to increase their scores by making the dogs bite the opponents&rsquo; rabbits. Everyone has a set of movement cards to direct the steps of the animals.  One half of each card instructs the rabbit, the other half instructs the dog; players have to choose carefully which part to use and when.<br/><br/>Rabbits also leave droppings on the board, which obstruct movement: if a rabbit crosses or lands on a space where there is a dropping, it loses a carrot. Dogs don&rsquo;t care about the droppings.<br/><br/>R&eacute;p&aacute;skert (Carrot Yard) is an easy-to-learn, fast-paced family game.  A party lasts 2-5 rounds, depending on the number of players. However, the game may end sooner if the upper limit of bites is reached or no more carrots are left on the board. The player with the highest scores wins the game.<br/><br/>Despite the theme, the the game requires some strategic thinking. Therefore it is recommended from 7 years of age, but it is real fun for the older generations as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Csib&eacute;sz nyulak vakmerő csoportja hatol be az &oacute;ri&aacute;s s&aacute;rgar&eacute;p&aacute;ir&oacute;l h&iacute;res R&eacute;p&aacute;skertbe, hogy akci&oacute;juk r&eacute;v&eacute;n min&eacute;l t&ouml;bb zs&aacute;km&aacute;nyt szerezzenek.

Each player chooses a robot which has a 12 card deck associated with it. Each deck is identical except for one card unique to that robot. Players set up by placing four cards in their Extra Stack (cards in the Extra Stack will be added to a players hand later in the round), one card in the Collection (a shared pool of hidden cards that players don't need to get rid of), and the rest of the cards in their hand.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of players taking turns playing cards into a pile in the center of the play area, or, if they cannot play a card, picking up the pile and adding the cards into their hand. Each card has an ability that might do things like blow up the pile, skip player's turns, or tamper with cards in the collection.<br/><br/>Players who get rid of all of their cards earn victory credits. The first robot to receive six is crowned the winner!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

With 18 hexagonal tiles, game modes that bring more challenging experiences and a 5-10 minute duration which makes this game the perfect filler game.<br/><br/>On their turn, players will try to finish the quantum link (which means revealing all of the tiles) but in order to do so, they need to follow the quantic sequence.<br/><br/>Each time a player flips up a hex-tile, it will have to connect with the previously revealed tile either on it&acute;s core colour(black or white) or the background color. If they match, then the next tile revealed must match the opposite(if it matched the core, now it has to match the background color and vice versa). If, at any time, the conditions are not met, the player must flip back down all the tiles and the next player starts their turn.<br/><br/>The first player to finish the quantum link will be the winner of Q-Memory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

In the auction, rather than bidding money, players bid with how many squares of their existing city they will cover with the tile they acquire.  However, at the end of the game, some of the scoring will be based upon who has the most squares showing of certain types. Some squares require special resources to operate, and other squares cannot be covered.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Everlasting Glory (英烈千秋) is the first independent box wargame made by Formosa Force Games. It is a two-player operational wargame simulates the War of Resistance (抗戰）1937-45. One player commands the Imperial Japanese Army (大日本帝國陸軍）and the other player commands the National Revolutionary Army（國民革命軍).<br/><br/>Leonard To who is the designer of War of the Suns（天無二日） tried to use another way to show the history of War of Resistance in this new game.<br/>The Everlasting Glory (英烈千秋) uses the same research and basic game concepts as War of the Suns: The War of Resistance 1937-1945, while focusing less on the non-military aspects.<br/><br/>There are also 4 fundamental changes in the game design:<br/>1. The use of area movement instead of hexes. Each area is a province. It speeds up the game. By organizing combats in an area, similar dynamic like that of hex and counters has been maintained.<br/>2. The use of generic units instead of unit IDs. This is a tough choice. It reduces the effort of the player to locate individual units, and makes it more flexible in losses and breakdowns calculations. Historical unit IDs are provided in the OB for those who are interested in unit history.<br/>3. A 2-players instead of a 3-players game. The game is now played between the KMT and Japan players. Game mechanism controls CCP. British and part of the Japanese forces in India and Burma are removed cause they do not represent the core of the Chinese struggle. It again speeds up the game, and removes a player who has little to do sometimes.<br/>4. The use of cards. This is not a card-driven game but strategy, command and logistics cards are included to handle those aspects.<br/><br/>There are 6 scenarios included: <br/><br/>    1 Campaign scenario<br/>    2 Operational scenarios: Space for Time, Operation Ichigo <br/>    3 Introductory scenarios: Fist of Fury, Retreat to Victory, Plan B<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    540 5/8&quot; counters<br/>    60 Cards in English, 60 Cards in Chinese<br/>    1 A1 map in Chinese &amp; English (mounted)<br/>    1 Chinese &amp; English Rule book<br/>    1 Chinese &amp; English Scenario book<br/><br/><br/>",

The Guard player doesn't take a Blessing Card for the monk. One turn one, the guard selects one of the 3 garden gate paths to have the monk follow: either to the Pharmacy (122), the Kitchen (147) or the Scriptorium (101).  The monk moves during the Guards Move phase of the game, and only walks (3 or 4 spaces).<br/><br/>Since the monk is deaf, he does not get a sound check, nor do novices need to check to see if he hears them during the novice's noise check.  He does, however see just like the other guard characters do (180-degree vision, up to 6 spots away).  If a novice enters his field of vision, they must reveal themselves. The monk cannot capture a novice, and novices may move through his position without penalty.  If a novice shares the same space as the monk the novice is detected. When the monk arrives at his path destination, choose another token that includes his current location and continue his movements.<br/><br/>You will only use 4 of the 6 tokens during the game - 2 of the 3 garden gate tokens (entering and leaving the convent) and 2 of the 3 tokens that allow travel between the Pharmacy, Kitchen, and Scriptorium.<br/><br/>The guard player may use any combination of tokens, but you may visit a convent location only once (with the exception of the Garden Gate).  Once the monk returns to the Garden Gate, remove him from the game.<br/><br/>",

Your strategy, consequently, must be based solely on the last known position of the enemy. A given enemy unit's strength is not known until contact has been established. Both, the government and the guerrillas, have different but equally difficult tasks ahead of them. Every aspect of the game has been carefully developed for easy playability but maintains a high level of combat simulation. Many original and innovative design concepts make this rare combination possible. When it is over, perhaps we, as players, will have reached a greater insight into the most prevalent type of warfare in the world today.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game board is a square frame holding nicely-made square pieces. To begin, the frame is populated with one level of pieces on all spaces, except for the center on which five pieces are stacked and stabilized with a rod through the middle. Each player gets a large ball that fits on the hole in the pieces, and the starting position is determined based on the number of players (2-4).<br/><br/>With the goal being to get your ball onto the center tower, you progress by moving your ball anywhere on the same level you start and then placing another piece on an adjacent space (adding a level to that space.) You can move down the structure for free as long as you don't skip a level, but once you move onto a higher level in your turn it is over. Using this mechanism, players try to craft a path to the top of the tower that can't be used by others or use their ball as a blocking point to keep someone off the level you need.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher's website:<br/><br/>Announcing Ultra-Quick Tennis!<br/><br/>My goal in designing this game was to develop a mechanism to quickly play through a tennis tournament. With other tennis games, either the game took too long to realistically complete a full tournament, or the game was too simplistic and produced far too many upsets. As with all of my games, I wanted a quick playing design that closely mirrored reality in the tennis world. The end result is a game that I&acute;m very proud of.<br/><br/>Ultra-Quick Tennis has been thoroughly tested for statistical accuracy. I am extremely confident that the formulas employed in the game accurately represent each player. To make it a game, I&acute;ve added some elements of chance, as well as some rare play results. Overall, I think you&acute;ll find the winners to be on par with what you would reasonably expect.<br/><br/>Ultra Quick Tennis includes over 300 professional men from the 2005 ATP Tour and well over 400 professional women from the 2005 WTA Tour. Also included are the full schedules for both Tours.<br/><br/>Players are accurately rated for each playing surface found on the respective Tours. You'll experience the sheer dominance of Roger Federer on grass. Clay court specialists like Guillermo Coria will shine at Roland Garros, but prove to be mortal on the hard courts at the US Open. Every player will realistically perform as they did in actual tennis competition during the 2005 campaign.<br/><br/>All of the unusual events that can happen in tennis like injuries, retirements, loss of concentration, arguing line calls all happen in Ultra Quick Tennis as well. The ball is in your court, purchase Ultra Quick Tennis today!<br/><br/>",

Some cars have cheaper upkeep costs than others, but they will reduce the income received when they land on the profitable bank spaces on the board.  But money can also be earned through petrol/service stations, obtained by correctly answering the question cards as well as by chance cards and the possession of special star chips.<br/><br/>These star chips are the main objective of the game, because the first player having 70000 francs in money plus 7 star chips, wins the game.<br/><br/>Traffic comes with some unusual components. First, there is a plastic bar with 23 holes. <br/>Rolling a glass marble in that bar replaces the roll of a die. Second, a 1.5 x 3 inch model car serves as challenge trophy. The winner gets this car until a next game is played. And third, 2x36 (traffic) question cards for children and adults are somewhat like a game in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mine-Shaft Gap simulates a battle for resources on, above, and under the surface of a lifeless but treacherous planetoid. Players must seek out valuable metals and fuel materials and mine them, using the materials to feed their home planets, and inch closer to victory, while at the same time allocating resources to maintain or strengthen their armed forces and fortifications. Drill tanks tunnel beneath the surface of the planet while drilling stations pound away from above. Drilling stations are faster and more efficient, but are vulnerable to attack from above and even capture by enemy troops. But tunnels can cave in&hellip; And market forces are unpredictable. The resource making your planet rich today might be better off greasing the treads of your tanks tomorrow!<br/><br/>The game takes place on two maps &ndash; one representing ground level and above, the other representing underground terrain. The rules differ slightly depending upon the map on which action occurs. At the beginning of the game, the subterranean map is unmarked: it is solid. As the game progresses, units will drill beneath the surface of the planet, creating tunnels through which they and other units can explore the sub-surface, mining for riches and engaging each other in combat. Each map parallels the other, in that each hex on one map represents the same coordinates, just at a radically different elevation (above or below ground) on the other map. Maps are labeled in columns and rows so that it is possible to find corresponding hexes quickly. Hex B4 on the surface map is considered to be directly above hex B4 on the subterranean map, and so on. It is recommended that a new subterranean map be printed out for each game, so that it can be marked throughout the game and discarded at the end.<br/><br/>Counters represent mobile units such as drill tanks, transport vehicles, hovertanks, missile launchers, atmo-craft, and squads of infantry with jump-jet powered armour; structures such as command posts and drilling stations; extracted resources; and rubble. They are printed with varying information. Resource counters show the type and quantity of resource with a letter and number. Units are printed with a movement type, attack strength, range, defense strength, and movement points.<br/><br/>Elements include tactical level sf combat using a terrain-and-elevation-based combat system, satellite searches for ore deposits, in-game allocation of resources to build units and outposts, resource extraction and re-use, resource allocation towards victory, varying resource value depending on market fluctuations, airstrikes, cave-ins, and underground combat.<br/><br/>",

It is very similar to his later Alien Space Battle Manual and Star Fleet Battle Manual, with good reason. Zocchi did not have a license to publish a Star Trek game when this came out, and in addition to the title the game uses images of ships from the series (the Enterprise is on the cover), not to mention the names and pictures of the characters. Paramount objected and Zocchi was forced to recall the game from stores. A few copies had already been sold, which are the ones occasionally seen today.<br/><br/>The following year, Zocchi released Alien Space Battle Manual, with all the Star Trek references replaced with ones he invented. When he obtained a license from Franz Josef Designs (allowing him to use ship designs and names such as &quot;Klingon&quot;), he published Star Fleet Battle Manual.<br/><br/>In this game, optional rules are given for the special abilities of some of the Enterprise crew - these of course do not appear in the later games.<br/><br/>",

As the leader of your race, can you build support on the planets, wisely assign your Councilors, and seize power as the Emperor of Solaria?<br/><br/>Solaria features area control, limited actions and resource management. The main action plays out on the five planets that rotate around the sun in different orbits.  The ever changing rotation of the planets can dramatically affect game play, as planet position determines travel costs (the greater the distance between planets, the more fuel it takes to get there), scoring (elections only take place when a planet is in the same sector as the capital), and deep space exploration.<br/><br/>By winning elections, players appoint their Councilors to positions in the Solarian government that can best serve their own race (different assignments reap game-altering benefits). Competition for privileges is fierce. Choosing where to increase your power base on the planets, where to move your Planetary Base, whether to mine asteroids or the best method to explore deep space (and other options) is a careful balance of managing money, Councilors, and your rivals&rsquo; best-laid plans.<br/><br/>After six rounds, all planets hold their final elections. The player who exerts the most influence in the government becomes the Emperor of Solaria and wins the game!<br/><br/>Actual playing time is 90-150 minutes.<br/><br/>Note: The game was selected for participation in the 2008 Hippodice international game design competition. It is currently unpublished.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dutch cycling game from the 1960's, released by the small publisher &quot;Es-Es-Es&quot; from Voorburg. The game could be ordered by readers of the dutch television magazines Avrobode and Televizier (years 1960-1965), and was advertised in several newspapers between 1960 and 1966. However, the game wasn't sold in most of the regular toyshops. According to an advertisement in the local newspaper (1960) the game could be acquired at the bigger sport shops in greater towns.<br/><br/>The board measures 50x32cm.<br/><br/>What makes this game unique for it's time was that it was a racing game that didn't use any die but action cards for movement. There are several &eacute;tappes (including an individual and group time trial etappe and a mountain etappe).<br/><br/>For the  overall leader there is yellow jersey, for the leader of the point standings there was a green jersey. Both jerseys were flat plastic circular &quot;counters&quot;(0.3mm thickness), which could be put over the head.<br/><br/>There are at least 4 different box-versions of this game, coloured white (the Televizier version), black and red (both square and rectangular). The mapboard has 3 versions (one with the Televizier log, one with tables and one with no tables and logo).<br/><br/>",

Pieces are captured by jumping over them, checkers style, and placing them in a special zone on the board.  These pieces can be rescued by an uncaptured piece moving through the capture zone.  The piece which freed the others is then crowned.  This offers the piece more options for movement while at the same time making it vulnerable to elimination, as the crowned pieces are removed from the board if an opponent jumps them.<br/><br/>The first player to capture or eliminate all opposing pieces wins.<br/><br/>",

This navy game can be played by two or more players (up to 12) from 8 years upwards.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT:<br/>This navy game exclude blind luck, so badly needed with cards or dices, because the man-o-war and air attacckers move in precisely the same way as the teal task forces when sent out on a mission, having similar displacement, speed, navy apparel and airplane armaments.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Board represent an hypothetic Pacific Sea divided into meridians and parallels, where only the intersections are marked. There are two home lands drown on the map, and other six movable.<br/>There are two factions in the game (Copper and Nickel) that face each others in order to accomplish certain objectives (capture the flag, dominate the sea, defende transport, tow home a captured enemy frigate ecc... scenarios are countless).<br/>Each faction has always an ADMIRAL, that decide where put the mines (secretly marked on &quot;Admiral's plot&quot;), his fome flag (the tower) and which unit group will move. An Admiral could have COMMANDERS, in charge to manage the units (there could be a commander that handle all units, two commanders that share the army or specific commanders that handle a group or a type of units... depends on the number of players).<br/><br/>Teams take turn by moving one unit at time (like in chess) orizontally or diagonally without change direction (planes can) and in case check if they hit a target.<br/>Each unit has three characteristics, Life points (1 to 3), speed (2 to 5 crosses) and range (0 to 3 crosses). Submarines can shoot only forward or backwards, and can immerse themselves (admiral removes the miniature from the board and tracks down their path on his plot), Airplanes can be very fast on high altitudes but can bomb (and be shot) only on low altitudes, they also can patrol 12 crosses away from a land or a carrier otherwise are considered lost.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Very unusual board game from the late 70's. Each player is a mountaineer and must climb the Mont Blanc to win the game. However, the player has to earn experience points to get the skills to climb mountains, so there are 22 mountains to conquer. Each climb is harder than the previous one. You don'&Auml;t have to climb them all, you can choose which to climb. You might, for example, climb Number One (Aiguille du Belv&eacute;d&egrave;re) successfully, and then try Number Four (Aiguille Purtscheller), and so on.<br/><br/>Each climb is illustrated for the player, with various points along the route when equipment (Alea) cards might be asked for, the more equipment you have, the better for you. And the Descent (Rappel) might cause you problems.<br/><br/>The board is very attractive, showing the mountain ranges. There is a curious box in the right hand corner, on which you place two tiny green frogs. These frogs move during the game and when they reach certain points on the track, the weather changes (Meteo). This weather change can be catastrophic. You might not to be able to get down a mountain you have climbed and a helicopter might be needed to get you off the mountain.<br/><br/>The game looks great with all the Climbs being illustrated in some detail. The playing pieces look good but are completely impractible. They are plastic Picks, in 6 colours. And they fall over far too easily. And not to forget, the two green frogs.<br/><br/>In my game there was a card asking me to buy their next game, which would be about skiing. However, I got no reply and I never did see a second game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A pencil-and-paper dice-based solo roleplaying adventure.  Players build a character and face hordes of enemies in an attempt to level up or die.  The ultimate grindfest.<br/><br/>Players create a character of one of four classes (Warrior, Mage, Ninja, or Druid) each with a special ability, and adventure off into the wilderness to slay countless foes.  In between each fight, the character rolls on the monster tables to determine which foe they will face in the upcoming round.  If they so choose, they may spy by paying one gold before the roll--spying allows the player to decide whether or not to face the enemy.  After the enemy is determined, the game continues to battle.  During battle, initiative is determined each round by a roll of the dice modified by attributes, and whichever side has the initiative is allowed to make an action--either attacking, running, or using magic if possible.  Combat is worked out in this way until one side or the other is reduced to 0 health, at which point if the character survives they gather gold and experience, and lives to fight another monster.  If the character is dead, the game is over.<br/><br/>The goal of this game is simply to kill time in a fun way.  Surviving characters can last for several sessions, and allow for a feeling of progression.<br/><br/>",

The widespread use of the flintlock musket had transformed the way armies trained and fought.<br/>This period was a golden age for the crowned heads of Europe. They commanded professional troops, gloriously outfitted in splendid uniforms, and fought each other over land, wealth and the succession of their thrones. Some even led their armies on the field of battle. Yet by the end of the century, the real power of kings was gone or greatly eroded parliaments would decide the foreing policy of nations, democracy had taken hold in the New World and the divine right of kings was being questioned everywhere.<br/>These were the last wars fought to protect the succession rights of royalty. These wars were the Last Arguments of Kings.<br/>This supplement for the Black Powder game overviews the main conflicts and armies of this period, and includes army lists and special rules to enable you to refight these wars using the Black Powder rules, as well as scenarios for the most dramatic battles of the time. Featured conflicts include:<br/>The War of the Spanish Succession (The Battle of Blenheim 1704)<br/>The Great Northen War (The Battle of Holowczyn 1708)<br/>The Austro-Turkish Wars (The Battle of Petrovardin 1716)<br/>The War of the Austrian Succession (The Battle of Fontenoy 1745)<br/>The Wars of the English Succession (The '45 Rebellion)<br/>The Seven Years' War (The Battle of Hundorf 1762)<br/>War in the Colonies (The French Indian Wars &amp; The War in India)<br/>Raids and Invasions (Amphibious Warfare in the 18th Century)<br/><br/>",

The Israelis were to take and hold the Pass to prevent Egyptian forces from reinforcing their counterparts to the east, as well as establish a credible force that could threaten the Suez Canal. This would provide the pretext for Great Britain and France to intervene and take the crucial waterway back from Egyptian control.<br/><br/>The battle would come to represent the confused and tragic aspects of this war. The Israelis underestimated the strength of their opposition, the indecisive actions of their British and French allies upon which this operation depended, and the diplomatic victory Nasser and the Arab Allies would realize despite the military defeats they sustained. General Sharon&rsquo;s controversial decision, to attack and take control of the pass in disobedience of direct orders, led to high losses in a fight that did nothing to further the Israeli cause.<br/><br/>As the Israeli player you will have to keep your losses low, while keeping hold of the roadway through the pass, as the Egyptian player you want the Israeli's to pay a high price.<br/><br/>Activation takes place by the use of a deck of cards, similar to the Pocket Battle Games by ATO.

Two players or teams direct the actions of the escorting and intercepting fighters as they seek to inflict losses on the opposing aircraft while minimising their own losses. In team play, each player controls one or more specific fighter units, depending on the number of players and the amount of time available.&quot;<br/><br/>The counters come in four different sizes, with each larger size corresponding to the next higher altitude band (hence giving an intuitive representation of height, since higher units appear closer and so larger from an overhead perspective).<br/><br/>One of the games in Philip Sabin's book &quot;Simulating War&quot;, with counters and map downloadable from his website.<br/><br/>This game has now been published in a deluxe edition by Victory Point games, with full colour components and added historical scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny is an Apples-style party card game for a bunch of people. Players make compound words or phrases from a set of word cards to satisfy a mission. The dealer decides which of the submissions is Good, which is Bad, and which is Funny, and rewards the players appropriately (3, -2 and 5 points respectively). The first to 21 (or -10) wins.<br/><br/>There are three main differences between The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny and other Apples-style games:<br/><br/>The three main differences are:<br/><br/>1. Scoring. Apples games with strangers can be aggravating - will they choose the funny card or the clever one? Or the realistic one? Or just choose something terrible.<br/><br/>The dealer always has to choose The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny.<br/><br/>The Good is the best representation of the mission card. It&rsquo;s worth three points because, while good, it&rsquo;s boring and obvious. And you probably had the perfect card, so whatever.<br/><br/>The Bad is the worst submission that round. It&rsquo;s worth negative two because I&rsquo;m sick of players constantly ditching cards instead of actually thinking about a good answer. You&rsquo;ll also notice that many of the players that think they are funny will end up with a lot of bad answers.<br/><br/>The Funny gets the biggest laugh. Subjective, of course, but it&rsquo;s worth five points for entertaining the room.<br/><br/>The first to (or above) 21 points wins, unless there is a tie, in which case play continues as normal until a single player has the highest score.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s another small twist, which is that players can also win by scoring -10 points. This makes it a bit more fun to be chosen for that bad answer in round 1.<br/><br/>2. Players always play two cards. This is a game about compound words and phrases. Our lives are surrounded by such combinations - you&rsquo;ll start to notice much more after reading this sentence. Creating compound words and phrases is a wonderful challenge - it forces players to think about the many ways that a word can be interpreted and manipulated by another word. And the essence of this game is a carefully created wordlist that is composed of the most commonly occurring bits from compound words and phrases in the English language, almost all of which are nouns.<br/><br/>There are a couple of key benefits to this approach. Most answers are not reliant on a shared understanding of pop. Many other Apples games assume a certain level of 21st Century culture familiarity while the word cards from The Good, The Bad &amp; The Funny are timeless (the mission cards, however, do have a bit of pop-infusion). Answers won&rsquo;t get stale, as the likelihood of a one playing the same combination twice within a play session or many, many play sessions is infinitely low. Even playing the same word card won&rsquo;t have the same negative effect as in other games because it is about how two cards react together, not simply a funny reference. Even if the same two cards are played together, the order can be changed to dramatically alter the meaning.<br/><br/>The game is very replayable without the need for many, many expansions.<br/><br/>3. At any given time, three mission cards are face up. Dealers get to choose which mission they want to judge, which allows for another layer of strategy. Players can hold onto cards that match future possible missions (don&rsquo;t you hate throwing out the perfect card right before getting the matching mission?).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Game is a realpolitik boardgame where the players step into the role of the most influential people of the planet, the ones who control governments and nations. To win the player must avoid to identify himself with a faction such as North America, the Soviet Union or the Middle East. These factions should be &quot;puppets&quot; that the player must maneuver to get richer than other players.<br/><br/>During a play of The Game players manage governments, banks, religious congregation and mass-media, creating conflicts, speculations, war debts and political scandals. These events can decree the well-being or the failure of the world factions, provoking wars, truces and weapons trade. It doesn't matter if the factions controlled by the player prosper or suffer: the winner will be the player who benefits the more from the world situation: when you sell weapons you can win even losing the war.<br/><br/>Some notes regarding actual game mechanics, actions and win conditions.<br/><br/>There are six factions: Europe (black), USA (blue), Sovietic Area (red), Chinese Area (yellow), Arabian area (green) and Third World area (white). Players are not associated to factions but they control them. From this point of view the game paradigma remembers Imperial.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. During each turn a player draw one card from the common deck, then can play one card from his hand. Other players could play also a card during current player's turn, but this is not mandatory and not often worthy. Part of the strategy relies on the decision about if, when and what to play during the turn of another player. Aside from the card, each money holds some money, which can be spend during the game and it's considered as victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The deck contains 72 cards. 24 cards are named &quot;Controls&quot; and are permanent cards, i.e. they remain on the table after being played. The other 48 cards are temporary cards, i.e they are discarded after their effect took place. All cards are of four types: Military Control, Economic Control, Mass-Media Control and Religious Control. Since we have 6 factions and 4 type of control cards, this makes up the 24 control cards. The other 48 cards are also divided into these 4 categories (Military, Economic, Mass-Media and Religious) but, as stated above, they are temporary.<br/><br/>After playing a card, and carried on its effects (if not permanent) the current player can activate all his permanent cards. Each card allow differect actions.<br/>A military control card allows to move military units on the map, triggering wars and occupations among the 6 factions. Economic control cards allow to directly attack another player (not a faction) by stealing his money. Mass-Media control cards allows to move tokens from any position, changing the &quot;meaning&quot; of the token. This is probably the most innovative game concept: by activate a Mass-Media control a player can take a token from a Military card (depicting a was loss) and move it to a Economic card (depicting a return of investment). By this mechanism the player can use the power of Mass-Media to change the way facts are explained to people, and then changing the way the history events affects social groups. Finally, Religious control allows to steal a control card from another player: this is probably the most powerful card, but it's not always easy to manage.<br/><br/>Player roll dice only when manipulating factions. Factions are not balanced, and this is the game's core logic. For instance, a player controlling blue Military Control (USA Military control), white Economic Control (Third World control) and red Mass-Media Control (Sovietic Mass-Media Control) could decide to trigger a war between USA and Sud Africa, being almost sure that USA military forces will win easily. This could create a debt to his white Economic control card, and then he could use his red Mass-Media control to move this tokens away from white Economic card to another card of his own. An historical lecture of these strategy could be read as follows: in the real history USA won a war against Sud Africa, but russian Mass-Media managed to tell another version of facts, and this could produce a money income for the player controlling russians Mass-Media enterprises.<br/><br/>Playing The Game should give players the same feeling you can get by movies as &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997) or from the historical events as the attack to the World Trade Center (2001). Players should manipulate factions, sometime carrying them to financial crises, war or destruction, in order to enrich themself (and not the faction). The game ends when a player reaches the victory condition or the deck runs out of cards. At the end of the game the richest player is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Most of his discouraged followers and admirers are still asking each other hopelessly: how to go on without him? What&rsquo;s next now?<br/><br/>Some of them, however, know very well what is to be done in times like this: to write down the events of the reformer&rsquo;s earthly journey as detailed and as true as possible. This is the only way to pay due tribute to their friend and professor in order to educate the world and the church. So, they organize themselves into a handful of scriveners and set to writing the great biography. But they might get hard pressed for time!<br/><br/>While playing Luther &ndash; Das Kartenspiel we have the chance to slip into the shoes of these scribes. The teamwork, as usually happens, swings into a little rivalry: who will reap the glory, which comes with chronicling certain stages of life?

Then, each player must chose a card and play it at the same time. The person with the initiative executes his or her action first, then the other does this as well. After that, cards are swapped. It means the Authority's card goes to the Outlaw and vice-versa.<br/><br/>The Outlaw must then use these actions to move alongside the train to steal the beans before it arrives its destination, and, off course, without losing all his or her health points. Meanwhile, the Authority must keep at least one bean until the final station.

Each turn extra events can help you, allowing you to plant more, exchange crops, or even destroy parts of the farmland.<br/><br/>Crop Rotation: Bug Plague contains the base game and the Bug Plague expansion. The expansion adds an action rondel as alternative to the die to define the turn's extra event. Each player must evaluate if it is Worth pushing their luck with the die or discard objectives to use the rondel and ensure the desired event. This lowers the base game's randomness and increases the game's strategic possibilities.<br/><br/>But the defining characteristic of the expansion is the appearance of a locust swarm that endangers the whole farm. Using it, the game changes from competitive to solo/cooperative, and the players must work together to complete the objectives before the bugs devour everything.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Place the pieces carefully so that the enemy does not see the true identity of the pieces.<br/><br/>Now you play alternately by moving one character forwards, backwards or sideways - never diagonally. If you move through a field occupied by the opponent, this figure is hit.<br/><br/>To win, one of the following conditions must be met:<br/>conquer all 4 opposing Dr. Jekyll figures<br/>lose all 4 of your own Mr. Hyde characters<br/>leave with your own Dr. Jekyll figure in a corner on the opposite side of the field<br/><br/>",

The Guardian Card is a log of the training that you have received from the guardians of the island. The Dashboard contains a Health Meter which indicates the health of your character, a Damage Meter which indicates the condition of your vehicle and a Binoculars Meter which helps you look into the distance.

A player then rolls the High Speed Die to move their vehicle down the road (during certain times they must roll the Low Speed Die). They collect Game Cards and Coins along the way. They must traverse difficult terrain and battle hostile animals and other players.<br/><br/>Each character has at least three unique powers and/or abilities.

The player who possesses the compass is able to find and go through these paths. Other players may steal the compass.<br/><br/>During certain conditions, Game Cards can be flipped.

        "description": "Mystery Detective is a mystery solving party game that you can start playing almost as soon as you open the box.<br/><br/>One player, the Chief, takes one of the 100 illustrated cards and reads it to himself. The front of the card has the mystery, the back the solution. Then he reads the front of the card to the players and shows them the illustration. The other players are the detectives. Singly and together, they try to solve the mystery by asking the Chief questions. But he can only answer Yes, No, Close, or Not Relevant.<br/><br/>Here is a mystery:<br/>Title: Nasty Finish<br/>Excessive hurry led a man to a stinky situation.<br/>The picture on the card shows a man about to step into it.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s going on?<br/><br/>The detectives discuss and try to form theories that can be proved or disproved by their questions:<br/>Is the man afraid? - no<br/>Did the man die? - yes<br/>Was he murdered?- no<br/><br/>So it must have been an accident&hellip;<br/><br/>Now we're getting somewhere&hellip;<br/><br/>Bit by bit the detectives try to piece together the mystery. Often a question from one detective will give another an idea for a whole new line of questioning. There is no winner or loser but when you finally solve the mystery, you feel brilliant!<br/><br/>The mysteries, while not all crimes, are morbid and twisted and often very funny. You need to discuss, question and think outside of the box in order to solve them. Great fun, you can play almost anywhere, anytime. In the car, at the dinner table or at a gathering, all are perfect for this co-cop mystery solving game.<br/><br/>This volume contains 100 cases. <br/>For Black Stories fans, this second volume includes never before published in English, translations of Black Stories Funny Death and Black Stories Shit Happens.<br/><br/>- description by the publisher<br/><br/>",

The water is rising and the only things standing between the sea and your town are a dam and a handful of brave hamsters. Place your hamsters on your dam and roll dice to see where the floods will strike. If you have a hamster there to protect your dam, they become part of your reinforcements. If the flood strikes an unprotected part of your dam, the flood waters seep through. Keep your town the driest and you win.<br/><br/>This new edition of Hamsterdam has updated artwork as well as a number of rules changes from the 2011 version.  The main differences in the rules are:<br/><br/>     You now pass two of your dam cards to your neighbors and get two in return which could cause you to end up with up to three of a single number.  <br/>     The number of hamsters you get to defend your dam are based on which dam cards you keep and are passed.<br/>     You may arrange your dam in any order.<br/>     As you take on water, your dam now starts to collapse from the outside in.<br/>     There are now 18 special hamsters to choose from instead of the original 6.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

From all over the world, the best fighters are invited to prove their worth and do battle to become the next legendary Guardian. Authorities in their chosen martial art, each contender brings a set of special skills to the arena. The fights themselves won&rsquo;t be easy: the masters will not only have to battle each other in duels, but also with 3 or 4 person free-for-alls where they have to keep going until there is only one fighter left standing. Not only that, players will also have to compete in 2vs2 matches where they not only have to adapt to their opponent, but also their temporary partner. Each fighter is unique both in his techniques and in his reserves of energy and life.<br/><br/>In turn, players will choose one of the five areas on their personal Fighter Board and use the tokens on it. They will be able to hit their opponents with Action Tokens, but they will also have to use their Effect Tokens to control their positions on the Fighting Area, generate energy to trigger powerful special skills and prepare their defense for the next turns.<br/><br/>In Martial Art, your goal is to knock out your opponents. You have two ways to win the battle in the Fighting Area:<br/>- Cause enough damage to your opponent's whole body, leading to a technical KO.<br/>- Cause enough damage to a single body part to KO your opponent directly.<br/><br/>The last fighter standing wins!<br/><br/>",

The Futurium board game was released by Muravey Games in 2017.<br/><br/>Game participants are invited to become creators of the future, science fiction writers, and cyber prophets.<br/><br/>Imagine the world in 20-30 years, when it will change beyond recognition. Futurium is a conversation game that allows you to immerse yourself in this world! By playing, players can create a future that even great science fiction writers never dreamed of!<br/><br/>Each time they open the box, players become creators of a future reality. The game offers many versions of the future and a huge number of unexpected developments. For example, humanity in your game can move to live underwater or, conversely, fly away to colonize Mars in its entirety, or simply surrender all control in the world to intelligent robots, while ceasing to work at all. Each game takes place in a different future - each time in a new way!<br/><br/>The game is suitable for both novice players and experienced ones. Whether it's fun, serious, or completely insane - you choose what your future will be like!<br/><br/>It's easy to play:<br/>1. Open cards with names of objects<br/>2. Invent and tell what one of the objects will become in the future<br/>3. Those interested can tell alternative versions<br/>4. Vote for the most interesting version<br/>This continues for several &quot;circles&quot;.<br/>At the end of the game, the one who gets the most votes will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

You can assemble your players around an arena that changes with every game, toss dodgeballs at your opponents, move around the field, activate abilities, AND land critical hits until only one team remains!<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to be a Jungleball champion?<br/><br/>Jungleball is a dexterity game that plays in about 15 minutes. The game is played through a sequence of turns where players will throw small wooden disks at their opponent's characters hoping to land on them and get them out. Every character has a number indicating the amount of dodgeballs that can land on them before they must go out. Activating a character allows the player to move that character anywhere on the board, use that character's unique ability, and then throw dodgeballs (wooden disks) from wherever they move that character to. Play ends if all the characters on one team go out, the player with characters remaining is the victor!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

You can get help from specialists in several phases of the game. Secret route targets and special bonuses can make you the winner. But you also have to keep an eye on your fellow players as they can compete with you on your routes and therefore reduce your scorer points. They even can place negative events on you. But you can do so as well!<br/><br/>The game is played in 4 rounds. You always start by choosing a route board from a given selection of available routes. You will prefer to get routes with many passengers, short travel time, good connection to your existing routes and whether they support  your secret route targets chosen at the beginning of the game. You now need to establish a service point for each route in order to operate it. You can save money using one of your existing service points or using one of your competitors.<br/><br/>After 4 round&rsquo;s validations you can get additional scorer points by fulfilling your route targets, having the biggest train fleet, the best single route or most money. Then you will know who this time is the winner of Night Expresss.<br/><br/>",

In Emotional Intelligence, each player becomes a personality detective, and aims to deduce the personality traits of the other players before their own personality is revealed.  The catch: players can only provide subjective This or That clues regarding their personality type. The result is a fast-paced, sometimes contentious social deduction game perfect for players looking for both mystery and social examination.<br/><br/>HOW IT WORKS:<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re given a unique personality at the beginning of the game - you will play from the perspective of this personality for duration of the game. Every turn, you will take turns asking other players to answer This or That questions based on one element of your given personality.  The clues, which are subjective This or That answers, may only be as helpful as how well you know the person. Is seeing the future Volatile or (K)omposed? Up to you!<br/><br/>You will be given a Deduction Pad, where you will jot down your notes and make your decisions on whether another player is more Extroverted or Introverted, Logical or EMpathetic, Concrete or Abstract, or Volatile or (K)omposed. Once you&rsquo;re sure about all 4 elements of another player&rsquo;s personality, you can instigate guessing their personality. Everyone else will guess as well, but you will get double the points for each correct guess.  Additionally, you get points when other people correctly guess your personality, so it's a win-win!<br/><br/>The game ends when everyone's personality has been investigated.

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>In these days of recession, it's not that easy to scrape an honest living. But there's always a neighbour&rsquo;s lawn waiting to be mowed.<br/>Fortunately you have inherited your grandfather&rsquo;s MowMaster 2000, in it&rsquo;s day the height of grass removal technology. Unfortunately that day was about 100 years ago and mowing with it now is tricky, due to the machine&rsquo;s somewhat limited functions.<br/>Mind you don't smash it into those trees, because it'll cost you for repairs and watch out for that dog. Above all try to steer clear of the customers' flower beds and prize vegetables as they get very upset at the sight of beheaded daffodils or mashed marrow.<br/><br/>Mower Mania is a mix of puzzle/strategy (working out best routes through the gardens), resource management (your mower functions) and luck (dice for movement and randomness of garden tile layout).<br/><br/>When you land on a long grass tile, you turn it over to reveal it nicely mowed. Landing on vegetables or flowers, however, results in loss of points (money). Land on a pot, or go too fast into a tree or garden feature, and you'll also sustain damage to your mower.<br/><br/>The amount you earn will be based on how much of the lawn you've successfully mowed (a minimum amount required to progress to the next garden) and how much damage you've caused. You'll then need to pay for mower repairs and to replenish mower functions you used.<br/>.<br/><br/>Mower Mania was an entry in the 2016 Mint Tin Design Contest and did exceptionally well:<br/><br/>1st place: Best Overall Design<br/>1st place: Best Theme<br/>2nd place: Best Artwork &amp; Graphic Design<br/>3rd place: Best Written Rules<br/>Top pick: of Guest Judge, Caroline Berg <br/>.<br/><br/>Thanks to all those at BoardgameGeek who played the game, and gave feedback and suggestions, during the contest, especially:<br/>John Kean, lelo Arrowsmith.

Players then allocate the roll values, aka productivity, towards food, housing, more tribe members, or art.  &quot;Bad luck&quot; as determined by a separate d6 and penalties also play roles in determining which tribe will become the most culturally successful, but the main factor is a good deal of strategy on the players' parts.<br/><br/>",

Later issues of Battle Games featured more advanced rules to cover special abilities, magic, etc.<br/><br/>The title proved more popular than the publishers expected and the deadline was extended several times.

The hardest part will not necessarily stop the gangsters, but you agree you later for the distribution of benefits of each intervention.<br/><br/>Thus, at every moment of the game, you will make the right decisions and advance good arguments in a very short time. Negotiation and reactivity are your main weapons. But beware: if you and your colleagues will too shoot in the legs, it will be the Mafia who eventually win the game.<br/><br/>City Police is a fun and relaxed which makes great negotiation and role-play. Unlike Gangs City, you need to know to make decisions very quickly, on the stroke of the pulse. It will show you reagents both intellectually and physically, since the investments are trades like an hourglass time of 30 seconds.

When a new mining location is discovered, each company sends out a fully robotic mining base. Before mining begins, the companies attack each others bases. When only one base is left standing, the victor gets exclusive rights to reap the benefits.<br/><br/>Players play as one of the companies and try to build their own base while eliminating the competition. The last player with a base still standing wins. The base game mechanism involves laying cards in a grid to form a &quot;base&quot;. Each card or &quot;Module&quot; acts differently. The five base cards are the solar panel, the turret, the repair bot, the ray shield and the processor.<br/><br/>",

The remaining cards in their hand are then drafted to the next player, so players build up a picture of which therapies might offer a cure as the game goes on. Therapy cards range in value from 1 to 6 and can only be played if any player has played the card below it (i.e. playing a four requires a 3 in that therapy in play) and then game ends when one or more 6s are played in a round. Players work together, trying to cooperatively generate enough evidence for a cure, but not everyone will win - only those who have backed the right cure will be lauded, or everyone might die!<br/><br/>",

Players pick command markers to generate actions, modeling the chaos of the battlefield. The objective is to gain victory in battle, usually by destroying enemy units and morale. Each hex represents an area about 100 yards across. Each unit represents from 400 to 2,000 men. This game includes two scenarios:<br/><br/>Faesulae AD 405: Gothic chieftain Radagaisus vs. the Roman warlord Flavius Stilicho.<br/>    Tricamerum AD 533: Flavius Belisarius vs. Gelimer (King of the Vandals), mid-December AD.533 west of Carthage.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters.<br/><br/>This is the game contained in Strategy &amp; Tactics Magazine #324.<br/><br/>",

It is you who are the invisible force that the state uses when it is necessary to resolve the issue quietly. A difficult task falls on your shoulders, for the implementation of which you must use the most sophisticated techniques. Expanding the intelligence network is a kind of art ... Brute force, surveillance, blackmail, propaganda, bribery are just a small part of your arsenal. After all, the end justifies the means, especially when the interests of the state are at stake. And you also know for sure that all the links in your chain: informants, operatives and diplomats must work harmoniously, and only then will you achieve your goal.<br/> Place your spies in different parts of the world, introduce reconnaissance of rivals, eliminate enemy agents, complete secret missions and get victory points for all these actions.

Players must fight battles successfully to win territories and therefore increase their income. The more income a player has, the more buying power he has to purchase the combat units necessary to win battles and gain territories.<br/><br/>In order to achieve their goals, the players have at their disposal playing pieces representing infantry, armor, artillery, fighters, bombers and various types of naval vessels. A player must use clever strategy and planning and purchase units wisely in order to make the most of his resources.<br/><br/>The Japanese player starts the game at war with China. He must decide how much military equipment he wants to commit and for how long before the United States and Britain are brought into the war.<br/><br/>The Chinese player must attempt to inflict as many Japanese casualties as possible and hold out until the Allies enter the war.<br/><br/>The U.S. and Britain will enter the war simultaneously. Until then, they can only prepare the best they can for the inevitable Japanese attack...<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The set &quot;Sachsen&quot; contains historical events which are related to Sachsen. This relationship is not necessary obvious. Like all Anno Domini the Sachsen edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

One player takes the role of the attacking forces and other the defender.  Each takes turns exploring the board and coming into conflict with each other.<br/><br/>Players have a limited set of moves and military pieces they may use during the game. The attacking player is trying to win via the listed victory conditions before a set number of turns elapses.  The defender is trying to prevent this.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is broken into three phases (Command, Movement, and Firefight) and each player completes his turn fully before it is passed to the other.<br/><br/>Advanced rules are provided which gives players access to a set of six fleet cards with unique abilities that will alter their play-style.<br/><br/>Shoulder of Orion is part of a series of print and play boardgames published through Bell of Lost Souls.  This series is provided as a downloadable pdf which includes everything needed to play except dice.  Players may download, print out the pieces, and start playing.  The game is designed to be enhanced with common playing pieces found in other games for those would prefer to not use counters.<br/><br/>SHOULDER OF ORION is available FREE at BoLS Board Games: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.bolsboardgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.bolsboardgames.com</a><br/><br/>",

Can you describe a list of ten people, places or things to your team mates before your minutes is up?  Can you keep a game of work association going without any hesitation?  It's a hectic game where getting your tongue in a twist could be your downfall!<br/><br/>Players are split into teams.  Each card has two parts.  First you have to describe a list of ten things - these might be movie actors, sports people, cities, countries or things like herbs and spices, to give a few examples.  Sometimes there are limitations to what you can say, such as describing actors without mentioning the films they've been in.  Then the second part of the card is &quot;Don't Hesitate&quot;, when two players keep up a game of word association for as long as they can, from the given start word on the card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Depths of Durangrar is a dungeon crawler table top game that is played in the dark. Individual explorers will light up to illuminate only what is in front of them in a 3D maze. The goal of the explorers is to find treasure in the maze and bring it out of the maze from where they came. However, explorers must be careful for a monster hunts them in the maze. The monster does not light up and remains hidden in the darkness. The monster player is wearing night vision goggles and can see the whole maze.<br/><br/>Players move throughout the maze using action points. Action points are spent moving space to space, rotating, picking up gold, using their unique abilities, using items and attacking other players. Explorers can also team up with one another to increase their odds of killing the monster, however, it leaves them open to betrayal where another explorer can steal the gold they have collected for their own gain.<br/><br/>The explorers are the Scout, Knight and Demolitionist. The Scout can have more action points than other explorers. The Knight can reduce damage they take in combat and the Demolitionist can permanently remove walls from the maze.<br/><br/>The monsters are the Thresher, Excavator and Sentient Fungus. The Thresher can jump over walls to ambush explorers. The excavator can build temporary walls to trap explorers and the Sentient Fungus can build environmental traps to injure and slow the advance of explorers.<br/><br/>",

The block is a &quot;top-down&quot; design inspired by Greek mythology.<br/><br/>The second set of the block, Born of the Gods, was released on February 7, 2014. Born of the Gods is a small set consisting of 165 cards; of those, one is a planeswalker, the blue/green Kiora, the Crashing Wave. The set also introduces the ten &quot;demigods&quot; of Theros's pantheon, which are dual-colored and care about their controller's devotion to two colors. Born of the Gods features five of them with allied-color combinations; Journey Into Nyx will feature the remaining five.<br/><br/>In addition to the block-wide mechanics, Born of the Gods features two unique mechanics:<br/><br/>Inspired: a triggered ability that occurs whenever an Inspired creature becomes untapped. When an Inspired ability triggers, it provides additional bonuses such as drawing a card; occasionally, it may require additional costs to be paid.<br/>Tribute: an activated ability of creatures, replacing Monstrous and intending to evoke a similar flavor. However, it occurs only when the creature comes into play. At this time, an opponent may choose to give the Tribute creature a certain number of +1/+1 counters. If no opponent chooses to do this, the Tribute creature has a separate effect on the game state, such as spawning token creatures or causing the player to gain life.<br/>In addition to more enchantment creatures, Born of the Gods also introduces cards that can create enchantment creature tokens; these tokens are also printed with the starry Nyx background.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A regular Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.<br/><br/>This small expansion Set &quot;Anno Domini - Fussball WM&quot; contains only 54 events related to Soccer Worldcups. As it is conceived as a free give away (on occasion of the 2006 Worldcup in Germany) it consists only of those 54 cards (no rules, only cards in shrinkwrap). These are to few for a regular game, but can be added to any other games of the series.<br/><br/>In 2008, this expansion was included in &quot;Anno Domini - Jubil&auml;ums Metallbox&quot;, a metal box designed to hold 8 regular Anno Domini games. It has no own entry on BGG.<br/><br/>Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly. Anno Domini is a blast to play, it is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

Players are trying to discover the mysterious tomb which might hide the grave of the famous King Tutankhamun. While navigating the labyrinth of passages and diving deeper into the heart of the pyramid they ecounter various traps and other dangers, but also find usefull items.<br/><br/>Althought the game is usually full of suprise and mystery (and has a certain amount of luck present), there is also a fair amount of strategic thinking required. You will be able to influence the labyrinth, plan ahead and work together with other archeologists.<br/><br/>Farao can accomodate different playstyles - with beginners you can go for pure theme or with the thinking heads you can opt for more strategy. For example the strength of individual items depends on the random board setup (you gradually reaveal the game board during the game), so players may want to take this into consideration.<br/><br/>The game can be played in two ways:<br/><br/>     The small pyramid is suitable for beginners, as it only contains half of the obstacles and the labyrinth is smaller. This game lasts around 30 minutes.<br/>     The large pyramid is suitable for a longer game, giving the players more freedom in combining items and using various tactics. The basic rules for the game are always the same, so even beginners and younger children can easily pick this longer version up after a few plays of the smaller pyramid.<br/><br/><br/>Farao is largely language independent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Seth's Tunnels serve as shelters for Orcs, Goblins, Cultists, Necromancers, the Living Dead and the terrible Svartalfenheim (The Black Elves), as well as the Scorpion People and other even more terrifying creatures.<br/>Dungeons can be ancient abandoned mausoleums, ancient crypts of lost dynasties, subterranean labyrinths built by already extinct races, dens or orches and caches of orcs, gnolls or goblins, serving as the basis for powerful necromantics or even demonic portals for other dimensions. All of these sites have legends about lost treasures and valuable artifacts and attract the attention of Kingdom Adventurers groups.<br/>Our game begins when a group of Four Brave Heroes decides to investigate these locations in their quest during Hero's Journey.<br/>The RPGQuest can be played from 2 to 5 people (or up to 6 people if one of them takes the role of Narrator). Each of them will take on the role of one or more Heroes (out of 12 initials) within a team of 4 Adventurers and together they must face the challenges within the Dungeons.<br/><br/>RPGQuest is played in stages, called ADVENTURES. During an Adventure, a Hero can find or gain treasures and valuable artifacts. Weapons, Armor, and Magic Items that can be used in the following Adventures of a Campaign. You can also improve the powers and attributes of your Characters by making them stronger and more powerful on your Journey.<br/>Heroes must act together to win the Adventures.

The rules are quite simple: on one side there are Men, Dwarves and Elves trying to defend the gates and the slopes of the Lonely Mountain. The Free People are few but can use the advantage of the terrain (mountains and rivers). The game is played in turns (12): the Free People must defend the gates and try to survive the dark hordes.<br/><br/>Each units has a movement value and a combat value (attack and defence); the combat value of the defender can be modified by the terrain. The leaders (King of Orcs for the goblins; Wizard, Dwarven Hero and the kings of Elves, Man and Dwarves for the Free People) are really strong in supporting the troups and could really change the odds of the battles.<br/><br/>The goblins could also win the game killing all the troops and leaders of one of the Free People army (Elves, Dwarves or Men).<br/><br/>Close to the end, the Eagles and the Bear-Man come to help the Free People.<br/><br/>",

However, by means of the verses printed on the following pages, you may like to test the wits of your friends in the following simple game (for two or more players).<br/>Discarding one Joker, neatly lay out all the cards, in any order, face upwards. Reading aloud from the verses, in the sequence shown, you invite the players to call out the card that matches the verse. The first player to guess correctly, keeps the card. Whoever holds the most cards at the end of the game is declared the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Using their skills, the fighters attack each other, avoid hits and maneuver in an attempt to gain a tactical advantage.<br/><br/>The unique game mechanics lie in the interaction of the move cards and 40 multicolored dice.

Custer drove his seven companies of the U.S. 7th Cavalry into the valley of the Little Bighorn River in search of that last big victory to cement his place in history. There he met a vast gathering of Native American nations not willing to back down from the normal tactics of the U.S. Army. Custer planted his name in history, but for the wrong reasons as he and 255 of his men were slaughtered at the Little Bighorn.<br/><br/>Little Bighorn Rummy brings back both the famous and infamous cast list of this incident to create an unusual style of rummy, specifically a set collection game in which players collect both Native American and U.S. Cavalry melds to secure points while attempting to empty their hand. Special cards and support cards alter play, allowing players to play single cards (chiefs) to their table, look through the discard pile, and help Lt. Col. Custer (worth -20 points) escape the scene, among other actions. The first player to achieve 150 points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is set in a timeframe of the near future &ndash; 2017 through 2020 &ndash; in which the Iranians may have developed some kind of military nuclear capability. Even so, with the US likely still in another post-Vietnam-funk-type of &ldquo;neo-isolationism,&rdquo; the possibility for a blitz-style conventional Iranian victory across the region &ndash; aimed at fully establishing and certifying Tehran as the unchallengeable hegemon of the Gulf region &ndash; moves to the fore. The game&rsquo;s scenario can also be taken as a model of a possible Iranian reply to a US and/or Israeli precision aerial campaign targeted against their nuclear development facilities.<br/><br/>More particularly, though, the game examines what may well prove to be the precipitating event for such a war: a declaration of full independence by Iraqi Kurdistan. Such a move would almost certainly be quickly followed by similar declarations from the Turkish and Iranian portions of Kurdistan. In turn, no new regime in Irbil could then possible do anything other than admit those two additional territories into a &ldquo;Greater Kurdistan.&rdquo; That would then just as quickly mean Iran and Turkey would effectively find themselves at least becoming cobelligerents (if not outright allies), with a shared interest in destroying the new country as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>This wargame examines the strategic possibilities and parameters inherent in the opening Iranian offensive of such a war. There are no rules for the use of nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction. The situation is on such a hair trigger in relation to that aspect of things, if one such weapon were to go off, many more detonations would be certain to follow. The idea for Tehran (and Ankara) would be to gain a victory without resorting to &ldquo;game changing&rdquo; WMD.<br/><br/>Further, the entirely playable on its own, Isis War can also be played as an expansion and update of my earlier design, Oil War: Iran Strikes.

The other player is in charge of the German defenses (fighters and AAA). Each turn players commit their forces to the different map sectors secretly and then air battles are fought first between fighter sweeps and defending fighters, then between fighter escorts and remaining defending fighters and finally the latter against bombers.<br/><br/>Victory is measured in how many months the war in Europe is shortened or lengthened compared to May 1945. Victory Points are accrued by the US player for destroying targets and achieving air superiority in the most sectors, while the German have to hinder those efforts before the game ends.<br/><br/>",

Take advantage of unique movement mechanics such as shot selection, controlled positional play, dead ball extractions, tactical safety play, rebound doubles, combination shots and more. The game gets more and more intense as both players fight to control the board and edge closer to the 8 ball.<br/><br/>The Game starts by dealing out the breaking cards to form the starting layout of the game. Two groups of balls (solid &amp; stripes) along with the White and 8 Balls. Once the first ball is pocketed (directed into 1 of the 6 pockets), that group of balls will be designated to that player for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>The first player to pocket all their balls and then pocket the 8 Ball wins. Winning the game is determined by players shot selection and tactical safety play.<br/><br/>Balls can only move in straight lines, either Vertically, horizontally or diagonally along the board. Much like a queen piece in the game of chess. Always moving the white ball first, players choose which direction to move other balls and in addition have the option to move the white ball in preparation for their next shot. Using the dice, will help to determine how many moves a player possess and how they want to use them.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The Dreamer, meanwhile, listens attentively to the story and then - once all the Guides have spoken - must find the hidden meaning behind each intervention, with the help of his Dreamer cards (identical to the Guide cards in play). A certain number of successful associations enables the Dreamer to move on to a new chapter, with changing constraints. Conversely, each failure draws the Dreamer deeper into his dream, at the risk of not being able to get out... If the players all reach the end of the dream together, the Dreamer is freed and the game is won.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>R&ecirc;velune est un jeu coop&eacute;ratif de narration et de d&eacute;duction.

Each card has a microbe type represented in the middle and dots at corners. The dots are red, white, or grey. Players score colored markers by placing cards next to each other on the grid in such a way that one or more of the dots on their card line up with similar dots on other cards. For each dot that matches, that player scores a colored scoring marker for the card that their dots matched (not the card they just played).<br/><br/>During scoring sessions, scoring markers are converted into point chips depending on the current layout of the 3x3 grid. Once a scorecard is drawn, play immediately pauses and scoring begins. Of the 4 types available, the one that is represented the least among the 9 currently on the 3x3 grid is worth the most. This means that each colored score marker of that type that a player has may be converted into a 2-point chip. The most abundant type represented on the 3x3 grid is worth negative 1 point. All other types are worth 1 point. Players may never have a negative total. If there are 2 or more types that are both the least represented type, they are both worth 2 points, likewise, if there are 2 or more types that are tied for being the most represented type, each of them are then worth negative 1 point.<br/><br/>After scoring has completed, play resumes where it left off and the game continues until the next scorecard is drawn or the draw deck is exhausted. Once the draw deck is exhausted the third and final scoring round takes place. Players then total all of their scoring chips. The player with the highest value wins!<br/><br/>",

Clever placing and timing is the main key to using it.<br/><br/>Station Master: Flags & Whistles<br/>Includes two tiles.<br/><br/>Tile #1: The Station Master's Whistle<br/>After the first train leaves the Station and has been scored give the Whistle tile to the player with the lowest score. If there is a tie for lowest score then wait until the next train has left the Station - basically as soon as there is a clear lowest score that player is given the tile. They may use it at any time in the game to send any train out of the station early (as in immediately the whistle blows). However, if the tile hasn't been used and another player becomes the lowest scorer then they take the tile. The tile may only be used once during the entire game (that is ONCE not once per player) - put it back in the box when it has been used.<br/><br/>Tile #2: The Guard's Flag<br/>This tile may also only be used once per game. It begins on the table next to the train stack. On their turn any player may decide to use the Flag instead of taking their normal turn (ie they do not get to play a carriage or place a passenger chit). The Flag is placed above a train which shows that the train has a fault and cannot be moved. Remove all the passenger chits and return them to their owners, then discard the carriages and the train engine - no one scores this train. After use place the Flag back in the box<br/><br/>Zen Garden: Raked Sand<br/>The two tiles allow a player to remove and replace a previously played tile - except a feature tile with a cube on it already.<br/><br/>This is available in Game Trade Magazine (Issue 173 - July 2014).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Will you survive the game of Mafia? Two teams compete in this delightfully deadly party game. Based on the classic role-playing strategy game, it&rsquo;s kill or be killed as innocent city folk pit their wits against a mob of ruthless international gangsters. Engage in a tangled web of intrigue, subterfuge, wild accusations, protestations of innocence and bluffing. Includes 24 street character cards, crime-scene notepad and definitive game guide with rules, case files, tactical tips and ideas for advanced play.<br/><br/>To begin a judge must be picked and they will take notes of moves. Character cards are dealt face down to each player. There are three levels of game you can play, described in The Ultimate Mafia Bible. In the most basic version of the game the judge asks all players to close their eyes. The mafia are then asked to open their eyes and silently pick a victim. All players then open their eyes and the victim is announced. The living players must then identify a suspect. That suspect is eliminated and this marks the end of round one. The game continues until all mafia or all civilians have been killed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players gain the resource by moving to the space or having a base on the space.<br/><br/>When the right resources are collected, super powers can be purchased, but you must have training (tokens) to use them.<br/><br/>If doubles are rolled on the resource phase, a villain appears that the heroes must defeat by either:<br/>giving up the proper power resources,or<br/>giving up a training token to activate a purchased power.<br/><br/>If the player can't do either, the must give up a token to pass. <br/>Once a villain is defeated the spoils of victory are spread among the players.<br/><br/>The winning hero is the first to reach 80 victory points.<br/><br/>Super Powers has been updated to Second Edition in December 2009.  The second edition changes mostly include the main board where energy tokens are aquired.  They no longer are placed based on a die roll.  Also, players are able to perform actions based on the number of their own tokens placed on the main board.  The art has been upgraded. The changes increase the strategy options against opponents and the new art makes the game much nicer.<br/><br/>",

Based on TV's cleverest new game show. TOP SECRET requires the same intelligence and cunning when you play at home, each player assumes the identity of a person, place or thing. Now, you all vie to answer toss-up questions to earn money and the chance to buy clues to one another's I.D.'s But you only get four clues to each - and you have to buy each one separately!<br/><br/>If you can keep your own &quot;cover&quot; secret while everyone else reveals theirs, you'll go on to the Super Sleuth round: Decipher six identities in sixty seconds - from just three clues each - and win $5,000!<br/><br/>TOP SECRET...Confidentially, it's just too much fun to keep under cover!<br/><br/>Each player is given a secret subject. Each subject has four clues, with each clue having a purchase price: $250, $500, $750, and $1,000.<br/><br/>One player is selected to read aloud a trivia question. The player who answers that question correctly receives a random reward between $200 and $1,000. A player must buy a clue from an opponent when afforded. Guessing an opponent's subject earns the guesser $500, with the other player eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>The process repeats until only one player remains, who then goes on to play the &quot;Super Sleuth Round&quot; where s/he must guess three secret subjects in under one minute for $5,000.<br/><br/>The player with the most money after two games is the winner.<br/><br/>This is a faithful adaptation of the unsold 1988 CBS daytime game show pilot of the same name, although the show itself never actually got past the pilot stage. The board game was only released briefly before being pulled, mostly due to this but also because it shared its name with a TSR, Inc. RPG that was already on the market.<br/><br/>",

Storing resources is voluntary, i.e. a player can choose to sell his resources immediately after the Resource action. But he can also choose to store one or two resources in his warehouse, up to a total capacity of 2 resources (same or different). Resources in the warehouse can be sold later in addition to any other action of the player, either before or after that action. If a player has stored two resources, he decides whether to sell both or only one resource. If he sells both resources, he may sell them at different stock exchanges.

        "description": "A strategic table-top card game set in Japan during the age of samurai.<br/><br/>Taiko was designed in Pittsburgh with the goal of creating a fast-to-learn game that engaged the attention of both casual (social) and strategic players.  The number of players can be extended from a minimum of 2 seamlessly to an unlimited number of players (Present record is a single circle of 14 players).  Taiko has a unique starting setup since each player begins with an identical army (selected from the available cards), and there is no random shuffling or dealing anytime during the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each player begins with a castle to defend, and 7 warrior cards.  Simultaneously, each player put facedown a card from their hand on their left and a card on their right which will attack that neighbor.  Cards are resolved based on their value (higher wins) or by special abilities.  After resolving, all cards are traded.  The game continues until all castles are defeated except for the last castle standing: the round champion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The universe was determined by &quot;Kir of Run&quot; &mdash; the direction of movement &mdash; and the gods settled in their Tums on the edges of the world.<br/><br/>Slavic mythology is a little-known theme for games, one that can hide many secrets. Żercy is both a card game and a first attempt to create a complete representation of the Slavic gods and disclose this mythology full of mysteries.<br/><br/>Who are the Żercy? They are priests of ancient gods who attempt to manipulate reality in subtle ways. They are mercenaries in the hands of tribal chieftains, who attempt to divine success or disaster in coming wars. Żercy, by making proper sacrifices, want to obtain a favor of Kir, the one they serve, while striving at the same time to change the natural balance of power.<br/><br/>In the game, each player impersonates a Żerca, a priest of one of four Kirs, gods who represent both the seasons and the directions of the world:<br/><br/>    Jaruna (spring, east)<br/>    Rujewit (summer, south)<br/>    Jesz (autumn, west)<br/>    Kostroma (winter, north)<br/><br/><br/>You must read signs in the continuous changes around you. Choose a direction for your actions and for the Kir that you want to serve. All gods who appear in the game belong to one of four Tums created by Kirs; the inspiration for the graphic representation of the gods comes from images of nature, in which the attentive observer can notice much more than just a chaos of random configurations.<br/><br/>",

To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.<br/><br/>At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or &quot;Legend&quot;, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.<br/><br/>Die Legenden von Andor: Big Box includes the Legends of Andor base game, the New Heroes expansion that allows for games with up to six players, a promo &quot;Wolf Warrior&quot; hero, and additional legends and variants on top of those in the base game.<br/><br/>",

Then was once again revived briefly in Syndication hosted by Wink Martindale along with Crystal Owens and K.C. Winkler as co-hosts respectively airing from 1987 until 1988.<br/><br/>Each number one through nine is assigned a random, secret card that has a value between $50 and $500. The game master begins the round by asking a trivia question of the two players. The player who answers the question correctly wins control of the dice.<br/><br/>The controlling player may roll the dice or force the opponent to roll them. If the player who rolls the dice can use any combination added together of the numbers one through nine to make the total rolled the player wins the value of assigned values of those numbers. Numbers used are removed from play.<br/><br/>A players wins by removing the last number. A player loses when the player cannot make the dice roll using the remaining numbers in play.<br/><br/>The winning player plays the &quot;Big Numbers&quot; round solitaire. Rolling the dice to remove numbers. Rolling doubles earns the player an Insurance Card which gives the player a free roll when needed. Removing all the numbers earns the player $10,000. Failing to remove all the numbers earns the player $100 for each number removed.<br/><br/>The player with the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>When the game was revived in 1978, gameplay was changed slightly. The numbers 1-9 are put in three columns of three and assigned prizes to each column at the start of the game. A player had to remove the last number of a column to win the prizes. The object of the game remained the same, as did the Big Numbers.<br/><br/>The 1975 home games from both the E.S. Lowe and Milton Bradley era were called Big Numbers: The High Rollers Game while the 1988 Parker Brothers home game was just simply called High Rollers.<br/><br/>The show was inspired by the board game itself called Shut the Box.<br/><br/>",

One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.<br/><br/>During a turn, a player draws a location card &ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how he/she thinks this location relates to the starting one. Is L&uuml;neburg west or east of Blankenese? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.<br/><br/>After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct &ndash; and the card placed wrongly &ndash; the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.<br/><br/>After fifteen cards have been placed, the interlude card signals an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.<br/><br/>After three rounds and the final interlude scoring, the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

But to rebuild the region, you will need new workers, whom you should train.<br/><br/>In order to improve the economy, you must fulfill government orders, that is, invest your resources in the development of Ukraine. Instead, your region will receive growth in the foreign-exchange reserves and various bonuses from the state (bonus cards).<br/><br/>The term of your governance is 12 seasons. In each season, various events occur that affect the general situation of the regions &ndash; shortage of extraction of certain resources, crisis, moratoriums on construction, over-extraction of resources, etc.<br/><br/>Check whether you have enough inspiration to be ahead of other governors in the fight for the prosperity and development of Ukrainian lands!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ominoes: Hieroglyphs is the second game in the Ominoverse adding to the Best Abstract Game of UK Games Expo 2017 - OMINOES.<br/><br/>Ominoes: Hieroglyphs is a tile laying, tile flipping game where players are racing to complete their temple ahead of everyone else.<br/>The temple is made of five parts each of which is bought and activated using blessing tokens. The blessing tokens are gained by placing tiles on the Frieze of Ominotep in groups of four or more. Once a group is formed it earns the active player a blessing of that symbol, plus any bonus blessings from being adjacent to special altars. Once score the tiles of that group flip to the other side and a second scoring may be possible. If a second group scores then those tiles are removed - but without breaking the Frieze.<br/><br/>Place Tiles. Score Blessings. Build Temples.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Rommel: The War for North Africa&quot;, one of the &quot;Great Battles of History&quot; series wargames, actually should have been titled &quot;Battles for Tobruk&quot;, since it only covers the general area around that famous fortress/Port.<br/><br/>The container for this is a pinkish fold-over cardboard with a large cut-out on the Front and smaller cut-out on the back for storage of the Mapsheet(front) while some sort of &quot;pocket&quot; is used on the inside back. It's best to provide your own plastic baggies for counter storage and you supply the 6-sided DIE needed.<br/><br/>The Game components consist of the following: a 17-inches by 24-inches Mapsheet; a HUGE fold-out RULES sheet(about the same size as the Mapsheet); a Turn Track Chart(with RULES modifications); over 72-5/8-inch rounded corners cardboard Counters including some small round ones for Supply Record keeping; and a very small Sheet with Combat Computation Charts on one side and Historical Notes on the reverse.<br/><br/>On the mostly GRAY Mapsheet at the upper portion is a RED section which contains the Sequence of Play; Unit Movement Abilities; Terrain Analysis Chart; Attack Analysis Chart; Attack Taken/Supply Expenditure Chart; and a Supply Point Index for EACH player. The Mapsheet has some RED features while the rest are of a BROWN color. The Counters are ORANGE with BLACK print for 8th Army units and GRAY with BLACK/ORANGE print for Axis units, with a few PINK informational markers. The UNIQUE symbols used for the AXIS units is actually what the Wehrmacht used for their &quot;unit types&quot; on their situation maps and vehicles! A FIRST for any company at this time in the industry. They take some getting used to for NON-historical minded folks.<br/><br/>There are 3 Scenarios from which to choose to play: Battleaxe-3-Turns-14-15 July 1941; Crusader-10-Turns-18/19 November-7/8 December 1941; and Gazala-15-Turns-27/28 May-24/25 June 1942. Sequence of Play is: 1.Reinforcement Segment; 2.Initial Movement; 3.Combat Segment; 4.Exploitation Movement; 5.Supply Point Index Adjustment and then the second Player repeats these. Optional Rules include Reserve status indication &amp; possible Breakdown of Armor types using a die-roll after Exploitation Movement. Units are back-printed for step losses and allows for Replacements to be incorporated when available.<br/><br/>Overall, this wargame introduces some aspects used by other companies later on, such as Wehrmacht symbols(used by Avalon Hill in the Longest Day game), single Combat factor printed on the counter and having a &quot;set&quot; movement rate for EACH type, and differing Combat results tables for various combinations of attacks. I was unable to determine ANY credits by anyone involved in the production of this.<br/><br/>",

Every player gets a Hat Card, 5 (random) Craft Cards, and 3 Bravo Chips. The Heckle Cards are placed in the middle of the playing area, and the StoryTimer is handed to the player who is going first.<br/><br/>The game starts with the first player reading aloud one of the 53 included storylines. There are three phases to play:<br/><br/>Phase I: StoryTelling<br/>The player holding the StoryTimer creates (speaking out loud) the next part of the story (typically a sentence or two). Play moves around the table, with each player creating and speaking a new addition to the story. During this time, if a StoryTeller uses one of the elements on your Craft cards, you place it next to your Hat Card. Bravo Chips can also be tossed to StoryTellers who do a particularly good job.<br/><br/>Phase II: Discussion<br/>Anyone who played a Craft Card points it out to the others. If no one object, it goes on to that player's Hat Card and will be a point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Phase III: Recitation<br/>The player holding the StoryTimer gives a Recitation of the story so far. Other players can toss Bravo Chips for a Recitation well done. The StoryTimer is passed to the left, everyone draws back up to 5 Craft Cards, and we go back to Phase I.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players vote to assign awards (most creative, most hilarious, most surprising, most dramatic). These go into the recipients' hats.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most points in his or her hat.<br/><br/>A couple notes about the cards are in order. Craft Cards contain elements of the StoryTellers Craft, which means that players score points by either using or recognizing good storytelling. There are also Heckle Cards which are common to everyone and can be tossed to stop things from getting out of hand.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.liveoakgames.com/storytellers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.liveoakgames.com/storytellers</a><br/><br/>",
