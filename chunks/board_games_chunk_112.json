The other 4 are 'House' cards, and they are used as Jokers which can be substituted for any other card.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect two sets of 3 or 4 object cards of the same period (e.g. Jacobean) or 3 or 4 object cards of the same type (e.g. lighting). The sets are:<br/><br/>1. Kettles<br/>2. Tables<br/>3. Clocks<br/>4. Chairs<br/>5. Toys<br/>6. Cradles<br/>7. Cabinets<br/>8. Lighting<br/>9. Musical Instruments<br/>10. Irons<br/>11. Vessels<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest are turned face down to form the draw pile, with the top card being turned face up to start the discard pile. Each player in turn draws the top card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. He then discards a card. As a player collects a set of 3 cards he may, if he wishes, place them face upwards on the table in front of him and score their total. Any player having the fourth card to the set may, in turn, place it in front of himself and score its number. The game ends when one player has disposed of all the cards in his hand.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/>Cards score according to the numbers on them. House cards score 20. All cards still in the hand of a player score against him, and all cards on the table score for the player who has collected them. The first player to score 200 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

They slowly add armies and spread out across the board (on a defined point-to-point network) to take over mines which allow them to produce gems (which must be transported back to the fort to be useful).  Gems may be used to spawn extra units or gain combat bonuses.  The game includes defensive terrain bonuses, very simple supply line rules, and stacking limits.<br/><br/>Players are eliminated when their fort is taken.  Last man standing wins.<br/><br/>The game components are a set of glass beads to represent armies and gems and a roll-up mat with the map printed on it.<br/><br/>",

An eight-sided compass die determines the direction of travel while a six-sided die determines how many spaces one can go in that direction. If a player cannot move in the direction rolled, the ship is not moved for that turn. A player may also refuse to move when it wouldn't be to their advantage, or move a smaller distance when there aren't enough spaces available.<br/><br/>The six-sided die is numbered 2 through 5, and has a lighthouse where the &quot;1&quot; would go. When the lighthouse is rolled, the direction die is ignored, and the six-sided die is rolled again. This player may move the number of spaces rolled in any direction, and may change direction as often as they please. If the lighthouse is rerolled, it is counted as a 1.<br/><br/>This game, along with others in Channel Craft's Vintage Game Series, comes in a small tin. Movement is made with pegs, which rest in a hole after each move, making it a suitable choice for travel.<br/><br/>",

Playing pieces are small spiders which slot into the board. Movement is determined by a twister-style spinner.<br/><br/>To begin, each player takes one of the spiders and, in turn, spins the spinner. The player may spin up:<br/>- 2,3,4 or 5: the spider moves that number of spaces up the board; <br/>- &quot;switch spiders&quot;: the player may change places with another spider higher up on the board; or<br/>- &quot;turn the tap&quot;: the player turns the tap at the top of the spiderweb, releasing one of the blue balls.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to move your spider up the spiderweb to the top. During the game, the tap may be turned, the ball released has a fairly good chance of hitting some of the spider playing pieces and knocking them off the spiderweb. Spiders which are knocked off have to start again at the bottom. The winner is the first player to reach the top.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Tryline&quot; is a head to head Rugby Union simulation. <br/>It consists of Fast Action Cards, Team Cards, a color coded pitch made up of squares and a blue and red reversible counter that changes color once possession changes.<br/><br/>The FAC's control the Kicking, Passing, Running, Rucks, Mauls, Scrums and Lineouts etc. These are turned over by players depending on the previous FAC command or on the strategic placing of a Team Card.<br/>The Team Cards have 2 functions only one of which can be used when it is played. The first function called the Territory Part uses a move value attached to Kicking, Passing and Running etc. which are implemented when the player has been allowed to on the FAC. The second function is the Action part which can be used to counter play determined by FAC's or indeed by the placing of other Team Cards.<br/><br/>Tries are awarded when the counter lands on the Tryline by means of Running, Passing and Tap Penalties. If Kicks, Mauls and Scrums move the counter onto the Tryline then players turn a FAC to see what the outcome is on the Grounded Ball section.<br/><br/>At an advanced level, once players become used to the basic game, Tryline offers you the opportunity to introduce Substitution Cards and a Yellow Card system.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the first player to collect $20 million dollars, or the one with the most money after time runs out.<br/><br/>The board is divided into 4 areas; Knife River, Apache Run, Big Muddy &amp; Black Basin. Players roll the dice and travel around the board clockwise. As the player moves around the board, they collect oil lease cards and begin drilling for oil.<br/><br/>As play continues, the players collect pay day, which grows based on the amount of producing oil wells. They also can experience wells running dry, leases expiring, and they can purchase insurance. New years begin, they can face windfall profit taxes, receive golden oil drop cards, refinery bonuses, go bankrupt, and they may make deals amongst each other.<br/><br/>",

There are two types of roles for the players, either Chemical Companies or Merchant Bankers (with about one third of the players being Merchant Bankers). All players rolls two six sided dice and move their marker along the track that many steps, paying rent to the owner or buying the property if it is not owned.<br/><br/>The Merchant Bankers usually acts as bankers and loan money to the Chemicals Companies, at terms that are up to the players to negotiate, but can own some properties (Pipelines and Transport Companies). The Chemical Companies can own Chemical Plants, of which there are six types, including the special &quot;Steam Crackers&quot; that enhance the other plants, but not Transport Companies and Pipelines.<br/><br/>Any player can take loans from the game's bank, the International Bank, when buying properties or developing a property but only up to 50 % of the needed amount and always at 20 % interest. If any player needs more money or there is a need for money when the player have to pay for the rent of a property, a board meeting requires money or the taxes are due, then that player may negotiate a loan with any of the Merchant Bankers (up to 80 % of the required sum, but at any interest rate and terms the players agree upon).<br/><br/>Apart from properties the game board consists of Board Meetings (when the player might gain or loose money), taxation and income.<br/><br/>When a player cannot pay, not even by selling property to some other player or by taking a loan, then that player becomes bankrupt and a special meeting is held among the creditors. The purpose of this meeting is to strike a deal where each creditor gains as much as possible and at the same time the bankruptcy is prevented. If such an agreement cannot be reached, the player is bankrupt and is eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>",

By way of the differently shaped tiles they can check to see whether the tiles match.<br/><br/>The game is made up of 24 tiles, 12 with a red and 12 with a yellow border. The tiles represent activities on a farm as well as things to be found on a farm. There are two sets of rules: one for one child, one for two children. The two children rule is that all tiles are shuffled and put into the middle of the table picture side down. On the first turn a child draws a tile and sees if its his color. If it is he can place it picture side up on his side of the table. If it is not it must be put back into the middle. On subsequent turns the child draws a tile and this must be his color and match the tile/s already placed. If not the tile is put back. A child can choose any tile in the middle including the tile just discarded by the other player. The first one having his twelve farm tiles in a matching row wins.<br/><br/>",

Each game has an identical set of rules and components, except for the game board, which is adapted to the city in question.<br/><br/>As in Monopoly, the game is about moving around a board, buying property, drawing cards and paying rent. The object of the game is to eliminate all other players by forcing them into bankruptcy. The players can also agree upon an alternative victory condition before the game begins; the player who owns at least half of all properties is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game board is covered with advertising. The properties you buy are actually real Swedish companies who reside in the city the game is about.<br/><br/>The big difference from the original Monopoly is the possibility to buy stock. There are five kinds of stock (coffee, coal, iron, oil and gold) with different odds and payout.<br/><br/>",

Poor Jolly was found standing on one leg in a bucket of hardened cement.  He had been blindfolded and duct tape had been wrapped around his mouth. And oddly enough, his arms were straight up in the air&hellip;and his hair stood on end!! My goodness, Jolly was quite the sight, he looked like he had quite the fright&hellip;&hellip;and he certainly  must have ticked someone off - big time!!<br/><br/>Tell us more&hellip;&hellip;<br/><br/>For decades, Jolly JoJo had been an employee of Claus Enterprises and was in charge of toy design.  He began his fabulous career with the creation of &quot;Mr. Zucchini Head&quot; which proved to be incredibly popular with children all over the world. Jolly then went on to invent &quot;Darbie&quot;, the first doll ever designed with an hour-glass figure and an &quot;out of this world&quot; wardrobe.  After &quot;Darbie&quot; came &quot;G.I. Jose&quot; and an array of other action figures quickly followed.  He was there at the infancy of computerized video games and the rest is history. His genius and adaptability to the new venue of entertainment was astonishing&hellip;.and his most amazing success, the creation of the action packed hand-held computer game series featuring &quot;Volcano Vinnie&quot;, won him universal fame&hellip;..so, it's  no wonder, Santa adored him.<br/><br/>So what Happened?<br/><br/>It was Christmas Eve and Santa had just left for his annual, around-the-world toy distribution trip.  As a long time North Pole tradition, all residents of Santa City gathered in the Town Square, waved goodbye to Santa and then headed off to the Candy Cane Cabaret to celebrate another successful season. Everyone was having a grand old time&hellip;..when Ebba Sneezer Scrooge, toyshop foreman, noticed that Jolly JoJo was nowhere to be seen.  Scrooge decided to hightail it over to the toyshop and lo and behold, there he found Jolly&hellip;..who wasn't looking very jolly at all, in fact he was quite dead.<br/><br/>Some guests include Frostbite and Snowflake Snowmanelli (toy inventors), Holly Berry (greenhouse supervisor), Ebba Sneezer Scrooge (toyshop foreman), Don Blitzen (stable keeper), Noel Angelino (JoJo's guardian angel), Bob Humbug (Santa's navigational coordinator), Sweet Wings (sugar plum fairy), Kirby Marlow (Ghost of Christmas Past), Ginger Snap (cookie baker), Capt.

State Trooper that ends up on a parallel earth where the 'secret' of gunpowder is controlled by a group of Priests who's influence and gunpowder or 'Fireseed' as it's called can be bought and controlled. Kalvin also possesses the knowledge of making 'Fireseed', better guns and the history of warfare.<br/>     The rule book is 20 pages with two card stock loose pages that have turn references and combat result tables. This game was designed in 1977 when 25mm was the dominant figure scale (15mm scale had just come into being), but you can easily change the scale for movement and range by dividing the 25mm distances in half or by replacing inches with centimeters. You can use any English Civil war minis for this and the has four pages of line drawings showing how the armies look and what colors to use for each of the different armies. <br/>     Scale for 28mm is 1 figure = 20 men. You can change this if you like using 15, 6, or even 2mm (for 1:1 fun) change range and movement distance as you scale down. <br/>     Orders are written down with simultaneous movement.<br/><br/>",

One player plays the red set and the other plays the white set. The object of the game is to be the first player to capture their &quot;Boar&quot; between 2 of their &quot;Hunters&quot; either going across the board or along the outside circle.<br/><br/>The game is played in 2 phases as in a 9-Mans Morris Game. The players take turns placing their Boars and Hunters on the board and if no one wins in the placement phase, the players take turns moving their pieces to capture their own Boar between their own Hunters while trying to block their opponent from winning.<br/><br/>Though there have been countless games through the centuries which use a small format game board (Mu Torere and TicTacToe to name 2)but Boar Hunt is the first that uses 2 teams trying to achieve different but similar goals.<br/><br/>Boar Hunt:The Dark Ages Game started out as a small game with a leather &quot;Acorn&quot; board with glass playing pieces packaged in an attractive wood box.<br/><br/>The deluxe version features a solid wood game board with nice details and the playing surface is burnt into the wood using the &quot;pyrography&quot; decorating technique. The playing pieces are hand finished castings of the original playing pieces which look like they were carved in the actual Dark Ages. The playing pieces have a nice heft to them and the game is quite attractive when set up.<br/><br/>The size of the board (6&quot;x9&quot;x3/4&quot; - 16cm x 23cm x 2cm)and the sculptural quality of the playing pieces will make this an attractive game to leave set up on your desk, coffee table or bookshelf.<br/><br/>",

Overnight, your best customers became zombies, and a zombie's favorite food is brains. Fortunately your meat supplier also turned into a zombie, so getting your standing orders changed from pastrami and corned beef to brains and more brains wasn't difficult.<br/><br/>Zombie Cafe is a game of selling. Players are dealt five Brains from a Brain deck, each brain has a numeric value assigned indicating quality. The first player to sell all of their brains wins! Sounds easy, right?  Of course it isn't! During your turn you play modifiers from the Cafe deck on your brains to improve their quality and make them easier to sell, you play modifiers on other player's brains to decrease their quality and make them harder to sell, and general chaos ensues! It's not uncommon for one player to think they have it made and they'll go out on their next turn when suddenly a flurry of cards are played and they now have four more brains to deal with.<br/><br/>The game is fast to play, is good for 2-6 players (you could try eight players, but you'll exhaust the Brain deck pretty quickly), and a game usually lasts 20-30 minutes. One page of rules (double-sided), 52 Brain cards, and 52 Cafe cards. You will need two six-sided dice per player.<br/><br/>Home Page : <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.sparebrainsgames.com/zombiecafe.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.sparebrainsgames.com/zombiecafe.html</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A New Twist to the Popular Card Game Hearts!&quot; boasts the cover.  The game is somewhat of a Hearts with a retirement theme, but there are some rule ambiguities that make it unclear.  There are 40 cards, 10 each in 4 suits.  The black &amp; white artwork on each card depicts various advantages to retirement (more time, relaxation, etc.)  The lead player lays down a card.  Players must follow suit if possible, but also &quot;always trying to get red of heart cards first&quot;. It is not clear if this is a rule or strategic advice.<br/><br/>The person who plays the &quot;highest card in the group&quot; wins, but it is not clear if group refers to cards which followed suit or all cards played. Later, the rules indicate that players could have different numbers of cards in their hand, and that the game ends when one player is out. This seems to indicate that the proper interpretation of the rule that the winner &quot;takes the hand&quot; is that the winner takes the cards from the trick into their hand.<br/><br/>All cards left in players hands are worth face value, except hearts are worth 10 each. The person with the least points - at the end of one hand is the winner.<br/><br/>Neither the rules nor the box specify the player count range.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The games system of Archworld is designed with several purposes in mind:<br/><br/>1) To explain in terms of wargaming the capabilities of the armies and the peoples of the Archworld campaign setting<br/><br/>2) To provide a simple yet realistic set of rules that will cover ancient, medieval, and early gunnery periods.<br/><br/>One of the reasons behind the genesis of the Archworld rules has been an attempt to respond to the needs and complaints of many wargamers who feel that most of the ancient warfare rules now available are far too complex. Too many of these game systems require an excessive amount of log keeping and the use of overly long sets of tables. A need for referees and a lot of pencil pushing detracts from the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>The other problem with many fantasy rules is that they bear little relation to the literary fantasy tradition. These games tend to rely upon vast numbers of omnipotent beings and spell-casting wizards rather than the strategic capabilities of a kingdom's legions of ordinary soldiers.<br/><br/>Archworld is intended to provide a reasonable and easy-to-understand accounting of the uses of weapons and armor of the period, and the strategy of empire making and the like. The gamer who is not interested in the re-fighting of Archworld battles may simply disregard the fantasy elements and still use these rules to create realistic battle situations for any period up to the late 1600s.<br/><br/>Bases and Scale:<br/><br/>Scales is given in terms of paces, with one real inch equaling ten paces, one scale pace equals 2 1/2 feet (or 1 mm. equals 1 foot). All movement and the proper sizes of bases can be worked our from this scale. As a rule, one figure equals twenty men, except in the case of personality figures, which obviously are one to one.<br/><br/>Archworld also contains a complete set of rules for naval combat.<br/><br/>Archworld also includes a 4 panel paper foldout map of Archworld, 3 single sided sheets of cardboard ship cutouts (these are not counters-the cut outs of the ships are much larger and are used for naval miniatures combat), and 2 single sided cardstock sheets of reference charts.<br/><br/>",

From the appearance in the book, it's a bedtime game for children -- players roll the die and move their piece, and follow the directions when they land on certain spaces -- e.g. move forward, wait for two turns, etc.<br/><br/>John Blund is known in Scandinavian as a mythological little man who calms the children and helps them to sleep.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to reach the finish point first. Just roll the die and move. If you end up on a &quot;action&quot;-field just follow the simple instructions.<br/><br/>",

A four-player game takes about 25 minutes to play. Monster in the Cabbages is appropriate for ages 10 and older.<br/><br/>Your goal is to harvest as many cabbages as you can. However. there&rsquo;s a Monster in the cabbage field that needs to be fed. If everyone ignores the Monster, it&rsquo;ll get so hungry that it&rsquo;ll eat everyone (Everyone loses the game if this happens.). That means that you have to balance your need to harvest cabbages with the threat of letting the Monster in the Cabbages eat everyone.<br/><br/>On your turn you can Harvest Cabbages or Feed the Monster.<br/><br/>If you choose to Harvest Cabbages, roll two dice and add them to your score (under Cabbages).<br/><br/>If you choose to Feed the Monster remove a die from the Monster Cup, mark a Feeding on your paper, then roll the dice in the Monster Cup (see below for the possible ramifications of this).<br/><br/>If the Monster Cup is between you and the next player at the end of your turn, it gets to take a turn. On the Monster Cup&rsquo;s turn, add a die to it, then roll the dice in the Monster Cup. When the Monster Cup&rsquo;s turn is over, move it to your right.<br/><br/>When you roll the Monster Dice: If the Monster Dice total 25 or greater, or if the Monster Dice show three or more identical results (triples or better), the game ends.<br/><br/>If the game ended because the Monster Dice roll was 25 or greater, the Monster in the Cabbages got too hungry and ate all of you (the game wins and all of the players lose).<br/><br/>If the game ended because the Monster Dice rolled triples, cross reference the triples rolled with the following table to determine the winner:<br/><br/>1 or 2: The player with the most cabbages wins. Ties go to the player with the least number of feedings removed.<br/>3 or 4: The player who did the most feedings wins. Ties go to the player with the least cabbages.<br/>5 or 6: Multiply your cabbages by your number of feedings. If your result is the biggest, you win. Ties are shared victories.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Canadian cycling game is about a race in a city (a criterium). The board measures 64x48cm., there are 18 cyclists, 2 dice, 40 lap winner cards, 40 booster cards and 32 chance cards in the game. The mechanism is not difficult. The criterium goes over a number of laps that is agreed between the players (this determines the length of the game). One the map there is a track that gives the players multiple choice to determine the circuit. A number of spaces on the track are colored yellow and blue. When a cyclist is on a yellow space he receives a power card (also when he finishes a lap and starts a new lap), on the blue spaces a player has to draw a chance card. It is also possible that a cyclists takes a wrong route (this can happen with a chance card). There are also spaces that contain a text (for example 'flat tyre'). Winner is the player who's cyclist covers first the total distance of the criterium. With the dice and the card drawing this Canadian game has a high luck factor but the cyclist lover will certainly enjoy it.<br/><br/>",

Here, the goal is to place the location of various metropolises on a blank map. The closer your X comes to the correct location, the more points you get.<br/><br/>The game was invented during a car ride from Stuttgart to Leipzig. There was a lot of traffic and therefore lots of traffic jams mentioned on the news. The inventor pictured a map of Germany during these announcements and tried to arrange the towns mentioned. From this situation arose the first prototype &quot;Highway Guessing&quot;. This very quickly turned into the playable &quot;Metropolen&quot;.<br/><br/>The game can be used by school classes as a geography learning game (for example in two groups playing against each other) or as an educational game for traveling groups or other parties. The game was tested in a casual group and was a real conversation starter (&quot;I know where that is, I had the most unbelievable experience there...&quot;).<br/><br/>",

On regular game cards, teams encounter trivia, odd comparisons (Which happened first? The United States attacks Libya or the Culture Club releases Do You Really Want to Hurt Me) , riddles, jokes, math and grammar problems. Second Option cards introduce elements such as debate (Would Daffy or Donald Duck last longer on the cartoon version of Survivor?), charades and personal trivia (Was I born before or after Woodstock?) to the game, creating a whole new level of fun. R5 can be played by 3 or more adult players for a total point objective, select number of turns or within any given time constraint.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.roundaboutfive.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.roundaboutfive.com</a><br/><br/>",

Each of the route cards shows the four locations where the fox might be hiding.  The path is connected to a tile on which the fox playing piece is placed. They Prince players each have four tiles representing the four locations.<br/><br/>Each turn they try and predict at which location the fox will appear by laying one of their tiles face up.  The fox player then turns over his top card and 'appears'.  If any of the other players have a match then they move down the path to the next location on the route showing that location.<br/><br/>Over twelve rounds players progress down the path towards<br/>the fox - the first player (if any) to reach the fox is the winner.  If no-one manages to reach the fox then it is the player that progressed the furthest down the path that is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The dwarf warrior did not like the smell that was coming out of the dark room, it reminded him too much like his wife&rsquo;s cooking. By the Gods the woman could burn toast he thought, hell that was why he was always seeking out these dark dungeons, any excuse to eat something other then her gruel.<br/><br/>The elf signaled the way was not guarded by a trap, and so the dwarf and the small human sorceress took up a position near the entrance while the burly human warrior and the elf entered. As soon as the two stepped into the chamber the whole place lit up with a bright light and the laughter of the necromancer that waited within. Damn Jord cursed as he watched the hoard of skeletons rush him and his companions. Maybe he should have stayed home today and eaten the roast his wife was burning.<br/><br/>This is dark dungeon, the newest Mini-game from Bad Baby Productions. Hire mercenaries and adventurers and then send them out to explore the many dungeons and adventurous locations about the great city of Mordenhelm. See if you can outlast, out fight and outsmart the many monsters, traps and dangers that wait for you in the Dark Dungeons of this city.<br/><br/>Dark Dungeon is a sole game, using a fast, fun system of encounters and adventurous situations.

This way, for kids too young to know their numbers, they can play using the animals as 'the key' to matching their cards.<br/><br/>Each player takes turn matching one card, if no match is possible they must draw cards from the 'tile card pool,' until there is a match, then play continues to the next player.<br/><br/>The game ends when when one of the players runs out of cards.

Scores are tallied when all the countries have been named.<br/><br/>The other game is played Cranium-style, where players must answer certain trivia questions aided by Visual Aid cards that ask for the location or name of certain buildings. When these are answered correctly, the player moves forward on the board. The player to reach the Finish square first is the winner.<br/><br/>",

While there is education value in teaching recognition of music notation and theory, the game's mechanics have little to do with music.<br/><br/>From the Manufacturer's instructions: <br/>&quot;No musical knowledge required. Just read, count, and roll dice.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A game of chance by rolling the dice. Each player will encircle board several times in one game. Player keeps moving his token around the board the number of spaces indicated by the total sum of the two dice. Each space landed upon and each card drawn directs the movements of teh player. No one is safe even in his own play area. He must follow directions of space landings. There is no blocking, no bumping players off spaces and no back obligations. First player to fill his staff with notes and complete a song title is the winner. It can be very frustrating at times with continual gains and losses; such as real composers go through as they create a song. A player who has the least notes or words during the game can be the winner at the last minute though it appears he is losing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Object of Game: A player must fill his 8 BAR STAFF with 4 beats to each measure containing the right amount of notes and complete a SONG TITLE of four words or more which say something.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;EQUIPMENT: Board with indicated play spaces, four 8 bar staffs, four tokens to represent each composer, two dice, 500 words, 50 whole notes (clear discs) 50 half notes (white discs) 75 quarter notes (black discs) and 75 Directional cards.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Most spaces of the track represent countries, but there are also spaces for traffic hubs, Red Cross, immigration detention centre, lawyer and event card pickup (authorities, everyday life). Usually landing on a space decreases player's points.<br/><br/>A player may apply for asylum in one country. The odds for being granted asylum are given by country cards and they reflect some statistic characteristics of the real country.<br/><br/>A player's game ends once he/she has run out of points and so been deported out of EU, or if he/she manages to get asylum (win) or a temporary residence permit (lose).

The players begin and end in London, and many spaces advance players or transport them to other portions of the board.  For example, a playing piece that lands on Hanover &quot;shall by order of Ye King of Great Britain who is Elector, be conducted to ... Gibraltar to visit his countrymen who keep garrison there&quot; while the playing piece that lands on &quot;Rome for kissing ye Pope's Toe shall be banished for his folly to ... the cold island of Iceland and miss three turns&quot;.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/42/13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/42/13</a><br/><br/>",

All you do is maneuver the magnet around the Jati maze. Sounds easy - but, here's the catch - you can't touch the magnet! All maneuvering must be done with the magnetic wand. Come too close to the magnet with the wand and - you've had it. The magnet either plunges over the edge or reverses itself and leaps toward the wand. Only a dazzling display of dexterity on your part will maneuver the magnet around the Jati maze and into the center. So, test your skill and dexterity; see if you're a novice or a Jati Master, and score yourself accordingly. As a novice, you'll only score 25 points. To be a JATI Master, you'll have to maneuver the magnet in printed side up - no easy feat! For superb skill, the Jati Master scores 100 points. What if you get the magnet in upside down, you ask. Well, then you're only an advanced Jati player; score 75 points and keep practicing.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with:<br/>Jati, a tile laying game<br/><br/>",

Furthermore there are actions like &quot;spin again&quot; or &quot;go directly to next round&quot; (with higher cash reward).<br/>The money is usually distributed to equal parts amongst the players, only the Captain is getting more.<br/><br/>The difficulty of the trivia questions rises every round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Count on Buzz Lightyear is a card game in which players must get rid of cards in their hands by creating math equations.  Each time an equation can be made, using one card from the hand and two cards from the table, the player gets to put down  the card from the hand that was used.  When one player has rid himself of all cards in his hand, the other players add up the points left in their hands and another round is dealt.  Play continues until all players but one have passed 50 points.<br/><br/>The theme of the game is Toy Story, and each number card, 1-10, features a picture (drawing) of one of the Toy Story characters.  Buzz Lightyear cards are wild cards and can represent any number (but, if left in your hand, count for 11 points each).  This game would be best for children in early grade school, as they develop their basic math skills.  The suggested age of 7+ is pretty accurate, although enjoyment of the game will depend greatly upon the player's math skills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Rules<br/>This game was devised to enable the therapist to learn about the underlying psychological processes of such children, in a way that is non-threatening. It utilizes the vehicle of the standard game--so universally appealing to children--and the elicitation of responses via token reinforcement. The game has proved helpful in shortening the therapeutic process--not only because it provides the therapist with information earlier than he would have otherwise obtained it, but also because it facilitates the child's freeing himself enough to reveal his previously suppressed and repressed thoughts, feelings, and actions. The game can be useful in both individual and group psychotherapy with children. And even the child who will engage in direct discussion, psychoanalytic inquiry, and fantasy play can find it a pleasurable additional psychotherapeutic experience. It is most useful in treatment of children between the ages of four (children younger than that cannot usually  play board games) and twelve (the adolescent will often consider the game &quot;babyish&quot;).<br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTICE<br/>Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game was designed to be used only by mental health professionals in their therapeutic work with children. Accordingly , every reasonable attempt is made to limit the sale and distribution of the game to such professionals. Use of the game by parents with their own children is therapeutically contraindicated. Most parents are not trained to provide appropriate therapeutic responses to the cards. And even those who are, are not likely to have the objectivity with their own children that is necessary for optimum utilization of the game. Lastly, such play with parents will compromise the child's use of the game with his or her therapist.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Anger Solution Game helps children learn to control their behavior responses to anger. As players make their way around the board, they are faced with a series of decisions and learn to choose the success route over the victim cycle. The anger solution game is a unique therapeutic tool. The game includes a game board, 100 tokens, 1 solution spinner, 1 6-sided die, 24 empowerment cards, 58 question cards, and 40 solution cards.<br/><br/>From the Rules:<br/>This game is intended to be played with adult supervision. Any empathetic adult (parent, teacher, counselor, etc.) can assist children to effectively identify, express, and manage their anger. Although anger is a natural emotion in response to conflict situations, it can jeopardize relationships if it is not communicated effectively and appropriately.<br/><br/>Typically, people react inappropriately to anger in one of two ways. The first is by overreacting to conflict situations by becoming verbally and/or physically explosive to others after allowing anger to build up. Secondly, a person may react to anger by internalizing their frustration with a conflict situation which often results in physiological or emotional symptoms of stress.<br/><br/>The Anger Solution Game  was developed through the integration of a psycho-educational approach with cognitive behavioral intervention modality. The main goal is to help the client to understand that he/she has control over behavioral responses to anger and that he/she can make choices which can result in positive solutions.<br/><br/>",

This contains 24 squares representing all ways to divide a square into four equal triangles (with short edges along the square's diagonals) and color the triangles with 3 colors.<br/><br/>Wade E. Philpott sold a cardboard set of squares, including rules for several games and puzzles, beginning in 1966. Kadon distributed it beginning in 1982 and started producing an acrylic version in 1989.<br/><br/>The second edition Kadon rulebook (dated 1991) contains rules for 4 games, plus variants. The first three were originally designed by Philpott, although they have been changed slightly over the years; Closure was not in the original set and was presumably designed by Kate Jones.<br/><br/>The games are:<br/><br/>Multimatch. Players take turns placing tiles on the 5x5 gameboard. Edges must match and the first piece placed on a border of the board determines the color of that border. Last player wins.<br/><br/>Bingo. Players take turns placing tiles on the 5x5 grid, attempting to be the first to create a row of 5.<br/><br/>Outmatched. Players divide the tiles equally (face-down) and then race to assemble their group into a rectangle, with tile edges matching.<br/><br/>Closure. The tiles are assembled into a random (but edge-matching) group. Players take turns &quot;closing&quot; one of the 3 colors by moving as few tiles as possible. Closing a color requires leaving no exposed edges of that color. Moves may not separate any tiles from the group.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monopoly themed around the Village of Granville, Ohio to celebrate the Granville Bicentennial. Features many of the historic locations and businesses around the community.<br/><br/>The classic boardgame was inspired by Sam Kapland-Goland, created by Mrs. Jeanna Giovannell's 4th Grade Discovery Class of the Granville Intermediate School.  This version of Monopoly requires players to accumulate wealth by acquiring businesses while avoiding charges for the customers. Community Chest and Chance cards are replaced by Fate and Bicentenial Chest cards.  The In Court and Loading Zones spaces replace the Free Parking and Jail spaces.  A must for Ohio history fans.<br/><br/>",

Implements and rules were included for one game along with &quot;a full set of checker men&quot; (as a Stoll &amp; Edwards catalog put it) for the other.<br/><br/>In this case, the &quot;A&quot; game is a simple spin-and-move race through the episodes of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), including the Pool of Tears, the Caucus Race, the Mad Tea Party, and the Queen's Croquet Grounds. Occasional hazard spaces actually tend toward rewarding players, but occasionally they can force players to move back a few spaces or lose one or two turns.<br/><br/>The original Stoll &amp; Edwards edition has a game board printed in three colors (black, orange and green). In their next incarnation as Stoll &amp; Einson, the publisher reissued the game a decade later under their &quot;Playjoy&quot; brand, with board art utilizing a wider variety of colors and some illustrations revised to more strongly resemble Sir John Tenniel's famous book illustrations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maatilakierros is a simple children's game where players move around the farm by rolling the dice. The dice is not numbered but instead has different colors on its side. On blue, green, yellow and orange you get to move to the next circle with the appropriate color, on red you move backwards and on white you do not move at all. The winner is the player who reaches the last circle first.<br/><br/>The components are nice - the dice is big, as is the board which is constructed from over 30 pieces. Soft and cute animals (a cat, a dog, a pig and a cow) are used as player tokens.<br/><br/>",

The drivers were determined Sept. 8 after the Chevy Rock and Roll 400 race at Richmond International Speedway.<br/><br/>Players race around the racetrack game board, trying to be the first to cross the finish line for the 10 races that make up The Chase. They collect chips for the races they win, and the player with the most race chips at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Along the way, players try to avoid the Crash Zone and Pit Road but zoom forward when they land on a Drafting Advantage space or play a Pass Card. The game board also has several Chase Challenge spaces, which might help lucky players take the lead or avoid a crash. Players who aren&rsquo;t so lucky might be warned about changing track conditions or a tire that&rsquo;s losing air.<br/><br/>",

It is designed for family members to play on &quot;Family Home Evenings&quot; but is also appropriate for other church gatherings.<br/><br/>Players begin at Earth and follow a &quot;Strait and Narrow Path&quot; (a phrase from Mormon scripture) to the Celestial Kingdom. Players advance by answering up to four religious questions per turn. Odd numbered questions are about faith/religious knowledge and even numbered questions are about Good Works. Each questions answered increases the number of spaces the player can move.<br/><br/>If a player answers a Faith question incorrectly, his or her turn is over. If he or she answers a Good Works question incorrectly, then the pawn is moved off the Strait and Narrow Path and onto a detour, which lengthens the route to heaven.<br/><br/>The first person to make it to the Celestial Kingdom is not the winner. Also, the rules encourage helping players that are falling behind. The game ends when all players arrive, thus emphasizing that Families should work together so that everyone makes it to heaven.<br/><br/>",

Players acquire wealth by buying and selling on the black market and correctly answering trivia questions about Soviet society and other Russian curiosities.<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to weave their way through the three social classes and make it to Red Square.

        "description": "This game is played on an empty NxN square board (such as a 7x7 board).<br/><br/>Each player drops his stone on an empty cell. On each turn, each player must move his stone. The stone moves similar to a chess Knight, but in two steps rather than one. First it moves one (two) cell(s) in one direction, then two (one) cell(s) orthogonally (hence each player has two moves per turn). All positions moved to or jumped over turn into an impenetrable barrier for both players (i.e., they cannot be moved into or jumped over).<br/><br/>Whoever leaves his opponent with no move first wins.<br/><br/>",

Yudenich&rsquo;s planned Fall offensive was timed to coincide with the pinnacle of the White&rsquo;s success, as Denikin approached Orel and Tula, the munitions-manufacturing center. From there it was only a short distance to Moscow. Heroic Frenzy covers the battle for Petrograd during this time.<br/><br/>The map scale is about 3-3.5 miles per hex.

Now you can play it for yourself to see which side would win.<br/><br/>This game was developed to help cross-understanding of the two different chess systems.<br/><br/>One side plays with the Western Chess pieces, the other with the Chinese Chess pieces.<br/><br/>Due to the differences in western and eastern chess boards, both halves of the board retain the characteristics of each side. The number of squares have been increased to accommodate the slightly larger Chinese chess board. A central row on the Chinese chess side terminates at the &quot;river&quot; to merge into the western chess board. Units playing at the central row interface play as per normal but with a termination at the end of the row. Bishops and Queen moving along the diagonal will side-step across the central row to maintain the same colour of squares.<br/><br/>Because of Eastern initial advantage checkmating with catapults in first move, West starts.<br/><br/>All usual rules apply.<br/><br/><br/>     Western - King - 1 step in any direction<br/>     Eastern - ji&agrave;ng/shuai (General/Marshal) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)<br/>     Western - Queen - moves diagonally and vertically/horizontally<br/>     Eastern - sh&igrave; (Scholar/Official) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)<br/>     Western - Bishop - moves diagonally<br/>     Eastern -  xi&agrave;ng (Elephant/Minister) - moves in 2 step diagonals (blocked by a piece along its diagonal) (cannot cross river)<br/>     Western - Knight - moves in 2/1 step &quot;L&quot; (blocked by a piece along the long side of the &quot;L&quot; when in Eastern territory)<br/>     Eastern - ma(Horse/Cavalry) - moves in 2/1 step &quot;L&quot; ( blocked by a piece along the long side of &quot;L&quot; when in Eastern territory)<br/>     Western - Castle - moves vertically/diagonally<br/>     Eastern - ju (Chariot/Wagon) - moves vertically/diagonally<br/>     Eastern - pao (Catapult/Cannon) - moves vertically/horizontally, takes enemy piece by leaping over another piece<br/>     Western - Pawn - 1 step forward, takes enemy piece 1 step diagonally (1 or 2 step opening move)<br/>     Eastern -zu/bing (Private/Soldier) - 1 step forward (across the river, 1 step vertically/horizontally)<br/><br/><br/>Other rules;<br/>Western Chess Unique Rules<br/>1.

        "description": "This game features a fly wheel and a starting grid for 6 horses. From the rules: Before running the race be certain that all horses are lined up evenly at the barrier (starting point) and that all the flags at the opposite end of the track are lowered. To operate, hook loop in string over the pin in the shaft and wind by turning the fly wheel away from you 5 or 6 times. Then hold the game down with one hand and give a vigorous pull toward you. This should keep the fly wheel spinning with enough power to carry all of the horses the complete length of the track to the point where the flags go up. As the horses finish the flags rise, for instance if the white flag goes up then the white horse has won the race and the flags go up in corresponding sequence as the horses all &quot;come in&quot;.  To line up the horses for the next race simply pass the string in front of the horses and draw them back to the start line. All horses have an equal chance of winning the race because once the race starts no one can have control of the action of the horses.<br/><br/>The rules then go on to say that in some instances dirt or dust can retard the forward motion of a horse. To avoid this,  the grooves in the tracks should be kept clean by occasional use of a soft cloth. Also a drop of lubricating oil on the bearing at each end of the fly wheel now and then is advisable and that GEE-WHIZ should be played on an even and level surface.<br/><br/>",

It feeds into a CO2 pipeline delivering it to Chevron in Rangely Field in northwest Colorado, then Anadarko Petroleum at Monell Field and Merit Energy in the Lost Soldier and Wertz Fields (south-central Wyoming), and finally to Anadarko at the Salt Creek Field in east-central Wyoming.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most hands wins.<br/><br/>Playing the game: <br/>The players choose at random who deals first. This player deals the cards based on the number of players and places the deck of remaining cards face down on the table. The player cuts the deck to determine the trump colour which is the highest ranking suit. The player then places the trump reminder card face up on the table for all to see. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left goes first. The first player lays one card face up on the table. Each player takes turns playing a card of the same colour as the colour requested. If a player does not have a card of the colour requested, he or she may play a trump colour, a card of a different colour or a Lettro TM card. The player with the highest card wins the hand. Then the winner of the hand plays the first card, and so on.<br/><br/>If more than one Lettro card is played in a round, the last player to play a Lettro card wins the hand. When a player plays a Lettro card, he or she can change the trump immediately, but players who have not yet completed<br/>the round must play cards of the colour originally requested. After all the cards have been played, enter each player&rsquo;s number of hands won.

Its purpose is also to show the problems associated with the transporting of munitions and supplies of all kinds to Great Britain. The part which Canada is playing in the whole war, and in the crucial Battle of the Atlantic in particular, will undoubtedly be better appreciated by both young and old after playing this game and digesting some of the information contained here.&quot;<br/><br/>The contents consist of one cardstock sheet, 14&quot; by 35&quot;, printed in three colours and folded into four panels like a menu. Six markers are available to be cut out from one margin of the board, as well as a six-sided top to be used as a die. One side of the sheet consists of a map of Canada, the North Atlantic and Great Britain. The other side of the sheet contains instructive data, graphs, charts and other appropriate propaganda.<br/><br/>",

Each has particular properties that can help you blaze a trail from Monte Carlo across to Gibraltar round to St Petersburg, back to London and on to Helsinki in time for tea. Whoever has been to the most casinos after each player has been the &quot;dealer&quot; once, wins.<br/><br/>Jet Set Casino is all about successful negotiations. You must clinch the best deals with your opponents to get hold of useful casino cards and the right transport cards to get there. Those who have successfully visited a casino during their turn have the right to participate in a genuine casino game: they play a round of 'Seven-and-a-half' (not unlike 'Vingt-Et-Un') to compete for a further free casino visitation. The game also demands a good sense of strategy - from choosing the all-important starting casino, to obtaining the best transport cards for each different phases of the game - plus a little luck, as that's what gambling is all about, really...<br/><br/>Jet Set Casino has just been released in mainland Europe, and will be available shortly in the UK.

        "description": "From Old Silk Road:  A voyager in the game finds himself on the trade routes which existed at the height of the Tang Dynasty in China (c. 750 AD). He sets out from Chang An, the cosmopolitan Chinese capital. Traveling across northern China and then to Central Asia, with a lucky roll of the die he will arrive at Samarkand, an important trading center. There, glass, fruit and horses may be purchased. At Merv, the traveler must decide whether to follow the overland or sea route. Going by sea, one has the opportunity to buy incense at the port of Hormoz, collect rubies, sapphires and pearls in the kingdom of Anuradhapura (now in Sri Lanka), visit the wondrous temples at Elephanta and Kancipuram and buy spices in Srivijaya (Sumatra). But beware! There are mighty perils on this route. On the overland route, the traveler visits magnificent Buddhist temples in India and beyond, encounter tigers in the jungles of Bengal and purchase luxuries such as kingfisher feathers and rhino horn at Angkor. The final leg of the journey passes through the the bustling port of Guangzhou (Canton) and then off to Japan and Korea where the traveler will be able to visit foreign temples and complete final trading before returning home by way of the Grand Canal.<br/><br/>Each location includes a special paragraph of text describing what happens to the traveler there. Often they include special trading opportunities. Major trading centers have specific products which they sell and also another list which they want to purchase. Commodity holdings are shown by cards which list the differing values of these items at various locations. Includes short history and glossary of terms.<br/><br/>",

The first player to kill off all of his opponent's gladiators or have one of his own gladiators<br/>survive 5 fights (thereby earning fame and freedom) wins the game.<br/><br/>The game models gladiatorial combat between two or more gladiators, including teams.<br/><br/>Combat is broken down into melee combat turns, with each turn consisting of 5 phases:<br/><br/>1. Movement<br/>2. Initiative/Maneuver<br/>3. Attack/Parry<br/>4. Riposte/Counter Parry<br/>5.

        "description": "These rules allow quick and fun gladiator combats involving just two gladiators or a whole crowd.  Animals such as lions and tigers can also be included.<br/>Each player controls one or more units. A unit can be a gladiator OR animal such as a lion or tiger. Each unit requires a unit sheet.  Mark in pencil or use pins in the shaded squares.<br/>The playing area is divided into squares to regulate movement and which units fight. Players roll 1d6 for each unit to determine initiative. The units will be moved in the order of lowest initiative to highest initiative. Roll another dice to separate tied rolls.  This second roll is only used to separate initial tied rolls and does not change the order of others who initially rolled higher or lower.<br/>It costs 1 move point to move a unit to a vacant adjacent square (including an adjacent diagonal square).  A unit can only use up to the number of move points shown in the gladiator table each turn, but does not have to use all of their move points each turn.  Move points not used that turn are lost. A unit cannot move into or through a space occupied by another unit.<br/>The combat phase occurs after all movement has been completed. A player does nothing in the combat phase if that unit is not adjacent to any other unit. Adjacent also includes the touching diagonal spaces.  Otherwise :- Players secretly choose which (if any) adjacent unit they will attack this turn. A player also secretly chooses the aggro level. The aggro level chosen will affect the attack and defense factors for that unit.  This is how aggressive or defensive that unit will be for all combats this turn.<br/>When a unit reaches 0 or less hit points, it is dead, and is removed from the board. A unit scores a victory point each time it inflicts a hit point of damage on another unit.<br/>The winner is the owner of the gladiator who survives, or the gladiator who scored more Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TZAP Rummy is a fast-paced game. Like all rummy games, it involves creation of 3-card RUNS (sequences) and SETS (3 of a kind). And, like the Rummikub tile rummy game, it involves rearranging already-melded cards on the table to the best of your advantage. The deck of standard cards also includes six special TZAP cards which have both strategic and laugh-generating functions that provide twists not found in other rummy games. The game is for ages 8 and up, 2 to 8 players, and can be played individually or as partners.<br/><br/>TZAP Rummy claims to set itself apart from other rummy games by:<br/><br/>FIRST, it involves manipulation of melded cards on the table to help get rid of cards from hand, i.e., to &quot;go out.&quot;<br/><br/>SECOND, it involves manipulation of opponents by strategically &quot;zapping&quot; the right opponent at the right time to improve your chances of going out, while at the same time inhibiting others from going out. This requires some tough decisions on whether to use TZAP cards for melding or for penalizing an opponent.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.tzaprummy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.tzaprummy.com/</a><br/><br/>",

Most images in the game are signed Carl-B&ouml;rje (real name B&ouml;rje Nilsson, cartoonist and comic magazine editor), the cartoonist who drew the comic, and the whole game could probably be credited to him (given that there is no original gameplay).<br/><br/>The six playing pieces are pictures of main characters from the comic, Pelle Svansl&ouml;s (the hero without tail), Maja Gr&auml;ddnos (his girlfriend), Feta Trisse (fat and smart cat), Elaka M&aring;ns (mean main enemy of Pelle), Frida (the scatter-brained one) and one of the twins Bill and Bull (the funny and dumb duo, sort of like Dupont and Dupond). A few more characters show on the gameboard and on the cover: Tusse Batong (policeman), Gullan fr&aring;n Arkadien (another good-looking girl-cat) and Murre fr&aring;n Skogstibble (farm cat). There are also some anonymous extra cats on the game board. All pictures follow the comic style perfectly, certainly a main feature of the game at the time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An abstract battle game played on Strategic and Tactical Boards. The object of the game is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s castle.<br/><br/>The Tactical Board is a 6x6 grid containing six randomly placed terrain obstacles which block movement. The Strategic Board is a 7x7 grid. The corner squares and center square on the Strategic Board are Towns, and the center square in each player&rsquo;s back row is a Castle.<br/><br/>Both players start with six Armies on the strategic map, one located in the Castle and the other five in the surrounding squares. When opposing Armies occupy the same space on the Strategic Board, they are immediately moved to the Tactical Board for battle. A partition is placed in the center of the Tactical Board so that the battling forces may be set up in secret. The Tactical Battle concludes when one side has no pieces left, or if no pieces can move, or if no further captures can be made by either side, or if ten turns elapse without a capture being made.<br/><br/>Players earn gold from occupied towns. Gold may be used to recruit (purchase) new units.<br/><br/>",

Each defender and structure is worth 1 victory point. The game ends when the last card is drawn from the deck. In a multi-player game, the game ends if all but one player's town is destroyed.&quot; In a solitaire game you win by getting through the deck.<br/><br/>",

Each turn has two phases, a Straggler Phase and an Engagement Phase. The player must use his English raider ships to disperse Spanish stragglers, which are then placed in the player's Victory Pile. The victory conditions set the level of success or failure based on the number of cards in the Victory Pile after the Spanish Armada Deck has been exhausted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ULA is a Finnish acronym meaning &quot;ultra-short wavelength&quot; in relation to radio waves; the English equivalent is VHF or &quot;very high frequency&quot;. The game name Ula-taxi (or Ulataksi) refers to the mode of communication between the taxi drivers and the central taxi station.<br/><br/>The players are taxi drivers in an unnamed city. They draw assignment cards from a deck, take money (the amount depends on which city zone they are in and where they are going) and drive to the address on the card using movement points rolled with a six-sided die. Players decide beforehand whether the game ends for example when someone has completed five assignments or when the last card in the deck has been drawn and the action completed.<br/><br/>During the game, the players are free to choose their routes in the streets, but movement has some restrictions: right-hand side traffic, stop signs, one-way streets etc. Violating the no-stopping sign or speed limits results in a ticket and the player loses money (for example rolling a 5 on a street with a speed limit of 3 means that the player pays 2). There are also tunnels and a ferry which give additional choices. If cars of two players collide, both go to the repair shop and the player who was moving at the time must pay a sum equivalent to the remainder of movement points on the die. Among the assignment cards there are a few cards on car maintenance, vehicle inspection and insurance which require payments and movements to appropriate locations. When the end conditions agreed upon are met, the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>The rules were written in May 1968. The original game board is a paper sheet glued on a thick two-fold cardboard. The city zone payment chart is thin cardboard as are the 70 cards and the small square ferry. The game includes 100 paper banknotes with denominations of one and five. For each player there is a small plastic car and an assignment marker.<br/><br/>The first paragraph of the rules (translated from Finnish): &quot;Ula-taxi is an interesting, surprising and educational game with which you will surely find entertainment. The basic idea of the game is simple, although the abundance of rules may at first feel discomforting. Once the players have become accustomed to the instructions, they will notice that the majority of them is based on general traffic regulations, the knowledge of which is nowadays common among the citizenship.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The players simultaneously play a meld of one hero and one other card from the other seven types.<br/><br/>The players then take turns activating cards in their meld. Depending on the type of card activated, this may allow players to add to their melds, to draw new cards from the deck, or to cause an opponent's card to be discarded.

If all of the players consecutively pass, the round ends and the winner of the round is determined based on the total force value of each player's meld.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to win five rounds.<br/><br/>The designer notes: &quot;I was working on a Heroscape mod and this is where I wound up.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Every issue included a board game inside, with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).<br/><br/>Issue 5 included &quot;Acoso en Nicaragua&quot; which, despite its name (&quot;Pursuit in Nicaragua&quot;), it&acute;s not properly a wargame. The board is a squared one. Each player has a commandant and 36 soldiers (Americans and Sandinistas). Each turn, they move the commandant one square, then places a soldier counter (which can&acute;t never move) trying to immobilize the enemy leader. It&acute;s that simple.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game published with the support of the Government of the City of M&uuml;nster, Germany, with the aim of learning about the city. During the game, players have the opportunity to learn about some historical and touristic aspects of the city and its shops. On each turn a six-sided dice is rolled to determine how many spaces the player&rsquo;s pawn may move along a game-board depicting a simplified map of M&uuml;nster. At certain spaces, cards of the shops can be acquired or the player can go sightseeing by following the instructions written on the back of a card. Such instructions can be only a mere historical/touristic information, sometimes you need to pay or you may earn some money. The game ends when the last player reaches the final space and the winner is who has acquired the most sightseeing and/or shop cards.<br/>Since the game idea was developed by an advertisement agency, other German cities were focused in other similar games (for example, the game related to the city of Paderborn can be found at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/25735\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/25735</a>)<br/><br/>",

And each end contains half an animal.  Each end of the tile can only be matched to one other tile so when you are done, you have one long chain that wraps around to form a rectangle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Isolo (according to Kalumbete also called isumbi) is the name given to three related mancala games played by the Sukuma, in Tanzania. This is the more simple one, the &quot;women's game&quot; (in fact, the girls' game).<br/><br/>The game begins with 2 seeds per hole. (In a 4x8 grid of holes with one of the longer sides facing each player.) On the first game the beginning player is chosen at random. On the following games, it alternates. <br/>Each player controls the two rows closer to her. <br/>Moves are multiple lap. <br/>On her turn the player takes all the seeds from a hole on her side and sows them one by one on the following holes on her side, on a counterclockwise sense. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in an empty hole the move ends. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole not allowing a capture she takes all the seeds on this hole and keeps on sowing another lap. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole of the inner row and on the opponent's facing holes there are any seeds she captures them and sows them in another lap starting on the same hole the capturing lap started. <br/>If on her turn a player can not move (she has no seeds, or all of them are singletons) she has lost the game.&quot;<br/><br/>That is the basic game. An intermediate form is:<br/><br/>&quot;This is the middle (according to difficulty) one, the &quot;boys' game&quot;.<br/><br/>The game begins with a special position&quot; Thesame board as the above but with a non-uniform starting position. 17 seeds start in the pit at the bottom right corner for each player. The adjacent pit in the same row starts with 2 seeds as does each other pit in the same row thereafter. In the middle two rows, pits with an empty pit behind them (i.e., closer to the nearer player) start with 2 seeds and the hole diagonally next to the corner starts wth 1 seed on each side. Other pits start empty.<br/><br/>&quot;On the first game the beginning player is chosen at random. On the following games, it alternates. <br/>Each player controls the two rows closer to him. <br/>General rules<br/>General rules are as those of women's game. <br/>Moves are multiple lap. <br/>On his turn the player takes all the seeds from a hole on his side and sows them one by one on the following holes on his side, on a counterclockwise sense. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in an empty hole the move ends. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole not allowing a capture he takes all the seeds on this hole and keeps on sowing another lap. <br/>If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole of the inner row and in the opponent's facing holes there are any seeds he captures them and sows them in another lap starting on the same hole the capturing lap started. <br/>If on his turn a player can not move (he has no seeds, or all of them are singletons) he has lost the game. <br/>Overture<br/>At the beginning of the game some special rules apply. <br/>Both pits containing 17 seeds are called ng'hana (privileged pits). <br/>During the player's overture (each player overture can last differently) seeds are sowed only on his 14 left most holes, and the contents of the ng'hana can not be captured.<br/><br/>Once a player decides to (or must, as all other pits are empty or singletons) play the ng'hana his overture is over, he sows the seeds on the full board and all his seeds can be captured, from any pit. However, he can not capture the opponent's ng'hana as far as the opponent is still playing his own overture. &quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pachgarhwa was first described in 1906 by E. de M. Humphries, a civil servant appointed as the Sub-divisional Officer at Karwi Sub-division at United Provinces, Northern India (today in the Bandi District of Uttar Pradesh).<br/><br/>No cultural background is given except that it &quot;appears to be more popular than its intrinsic interest would seem to merit&quot;.<br/><br/>A similar games appears to be Longbeu-a-cha in Assam. <br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRulesThe board is made of two rows of five holes.<br/><br/>At the beginning, there are in each hole five pieces made of a material called kankar (presumably a mineral used as a construction material, a calcareous laterite with a high lime content).<br/><br/>Each player controls the holes on her side of the board.<br/><br/>At your turn you take all the pieces from any hole on your side of the board and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each hole. After you have sown them, you take the ones in the next hole and keep on sowing with them.<br/><br/>Your turn ends when you put the last piece of a sowing in a hole followed by an empty one.<br/><br/>If the hole following the empty one is not empty, after a player has finished sowing, he captures its contents.<br/><br/>The winner of a game is the one who captures more seeds.<br/><br/>According to the description the game ends when &quot;all the pieces on the board are exhausted&quot;<br/><br/>This is indeed possible, although it is a rather unusual ending. Humphries failed to explain what would happen if a player has no pieces to distribute, while his opponent has still pieces left in his holes.<br/><br/>Similar games (e.g. Bay Khom, Walak-pussa) include the following rule:<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no legal move and the remaining pieces are captured by his adversary.<br/><br/>The game was played in several rounds, in which holes could be captured, but the exact rules weren't given as &quot;by that time things began to get complicated and I was unable to discover how, if ever, the game ended&quot;.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mancala game. From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Rio_Kadalis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Rio_Kadalis</a>:<br/><br/>Rio Kadalis (&quot;helping a female goat to give birth&quot;) is a mancala game, which is played by the Habr Awal tribe and other clans in Hargheisa and in the Jigjiga area in Somalia. The game was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971. Similar games exist in western Eritrea and in some parts of Ethiopia (Tigre, Shoa), e.g. Lahemay Waladat, Lam Waladach, and Lamosh.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Rio Kadalis is played on a board of two rows of six holes (the Habr Awal also use sometimes just five). There are four stones in each hole at the outset of the game.<br/> On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes anti-clockwise (some Somalis also play clockwise), one at a time, into the following holes.<br/><br/>If the last stone is sown into an occupied hole, its contents are distributed in another lap.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last stone falls into an empty hole or makes a group of four stones, a situation referred to in Somali as binikh (&quot;wasting&quot;).<br/><br/>Any groups of four made during a turn belong to the owner of the row, except a group of four effected by binikh, which is won by the player whose hand it was.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player can't move at his turn. The stones that remain are won by the player on whose side of the board they are.<br/><br/>The player who wins more fours wins the round.<br/><br/>For the next round each player fills his holes with four stones from his winnings. Any holes that could not be filled are closed down with sand, but can be re-opened in a later round.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to close down all the opponent's holes, that is, to reduce his provision to less than four stones.&quot;<br/><br/>Pankhurst, R. 1971.

Training the truck driver to higher levels of his driver's license allows to bid for better paid contracts, containing goods with need for cooling, for example.<br/><br/>Delivery time for the active contract is marked on the turn clock, so that all players see how many turns a player has left to reach his target. If a player manages to move his truck on the map form startpoint to endpoint stated in the contract (movement via d6), he earns money.<br/><br/>In addition to contracts, event cards can be purchased, which allow for certain special actions (like blocking certain countries for all players or promoting a player's driver to next level).<br/><br/>The game ends if either one player manages to deliver a freight to five different European countries pictured on the game's map or after the turn clock reaches a defined point.

The players guess what remainder will be left when the pile is divided by four, and bet upon the result.  The name means &quot;repeatedly spreading out,&quot; and refers to the manner in which the coins or other objects are spread out upon the table.&quot;<br/><br/>The equipment needed to play includes:<br/><br/>The playing mat (called the t'an ching)<br/>Coins, buttons, or something that is numerous and can be spread out<br/>A cup or cover for the coins (called a t'an kun)<br/>A rod used to separate the coins (called a t'an pong)<br/><br/>It takes two people to run the game, One is called the &quot;t'an kun&quot; (ruler of the spreading out) and the other one is called the &quot;ho kun&quot; who acts as a cashier.<br/><br/>Culin writes that the game is believed to have been invented by Kwan Chung, a renowned statesmen of antiquity who died in 645BC. Culin also mentions the likelihood that the game was invented for soldiers as a way for them to pass the time in camp.<br/><br/>This game is identical to the Phillipine game Capona.<br/><br/>",

When your opponent sees that he's up, he can stop, play out his turn, flip the square, and go on about his business.<br/><br/>This feature justifies the magnetic aspect of the game.

BrainBox games will teach your children basic geography facts in a way that makes them eager to play; when have you ever been able to say that about flashcards?<br/><br/>BrainBox games develop both short and long term memory by challenging children to recall what they saw. Players study a game card for 10 seconds trying to memorize a variety of features such as surrounding countries or states, flag colors, famous landmarks, historical figures, and so forth. A die is rolled and if the player can answer the corresponding question, the card is his. Play until one child has won a set amount of cards or play until all cards are acquired. With 55 cards and 10 questions per card, this is a painless way to learn 550 geography facts. Designed for readers, but pre-readers do not have to be left out; just adapt the questions to their level.<br/><br/>Players with the most points win.<br/><br/>",

(1 is a knockout on 8) If it's 2 steps higher it's a knock and if they are equal it's a clinch.

After a knockout the victim must remove all markers in that row, after a knock you don't put down a marker and if there is a clinch no player marks. It is also possible to win if you successfully ask for a knockout before the numbers are revealed. If it's not a knockout then that player that asked looses.

        "description": "&quot;A game of adventure with Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest&quot; - also known as &quot;ROBIN HOOD GAME OF ADVENTURE&quot;<br/><br/>This is a very simple spin and move game produced in the UK in the 1950s by Bell Toys. The game is far too luck driven for repeated plays - but it has superb production values, including 3d features (the Target, Deer and Treasury) and a wonderfully illustrated board.<br/><br/>The game is for 2-4 players. Each player chooses a corner of the board, which is used to hold the players pegs (&quot;arrows&quot;) and any money that the player wins.<br/><br/>Each player takes a member of Robin Hood's band (Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck, Little John or Maid Marian) and places them at the &quot;Start&quot; square. Each player then uses the spinner in centre of the board; instead of numbers, the spinner points to different coloured squares, Each players playing piece is then moved around the board to the next relevant coloured square,<br/><br/>When a player lands on a square with instructions on, they must be obeyed. Players crossing Treasury Road collect one coin from the Treasury.<br/><br/>If any player lands on a square with a target on it, all players proceed to the Archery ground for an Archery contest. Each player has 3 shots (spins of the central spinner) in succession, their pegs (&quot;arrows&quot;) are placed in the target according to the colour indicated by the spinner. The player with the highest score collects a coin from each of the other players.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a square with an arrow then that player must pay one coin to the players nearest to them on the board.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a square marked &quot;Golden Chance&quot; they spin the central spinner to determine the result:<br/><br/>- if spinner points at the Treasury collect 2 coins<br/>- if spinner points at a Name collect 1 coin<br/>- if spinner points at the Deer lose 2 coins to the Treasury<br/>- if spinner points at the Target an Archery contest takes place<br/><br/>If a player runs out of coins to pay a forfeit they miss a turn.<br/><br/>If a player lands in &quot;Go to London&quot; they collect a coin from the Treasury.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to collect 10 coins and reach the &quot;Go to London&quot; square.<br/><br/>",

One player or team will be up at bat, controlling a switch to move players via vibrations from an electric motor.  The other player will be pitching and fielding.<br/><br/>Pitching is done via a spring loaded accessory.  Using the accessory you fling a magnet onto a pitching board.  The board has labels for strikes, fouls, ball, balks, wild pitches and a batter.  The batter then hits the board trying to accurately guess where the magnet landed.  They use a spring loaded paddle to try to propel the magnet onto the main board or on the outfield board.  Once the ball is hit the motor is turned on and plastic playing pieces then wiggle their way to the next base.  Simultaneously, the pitcher tries to use the fielding device to throw the magnet to the correct base.<br/><br/>The rules indicate you can play with teams up to 9 per side (just like real baseball), but head to head would likely provide the best games.<br/><br/>A very neat game which is part of the Tru-Action line which included football, sports car racing, baseball, basketball and horse racing.<br/><br/>",

The game is played in real time using a timer or stopwatch.<br/><br/>Once the game has begun players may not touch the ball with their hands, except to return balls which go out of bounds. Scoring is the same as in basketball.<br/><br/>The board is a piece of sheet metal with 19 indented holes.  A plastic basketball is used as well.<br/><br/>The ball is placed in the center hole and players then use spring controlled flippers to lift a metal tab which propels the ball into the air.  The ball will then roll around on the board until it stops on an indent.  The corresponding player will then use the flipper to try to score goals.<br/><br/>The board also includes wire boards which are elevated above the magnetic board.<br/><br/>This game is a wonderful and unique design.<br/><br/>On a side note, Lew Alcindor changed his name (after converting to Islam) to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  He is widely regarded as one of the best players in professional basketball and won numerous awards during his lifetime.<br/><br/>",

Use all the lures and hooks you can to turn that prospect into a buyer and move that inventory. Sucker is a fast paced family oriented game that starts with an exciting auction, and continues as you try to sell more cars than your competitors.<br/><br/>During the auction phase, each player tries to get the most inventory from the used car auction. Then the players choose their sales strategies, everything from free trips to low down dirty tricks are at your disposal. And finally you use those strategies to steal customers from your opponents and make the deal. The one who can move the most inventory wins the game.<br/><br/>This game gets really intense when you have 5-8 players. It is fully playable with only 3 players, but when you have 5 or more, the auctions become really intense, and that's when you can start seeing some real wheeling and dealing heat up.<br/><br/>",

The spin of the compass is used to find a good direction and the die decides the distances the player can go on the map grid. Movement is restricted that the players cannot walk over the lakes, marshes or planted fields on the map.<br/><br/>The game was produced in cooperation with the Finnish Orienteering Federation, and dates probably from the early 1980s.<br/><br/>",

The planets were built on wooden platforms an connected to the base-plate via wooden pegs. The game was handcrafted, and hand-painted, all the cards, rules, and names were invented for the occasion.<br/><br/>The army pieces were made from broomsticks (round pieces), and the others by sawing rectangular rods. Rocks were glued to the surface of the board and elevations were made from insulation foam. Electric illumination from toy railroads were added later, the pictures added here are from the candle - sun phase.<br/><br/>If players were eliminated, they received the ability to control a non-player character, who would occupy a certain space (i.e. planetary system) that could not be reached by any player, and could continue harassing the best players.<br/>Army pieces were allowed to move so long as they successfully conquered a new territory, making the game travel fast, and allowing boxed-in plaers to quickly gain territory on their round. Refreshments (new armies) were doled out on two methods (agreed upon in advance). Once, with more and more armies each time, and one depending on what the player offered the non-player characters (in terms of cards).<br/><br/>It never left this conceptual design phase, but allowed us several years of extreme gaming fun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Last Hurrah covers the Denikin's last successful counterattack of the Russian Civil War in February, 1920. After months of constant retreats and loss, the Don River offered a respite. Even though the river was partially frozen, crossing proved difficult for either side except at one of the four bridges which span it. Weather and time also proved to be a friend of Denikin one last time, as both sides had to fight freezing temperatures and slowed the rapid advance of the Red Army chasing them into Rostov, a small city at the time. Much of the Red forces that reached the city were to too small and the main body of the army was still several days away.<br/><br/>Denikin pulled his forces back to Bataisk and dug in and by the time the Red lead elements arrived, the Reds found themselves in a much weaker position because Denikin had gathered his units. Denikin planned for a quick offensive, one to retake Rostov and hopefully beyond to buy additional time before the inevitable. Retaking Rostov would also be a desperately needed morale boost. Thus, he gathered his last available Mk V tanks, aircraft, and reinforced his elite Volunteer Army. He suddenly struck, completely taking the Red units by surprise, routing many. Within a day or so, he entered Rostov, and pushed onto the suburbs along the fringe. The reversal was complete. Stunning. Morale rose. But, like the Germans and the Ardennes in 1944, the weight of the Red army was felt once it arrived. Bitter fighting in Rostov set the city on fire as the Whites fell back across the banks of the Don. It was their last hurrah!<br/><br/>The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules. The map scale is about one mile per hex. Each combat unit is one battalion\\brigade for non-AFV units. For Tanks ,Armor cars Aircraft, each counter is one AFV\\AC. A game turn represents several hours of time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A dice and cards tennis 'simulation'. Although it seems to only have been published in 2009, the copyright on the rules is 1985, and the approach of the tennis game (a good serve is always followed by the server going to the net for a volley, for example) dates from that era.<br/><br/>The 'basic' game is a D6 dice game, with no skill involved. The throw for the serve decides whether it is an ace, a fault, or in play resulting in either a groundstroke rally or the server at the net. Subsequent shots in the rally can be winners or faults, change the positions of the players (at the net or baseline) or keep them as is. There are slightly differing shot results for each die roll, depending on the positioning of the players, and what sort of shot is played (passing shot or lob when the opponent is at the net, smash or volley when you are at the net).<br/><br/>The 'advanced' game follows the same format as the dice game, but allows players to have cards that can be used instead of a throw of the dice. The number of these cards is limited, so there is some player judgement as to when best to play them, or roll the die. 3 Cards are given when serving (presumably so the server usually has more cards than the receiver, and thus an advantage) and 1 card for the winner of each game.

        "description": "Two players are playing a football match. There are four rows of numbers on the board, and each player has number chips. One player starts an attack by secretly choosing two chips which have a result (there are different sets for addition, subtraction etc.) that is on one of the fields in the first row of the board. The opponent does the same. If they reach the same result, the attack is stopped, the other player attacks and both players take back their chips. If not, the attack proceeds to the second row, etc. If the attack isn't stopped by the fourth row, the attacking player can try to flip the ball chip into the defending player's goal, thus scoring a goal. Whoever has scored more goals at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The goal for the sub player is to escape the board with the mother sub, while the other player tries to eliminate it.<br/><br/>There are a few differences from the usual tafl beside the obvious elongated playing field. By default, pieces can only move one step at a time; rook movement is an optional rule. Some tiles allow the submarine player to photograph &quot;defense installations&quot;, which forces the other player to remove a destroyer from the board. At some points around the edges of the board it's possible (rather arbitrarily) to move diagonally.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A collection of rules, game boards and numerous bits for playing twelve different educational games, all with a focus on early childhood mathematics. While designed for home use by parents, many of the games in the kit are also suitable for classroom use with larger groups. The rules booklet and each game includes an introductory section about the purpose of the collection and each game. The games included in the kit are as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     Coin Exchange (Money Cube Game 1) -- A two player game using play money and two special dice, each marked with 2 pennies, 2 nickles and 2 dimes. Players simply roll the dice and collect money from the bank. The winner is the player with the most money when the bank runs out of dimes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Concentration with Number Cards and Dominoes -- A two player game using a special deck of numbered cards (0 through 9) and 10 dominoes from a standard set that have a total of 0 to 9 pips. The cards and dominoes are shuffled and arranged in a face-down tableau, and the players take turns flipping over one card and one tile, collecting matching sets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Disappearing Train -- A two to four player board game a special board, 16 counters for each player and a special die with sides -1, -2, -3 and +3, with two other blank sides. Players make trains out of 12 of their counters and remove counters from the train according to the die roll, but the player has to roll a positive number to begin and an exact number to end. The game ends when a player collects 12 counters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Double-Digit Dice Game -- A game using two special dice, one marked 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the other marked 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0. Players roll both dice in turn and try to make the largest two digit base ten number. A suggested variation is to go for the smallest number. It could also be played as a press-your-luck game. It's suggested for two to four players, but any number can play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     High Roller -- A simple dice game suggested for two to four players, but any number can play. In turn, players roll two regular six-sided dice, then re-roll the lower, keeping track of their score. This is for the youngest players who are just learning how to count pips. The highest score after two rounds wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Matching Coin Game -- A game about matching coins rolled on a special die showing pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters, and placing them into the correct segments of a money tray. It's suggested for four or five players, but any number could play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Monster Squeeze Game -- A two player guessing / deduction game using a special board and monster figures to keep track of high and low guesses on a number line. Each player in turn thinks of a number from 0 to 10 and the other makes guesses, moving the monsters until the number is guessed correctly. Fewest guesses to get the number wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     One-Dollar Game -- A two player game where the object is to be able to collect enough change to be able to exactly exchange for a dollar. Players collect coins according to a special die with coins on the faces, making change for larger coins along the way. A special board helps players keep track of things.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Paper Money Exchange Game (Money Cube Game 2) -- A two player game where the object is to be the first to collect $100 by collecting bills shown on a special die, making change for larger bills along the way. A board helps players keep track of things, and variations are given for collecting $1000 and adding another special die.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Plus or Minus Game -- A territorial game played on a checkers board (included in the kit). Players roll a special die with faces -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3, placing or subtracting counters from the board. Suggested for 2 players, it could be played by up to four.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Spin a Number (1-10) -- A simple spin and move race game played with a single counter for each player on a track board. Suggested for 2 to 5 players, but any number could play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Top-It -- A two player card game similar to &quot;War&quot; played with a special numbered deck. The object is to either get the most or fewest cards after one trip through the deck.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the introductions:<br/><br/>MAGICAL BATTLIONS [sic] is a rule system for fantasy miniature battles.  It assigns figures factors by a process of measurement and judgment to reflect the capabilities depicted by the pieces themselves.  Figures are moved as individuals; no special stands or formations are required.  Play takes place on boards comprised of hexagons or squares; a list of terrain features and effects is provided.  The system is best suited for skirmishes involving 10 to 200 figures.  Any number of players can participate either as teams or in a free-for-all.  There is no need for referees.  The length of play and the area needed for play depend on the number of figures and players involved; a battle between two players' armies of 50 figures apiece would easily fit on a card table and probably last 2 to 4 hours.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the first player to win balls in this order 1=red, 2=blue, 3=yellow, 4=red or blue, 5=red or blue (whichever was not won in the 4th position.)<br/><br/>This game also plays another version called Merry-Go-Round. This game plays the same, but does not require the balls to be won in any specific sequence.<br/><br/>",

In the affective domain, the students will have fun learning what it often considered a difficult subject.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get two runs of three and four cards representing the sequential (deep to superficial) order of the five main anatomical components composing each suit. The dealer deals seven cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed face down and the top card is turned over to begin the discard stack. Moving clockwise from the dealer, the first player chooses either the discarded card or a card from the face down pile. The player determines which cards to keep and discards the extra card. The first player to create two runs of three and four cards places the cards down and must name three structures (e.g., three bones, three muscles) represented on each card. The other players refer to a reference sheet that indicates all the structures on each card to ascertain whether the player is correct. If the player cannot name at least three structures on each card, the player subtracts 1 point from his or her score for each card on which he or she failed to name three structures. The player with the winning hand adds the value of the cards laid down, subtracts the points for any unnamed structures and adds the total to his or her score. The players with the losing hands add the value of their cards and subtract it from their scores. The game is over when a player reaches a predetermined score.

        "description": "Talisman Quests: Rainforest is an unofficial expansion that is compatible with both 2nd &amp; 4th edition Talisman and is my largest print &amp; play project completed to date.  It was created to address a problem my friends saw with two official cards: The Pool of Wisdom and the Pool of Strength.  Whenever these two cards came into play, those with characters closest to the cards benefit greatly letting them to pull away in the game.<br/>      This expansion comes into play when either of the cards mentioned above come into play.  Players now have to enter the Rainforest board and follow one of several paths to the pools in order to gain its benefits.  Now players have to think about the time it takes to do the quest versus staying closer to the Crown of Command.<br/>     <br/>   Talisman Quests includes:<br/><br/>Rule book in PDF format, Two playing board images, One full sized jpeg for large format printing, 9 Letter sized jpegs for home printers, 60 Quest cards to challenger adventurers, 30 Curses cards for those who offend the gods, 2 New Characters and Character Cards (The Conquistador &amp; Cannibal Warrior), 24 New Purchase Cards, 4 Special Cards (Two Large Legend Cards, One Retreat Card, One Gibbering Horror).<br/><br/>Talisman Quests is designed by Scott &quot;Fenris&quot; Davenport and is self-published under Wolf Creek Games.

        "description": "Players play from a hand of cards which have creatures with attributes that are based on the properties of the elements on the periodic table. Each player is trying to collect the largest army, there is no actual fighting in the base game but this is planed for adding into future expansions.<br/>The top card of the draw pile is turned over, and each player tried to win that card to their army by playing a card from their hand that can match to that card and also using their standard multiplier cards that they can keep and reuse in the game. The winning player, which is determined by the actually chemical reactivity printed on the card, adds wining pair of cards to his army, and the loser takes the card they played back into their hand. The winner then draws back their hand to starting number and reveals the next card off the draw deck to win.<br/>When the entire draw deck is emptied players can attempt to combine cards from their had and if that is possible can then add them to their army. The winner is the player with the largest army.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The ELEMENTAURS were originally created as nanorobots but through a fortuitous accident in a bioreactor these synthesised beings took on a life of their own. They are living beings who have much to offer the human race. They can teach us many things, give us gifts, help us solve problems and defeat our enemies. Neither good nor bad, tame nor wild, they take on some of the personality of the human who releases them.<br/><br/>ELEMENTAURS BOOT CAMP is an exciting new card game with adventures on a subatomic level. In this game you meet the first eighteen of the ELEMENTAURS. You learn which clans they belong to, how they might behave and, most importantly, how to recruit them to your team.<br/><br/>ELEMENTAURS BOOT CAMP may be played at many different levels, depending on the age and ability of the players. From the simplest games through to the challenging COMBAT COMBOS there is something for everyone. And after the games are played, just looking at the cards is an enlightening experience. There is much to be learned and laughed about in the images and text on each of the cards as you decide which is your favourite ELEMENTAUR.<br/><br/>This starter deck is just the beginning as there are 92 ELEMENTAUR creatures to meet. Soon the next series of 18 will be released along with enemy, challenge and rare cards in packs of 10. There is also a series of books that will be published telling about the creation of the ELEMENTAURS and the adventures of a group of children in their quest to release them.<br/><br/>",

The little ghost is hiding somewhere in the box, and the policeman is searching for it, peering into each manhole with a modicum of fear in his heart, waiting to feel the spectre push cold fingers through his forehead and whisk his cerebellum into a frothy pink smoothie.<br/><br/>Ha ha, you believed that? No, the little ghost &ndash; should he be under the manhole upon which the policeman stands &ndash; will blow off his cap. If you, the player, have been wise enough to be the one who placed the policeman on that manhole, you receive a reward chip. The box is then shaken vigorously in order to spirit the ghost away to some other manhole and await for the policeman's attention there. The first player to blow a cop's hat off five times wins.<br/><br/>",

Try to place your own Pods and beware of your opponents feet.<br/><br/>Pods are tiny animals, living in the darkness of unknown caverns. They are made of a head and some feet  (bipod have 2 feet, tripod: 3 ... octopod:8). A foot may be small: a foot for walking (controls 1 square forward) or big: a foot for running (controls the aligned squares forward).<br/><br/>Players alternate turns and place their pods in the cavern (a 7x7 grid) but have to deal with the Pods 'way of life': respect your opponent tiny space. So each foot of any pod can never threat a square occupied by an enemy pod. When a player is unable to enter a new pod in the cavern, he loses the game.<br/><br/>In the advanced rules, the pods may move on the board an threat their enemies ... if a pod has no longer a foot able to walk, he dies and is removed from the board. Players then have to enter their 14 pods into the cavern to win.<br/><br/>",

Players throw their fishing lines into the water and try to catch the colorful sea animals with their fishing rods. For added fun, sea animals also link to each other so you can catch a bunch in one try. The player who catches the most sea animals wins!<br/><br/>Components:<br/>2 fishing rods, 10 assorted sea animals (2 goldfish, 2 sharks, 2 octopus, 2 starfish and 2 lobsters). The animals float to allow for play in or out of water. The sea animals are placed in between the two players.<br/><br/>There are four ways to play:<br/><br/>For younger players - both players try to fish for the sea animals at the same time. They must hook an animal with the fishing rod and bring it out of the water in order to retrieve it. The player who collects the most animals wins.<br/><br/>For older players:<br/><br/>Links - players fish for the sea animals, trying to link as many of them as possible until all have been collected. The player with the most sea animals linked together wins.<br/><br/>Collect-A-Set - players fish, trying to catch one of every type of sea animal. The first player to collect a complete set wins.<br/><br/>High Score - some sea animals are easier to catch than others because they have more arms, legs, tails and fins. Each animal has a different point value: starfish &amp; octopus are worth 5 points; goldfish &amp; shark are worth 10 points; lobster is worth 20 points. The player with the most points when all animals have been collected wins.<br/><br/>",

If he obtains it he may continue asking until he asks for a card which the player asked does not hold. The right of asking in then transferred to him and he in the same way continues to ask till in like manner disqualified. When any player has obtained all the cards of a set forming the complete proverb, he turns them up on the table.

The player to the left of the dealer estimates how many tricks he thinks he can take, and the highest bidder may substitute any or all of the 4 cards in the center for his 4 lowest cards.  Taking the four lowest cards from his hand he lays them down in front of him as one trick and then leads a card.  Each of the other players in turn plays a higher card if possible and the one who plays the card with the highest number takes the trick. The winner then leads a card from his hand.  If the highest bidder doesn't get the number of tricks he bid, he will have that amount deducted from his score.  All other players get one point for each trick they take.  The first player to get 50 points wins the game.<br/><br/>The miniature cards have illustrations on them from Pinocchio.  The instructions are written on the back of the box.  The cards range in number from 1 to 11 with fewer cards for each number as the number increases:<br/><br/>7 copies of #1 featuring Monstro<br/>6 copies of #2 featuring Lampwick<br/>6 copies of #3 featuring The Coachman<br/>5 copies of #4 featuring Stromboli<br/>5 copies of #5 featuring Fox and Cat<br/>4 copies of #6 featuring Figaro<br/>4 copies of #7 featuring Cleo<br/>4 copies of #8 featuring Jiminy Cricket<br/>4 copies of #9 featuring Geppetto<br/>2 copies of #10 featuring The Blue Fairy<br/>1 copy of #11 featuring Pinocchio<br/><br/>The illustrations are copyright W.D.P.

Players start with four scoops in hand, a spinner determines how many scoops can be played out of the players hand, players draw back up to four, and play passes to the left. The &ldquo;melt&rdquo; position on the spinner requires a player to return an already played scoop, and &ldquo;steal a scoop&rdquo; cards let players steal scoops from others.

(translation: Furniture Moving, or: How did the toaster get in the bedroom?) was produced by Ravensburger for Ikea, which presumably sold it in their stores at one time.<br/><br/>In the game, players move around a board and collect cards showing items of furniture and accessories (e.g., lamps) which belong in one of four rooms. Having at least three adjacent cards from a single room allows a player to &quot;open&quot; that room, at which point they start moving around a smaller, altered track and have exclusive rights to their room. When someone gets all eight cards for their room the game is over and the winner is the one whose cards are worth the most points.<br/><br/>Additional details include joker cards and the use of a second set of cards to remove furniture from other players' rooms.<br/><br/>",
