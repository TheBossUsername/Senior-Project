Italy and Germany quickly backed the Fascist Nationalists, as the Soviet Union rallied behind the Communist-Socialist-Anarchist Republicans. Meanwhile England, with a reluctant France, desperately sought to keep war from expanding. Shattered Armada features 22 scenarios describing battles that actually did occur, &quot;could have&quot; battles with combatants who were close enough to fight; and &quot;what if&quot; battles drawn from war plans and journals. From shore batteries and minefields to battleships and gunboats, players will re-live the role of Spanish navies as they contend with each other and warships of the Great Powers, as war at sea reveals Spain's ultimate fate.

A petty, jealous and vicious example of Skaven cunning, he ensured that no other player would be created to rival him by killing any Clan Rigens experiment or creation that looked like a potential equal.<br/><br/>Now, given the sheer amount of time spent ensuring the demise of any Skaven who look able to rival him, you might think that Hakflem Skuttlespike neglects his duties on the hallowed Blood Bowl pitch. Not so! With this bizarre, two-headed resin kit, you can field him as a Star Player in any Skaven team you choose. Furious, muscular and bedecked with spiky bits, he is posed in an appropriately aggressive manner, both of his sharply toothed maws likely shrieking unintelligible threats at whichever poor opponent is in the way. Each of his four (count &lsquo;em!) hands is ready to kill, with metal gloves and a spiked ball among the turmoil. There&rsquo;s even space for some Skaven symbols on his armour.<br/><br/>This resin kit comprises 10 components, and includes two 32mm round bases, one featuring a hole to slot a ball into, indicating possession of the ball in your games of Blood Bowl.<br/><br/>",

Use these maps&mdash;-and your dog-&mdash;to dig up mysterious treasures all over Fantastiqa! A new Victory Cup Quest is also added to the game (more on this exciting Quest below...)<br/><br/>Fantastiqa is required for you to play.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    12 Treasure Map cards (2 for each Region)<br/>    14 Mystery Tokens (see details below)<br/>    12 +1 Point Bonus Tokens<br/><br/><br/>Summary:<br/>At the beginning of the game, one Treasure Map card is hidden face-down underneath the Quest Goal card. This Treasure Map indicates the Region where the Victory Cup is located--a final Quest required for victory!<br/><br/>During the game, one Treasure Map card is always visible as an Open Quest for any player to fulfill. To fulfill a Treasure Map Quest, a player must travel to the Region showing on the Treasure Map and dig there (using his &quot;Dig Dog&quot;). On doing this, the player claims one +1 Point Bonus Token and one Mystery Token (see below). The Treasure Map card is discarded face-up at the bottom of the Treasure Map deck and a new Treasure Map card is displayed on top (reshuffle as needed).<br/><br/>When one player reaches the Quest Goal, the Victory Cup Quest tucked beneath the Quest Goal is revealed, face-up, for all to see. The first player who fulfills both of the following conditions wins the game: a) the player&rsquo;s score meets or exceeds the Quest Goal, and b) the player uses a &ldquo;Dig&rdquo; symbol (on his Dog card) to unearth the Victory Cup from the Region showing on the card.<br/><br/>List of Mystery Tokens:<br/><br/><br/>    Artifact: Draw one Artifact from the top of the Artifact deck and claim it for free. Immediately add it to your hand.<br/>    Beast: Draw one Beast from the Beast deck and claim it for free. Immediately add it to your hand.<br/>    Flying Carpet: Fly to any adjacent Region over a marked road. (Just like a regular Magic Carpet token.)<br/>    Magic Compass: Travel to any Region diagonally adjacent to your own (i.e., across the terrain occupied by an Open Quest card).<br/>    Pocket Portal: Teleport to any Region.<br/>    Potion of Persuasion: Use the potion to subdue any adjacent Creature while Adventuring (move your Adventurer as usual). Immediately add this Creature to your hand.<br/>    Secret Stash: The token is worth 4 Gems. These Gems do not count against you when the Mischievous Raven appears or when other players use Artifacts like the Rogue&rsquo;s Purse. They cannot be stolen by the Mischievous Raven or by other players. Use these Gems just like regular Gems when purchasing items. No change is given.<br/><br/><br/>",

Everything went according to plan until five regiments landed and Davion engineers discovered a real Star League installation.

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>Floating down from the dark early-morning skies of Normandy, American soldiers taught the world a new synonym for courage: Airborne. Landing on 6 June 1944, these paratroopers would fight for the next 33 days and go on to represent their country in the victory parade through the ruins of Berlin.<br/><br/>Airborne is a book supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series. It contains 35 scenarios set in the Normandy countryside: 20 of them from the long-out-of-print boxed game, 14 new ones by Mike Perryman, and one mega-scenario by Patrick Callahan. Plus the usual background material.<br/><br/>Airborne includes a mapboard, but no playing pieces. Players will need playing pieces and some maps from Elsenborn Ridge and Battle of the Bulge; a few scenarios also use boards or pieces from 1940 - The Fall of France and Edelweiss.<br/><br/>Airborne is sold in both print and digital editions. The digital edition does not include a map<br/><br/>",

Players take charge of Japan or the Qing Dynasty and fight for control of the Korean Peninsula, Liaodong Peninsula, Shandong Peninsula, and Penghu Islands. Alternatively, the Japanese Army can challenge the Zhili decisive battle.<br/><br/>As with historical facts, the Navy has a big role to play in games. At that time, the infrastructure was not well-developed, and it was the transport vessels that could most efficiently carry large numbers of troops and supplies, and command of the sea was needed to secure maritime transport. How will the Combined Fleet challenge the Beiyang Fleet, which has the battleships Dingyuan and Zhenyuan, which were called the strongest ships in the Orient? And how will the Japanese Army capture the fortress of Lushun and Weihaiwei?<br/><br/>The game system of this game is called card-driven, and makes full use of cards that represent war resources and historical events and tactics. But more important than how to use the card is a &quot;strategy&quot; that looks at how to end the war.<br/><br/>",

You can solve the puzzles that unlock the base&rsquo;s secrets using logic, or you can try to recover your lost memories for clues.<br/><br/>Choices<br/><br/>Whatever you decide, your actions change the world around you and determine the encounters you face next. Every game you play will be different &ndash; and you will need all of your skills to survive.<br/><br/>Theme of The World Reborn:<br/><br/>More than four centuries have passed since the Devastation engulfed the Earth. The species that remained were fused and reborn in the alchemy of atomic fire. Now their diverse descendants have claimed the planet. You are an agent of the Midnight Legion, tasked with preserving life and rebuilding civilization. Only one other agent remains, and she is somewhere ahead of you, racing for your last remaining base. Unless you can reach it before she does, she will seize the command center and use its ancient weapons to unleash a second Devastation. This time, if she succeeds, nothing will survive. Your chase will lead you to new creatures, lost technologies and possibly even the clues your adversary leaves behind. But beware&mdash;there are no established paths across this constantly shifting land, and nothing is what it seems.<br/><br/>",

Can you find out what happened to her before the police search party arrives and inspects your island?<br/><br/>Masters of Crime: Rapture is a co-operative deductive murder mystery game in which players must solve puzzles, follow clues and make decisions to solve a case. They do this using the included deck of cards, twelve hidden realistic clue documents, and the Internet. Through a choose-your-own-adventure mechanism, players make decisions that influence the course of the game and lead to solving the case in the end. One by one, they enter different realistically designed locations and encounter the various suspects. Then they choose from three different ways to deal with the situation and receive points based on their decisions. Complex puzzles and escape room elements must be solved in order to progress further in the case.<br/><br/>The game is closely intertwined with the real world, and players have to keep using traditional apps like Google Maps or Wikipedia to gather information. Email, detailed web pages, and cell phone calls are also part of the immersive gaming experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Flickin' Cars With Guns is a tabletop dexterity game for 2 or more players playable in as little as 10 minutes. Players use diecast toy cars (like Hot Wheels or Matchbox) to represent armed vehicles. The goal is to destroy your opponents by shooting and crashing into them.<br/><br/>The game is meant to be played on a standard kitchen table, and you can use household items as obstacles and terrain. A 4'x3' table littered with plates, cups, and bowls is pretty standard. In fact playing a quick game after dinner, before cleaning up the table, is one of the funnest approaches.<br/><br/>Each turn the player &quot;flicks&quot; their car twice and shoots once. The act of flicking is where the physical skill and challenge of the game come in. Crashing into an obstacle hurts your car, and accidentally flicking off the table is penalized as well, so players have to be careful.<br/><br/>Shooting is done by rolling 2D6 with a to-hit target number equal to the number of inches to your target. So if your opponent is 8&quot; away you need 8+ to hit. Double damage on double 6s, and shots always miss on double 1s.<br/><br/>There are several variants and optional rules that can be bolted onto this core system, such as droppable weapons, demolition derby mode, a drinking game, stunt bonuses, power ups, using playing cards, etc. to ensure plenty of longevity and suitability for all types of players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A storm has blown through the sleepy, fairy-tail hamlet of Ewetopia, releasing the sheep from their barns and now they&rsquo;ve all congregated into a massive, mixed-up herd in the middle of the valley! Players step into the role of village farmers, who must use their feisty canine companions to help them herd back the lost flocks.<br/><br/>Ewetopia is charming, fast-paced, easily-to-learn, and hard-to-master. With warm, friendly graphics that have appeal for kids, it will also appeal to older audiences with it&rsquo;s deceptively tactical game play: A strong denial game, board control, and a playing field that can change with every turn means Ewetopia enjoy plenty of play-time with old and young alike.<br/><br/>Players command their trusty dog around a 5x5 grid filled with tiles containing numerically ranked sheep, pushing rows and columns of them, adding the tiles that get pushed off the grid to their collection. The dogs are very fast and will always move at least 2 squares during their turn, so although they can be made to change direction after their 1st move, they can&rsquo;t then move back into the square they just came from: Players will need to plan their turn to avoid collecting the wrong tiles or ending up out-of-position.<br/><br/>Opponents&rsquo; dogs can&rsquo;t be pushed and will create obstacles on the board, but if this happens, or if a player wants to create a better move for themselves, fences can be built in the way of the charging sheep, diverting their path in a direction of the player's choice. Since these fences remain in the ground until the end of the game --and act the same for every player-- the result is a maze-like meadow where creative, zigzag moves aren&rsquo;t just possible, but become the norm.<br/><br/>Adding to the brain-twisting mix are special tiles, including:<br/>Motivating Bones: When collected, can be consumed at any time to &ldquo;motivate&rdquo; a dog to move an extra square. Useful to push your dog to get a rare sheep, or to force an opponent to make tough choice if their dog is in a bad position.<br/>Wild Sheep: A mythical breed with technicolor wool, these sheep can count as any rank at the end of the game, making them especially versatile.<br/>Wolves: A snarky, stenchy wolf-pack have sneakily donned sheep costumes in order to blend into the herd. Their own rank, having them at the end of the game will reduce your score by stinking up your other sheep&rsquo;s wool.<br/>Wood Carts: Contains enough lumber to build an additional fence on the board when traded in, and may be used immediately after being collected.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, points are awarded based on sizes of unbroken, numerical sequences AND sets of same-ranked sheep, allowing players to pursue different paths to victory if their original plans are foiled. Point values scale logarithmically with size, meaning a single big set or sequence will always be better than several smaller ones. After separating their sheep into the largest sets and/or sequences possible, totaling their values --and subtracting points for wolves-- the player with the highest score is the victor!<br/><br/>",

When a new wave spawns, modifiers are added to the shadows that make them more powerful as the game goes on.<br/><br/>Players defend their crystal (represented by a set of tiles at one end of the board) using guardians, each of which have unique movement types and abilities. All Guardians can attack by rolling a six sided die, but their special abilities make them suited to different roles. Some guardians can lay traps for shadows to fall into, others can heal allies, others focus on damage and maneuverability. While these are powerful, they are also limited, so you must use them strategically. Try to manipulate the board to slow down enemies and maximize your damage.<br/><br/>Abilities and shadow modifiers are determined randomly at the start of the game,so every game is going to play a little differently.<br/><br/>Additionally, while the game is focus on cooperative play, it also includes a 2 player competitive mode in which both players defend their own crystals from each other.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A British loss in the Great Lakes could have easily meant Canada would be part of the United States today.<br/><br/>During each turn each player receives action points plus random action points to activate his units for movement and combat. During combat each unit rolls dice and scores hits on opponent units.  Careful planning is required not to get trapped.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by occupation of key terrain features and elimination of enemy units.<br/><br/>Due to the randomness of the action points no two games play the same.  For this reason the game plays great solitaire (no solo engine - but by playing both sides).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lasalle is a tactical Napoleonics game suitable for beginners or veterans in which any army can fight any other or you can play historical scenarios. Players are a division or corps commander leading battalions of infantry, batteries of artillery and regiments of cavalry. A game is an affair for about three hours&rsquo; play on a modest table with about a dozen units on each side with no paperwork other than marking disruption against a unit's track.<br/><br/>The second edition has a new sequence of play, driven by momentum and interrupts, allows players to do virtually anything in any order, differently every turn. Completely new rules for the use of the general figure (i.e. &ldquo;you&rdquo;) permit you to choose the personality and effect of your intervention in the sequence. Skirmishing has been reinvented from the top-down. The two sides contribute skirmishers to their opposing &ldquo;screens&rdquo; and each turn they determine which side&rsquo;s screen has the advantage. That, in turn, affects the momentum and sequence, not to mention possibly preventing worn units from rallying, obscuring targets from shooters, or even sniping at infantry units as they try to change formations. Movement has been radically simplified. Rather than worrying about evolutions of individual units, movement gets you from point A to B with a certain number of &ldquo;complications&rdquo; that accrue as you try to do difficult things like changing formation near the enemy, moving through difficult terrain, interpenetrating, or attacking. Combat has been redesigned so that it is a more decisive either/or experience. Troops either press an attack home, or they are discouraged and fall back with few casualties to either side.<br/><br/>Second Edition Lasalle is a much more holistic game where you are playing not just individual units but rather an entire military effort, and everything affects everything else. You control the sequence and pace of events while your opponent tries to wrest that control from you. What your soldiers can accomplish is not just the result of moving them and rolling dice, but part of the overall situation into which you&rsquo;ve led your army.<br/><br/>",

When you're targeted (or even when you're not), you can respond by playing defenses, bouncing back Treacheries or Cursed Gifts, guarding yourself, or even sneakily stealing cards and swapping Cursed areas.<br/><br/>The possibilities for fun and mischief are endless in this light-hearted game.

        "description": "&quot;Grandpa, can you tell again the story of when all the toilet paper in the world disappeared?&quot; The old man's face closed, stripped of his usual smile. And, as he pulled the children into his lap, all those memories kept within him, closed by the invisible key of the passage of time, began to flow. His voice sounded calm and painful. &ldquo;In that strange period of our lives, there were a number of people who, without reason, decided to use up all the toilet paper in the world. These people were part of a radical terrorist movement called P.O.O.H., which basically meant the Party of the Organized and Obsessive Hoarders.&rdquo;<br/><br/>PAPER ROLL &amp; Write is a roll &amp; write game, for 2 players. One of the players takes command of the Party of the Organized and Obsessive Hoarders (hereinafter referred to as P.O.O.H.), whose aim is to try to deplete the toilet paper stock in the stores, leading the population to total panic. The other player assumes the role of Coordinator of a group of specialists called by the government to resolve this crisis, ensuring the production and supply of paper to the city.<br/><br/>In each round, the P.O.O.H rolls a certain number of dice. Then, the Coordinator chooses how many dice will be used during that round by BOTH players. For each dice that he decides not to use during that round, panic increases by 1.  The more dice the Coordinator choses, the more dice he and the P.O.O.H. will use. The more dice he choses not to use, the more the panic increases.<br/>The Coordinator will use dice to produce and distribute paper across stores, while P.O.O.H will use the same dice to accumulate bonuses in his headquarters and to visit stores on the map, buying all the paper and spread the panic, while avoiding being slowed down by the police.<br/><br/>The Coordinator wins the game if at least 5 stores are supplied with paper. <br/>The P.O.O.H. wins the game if the panic reaches the end of the panic track.<br/><br/>In the end of each round, players exchange the game sheets they have in their possession. This creates a constant back and forth between players, because the sheet that one player is currently using, will be used by the other player in the next round.<br/><br/>Also, the Coordinator and the POOH play two completely different types of games, which highly increases replayability.<br/><br/>&ldquo;PAPER ROLL &amp; write is a free Print &amp; Play Roll &amp; Write board game for two players. But for us it is more than a game, it is a cheerful and positive manifesto in times of uncertainty, and a joint effort from 3 designers in Lockdown due to Covid-19.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Its new cards promote exciting new synergies between dark Tomes and the daring Relic Hunters who seek them. Meanwhile, players gain unprecedented control over their decks and discard piles, finding new ways to work with lost knowledge.<br/><br/>Will the forgotten secrets of ancient Ebla provide you the answers you need to stymie your foes? Will humanity tremble before the terrifying might of the Ancient Ones restored to their former glory, or will heroic investigators and scientists thwart them and their zealous cultists to maintain sanity, at least for another day?<br/><br/>Ebla Restored introduces sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty cards) that provide players with new incentives to hunt down ancient Tomes, visit remote Libraries, and prevent rival Relic Hunters from fetching powerful artifacts for their respective factions.<br/><br/>",

Planetary Reign is a space civilization game based on classic video games of the same genre from the 1980's and 90's in which each player is the leader of a space-faring empire that is attempting to expand into and exploit the riches of a new-found galaxy. Planetary Reign provides a rich 4X experience without an overly complex rule-set and can be played within a couple of hours.<br/><br/>As a leader of THULE, VEYNA, METHIOS or CALDERA, you will assign your workers to a variety of actions - choosing which, when and how often they will be performed - with the ultimate goal being to dominate the galaxy and ensure the survival of your people. Your empire will build, upgrade and send its fleets into a galaxy to explore its unknown worlds. There, you will encounter planets with strange environments, hosts of alien species and a variety of resources as well as occasionally running into your opponents.<br/><br/>The main mechanics employed in Planetary Reign are worker placement, area control and a new specie assimilation mechanic. With nearly 5 years in development, Planetary Reign has been designed for players who enjoy medium to heavy games with low luck factors. There are multiple scoring paths and rounds - the winner being the empire with the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

T​he players will be storytellers tasked with writing a story from beginning to end. They will have to work together to finish the story before writer's block reaches them.<br/><br/>The game consists of 84 different illustrated &lsquo;inspiration cards&rsquo;. [The art was made by the students of the &lsquo;International School of Illustration&rsquo; of Sarmede (Treviso, Italy)]. It also includes 24 &lsquo;obligation cards&rsquo; and a table board with an &lsquo;inspirations path&rsquo; on it. During the game, all players will contribute to create a story that will be both personal and collective at the same time: it will talk about each one with the contribution of everyone.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a simple game in its mechanics - with a short learning time thus allowing to start playing right away - but complex enough to keep the attention and involvement - even emotional - of the players.<br/><br/>The game consists of five phases plus the ending. Each phase corresponds to a narrative stage: beginning, purpose, hindrance, overcoming, achievement and ending.<br/><br/>Each phase consists of several turns whose number depends on the initial choice, made by the players, between short story, novella and novel.<br/>​Each &lsquo;inspiration card&rsquo; shows four elements: a rule, an illustration, &lsquo;words in freedom&rsquo; and either &lsquo;hidden truths&rsquo; or &lsquo;suggestions&rsquo;.<br/><br/>These elements will encourage the players to find inspiration in their imagination or in their everyday life, to enrich the story with episodes and anecdotes, thus making the narrative structure more fascinating to all participants.<br/><br/>The writer's block flips one card: at the end of each turn starting from Phase 2 &quot;Purpose&quot;; when players make a mistake; if stated by the drawn obligation card; if players choose to discard an obligation card on the board.<br/><br/>If the writer's block flips all the cards played until that moment, the game is over, the players have lost.<br/><br/>If, instead, the players reach the final slot &quot;Ending&quot; without the writer's block reaching them, they won collectively.<br/><br/>",

You cannot move towards face-up tokens or empty spaces. You can move over the bridge token.<br/><br/>If the revealed illustration does not match another one on the board, play passes towards the next player.<br/>If the illustration on the token you just turned face-up matches another face-up illustration on the board you remove both pieces and turn the other face-up tokens face down.

        "description": "From the dust jacket:<br/><br/>&quot;Fighting battles on table tops, with miniature soldiers and model terrain features, is one of the oldest and most exciting of indoor sports. A good war game combines all the strategy of chess, all the fun of model railroading, and all the excitement and challenge of a game of baseball. Thanks to innovations in the manufacture of military miniatures, large numbers of excellent figures can now be obtained at very low cost. The result, in recent years, has been a dramatic upsurge in the popularity of war gaming.<br/><br/>Joseph Morschauser's How to Play War Games in Miniature explains every step in setting up and playing a table top war: how to obtain soldiers and their equipment; how to construct model terrain; how to deploy and maneuver troops; and how to fight battles which accurately reproduce the tactical conditions appropriate to any historic period from remote antiquity to the present.<br/><br/>Mr. Morschauser is an award-winning editor of one of America's greatest weekly magazines and a long-time war gamer. His book will introduce an exciting new pastime to thousands of older boys - and, indeed, their fathers.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In a desperate hope, the King of Elidor is seeking the help of a few brave adventurers to recover this book and return it to Elidor in the hopes that the City's mage may put an end to the evil that runs amok throughout the land.  Others, of vile morality, seek to take the Book to the Gypsies in a hope of finding its secrets for their own evil purpose.  You are one of these adventurers that seek the Book.  Along the way, you will encounter many perils and much treasure.  You will gain new friends and meet helpful strangers.  When you are strong enough, you will travel to the Abyss, where you will fight Gharad in a battle that may decide the fate of Djarhun.<br/><br/>Djarhun is a fantasy board game that can be played by up to 6 players.  As players move around the board, they will find items, and slay monsters, that will increase their power.  When a player is powerful enough, they may head for the center of the board and try to claim the Book of Avrakar.  Whoever brings the Book to the predetermined location, is the victor.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     Ruined Urthe: A Djarhun Expansion<br/>     Goblin Invasion: A Djarhun Expansion<br/><br/><br/>",

Presented as a general overview of the period, rather than a focused report on a single conflict, this book includes descriptions of every major Inner Sphere and Clan faction. Notable personalities, military forces, and an overview of the technological capabilities of the Inner Sphere and Clan powers of this critical era in history are also provided, along with special advanced-level rules for campaigns set in this era, whether played using the Total Warfare core rules or those found in A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/>For three hundred years, the nations of the Inner Sphere waged war in the name of the fallen Star League, sending armies of MechWarriors into battle for glory and power. Yet even as BattleMechs clashed over the forgotten ruins of humanity&rsquo;s Golden Age, the descendants of the long-lost Star League Defense Force gathered their might among distant stars.<br/>Then, in 3048, amid reports of a technological renaissance in the Sphere, the leaders of Kerensky&rsquo;s children decided the time for invasion had come. The Clan Invasion would transform the face of warfare and the fate of nations across the Inner Sphere, marking an all new era for all of humankind.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Set thousands of years in the future, the board game DarkStar is based on classics such as Dune, Cosmic Encounter, and Diplomacy.<br/><br/>Strategically, DarkStar plays out something like Chess, although the game mechanisms are wildly different. Your key pieces are squadrons that you move around the board in stacks. The board itself being gridded into systems (where resources are located) and subsectors (empty space). Squadrons move from square-to-square on the board as in Chess. As the game proceeds, stargates twist space so that squares change their position relative to one another.<br/><br/>Another big difference from Chess is that conflicts are resolved using tactical core cards that will feel to you more like rock-paper-scissors. Unlike in Chess, attacking pieces won't always win. Furthermore you will get free moves and other kinds of special actions through playing Imperial edict cards.<br/><br/>The most destructive force in the game are antimatter missiles. You build missiles in stages on your systems and launch them during your turn. These missiles are the reason why the goal of the game &mdash; collecting three different deep-defense codes &mdash; is so important. Missile detonations destroy everything in a square and even burn up the square itself so that nothing can enter it. Owning three colors of deep-defense codes makes some of your squares immune to antimatter detonations, upsetting the balance of power and giving you a chance to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Our climate is changing and the elements that prevail in the forest are unstable. We experience this by dealing with the effects of violent weather phenomena such as: drought, storm or heavy rainfall. We have no direct influence on them, but we can predict the effects they cause and try to prevent them. We can counteract some of these changes, others need to be adapted to.  The way we manage water and how we protect forests against fires is crucial in adapting forests to climate changes.  Keeping forests in good condition is your task now.<br/>It is your decisions and your actions that determine whether you manage the elements of fire and water.<br/>&quot;Żywioły Lasu&quot; is an original board game designed to be played individually among several people. The game balances the aspect of luck and the impact of player's decisions on the course of the game. Clear and intuitive rules allow you to quickly feel the vibe of the game regardless of age or experience with board games. Protect your forest from the effects of the forces of the elements, be ready for possible disasters and make sure the forest lasts longer for the benefit of people and nature.<br/><br/>In each round, players simultaneously pick the card with action which they will perform on the board and then pass the cards to the next player. The action is to place their marker in one of the forest zones: red, blue or neutral respectively.  At the end of the game, after an appropriate number of rounds, the players gain points for the advantages in the regions or the proper arrangement of their markers in relation to each other and the selected cards during the game. The winner is the player who collects the most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Panakizhi started life as a design challenge to see if we could design 3 fun games using a common set of pieces and game board.  Over time we experimented with, and discarded, a number of different ideas - streamlining game play to keep the games as simple yet challenging as possible.  With game times lasting 5-10 minutes each we feel that the 3 games presented in this set enable strategy players to always have access to a quick, tight, and challenging game wherever they are thanks to the compact and light design.<br/><br/>The three games are:<br/><br/>Vancanna<br/><br/>With only 12 pieces on the board the simplicity of its looks belies the strategy involved in winning.  Players are attempting to move 3 of their coloured pieces off the opposite side of the board, the catch being that if they can jump their opponent's piece then they must make that move - and doing so will cause the piece jumped to be flipped to their colour.  It may sound counter-intuitive, but the strategic use of forcing your opponent to jump your piece, and thereby losing it, can actually be advantageous as it could trigger a series of moves that see your pieces advancing across the board.<br/><br/>Talluka<br/><br/>This game is deceptively simple yet players can quickly find themselves with a limited number of optimal moves.  Pieces are slid across the board one space per turn, the catch being that they can only move if they are on the outside of a line and are adjacent to another piece in the direction they are moving so that they can push that piece as well.  Align 4 of your pieces adjacent to each other and in a vertical or horizontal line and you win.<br/><br/>Gopurrum<br/><br/>Gopurrum involves moving and jumping your pieces around the board as you attempt to make a stack of pieces 4-high.  Each time you jump a piece, or a stack of pieces, the top piece on that stack is flipped so that it changes sides.  Only your pieces, or stacks where your colour is showing on top, can be moved on your turn - and no move can end with more than 4 pieces being on a stack.  Players can shed the top piece of a stack to an adjacent empty space if the top piece is theirs, but be careful as you may also be helping your opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Some cards require two or three of the same card to be lethal like &quot;Choked on a Hairball&quot;, and some cards are instant death such as &quot;Hit by a car&quot;. Some cards are positive and heal or protect your cat.<br/><br/>When a player's cat is killed, the player has lost the game but continues to play, taking turns as normal to get revenge against those who harmed the player's cat.<br/><br/>",

They have created secret recipes, with different ingredients for each plant to heal them. These can not be mixed up!

But the trees are in continuous motion, the entrances of the clearings are changing their place, which can make the G&uuml;s job easier or harder. The movement can also lead to<br/>unexpected meetings with forest creatures.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to collect the correct color combinations and help as many plants as<br/>you can during the game. The player who collects the most recipe cards and heals the most plants<br/>is the winner.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no recipe cards left. The player who collected the most recipe<br/>cards and healed the most plants is the winner.

Players collectively represent the various Houses of the Kingdom of Zorn, and these Houses have joined together to defeat the existential threat of the vile Red Blight. The Red Blight is an evil entity that has just launched an invasion of peaceful Slumbering Troll Valley, the northern-most province of the kingdom. The monsters of the Red Blight are now holding the citizens of the valley hostage and have absconded with the province&rsquo;s valuables, treasures, and vital resources. The Houses have been summoned by King Rufus V of Zorn to launch a Royal Crusade to free the valley and rid it of this blight. The game&rsquo;s players will each control a Commander, a Magic User, and a House Army, made up of various types of military units. Each player attempts to defeat enemy units and capture Treasure Tokens, and by so doing earn Glory Points. The player scoring the most Glory Points will be awarded with the title &ldquo;Hand of the Crown&rdquo; and win the game. However, players must cooperate and assist each other as well. If the Red Blight achieves certain conditions, all the players lose the game, regardless of their situation or amount of Glory Points. If players can stave off The Red Blight&rsquo;s attempt to exploit the valley for four full days, the monsters will lose access to the malignant power that sustains them. If this evil has been successfully thwarted, peace and freedom will be restored once again to the valley and one of the intrepid Houses will gain the ultimate royal reward. Will you become Hand of the Crown, Sire?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fortes fortuna iuvat: Plinius adversus Vesuvium (Fortune favors the brave: Pliny against the Vesuvius) is a small and simple postcard game published as a freebie by SNAFU Design, first as a gift for the attendees to the Collonera Russa 2022 wargaming convention (Vilafranca del Pened&egrave;s, Catalonia) and later released for free as a PDF. It's the third of the Snafu Postcard Games.<br/><br/>It's a solitaire game in which the player, as Pliny the Elder, tries to rescue as many people as possible from the Vesuvius eruption of 79 AD, guiding the quadriremes of the Misenum fleet. The game uses a standard deck of cards. After shuffling them, the player reveals cards, one at a time. Black cards affect the progression of the smoke and of the pyroclastic flow, while red cards allow the player to act (move the inhabitants of the zone, move the quadriremes, move Pliny's liburna).<br/><br/>The name of the game comes from a line in a letter from Pliny's nephew, Pliny the Younger, to the historian Tacitus in which he retells the last moments of his uncle: &quot;'Fortes' inquit 'fortuna iuvat: Pomponianum pete.' (Fortune favours the brave, he said, head for Pomponianus!)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Age of Muskets Volume II: Eagles Rising  <br/> &quot;Eagles Rising&quot; is the second volume of our Age of Muskets Series, it covers Napoleon's Campaign in Northern Italy 1796-97. There, Napoleon made a name for himself and earned the prestige that would put in his hands the destinies of France and, eventually, of Europe.<br/><br/>The Campaign started with Bonaparte's offensive in the spring of 1796 that knocked the Piedmontese Kingdom out of the war and subjected it to French power. Then followed the struggle against Austrian attempts to relieve the besieged Mantua, and retake the Po River Valley that led to the Battle of Rivoli in January 1797. Finally with Napoleon's offensive in the spring of 1797 that led to Leoben (on the road to Vienna) and, eventually, to his victory over the First Coalition.<br/><br/>As in Volume I the game includes all the elements that characterized pre-industrial warfare. However, the player will also find some elements distinctive of this campaign, as Alpine terrain, a different map and time scale to reflect the duration of the campaign as well as certain historical details (the systematic looting by the French, the revolts against French occupation ...). Given the size of the armies involved most of the scenarios of this Volume are quite adequate for two players since there are few headquarters and their size is quite manageable.<br/><br/>However, the game title would be incomplete if it referred only to this first campaign of Napoleon. The box also includes the necessary counters and scenarios to play the Austro - Russian counteroffensive of 1799-1800 that ended at the famous Battle of Marengo, the first that Bonaparte fought and won as First Consul of the Republic after his return from Egypt.<br/><br/>Marshall Suvorov and the Russian Army, with their Austrian allies, expelled the French from all their Italian conquests. Bonaparte's counterattack in 1800 came after Suvorov and Russia retired from the conflict but, what if things had been otherwise? You may explore this exciting possibility in the Napoleon vs. Suvorov scenario.<br/><br/>Each game contains:<br/>- 2 70x50 cm maps (together form a 50x140 cm map of northern Italy, Switzerland and Germany) <br/>- 8 battlefield terrain overlays <br/>- 2 sets of Player Aid Sheets (3 sheets per set)<br/>- 2 HQ Display Sheets<br/>- 2 ten sided dice<br/>- 1 set of Army Sheets for photocopying <br/>- 832 counters (4 counter sheets)<br/>- 1 &ldquo;Age of Muskets Series Rules&quot; booklet<br/>- 1 Eagles' Rising booklet including special rules, scenarios, historical notes and designer notes.<br/>Eagle's Rising is not just a game, it's a whole gaming experience including 6 battle scenarios (Rivoli, Marengo, First Zurich, Second Zurich, Novi and Trebbia) and 11 campaign scenarios, ordered by increasing complexity, from the 2 turns of &quot;Piedmont's Defeat&quot; to the full campaigns of 1796-97 and 1799-1800. This includes Suvorov's campaign in Switzerland and a hypothetical campaign pitting Suvorov against Bonaparte!!!!<br/><br/>It will be possible to put together Volume II with the next in the series: &quot;Vienna or Death&quot; which deals with the campaigns of 1796-97 and 1799-1800 in southern Germany with Moreau vs Archduke Charles in action.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[En Espanol:]El juego est&aacute; en ingl&eacute;s pero encontrar&aacute;s en esta p&aacute;gina (Apoyo al Jugador) los archivos en espa&ntilde;ol necesarios para jugar &ndash;Hojas de Ayuda, Reglas y Escenarios.<br/><br/>",

The game uses traditional hex-and-counter mechanics to simulate the combat and emphasizes the ineffectual assault of Norman archers, the combination of Norman foot and cavalry units, and the defensive strength of the Saxon shield wall. The game also highlights the difficulty that the Saxon leaders keeping the shield wall intact. Saxon Units may involuntarily pursuit the Normans down the hill and lose their high-ground advantage after successfully causing the Norman units to route.<br/><br/>The game features rules for demoralizing of the armies, rallying the troops, and Saxon reinforcements. Also included are optional rules for army fatigue which increases the difficulty for both players.<br/><br/>The Saxon Player wins by holding the hill or eliminating the Norman king, William. The Norman player wins by taking the hill or killing the Saxon king, Harold. Either player can win by eliminating all units.<br/><br/>The game features about 147 counters and a 22x17 inch gameboard.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to be the first player to reach 40 points through traveling to various famous tourist sights around the world.<br/><br/>The game has two game boards; one working board and one traveling board. Each player starts in his/her personal corner of the working board. The players take turns rolling two dice and moving around the board accordingly. A player landing on a personal working field gains experience. A player landing on another players working field triggers a bank payment to that payment, depending on that player's experience for that particular field. There are also travel fields on which a player collects a bus, train or flight ticket. A player moving on or over his/her personal starting space gets some money and another travel ticket (up to a maximum of five that can be held in the hand.). Additionally, s/he can decide to go traveling by moving his/her pawn to the traveling board. A player who is on the traveling board starts his/her turn by paying 500 Dollars, then rolling the dice and moving on the traveling board towards any of four tourist attractions that have been randomly marked. After doing the move determined by the dice, the player can use a ticket to influence his/her movement, as stated on the ticket (however, using the ticket costs dearly, too). If a marked tourist destination is reached, the player scores points. If at the beginning of a turn a player cannot afford further travel, s/he moves back to the working board, trying to raise more money.<br/><br/>When a player has reached a sum of 40 points, the game ends and that player is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Quick KO&rsquo;s, TKO&rsquo;s, and close decisions, will all occur on your tabletop with real life accuracy in Main Event Boxing. As in real life boxing, ANYTHING can happen, but you won&rsquo;t see the flash KO&rsquo;s and huge upsets with regularity in Main Event Boxing, like you do with other boxing games.<br/><br/>Main Event Boxing is a sequel to FAST Boxing. However, the game has changed a great deal, and it is much more than a ratings update, which is why I gave the game a new name. If you have played FAST Boxing, the game will be somewhat familiar. However, if FAST Boxing wasn&rsquo;t your cup of tea, I ask you to give this game a look, as it is truly THAT much better.<br/><br/>I always felt that FAST Boxing was a &ldquo;complimentary game&rdquo;. It was a game that bridged the gap from a quick playing game, like Ultra Quick Boxing, and a detailed game like Title Bout. Main Event Boxing has shed the &ldquo;complimentary game&rdquo; title now. This game stands on its own with the best of them. While the game does play rapidly, and it&rsquo;s certainly not a punch-by-punch simulation, I stand firmly behind the accuracy of the game. And most importantly, I find the game play to be quite compelling and easy to pick up and play. This ultimately is the most important thing about any game!<br/><br/>Fighters, Fighters, Fighters&hellip;<br/><br/>The standard game features a vast array of today&rsquo;s current boxing stars. With the standard game, you get over 190 heavyweights, 90 Cruiserweights, 78 Light Heavyweights, 94 Super Middleweights, 82 Middleweights, 108 Junior Middleweights, 112 Welterweights, 122 Junior Welterweights, 115 Lightweights, 75 Junior Lightweights, 89 Featherweights, 76 Junior Featherweights, 74 Bantamweights, 76 Junior Bantamweights, 68 Flyweights, 45 Junior Flyweights, and 128 Strawweights. That&rsquo;s over 1600 active fighters. No other game company can match that! You can rest assured that my research and analysis yields very accurate fight ratings.<br/><br/>The match-ups are limitless!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In this game, you will play as an aspen tree, spreading its roots to grow clones in order to become the best grove of Quaking Aspens.<br/><br/>The active player rolls all three dice and then claims one of those dice. The player to their left will then claim one of the remaining two dice. All other players (if any) will use the final die. <br/>Each player will then use their die value to connect a leaf to another, already circled leaf (or the start leaf). They will do this by finding a solid path containing their die value leading from a circled leaf to another leaf, drawing a line over the path, and circling the new leaf. <br/>Each time a player circles a leaf, they gain the benefit of that leaf, which will either be a bonus or a scoring opportunity. These benefits will be tracked on your tracking mat. <br/>The game will be played in rounds, with all players taking simultaneous turns, until a single player has reached any 4 of the goal leaves. All players will finish the current round and then proceed to scoring.<br/><br/>",

If you can tell a nude from a vase of flowers you are in with a good chance!<br/><br/>Expos, is, as far as I know, only available from the Musee du Louvre, the Musee des Beaux-Arts de Marseille and the Musee d'Orsay in France. My copy was obtained by contacting the Louvre by mail. It was a gift, so I am uncertain of price.<br/><br/>The game is in French, English rules can be provided.<br/><br/>There are 126 cards in full color, showing a detail of a famous painting (eg Gauguin's The White Horse or Van Gogh's Sunflowers) and classifying it by one of the 21 painters and one of the 12 themes.<br/><br/>Everything is on good quality card stock.<br/><br/>Also provided are 34 Event Cards which are drawn after each player's turn and detail things like Fire or Critical Success or compulsory or optional auction of a painting.<br/><br/>There are 6 'cheat sheets' or Expos Catalogs, giving the names of the painters and the categories. In French, but they're easy enough to work out for the most part, (eg: Nu, Portrait Masculin, Marine, Hist. Relig ou Allegories,etc) and translations are given in the rules. The painting cards are helpfully colour coded which assists)<br/><br/>Also 6 screens help people hide their Euros, and provide a place to hang exhibition posters (there are 2 of these for each painter [so only 2 players can exhibit Monet for example] and 3 per theme [so only 3 players can exhibit Marine scenes]<br/><br/>140 money and loan chips in Euros are provided to buy and sell the paintings with, and to go into debt to the bank with should things get hot...<br/><br/>The rules are provided in French, I am not certain if the English rules are provided without request.<br/><br/>The plastic insert of the box provides the revolving centre of the game. 10 painting cards are separated and the rest are divided more or less evenly into four and placed in each the four easels of the carousel. The information on the card is covered by the one of the numbered cardboard easels' insert so that the painting can be seen, but not who it's by or whether it is classified as a Nude, Historical, Marine, or whatever. 1,2,3,4.<br/><br/>The event cards are placed face down on one side of the middle of the carousel, the spare paintings on the other.<br/><br/>Players are given a screen, 100.000 Euro and a cheat sheet, and a starting hand of 4 paintings.<br/><br/>Play proceeds by a player choosing to a) buy a painting by spending 20,000 Euro and taking a painting from any of the easels or the top of the face down spare painting pile<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>b) exhibit one or more collections (receiving 20,000 Euro)<br/><br/>You need two or more paintings by the same artist to make an exhibit, or three with the same theme. You take these from your hand and put them on the table face up, and hang the appropriate poster on your screen.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>do nothing. A player may also in each case choose to supplement an existing exhibition in which case they will get 5,000 Euro per exhibit, regardless of how many paintings are added.<br/><br/>They then must take an event card, react to it as required:  There may be a sudden auction, or the current exposed paintings may be destroyed or they may keep the card if it is one to be used later and then their turn is over.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player exhibits their 4th collection. The winner is the person with the most money at the end. The exhibitions worths are calculated using the chart on the cheat sheet.<br/><br/>Exhibits by artist gains the most points, but it is easier to collect by theme.<br/><br/>Unexhibited paintings: ie those still concealed in players' hands have a penalty of -5000 Euro each at the end of the game. Any debts are paid off if they can be.<br/><br/>Fast, attractive, as challenging as you want it to be.<br/><br/>It appears to have won some awards:<br/>1997 Double D' Argent (Double Silver) Besancon Festival Internationa des nouveaux jeux<br/>1998 De D'OR (Gold) Concours International de Boulogne Billancourt<br/>1999 Prime au Salon International du Jouet de Paris Concours Lepine A.I.F.F, which I think may be a bronze.<br/><br/>The only other information which may be of use on the box and insert I can find about it is:<br/><br/>Fabrique aux Pays-Bas<br/>Information: EXPOS Art, Business &amp; Collections<br/>O.

When a racket card is being fought over, the players all roll a HIT die (1d6); any opponent mugs in play that match your die roll (a die is printed on the mug cards), those cards are either flipped-unusable during this round, or discarded. The die roll is then added to the remaining value of your mugs in play, highest score wins the contract. But, you must have a mug who can control that racket, otherwise it is discarded. Family cards are played during non racket rounds to help your family or hinder the opposition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Conservation Crisis you set out to save your chosen species from extinction. You do this by acquiring resources for your reserve and creating environments where the animals can survive alongside the local communities. Its design combines the experiences Richard has had through his conservation work and our combined love of board games.<br/><br/>Each round, players receive $100,000 of Donor Funding when they reach HQ, as well as income from tourist lodges they have built. They then take event cards, which make their wildlife populations go up or down dependent on which projects and staff they have built, and continue around the board spending their money to rebuild their reserves. The game also includes a &lsquo;poacher&rsquo;s checkpoint&rsquo; where players must choose to pay a &lsquo;bribe&rsquo; to pass straight through or wait two turns. If a player pays the &lsquo;bribe&rsquo; they take a bribe card, which they turn over at HQ; all bribe cards are negative, so players soon learn to avoid them, teaching an important lesson about the dangers of corruption!<br/><br/>- CONSERVATION CRISIS! Take control of a wildlife reserve in crisis and rescue a species!<br/>    - SAVE A SPECIES! Test yourself and take your $100,000 then put it to work at saving animals<br/>    - FAMILY BOARD GAME! A fun family game perfect for ages 7+ and up to 4 teams ofplayers<br/>    - PLAY WITH 2+ PEOPLE! Go it alone or team up for a maximum of 4 teams to save the animals!<br/>    - FUN STRATEGY! Involve everything with this quick thinking and strategic gameplay required to protect a whole species from extinction!<br/><br/>The Conservation Crisis board game has been designed, playtested and refined by conservation and gaming experts and the general public over the course of three years, to ensure it is fun to play while still being as true-to-life as possible. It has the traditional feel of games such as Monopoly and Game of Life that many people will have grown up with but uses more modern game design techniques to make it less luck-based. It is suitable for ages 7 and above and makes a great family game.<br/><br/>",

The maps are 21&quot; x 27&quot; and there are two Pacific and two Atlantic maps with a total of 39 areas.<br/><br/>As a standalone game, The Two Ocean War allows double-blind player movement via two copies of the Atlantic and Pacific theater maps. During the movement phase, players place their fleets on their own game boards, unaware of the other player's moves. Once moves are completed, both players go area by area on both maps, resolving battles between fleets placed in the same areas on the two different maps and to resolve combat and determine victory points awarded for each sea zone. Combat is similar to the Avalon Hill sea games, using six-sided dice. Rolls of 1-4 are no effect, 5 is a disable (ship returns to port), 6 is a hit causing a subsequent die roll for amount of damage.<br/><br/>The game is superior to the Avalon Hill sea games in some regards. Highlights include larger fleets (CL-class ships for all nations are represented in addition to the other ship classes in the AH games), more sea zones, and the blind movement resulting in often surprising battle lineups in particular sea zones. Additional rules let small ships torpedo big ones under certain conditions, and since the game represents fleets worldwide, there are opportunities for some Axis ships to change theaters just as the Allied ships can.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes 9 matching coins. 2 dice are placed in a wooden cup. The object of the game is to move all 9 of your matching coins through the arc of cowry shells, in a clockwise direction from one end to the other. The winner is the first to do so. To play; the dice are rolled around in the cup, then the cup is placed sharply (with a snap of the wrist) upside down on top of the pad. The following player lifts the cup, revealing the dice. On each player&rsquo;s first roll, 3 coins are placed (make a space) past the number of cowry shells equal to the number showing on the dice.  On following rolls, either 1 coin is entered into the arc or coins  already in the arc are moved the amount of spaces showing on the rolled dice. There are Various rules such as &quot;killing&quot; the opponents coins and &quot;stacking&quot; your own, making them more powerful.    <br/><br/><br/>",

An influential goblin king, wielding unprecedented magic, has managed to unite the various goblin tribes into one mighty force.  The goblins have been led to the surface of Durach, and have poured across the land like a swarm of raging locusts to devour all of civilization.  The proud City of Elidor has beseeched the local Heroes to help halt the advance of these goblins before they manage to gain a foothold in the region.  So begins the Goblin Invasion.<br/><br/>The Goblin Invasion deck is an optional event deck depicting the efforts of the Goblin king to conquer the surface world.  If used, whenever a player is instructed to draw a Durach card, the card may be instead drawn from the Goblin Invasion deck.  Any number of cards can be substituted in this way, until the deck is exhausted.  Once the deck is exhausted, it is assumed the goblin forces have been routed and sent back to the Underdark.<br/><br/>This expansion includes...<br/><br/>- Hero Cards (10)<br/>- Market Cards (6)<br/>- Treasure Cards (3)<br/>- Quest Cards (97)<br/>- Updated Rules<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>     Djarhun<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "A set of miniature wargame rules for the English Civil War (1642-1650) or Thirty Years War (1618 - 1648).<br/><br/>The game scales are 1 figure equals 20 men, 1 gun model equals two guns, 1 rank of figures equals three historical ranks. The ground scale is 1 inch equals fifteen yards. There is no specific time scale per turn.<br/><br/>Protz' rules provide a great deal of flavor to the period of Cavaliers and Roundheads. The foot (infantry) regiments, which combine pikemen and musketeers, are arranged in a logical way that allows for easy use of the two types within the same unit. The foot can assume a number of specified &quot;postures&quot; or formations that affect their fighting ability against certain opponents. For example, foot in &quot;close order&quot; or &quot;ring&quot; fight better against opposing horse (cavalry).<br/><br/>The horse also has specified postures, such as the caracole, which is a deep formation intended to attack by firing pistols in successive ranks. Horse also has a unique movement restriction where they must move by one of three speeds: trot, canter, or gallop. The horse must accelerate turn-by-turn to get up to galloping speed. The speed makes a great deal of difference when fighting other horse. The faster troops have the advantage. This is a nice touch and provides a game mechanic for a situation that is often mentioned in accounts of the era.<br/><br/>Some of the game's mechanics are cumbersome. For example, &quot;Giving fire with small arms&quot; requires nine steps; firing artillery requires 10 steps. However, these rules are still very playable. The second edition (published 1976) adds several pages of rules for siege warfare as well as clarifications and revisions of first edition rules.<br/><br/>",

Briefly, Malta is an island (17x9 miles) located in the Mediterranean Sea south of Italy. Its strategic position was taken advantage of by the British as a base for aircraft and naval units. These forces were in the perfect position to raid German freighters and air transports heading south to supply Rommel and the Afrika Korps in North Africa. Malta first came under attack by the Italians in 1940, and later by the Germans and Italians in 1941-42. Although severely battered, the island never fell.<br/><br/><br/>An expansion for Rise of the Luftwaffe found in RBM/GMT's C3i Magazine Nr3. This expansion covers the air war over Malta from 1940 to 1942. It includes new rules for Torpedo Bombers, Transports, and point values for the new Fighters introduced in the scenario.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    Background and rules<br/>    Campaign Sequence of Play<br/>    Plane sheets (2)<br/><br/><br/>",

But even in paradise, the law of the jungle is absolute. Survival is a daily struggle, and only the strong survive.<br/><br/>The players in Chimera Isle are capricious nature spirits, observing and subtly influencing the ecosystem. Natural selection is only a game to these immortal beings, who wager on the fortunes of the eponymous &quot;Chimeras&quot;. The strongest creatures will thrive while the weakest go extinct, making room for newer and stranger upstarts. Don't get too attached, as the law of the jungle is brutal and survival is never guaranteed.<br/><br/>This is a voting and speculation game for 3-4 players. Each &quot;chimera&quot; is a unique creation of one head, body, and tail, drawn randomly from a deck. All chimeras are competing to win the habitats in a second deck, as the alternative is extinction. Players guide their progress by voting for which chimera is the &quot;fittest&quot; for each habitat. In between voting rounds, players speculate on the fates of the chimeras by buying shares in these creatures. The &quot;voting game&quot; influences the &quot;investment game&quot;, and the result is a scoring round at the end of each &quot;age&quot; of play. After three ages, the highest-scoring player wins.<br/><br/>",

While it never ignited into a Third World War, both sides armed for it, trained for it, and planned for it. Iron Curtain - Hammer and Sickle (a Panzer Grenadier game) explores the use of huge tanks and other weapons prepared for this war that never happened. Besides the twenty scenarios, players can take the role of the 11th Tank Corps, 8th Guards Army as it fights a hypothetical campaign to seize the American airfields at Rhein Main (Frankfurt am Main) and Wiesbaden, followed by the border crossings near Saarbr&uuml;cken.<br/><br/>Unlike most other Panzer Grenadier titles, Hammer and Sickle covers battles that never happened. We&rsquo;ve given you one plausible scenario background leading to war, that provides the setting and troops for the scenarios and campaign included.<br/><br/>Hammer and Sickle includes 77 mounted and die-cut Soviet playing pieces. Playing all of the scenarios and the campaign in this supplement requires the use of the included pieces plus boards and pieces from our Road to Berlin and Elsenborn Ridge games.<br/><br/>",

This refers to the different relationships each element has with the others according to their dominance, opposition and weakness.<br/><br/>Fire (Ashw) dominates over Earth (Ohif), opposes Air (Ukelele) and is weak against Water (Esbner).<br/><br/>Water (Esbner) dominates over Fire (Ashw), opposes Earth (Ohif) and is weak against Air (Ukelele).<br/><br/>Air (Ukelele) dominates over Water (Esbner), opposes Fire (Ashw) and is weak against Earth (Ohif).<br/><br/>Earth (Ohif) dominates over Air (Ukelele), opposes Water (Esbner) and is weak against Fire (Ashw).<br/><br/>The objective of this game scenario is to be the first to discard all your cards in your CURRENT HAND. The recommended numbers playing the game will be 2, 3, 4 and 6 who will be distributed with 18, 12, 9 and 6 cards respectively from a shuffled STANDARD DECK.<br/><br/>Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved. The starting player may lay down any 1 card from his/her hand into a common pool in front of all players.<br/><br/>During each turn, each player may EITHER 1) play a card whose FACE VALUE is higher than the previous card; 2) play a card whose ELEMENT dominates the ELEMENT of the previous card; 3) pass and the turn goes to the next player.<br/><br/>Each time a player plays a card whose ELEMENT dominates the ELEMENT of the previous card, each player MUST choose a card from his/her CURRENT HAND and pass it to the player on the left.<br/><br/>In the situation when the game cannot go on as players can no longer put down cards due to the rules, the player with the least cards of the smallest number wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fatal Choices: Wargames, Decisions and Destiny in the 1914 Battles of Coronel and Falklands is an experimental history using authentic naval wargames to examine choices made in the World War I battles of Coronel and Falklands<br/><br/>&ldquo;And now began the saddest naval action of the war (Coronel). Of the officers and men in both the squadrons that faced each other in these stormy seas far from home, nine of ten were doomed to perish.&rdquo;<br/><br/>-- Winston Churchill<br/><br/>This autumn marks the centennial of The Great War. Among the most dramatic sagas in a dramatic season was that of the German East Asia Squadron under Rear Adm. Maximilian Graf von Spee. Stranded by the sudden outbreak of war on the other side of the world, Spee&rsquo;s squadron evaded enemy forces for months. Dispatched the raider Emden to harry British trade in the Indian Ocean and then handed the Royal Navy its first defeat in battle in 99 years off the shore of Chile near Cape Coronel. That devastating defeat sent two British armored cruisers to the depths with their entire crews at trifling cost to Spee&rsquo;s squadron.<br/><br/>The stunning defeat provoked the British into sending two of their new battlecruisers thousands of miles from the European theater to search for and destroy Spee&rsquo;s squadron. Spee and the British squadron met at The Falklands just five weeks after Coronel. This time it was Spee&rsquo;s squadron which was annihilated.<br/><br/>For a hundred years historians and naval officers have debated Spee&rsquo;s choices and those of his opponents and speculated about what might have been. Fatal Choices looks at the course of the actual campaign and considers how it might have played out differently. But more than that, Fatal Choices applies the discipline of authentic naval wargames to evaluate those what-ifs under realistic constraints. And it provides the reader with the tools to see for himself how the battles may have played out.<br/><br/>By special arrangement with noted author and wargame designer Larry Bond, Fatal Choices contains an extract of Bond&rsquo;s superbly authentic and comprehensive Fear God &amp; Dread Nought naval wargaming rules providing the reader with all the rules, ship forms and tables needed to refight the historical battles and several credible what-ifs. See For Yourself scenarios examine historical battles such as Coronel and the Cocos Islands, as well as possible alternative fights such as Spee running into the Australian battlecruiser HMAS Australia or the old battleship HMS Canopus. Other scenarios examine what might have happened if the modern armored cruiser HMS Defence had joined the British squadron in time for Coronel or if Spee had a ventured to attack the British ships while they were coaling in Stanley Harbor instead of attempting to flee.<br/><br/>Fatal Choices also includes another entire set of rules, an extract of Minden Game&rsquo;s NavTac fast-play naval wargaming rules for those readers who are new to naval wargaming or pressed for time.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter edition of Fatal Choices also includes a special set of laser-cut ship counters including all the ships mentioned in the scenarios as well as play aids.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>In Great War at Sea: Triple Alliance, we explored the notion of Italy remaining true to her alliance partners, Germany and Austria-Hungary, during the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Staff officers from all three fleets prepared detailed operational plans, yet when war came in August 1914 Italy refused to join her Alliance partners and those plans would never be used.<br/><br/>The joint staffs foresaw an aggressive Triple Alliance, one attemtping to seize control of the Mediterranean from the British and French. Our book Triple Alliance looked at the first year of such a naval war in a set of 43 new scenarios for our Great War at Sea: Mediterranean boxed game.<br/><br/>Central Powers picks up that story in September 1915, with Italy, Austria-Hungary and Germany still struggling against Britain and France as new warships join the fleets of both sides. The fleets are almost evenly matched, with a slight Allied superiority in numbers matched by the Central Powers' central position. In this war, the fighting on the Mediterranean Sea has been just as bloody and destructive as that on the land fronts.<br/><br/>Central Powers is a book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on this naval war that never happened, but was probably more likely to have occurred than the actual events. It is not a complete game; ownership of our Mediterranean and Jutland boxed games and Triple Alliance, Dreadnoughts and Zeppelins supplements is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>The book includes 90 new playing pieces. The French receive their powerful Normandie- and Lyons-class super-dreadnoughts, and a pair of battle cruisers as well. And there's a quartet of French light cruisers proposed before the war but never built, that would have been very useful in fleet actions.<br/><br/>With the Royal Navy unwilling to detach too much strength from the Grand Fleet facing the Germans across the North Sea, it falls on the other Allies to bolster this very active naval front. The Americans enter the Mediterranean naval war with their oldest dreadnoughts and newest pre-dreadnoughts, plus a large squadron of the armored cruisers. The Japanese are present as well with a squadron of battleships and one of cruisers. Plus there are four re-armed Austrian light cruisers (there have to be Austrians) and an Italian seaplane carrier (with seaplanes).<br/><br/>The forty-two (42) scenarios continue the Triple Alliance story line through to the end of the Great War; since the book shares the special rules of Triple Alliance, we have more room for the story! It's a unique project, telling the alternative history of the entire Triple Alliance Mediterranean naval war in a series of game scenarios.<br/><br/>",

The &ldquo;M&rdquo; Armored Division would draw its personnel from battle-hardened Blackshirt veterans of the Eastern Front, and be equipped with the very latest German-supplied weapons and vehicles.<br/><br/>The M Division received its weapons and began training, but never actually entered combat despite Mussolini&rsquo;s desire to show his German allies what motivated Italians could do when armed to the same standard as the German Army. Intended as a politically-reliable palace guard for Mussolini, Il Duce hoped the division could be made ready for combat in Tunisia, and then later pressed for its deployment in Sicily. When Mussolini fell from power in July 1943, the division was still not ready for action.<br/><br/>Blackshirt Division is a supplement for Panzer Grenadier: An Army at Dawn, allowing Mussolini&rsquo;s boys to fight the Americans and British in North Africa. It is not a complete game: ownership of An Army at Dawn (and only An Army at Dawn) is necessary to play all of the 10 scenarios included. Blackshirt Division also includes 88 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces.<br/><br/>",

The name of the game implies an holistic understanding- learning as part of the human system as well.<br/><br/>Game Features: HoliMaths X is an educational family card game that allows the interaction of several players and encourages social interaction, as opposed to learning multiplication only through memorization, which is individual and not a collective or group process that isolates more than unites. Since it has 10 different ways of playing, the game has multiple variations; some are hard even for adults, thus, a fun and simple but challenging, mindful and expansive game recommended for all ages.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game, based on Problems-Solutions solving, helps develop logical thinking, decision making and problem solving in children in their learning stages, plus the development of strategies to earn points and solve problems. The game includes HelpCards as aids to find solutions which allows the child to eliminate the anxiety or stress that can be caused by not remembering the result of an operation through memorization alone.<br/><br/>It is a tool designed for association and pedagogically meaningful learning. It helps develop tolerance to frustration, healthy competition and the development of strategies throughout the game to solve problems.<br/><br/>Alternatives for playing the game: The game has 10 alternatives that can be played which allows the child to practice mathematical operation of multiplication in different manners ensuring the continued use without boring the game participants.<br/><br/>Meaningful learning is learning that students understand while they are learning. Meaningful learning is the leading trend for more useful and significant learning and how it is retained. This learning serves as to use what they have learned in new situations, in different contexts, so more than memorizing, this learning must be understood asimilated. Meaningful learning is thus opposed to mechanical learning.<br/><br/>This Foundation certifies: The game HoliMaths X is an innovative educational tool for comprehensive learning of the mathematical operation of multiplication. Our Foundation recommends it as a learning tool for organizational, familiar and educational environments.<br/><br/>We will summarize one of the ten ways to play, the &quot;original&quot; game play:<br/>6 problem cards and 6 solution cards are given out to 2-6 players. You must try to match the cards through its correct multiplicating result, after being able to have two matches in hand, you can lower them for everybody to see. You can use the wild cards as whatever you need. Now we are playing!<br/>On every turn you get a new problem and solution card or you can use the top card of the discarded ones of each.  <br/>Everybody will do the same and now the game shifts into a drafting card game with multiple possibilties to &quot;give problems&quot;, be very alert to commutation and holimaths special plays in which strategy of what cards to play or keep, while combining with the wild cards that are on the table, that can be replaced in your turn if you happen to have the card it represents, along with making decisions on who to play your cards to, giving it an interesting pace, along with the alertness, strategy, logical thinking needed to win the game. <br/>Luck is not essential and even if it takes a couple of rounds for you to have the two matches that allows you to interact, you can turn it around with the correct cards and awareness, and win the game which is won by the player that gains the most points. Each card has a symbol which has to with how much that result is present in the game. There is a symbol score card with how many points each symbol on each card is worth. Value depends of how many times that result is available in the deck. Thus, prime numbers are worth the most. <br/>It may sound hard, but guys, this is a kids game...this is very easy to understand in a single 20 minute game play. <br/>The game ends when any player has no cards to play and no unsolved problems. There will be positive and negative points based on the symbols of every card. Simple to add up and to continue with another game or skip to the other 3 strategy games or the other 6 training ways to play HoliMaths X.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this cooperative dice game, players direct a team of six female Knights of the Round Table (a number of Player Knights equal to the number of players, plus enough Questing Knights to make up the remainder) on a quest to obtain the Holy Grail. Each Knight has its own special ability that may prove useful during the team's adventures.<br/><br/>The Knights travel a path through the countryside, rolling dice in an attempt to gain valuable items that will score points or aid in future battles. At the end of the path, the Knights must roll dice to engage a Boss Monster in combat. All the while, the Knights must contend with worldly corruption, represented by Karma tokens. Any Knight who gains too many Karma tokens is too corrupt to obtain the Holy Grail and is eliminated from the quest.<br/><br/>Each Boss Monster battle represents the end of one round. After 3 rounds (Easy or Normal difficulty levels) or 4 rounds (Hard difficulty level), the Knights face one final trial to obtain the Holy Grail. If any Player Knight is eliminated due to too much corruption, or if the Knights fail to defeat the final Boss Monster, the players immediately lose. If the players pass the final trial and obtain the Holy Grail, they win. Victorious players may calculate a final score based on the items and successes gained during the game.<br/><br/>",

I&rsquo;ve been quite busy expanding here, let me show you.&rdquo;<br/><br/>He opens a hatch behind the bar and urges you to step down a ladder into what you assume must be a secret room below. As you descend the ladder the scent of spices, perfume, and other exotic wares you can&rsquo;t quite place greets you. The room is as exquisite in decoration as it is in fragrance, and inside is a group of a dozen or so outlandish individuals.<br/><br/>&ldquo;These are some of the friends I met while sailing the seven seas&rdquo;,says the infamous innkeeper. &ldquo;Like myself, each of them is uniquely skilled and they&rsquo;ll gladly work for you.<br/><br/>But their trade doesn&rsquo;t come cheap; it will cost you pepper...&rdquo;<br/><br/>HIRING CHARACTERS:<br/><br/>Characters can be bought for a single unit of pepper at Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove during the harbor phase. Players may always look at the stack of available characters, and when they buy a character they may choose it from the stack themselves. Players may have any number of character cards.<br/><br/>TURNING CHARACTERS FACE-DOWN:<br/><br/>Each character has a unique effect but only functions as long as it is face-up. Characters can be turned face-down in the following four ways:<br/><br/>1-When you board another players&rsquo; ship with your crew and win, for each cargo of the losing player you decline to steal you may choose a character of that player and turn it face-down.<br/><br/>2-When you bombard another players&rsquo; ship with your cannons and win, for each ship segment of the losing player you decline to damage you may choose a character of that player and turn it face-down.<br/><br/>3-&lsquo;The Artful Assassin&rsquo; can be used to turn a character of another player face-down.<br/><br/>4-&lsquo;The Sneaky Stowaway&rsquo; has to be turned face-down when it is used.<br/><br/>TURNING CHARACTERS FACE-UP<br/>Face-down characters can be turned face-up again in the following three ways:<br/><br/>1-In the Republic you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase.<br/><br/>2-In the Orient you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase.<br/><br/>3-At Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase if you have &lsquo;The Infamous Innkeeper&rsquo; and it is face-up.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Race to the middle of the board by moving your tiles like chess pieces.  With timely moves, you can place your opponent in a state of DURESS!<br/><br/>Duress is a two-player strategic board game.  It is intended for adults and children ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>Each player has 16 tiles with different letters (A through P).  These same tiles are arranged as Goal Pieces in the middle of the board.  The Goal Pieces are arranged symmetrically, equidistant from the two players.  Once a layout is selected, the Goal Pieces are arranged in a random order.  The two players may also decide to take turns selecting the placement of the individual tiles, which adds strategy to the game.<br/><br/>There are also Movement Pieces corresponding to chess pieces.  In a classic game of Duress, there are 16 Movement Pieces: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, and 1 king.<br/><br/>Once the Goal Pieces are arranged, the two players take turns.  In a single turn, the player:<br/><br/>a) Selects a Movement Piece at random.<br/><br/>b) Selects one of the tiles to move.<br/><br/>c) Moves the selected tile to a new location based on the Movement Piece.  Other tiles can block the movements of the pieces, creating opportunities for strategic play.<br/><br/>Players score points by landing their pieces on the corresponding Goal Pieces before the opponent can get there.  So, the two A tiles are racing to reach the A in the Goal Pieces.  The same goes for each letter.<br/><br/>A player wins the game by scoring a majority of the points.<br/><br/>There are many opportunities to change the structure of the game:<br/><br/>a) Each game randomizes the order of the Goal Pieces, creating a different strategic challenge for the players.<br/><br/>b) Players can take turns selecting the order of the Goal Pieces, creating additional strategy.  When one player goes first in the selection, and the other goes first in moving pieces, the potential for a first player's bias can be mitigated.<br/><br/>c) The players may create alternative layouts for the board.<br/><br/>d) As an alternative, players may select and hold 3 pieces.  This allows for planning moves in advance.  With each turn, the player will select one of the three movement pieces, move a tile, return this piece to the bag, and randomly select a new one.<br/><br/>With many potential variations, no two games of Duress are exactly alike.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "September 1994 - This set added a lot to the game of Spellfire.  First and formost, Dragonlance became the 5th world of Spellfire.  Also, this is the set that first started denoting champion race.  This included dwarves, elves, and kender (there still is only 2!).  This caused much of the past cards to get bluelining, which means that even though Drizz't Do'Urden doesn't say Elf(Drow), he still is.  Another major concept never fully followed up on was cards that were effectively based on the time of day outside of the game (such as various wizards of the _____ robes, Dagger of Night (#65), and Time Shift: spells) .  We also had the first time we use what is now the standard chase configuration (1 chase per 4 packs).  This gave TSR many headaches, as apperently the boxes were poorly labeled and many purchasers thought that it was a chase a pack.  Finally, the last big advance that this set gave us swimmers, who were champions that could attack realms other than the lead one if the realm showed coastline, and earthwalkers, champions who could attack any realm regardless of position (but not restrictions).  Again, this was the cause of much blue-lining in the original Spellfire Reference Guide.  Landmark Cards: Mithas (#1); Reorxcrown Mountains (#15); Raistlin Majere, Wizard of the Black robes (#31); Flint Fireforge (#37); Brine Dragon (#45); Blamblower (#56); Bronze Dragons (#97); Crossed Blades (c#8); Takhisis's Helmet of Power (c#18); and Medallion of Faith (c#25).<br/><br/>",

Thanks to Clem and Yann who generously gave precious advice and granted access to the rich graphic library of Devil Pig, I have been equiped with both intel and means to embark on this adventure which is in all quite new to me.<br/><br/>But where to begin? Clearly, the problem was not finding an idea but choosing the right one from my vast amount of ideas&hellip; The arrival of the FFI dice and order tokens tilted the balance. Reading up on the subject along with finding several internet images pertaining to the French Resistance provided inspiration. My vision on how this page of our history is intertwined with the secret war in the universe of Achtung Cthulhu prompted me to create a new FFI unit and different options.<br/><br/>For a long time I wanted to expand this faction so as to turn it into a complete and in certain cases independent army. Initially made to represent only the French Resistance, an FFI army can be used to depict any group of civilians that has taken up arms, regardless of their nationality in the scenario or whether they are deployed in the HoN or SoN universe. I spent many hours in front of my screen, with trials and errors, corrections, new attempts&hellip; So finally today, I have the pleasure of presenting to you, my first punchboard. It is approved by Yann and Clem and validated as an official DPG product.&quot;<br/><br/>",

From your lofty perspective, movies only amount to a few ideas thrown together and backed up with several million bucks so they can lure different demographics into the theaters. The real trick is in timing your movie&rsquo;s release so it can go down in history as a box office smash rather than a humiliating flop.<br/><br/>Big Picture is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that this game starts with a few materials: index cards, a print-out to track market trends, and a few coins. Players will modify cards during the game as they create the movies that will cement their place in the annals of Hollywood.<br/><br/>As movies are added to the deck, each future game will draw on the imagination of past games. The deck can grow indefinitely, preserving a legacy of movies and ideas. Players can return to the saga of their Hollywood executive careers over and over for gambles on brand new motion picture releases.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Wenn er den Wert des Pergaments an Willenspunkten besitzt, kann er damit den Erz&auml;hler 1 Feld auf der Legendenleiste zur&uuml;cksetzen. Das Pergament kommt dann aus dem Spiel. Er muss die Willenspunkte nicht abgeben, er muss diesen Wert nur besitzen. Sollte er den Wert nicht haben, bleibt das Pergament offen liegen. Er oder ein anderer Held kann sp&auml;ter zum Baum der Lieder zur&uuml;ckkehren. Wenn dieser Held dann den geforderten Wert hat, kann der Erz&auml;hler 1 Feld zur&uuml;ckgesetzt werden und das Pergament kommt aus dem Spiel. <br/>Wichtig: Wenn der Erz&auml;hler zur&uuml;ckgesetzt wird, werden Legendenkarten oder Kreaturenpl&auml;ttchen nicht erneut aktiviert.<br/><br/>Wer es noch ein bisschen leichter haben m&ouml;chte legt zus&auml;tzlich ein zweites Pergament verdeckt auf die Taverne (Feld 72). Dieses Pergament funktioniert auf die gleiche Weise.<br/><br/><br/>Hello everyone<br/><br/>The level of difficulty in &quot;The Legends of Andor&quot; increases steadily with each legend. That's why Legend 5 should be a real challenge. For all players who are a bit overwhelmed in the basic game version, I have written down a variant that will allow you to lower the difficulty a bit.<br/><br/>Have Fun<br/>Michael Menzel<br/><br/>Legend 5 Game Variant: &quot;The Dragon Song&quot;<br/>Place one of the 6 parchments face down on the Tree of Songs (space 57). A hero standing on space 57 can activate the parchment. If he has at least the value of the parchment of willpower points, he can use it to move the Narrator back 1 space on the legend track. The parchment is then removed from the game. He does not have to give up the willpower, he just has to have that value. If he does not have the value, the parchment remains on space 57. He or another hero may later return to the Tree of Songs. If this hero then has the required value, the Narrator can move back 1 space and the parchment is removed from the game. <br/>Important: If the narrator is reset, Legend Cards or creature tokens will not be reactivated.<br/><br/>If you want to have it a bit easier, put a second parchment on the tavern (space 72). This parchment works in the same way.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first player successfully use all the cards in their Win Stack (usually 10 cards) to build Sequence Stacks in the center of the table.<br/><br/>The game is broken into rallies, where all players are able to simultaneously place cards from their hand, discard, and Win Stack in piles on the table in sequential order from one to ten. A rally ends when the play reaches a stalemate because players are either unable to continue building on stacks or they choose not to.<br/><br/>After a stalemate, the next player starts another rally by drawing cards for their hand until they reach 5 total cards and they play more cards. The standard deck comes with 3 nut card variations that spice up the game play.<br/><br/>Wild nut- Can be played in place of any numeric card. <br/>Draw Two Nut(double nut)- Also can be played in place of any numeric card, but the player selects a victim that must immediately add two cards to their win stack from the draw deck. <br/>Swap Deck Nut- Also can be played in place of any numeric card, but the player selects a victim with whom they immediately exchange win stacks- for better or worse.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

He wagered Poland&rsquo;s allies of France and Great Britain would once again cave-in to his demands and not oppose his invasion. Even if they did, a lightning-fast war (blitzkrieg) would make mote any of their objections once the rival to the east was subjugated. That a mutual defense treaty stipulating an invasion from the east by the Soviet Union only &ldquo;sealed the deal&rdquo; and further secured Hitler&rsquo;s risk.<br/><br/>Lances and Steel is a war game simulation of the battle fought near the town of Mokra during the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany.  The area was held by the Polish 7th Infantry Division and the Wołyńska Cavalry Brigade supported by the Smialy armored train and the 21st Tank battalion. The German attack here sought to separate the Polish Lodz and Krakow Armies and effect a breakthrough to the Polish rear areas. The first major battle of WWII was fought here.

Will your actions pay off or will your livelihood be swept away with the changing wind?<br/><br/>Storm Chasers is a hand management, tile manipulation game for 2-4 players. In Storm Chasers, players manipulate the weather across region tiles to maximize their film footage of Thunderstorms and tornadoes as they sweep through regions.<br/><br/>In a turn, a player can use cards in their hand to benefit themselves or to affect other players. They can move from one region tile to another to increase the number of regions they will view when a storm is activated. They can flip/rotate tiles to create longer storm fronts, maximizing their potential income, and change the type of storm to strategically meet their goals. Players can clear rubble left from previous tornadoes, and complete special assignments to earn additional income. A player's turn ends by activating a storm using a card from their hand. Income or loss of income due to damage are subsequently dealt to each player who is affected by the activated storm. But players should be careful not to get to sure of themselves. The competition is fierce, you never know when a competing storm chaser might surprise you by adding an unanticipated challenge.<br/><br/>After 4-6 rounds (depending on player count of 2-4 players) the player with the highest earned income value wins and is awarded the coveted &quot;Eye of the Storm Award&quot; for excellence in extreme weather videography.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Pair it up with lower initiative tanks that can shield it from enemy fire and a radio operator with Signal Boosting to improve the initiative of every other tank in your platoon.<br/><br/>Inside the M10 Wolverine Expansion Pack, you will find a highly detailed, assembled, pre-primed plastic M10 Wolverine tank miniature and tank card. Your tank can be further personalised to match your requirements using the five crew, module, and upgrade cards included.<br/><br/>",

The banished Grim Reapers wish nothing but regaining their power, so they assemble secretly, endeavoring to take back their control over the Reaper&rsquo;s Realm through a mysterious sacrificial ritual. However, the assembly room is already penetrated by the Jokers --- the orders of the offerings are disrupted, and the real class of the offerings can&rsquo;t be identified! The clock is ticking, and the right moment for the ritual is about to pass. The Exilers have no choice but to start a &ldquo;Life-and-Death&rdquo; battle with the Jokers&hellip;&hellip;<br/><br/>&quot;Vitamors Conspiro&quot; is a social deduction game of hidden loyalty. Players take the role of either the &ldquo;Exiler&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Joker&rdquo;, through &ldquo;Offering Up a Sacrifice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Start the Ritual&rdquo; to attain victory. Players may start the ritual whenever the number of the character cards on the altar meets the requirements; however, to start the ritual successfully, the combination of the character cards have to be correct, too. That means players may also win the game by cheating their opponents, misleading them to start the ritual with a wrong combination and cause the ritual to fail.

This is one of the few games where you must defeat Batman, and that gives the player the opportunity to play as dozens of characters. The players will put themselves in the shoes of the most iconic Super Villains of Gotham City: The Joker, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, The Penguin, Bane, Poison Ivy, and The Scarecrow. The goal? Escape from an iconic institution of Gotham City: Arkham Asylum.<br/><br/>Batman: Escape from Arkham Asylum offers the funny and wild vision of the comics of the Batman universe and introduces a novel element: confronting Batman. Players must join forces to achieve their common goal. However, each one of them will have their own hidden objectives, which can range from escaping on their own or sowing as much chaos as possible in the asylum, something they must achieve to gain an advantage over their companions and be the one who finally wins the victory.<br/><br/>The players choose a Super Villain and play their turns one after the other. In each of these turns, the players can perform different actions such as moving around on the board, attacking their enemies with crazy weapons, searching rooms or crafting tools to use in their escape. The game ends when the players escape or when everyone is defeated by the forces of order that run Arkham, from the tough guards of the complex to, of course, the Dark Knight himself.<br/><br/>",

In response to General Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s bold offensive the British-led Allied forces launched a counter offensive to defeat the Axis forces that were besieging Tobruk. Dubbed Operation Crusader, the Allied attack was launched on November 18th and caught the Axis by surprise. However, Rommel reacted quickly by withdrawing his armored forces into an arc that stretched south and west of the crucial port. The British armored units groped their way forward attempting to identify and fix their enemy&rsquo;s positions. Late on November 18th units of the Italian Ariete (Ram) Division were discovered near the village of Bir El Gubi. The 22nd Armored Brigade (Stags), a recently deployed unit to the North Africa, was ordered to attack. In the past, British tanks had sent the Italians into head-long flight and a repeat was expected. Instead, the Italians had dug in and were prepared to fight.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counter parts?

        "description": "On March 9, 1862, the clash of the ironclad gunboats CSS Virginia and USS Monitor at the Battle of Hampton Roads heralded a new age of naval warfare. The innovations of the early industrial era yielded powerful new warships, armed with strong new guns, and plated with thick metal armor. A new ironclad navy threatened to revolutionize the practice of naval warfare, rendering old wooden fleets obsolete.<br/> This solitaire book game explores the use of ironclads during the American Civil War through a series of scenarios that teach the system gradually. In seeking to capture essential qualities of the battles in a fast and playable system, many aspects of these conflicts have been abstracted. Simplicity and ease of play have taken precedence over intricate rules and historical detail.<br/><br/>Each scenario consists of a playsheet (left) and mapsheet (right), and features a short historical introduction. The scenarios, which each usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, walk you through the rules. As you progress from scenario to scenario, new rules will be added, basic rules will be upgraded to &lsquo;standard&rsquo; or &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; status, and scenario-specific rules may come into play. By the end of the book, you&rsquo;ll have experienced the game system in full, and perhaps something of ironclad history as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Great European War is a Strategic level two-player wargame of an alternative World War II in Europe, based on the premise that Adolf Hitler did not order the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Instead, the Axis goes over to a naval-air offensive against the British with additional operations in North Africa and the Middle East, while waiting for America to enter the war and keeping a watchful eye on Stalin who may intervene.<br/><br/>The game assumes that the Western Allies decide on a Europe First Strategy, diverting forces and logistics from the Pacific. The Axis is under pressure to win the war before economic collapse sets in, the Allies to win before the Japanese seize too much of the Pacific. Given the shift in Axis logistics and planning against the British Empire and the US. only the westernmost Soviet Union is shown on the map, but there is emphasis on North Africa and the Middle East.<br/><br/>There are two players: Axis and Allied (to include the Western Allies and the Soviet Union). Both players can develop orders of battle by expending Mobilization Points. The game shows the war in Europe during the early and mid-war years before the full Allied buildup. Both sides will be fighting a war which is markedly different from that fought in the historical event. The game ends in 1943, the time when the Western Allies originally planned to return to Europe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In L&oacute;ng Soul, you play as a water dragon competing to return honor and good fortune to your island-dwelling creators. Your gameplay is influenced by your dragon's elemental alignment, and you will need to gather raw elemental rings from the sea purifying them at elemental shrines. Once the elemental rings have been purified, they are placed onto your island, protecting your creators and also scoring you points. May the best water dragon win.<br/><br/>L&oacute;ng Soul provides a new spin on the classic archetype of resource drafting and set collection by funneling resource gathering through the player's dragon avatar on the gameboard. The 3D board physically holds all of the ring resources, stacking them up to four rings deep, so you peer into the depths of the board and examine how these rings are stacked when making plans for future turns. As the game arc advances, new late game mechanisms will emerge as a result of the evolving board state.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they must fly, then do one of three actions: ability, shrine, scale. Flying is a single point-to-point movement adhering to the 5x5 grid, often gathering a single ring. An ability is a positional puzzle for your dragon avatar to solve with the potential to gather two rings. Visiting a shrine is your opportunity to convert gathered rings into points on your player board. Shedding a scale is an alternate path to pursue to gain points, taking advantage of particular board state opportunities.<br/><br/>When you're done with the game, simply reload the 3d board for storage and affix the lid to enable a quick set-up next time you play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each round consists of eight tricks--four played in the Calais, France location and four in Trondheim, Normay--with a final ninth trick, that you're trying to lose, played in Normandy.<br/><br/>Between rounds, if you've played tactically then you can earn upgrades that help modify your future cards. But be forewarned because you'll draw periodic setback cards that might well turn a winning position into a loss.<br/><br/>While you want to win tricks in Calais and Trondheim, winning in Normandy will eventually clue Germany into its importance to the Allied forces. So every Normandy win requires you to fill in spaces in a limited polygonal area. If you can, then you continue your campaign. But if you can't fill in the required boxes, you lose.<br/><br/>Fortitude is a trick-taking and write game that asks if you can successfully deceive the Germany military intelligence long enough to ensure D-Day happens as planned.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Standing against them is the Last Sovereign, who attempts to surmount the odds and constantly tries to divine the Fates' next move.<br/><br/>Each round, the Last Sovereign makes a prediction while the Fates choose a god to corrupt - represented by the Arcana cards. The Fates then plays the chosen card onto the Spread, on either its Corrupted or Sanctified face, depending on whether the Sovereign's divination proves true. Every god has their own unique effects; flipping, moving or otherwise manipulating other Arcana cards and the Spread. Should adjacent Arcana sum to 10, they will bind together, locking them in place. After nine short-but-tense rounds, the game moves to its conclusion, where the player with the most cards aligned to them wins.<br/><br/>No two cycles of Arcana Proheptia are identical - each of the arcana feature three different aspects, and the Fates can choose a face card that warps the game in unique, fun ways. Likewise, while the Last Sovereign often finds themselves on the back foot, they're not without tools. With a limited arsenal Sigils and the Relic of the Dead God, they must work to have predictions strike true, lest the pantheon falls to chaos.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Elevator Pitch<br/><br/>Case #27 is social deduction game, meaning that the people around you will be participating in the game--although they will not know they are involved.<br/><br/>In Case #27, you are a private detective, hired to solve a murder which the police have given up on. You must question your friends, relatives, acquaintances, or even strangers about their whereabouts at the time of the murder, as well as dredge up some information about their lives, in order to determine who the murderer is. Have casual conversations with them, ask innocent questions, but don't let them know that they are murder suspects!<br/><br/>Number of Players<br/><br/>One.  However, this solitaire game requires the player to speak with at least five other people.<br/><br/>Expected Play Time<br/><br/>Anywhere between 30 minutes and several days, depending on how often you speak with people.<br/><br/>The Longer Pitch<br/><br/>To play, print out the Case #27 PocketMod and put it in your pocket, along with a pen or pencil. Go about your day, having casual conversations with those around you. When someone asks you &quot;How are you doing?&quot; or a derivative thereof, that triggers the start of the game. That person is designated as the murder victim. You must now find out where they died, how they died, who killed them, and why.<br/><br/>As you go about your day, other conversations you have and other people you encounter will give you further clues. Piece together the evidence to bring the guilty party to justice!<br/><br/>Record your evidence on the PocketMod. Once you have solved the case, post your results online to reveal the murderer!<br/><br/>The Explanation<br/><br/>This is an idea I've had for a long time. I wanted to encourage gamers who are naturally shy or reserved (ahem... like myself) to have conversations with those around them. I thought it would be fun to have a game where the player's conversations with others and the things happening around them would trigger events or give the player tools to solve problems in the game.<br/><br/>Detective stories largely involve the protagonist going around having conversations with people in order to gather clues. That's easily translated into a game that can fit into one's pocket or purse!<br/><br/>I came up with different &quot;triggers&quot; that will give the player pieces of evidence. For example, the first suspect you encounter will be the first person to say some derivative of &quot;Hello&quot; to you once the game has begun. This will force the player to carry on a conversation with that person to find out such things as: where they were during the time of the murder, how they knew the victim, and whether they possessed the murder weapon.<br/><br/>Try to innocently ask people questions without giving away the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The set utilizes new oversized Plane cards, cards that are based on various locations (Planes) within the Magic multiverse, to modify the rules of gameplay.<br/><br/>To play a game of Planechase, each player needs his or her own planar deck, consisting of at least 10 different oversized cards. The players may also use a &quot;shared planar deck,&quot; which requires ten cards per player. Players cannot use more than one plane with any given name. When the game begins, the player going first reveals the top of his or her planar deck (or the shared planar deck), which is the plane the game starts on. Each plane card has a name, a type, one ability that applies at all times (either to all players or to whoever is the turn player at the time), and one &quot;Chaos&quot; ability.<br/><br/>Players also need a six-sided die, called the &quot;planar die.&quot; Each Planechase pre-constructed deck comes with a &quot;planar die&quot; that has four blank faces, one &quot;Planeswalk&quot; face with the &quot;Planeswalker&quot; symbol, and one &quot;Chaos&quot; face with its own symbol unique to Planechase. During a player's main phase, that player can roll the planar die, with three possible outcomes. A blank roll of the planar die does nothing. If &quot;Chaos&quot; is rolled, the &quot;Chaos&quot; ability of the current plane card triggers. If the &quot;Planeswalk&quot; symbol is rolled, the player &quot;planeswalks away&quot; from the current plane (put it on the bottom of its owner's planar deck) and he or she reveals the top card of his or her planar deck, which becomes the new plane that has been &quot;planeswalked to.&quot; A player can roll the planar die as many times as he or she likes, but successive rolls cost an additional one mana for each time the planar die has been rolled this turn.<br/><br/>Other than the above, the normal rules of the game are followed, and Planechase can be adapted to any multiplayer variant.<br/><br/>",

Your rivals can build next door, and they just might take you over with a clever paint job or a lucky roll of the dice. Buy, sell, trade, and gamble your way to the top as you build your empire along the storied Strip. Channel your inner casino mogul and build your piece of Paradise!<br/><br/>This new edition from the creators of the game features redesigned money, cards, tray, and more. All the rules and components are functionally the same as the classic edition, just with a fresh coat of paint in some cases. The new Lords of Vegas includes updated components and the 5 &amp; 6-player expansion Up!, which lets players build their casinos in three dimensions, adding new stories as their towers compete for control of the sky. Here are some improvements in the new edition.<br/><br/>-Plays with 2-6 players.<br/>-Contains 72 dice!<br/>-Risers and the raise rule are included, at any player count.<br/>-Streamlined property cards work seamlessly with Vegas, as well as the expansion boards for Americana.<br/>-More reference cards with turn orders, replacing the less useful House and Player cards.<br/>-Turn order has been streamlined based on years of player feedback.<br/><br/>",

You must use one of these editions in order to play this expansion.<br/><br/>Press your luck to find treasure and glory by exploring the eerie Abandoned Abbey!<br/><br/>Components<br/>&bull; 18 Abandoned Abbey cards<br/>&bull; 4 Abandoned Abbey Quest Goal cards<br/><br/>Setup<br/>&bull; Shuffle all the Abandoned Abbey cards into a single deck and set them face down on the lower Open Quest space on the table. In the game you will still put out two Open Quests at a time as usual, along with +1 Bonus Tokens, but these cards will now go side-by-side in the upper space.<br/>&bull; Flip the top Abandoned Abbey card face-up.<br/>&bull; Use the Abandoned Abbey Quest Goal cards instead of the regular Quest Goals. These cards list possible victory conditions and length of game. Choose one before beginning play and return the others to the box.<br/>&bull; To win the game using the Abandoned Abbey expansion, you must acquire the number of Quest points shown on the Quest Goal PLUS the number of Abandoned Abbey cards indicated on it. Fulfill the conditions of any single line on the Quest Goal to win -- the game can be won using fewer Quest points and more Abandoned Abbey cards, or vice-versa.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>1. Treat the Abandoned Abbey deck as a new kind of Quest.<br/><br/>&bull; Players may explore the Abbey as their Turn Action (&ldquo;Complete a<br/>Quest&rdquo;) if they occupy any of the four Regions diagonally adjacent to the Abandoned Abbey deck.<br/>&bull; Leave the Adventurer Standee in one&rsquo;s current Region when exploring the Abbey.<br/>&bull; Because entering the Abandoned Abbey counts as one&rsquo;s Turn Action, a player may not perform any Free Actions while in the Abbey. (Players may still perform Free Actions before and after.)<br/><br/>2. The Abbey is explored one card at a time. To do so, a player must discard a card symbol that matches the required symbol on the face-up Abandoned Abbey card. As with regular Quests, the symbol used must be an exact match -- using a &ldquo;double-symbol wild&rdquo; is not permitted. (Double-symbol cards and<br/>Curious Companion cards work fine as long as one symbol matches.)<br/><br/>3. After discarding the matching card, set the top Abbey card to the side, face-up -- do not claim it yet -- along with the reward shown on top of the card.<br/><br/>4. Immediately draw one card from your personal deck, as indicated on the Abbey card, to replace the card you just played. (!)<br/><br/>5. You must now decide if you wish to keep exploring, or stop. You must make this decision before revealing the next Abandoned Abbey card!<br/><br/>6. If you decide to keep exploring, flip over the top card of the Abandoned Abbey.<br/><br/>&bull; You must again discard a card with a symbol matching that on the face-up Abandoned Abbey card.<br/>&bull; If you succeed then return to step 3, above.<br/>&bull; If you fail, you lose all the Abandoned Abbey cards and rewards from this turn of exploration. This can mean losing multiple cards and rewards! (Do not lose anything already acquired in earlier turns of the game.)<br/>&bull; Return unclaimed rewards to the supply. Discard unclaimed Abbey<br/>cards to the bottom of the Abandoned Abbey deck, face-up.<br/><br/>7. If you decide to stop exploring, then claim all the rewards and cards received in this exploration and add them to your supply (keep Abandoned Abbey cards separate from your deck; turn them face-down). Players should keep track of all the Abandoned Abbey cards that they collect. Sets of these cards apply towards victory as shown on the Abandoned Abbey Quest Goal card. Combine totals for partnership games. Each player (or partnership) may collect no more than 7 Abandoned Abbey cards in total.<br/><br/>8. End the turn. No matter how the exploration ends, make sure that the top Abandoned Abbey card is turned face up after the turn action ends.<br/><br/>9. If Abandoned Abbey cards are ever depleted, reshuffle them to form a new face-down draw deck.<br/><br/>",

Kibbutzniks defending their homes, fighting alongside their wives. Homemade armored cars trundling into battle. Davidka mortar shells exploding with terrifying shrapnel--due to the soft metal used in the underground shops--with unexpectedly deadly results. The 1948 siege of Jerusalem. Numerous, well-equipped but poorly organized Arab armies.<br/><br/>It's all here in Genesis 48 in a well-researched and extensive module presentation. Three sheets of color die-cut counters include 20 troop-types ranging from elite Israeli Palmach soldiers to Moslem Brotherhood conscripts. Israeli Molotov Tank Hunting Heroes. And more. You also receive numerous new vehicles, including 3 types of Israeli Homemade armored cars, Davidka and Parosh mortars, the Marmon Herrington IV, Jewish 'Sandwich Car' APC, and a variety of half-tracks up-armed with small turrets and a variety of armaments. You also receive a 22&quot; x 34&quot; historical map of Old Jerusalem, a color overlay of a kibbutz, three color card-stock play aids and a 32-page VARIANT rulebook full of vehicle and ordnance notes. All of this equipment is provided to use with the Jerusalem Campaign Game and the 15 well-tested scenarios provided.&quot; (Ownership of ASL, Beyond Valor, Hollow Legions, and Croix de Guerre is necessary to play this game).<br/><br/><br/>Second Edition - GENESIS II The Arab Israeli Wars<br/><br/>From the Publisher:<br/>GENESIS '48 2nd Edition aims to polish every rough edge of its predecessor, while adding value in the form of new counters and situations. Rules such as the &quot;Molotov Tank Hunting Hero&quot; and others have been streamlined. Squad types have been reduced appropriately and redundancy in rules addressing their use edited down. Scenarios continue to use mostly non-desert, daytime situations and are moderate to small in size and play on geomorphic boards. An all new Kibbutz geo board is provided and a separate JERUSALEM '48 historical map-based module is coming with a fully remastered map that utilizes larger hexes than its predecessor. Thus, GENESIS '48 2nd Edition is a 100% geomorphic board product with 16 exciting scenarios and a LARGE COLLECTION of 1000+ of new counters!  In keeping with the CH approach used in the Berlin and Omaha releases successfully, all you'll need to own is your ASLRB and a collection of marker counters. EVERYTHING YOU NEED in terms of color, die-cut counters is provided in GENESIS '48 2nd Edition! Punch it out and play, no more hunting through tray after tray of old counters to get into the action.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1951, the Indian government commissioned the renowned architect Le Corbusier to design a new capital for the state of Punjab. Thus, Chandigarh was born.<br/><br/>In the game Chandigarh, players in the role of urban planners are in charge of building this modern city from scratch. They will construct buildings, try to take advantage of buildings constructed by others, use the abilities of the different municipal employees, and try to position themselves in the key locations of the city, all with the aim of achieving the patterns of the plans they have chosen. Whoever scores the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>In more detail, the city of Chandigarh is represented by a 4x4 grid of sector tiles, with each sector having multiple plots. These sectors intersect at junctions, with the edges of these tiles creating streets between the sectors. You each start with a project card that shows an arrangement of buildings, along with two different colored buildings from the four colors available; your architect starts on a junction in the city.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can move your architect up to the total numbers of footprints on your active project cards, stopping at each junction (if you wish) to place a building from your reserve on an empty plot next to a street that's adjacent to the junction you occupy. If you occupy the final plot of a sector, place one of your supervisors on this tile. Alternatively, on a turn you can choose a new project card from the display, placing it on the left or right side of your row of active project cards and taking buildings from the reserve based on the card you just placed and the card adjacent to it. If you now have four cards in a row, you immediately score the card at the opposite end of the row from the card you just placed. Score the points listed on this card each time the pattern on it occurs in the city.<br/><br/>Four specialist tokens start in the corners of the city, and if you construct a building of the specialist's color in the sector where they are located, you gain the power of that specialist for the remainder of the game and move them to a different sector. Each specialist has six different abilities, some that score you bonus points and others that give you special powers during play.<br/><br/>",

Historically, 45s were purchased to initially and eventually encouraged buyers to acquire the associated LP album or even another album from the band. In BI, players can acquire 45s by matching the band icon. Each 45 has an &quot;A-side&quot; with locked attributes that can be unlocked at the Listening Booth. At the Listening Booth, players will discard a magazine card with one matching icon to flip the 45 to its &quot;B-side&quot; giving the player more points and the opportunity to use the 45 to acquire LPs with similar attributes in future rounds. BI leverages the same collection rewards system (Pure, Mixed, Double Mixed) that comes in the base game and can be further integrated with Top Shelf, Publisher Expansion, Clearance Bin, or even the memorabilia from Masters of Metal!<br/><br/>For 6 the new bands (Half &amp; Half, Lead Balloon, Scarabs, The What, Rolling Bones, Pink Fluid), the following is included in this expansion:<br/><br/>     66 Magazine Cards<br/>     72 LP Album Cards<br/>     24 45s Cards<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Head for Glory is a fast-paced arena fighting-game set in an alternate-reality of ancient Rome, where headless Romans compete for the right to rule the empire as the new Caesar.<br/><br/>Each player enters the fight headless and has to choose out of a pool of 9 different heads, each with a unique ability or attack modifier. But the powers you choose may change by the swing of a sword. As you get decapitated you lose your powers and have to re-evaluate your strategy by changing heads.<br/><br/>When entering the final stage of the fight, Caesar's head enters the arena and grants the bearer special abilities. The fighter who can defend the head while not being decapitated, wins the game.<br/><br/>Determine your fighting style by enhancing your character traits. Your style will evolve during combat as you get to know the benefits of each trait and how to combine your abilities. Plan your attacks by moving on the hex-grid and by creating synergies of card-based abilities combined with your head abilities.<br/><br/>Expand your tableau and build your dice-pool. Draft your abilities, choose your fighting style and master each matchup as you play.<br/><br/>",

The 30 Photoghast cards are split into the equal number of players playing. With each player also dealt a set number of &lsquo;action cards.&rsquo;  Then, the dealer launches the Photoghast app on their phone.<br/><br/>Once the game begins, each player takes turns in scanning their cards in the allocated time in the hope of exorcising or &lsquo;fading&rsquo; each photo. Exorcise as many ghosts as possible. But beware, that camera shutter can stick, allowing more ghosts to be scanned by your opponent. Or even worse, you might scan the wrong card unleashing the ghost trapped inside.<br/><br/>Each card has its own point value system and every time one is scanned it&rsquo;s very own custom animation will be triggered.<br/><br/>Oh and here&rsquo;s the scary part. Play the game after 9pm and you run the risk of disturbing the original Photographer, which adds additional dangers. There's a 'safe' mode to allow you to play the game as usual after 9pm.<br/><br/>The game ends when the decks have been exhausted.  The player who has exorcised the most ghosts wins.<br/><br/>",

Situated probably atop Mont Auxois, above modern Alise-Sainte-Reine in France, but this location does not fit Caesar's description of the battle. A number of alternatives have been proposed over time, among which Chaux-des-Crotenay (in Jura in modern France) only remains as challenger today. This battle was fought by the army of the Roman Republic commanded by Julius Caesar, aided by cavalry commanders Mark Antony, Titus Labienus and Gaius Trebonius, against a confederation of Gallic tribes united under the leadership of Vercingetorix of the Averni.<br/>Alesia was the last major engagement between Gauls and Romans, and marked the turning point of the Gallic Wars in favour of Rome. The siege of Alesia is considered one of Caesar's greatest military achievements, and is still one of the classic examples of siege warfare and circumvallation.<br/>Now, in this game free to download and play, as Caesar, You will defend a system of ramparts, forts and awesome fortifications with units representing legion cohorts, leaders, archers, Germanic cavalry and, as Vergingetorix, you will assault the Roman besiegers with infantry and cavalry units from 46 Gallic tribes. The game system comes from the Ancients freeware game with some modifications.<br/><br/>",

The scenario book includes a brief introduction to the political and economic aspirations of the potential belligerents, and is followed by a discussion of their capabilities and military plans for the immediate future. There are 4 scenario sets containing a total of 26 engagements, many of which are suitable for solitaire play. The scenarios can be played individually or as part of a mini-campaign. And just in case 26 scenarios are not enough, a scenario generator for the hotly contested Spratly Islands is also included.<br/><br/>The fleet and air force lists contain all the platforms currently in service plus those expected to come on line over the next few years. Rounding things out is an extensive bibliography and reference section and errata for Harpoon 4 rules and data annex.<br/><br/>The Data Annex contains almost every platform available since 1980 as well as quite a few older ones that are now out of service. The vast majority of the data on the weapons and sensors are new and have previously not been listed in Harpoon 4. This wealth of information will allow the modern naval enthusiast to explore various combinations of systems, much as the nations involved do when preparing threat analysis.<br/><br/>",

The games are shorter than in Top Speed and are based on Kart racing.<br/><br/>All the components come in a single set as opposed to Top Speed, where the components are purchased separately (one team per player).<br/><br/>The rules are quite different from those in the Top Speed rulebook. For example:<br/><br/>- There is no Safety Car, Pit Stop or Drive Through penalty.<br/>- The number of laps for the race is smaller (usually 3-4 instead of 60).<br/>- You can fix your car by just passing a whole round, but you can only discard 1 damage card each time.<br/>- The maximum recommended number of players is 5 (but it accomodates more).<br/><br/>You can play TOP SPEED MINI with a Top Speed set, but not the opposite.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>- A small TOP SPEED board (one pad) depicting the Montmel&oacute; circuit (SPAIN).<br/>- A TOP SPEED deck of cards.<br/>- 8 cars in different colors (white, black, red, yellow, green, orange, blue, purple). <br/>- 8 color markers.<br/>- A carrying case.<br/><br/>",

Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions.  Campaigns are a series of skirmishes. In campaigns, players begin with a squad of recruit characters.<br/><br/>The game board for STA is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments.  The default game board is a destroyed urban setting.  Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid.  Characters use the grids for movement.<br/><br/>STA is a scenario driven game.  Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually a secondary or tertiary objective.  Players win skirmishes in STA by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.<br/><br/>Each character in STA is represented by a token and has a corresponding character card.  During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite status.<br/><br/>Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six factions.  The Combine and Marauders are part of the core game; the other four factions can be integrated seamlessly.<br/><br/><br/>     Combine: The Combine is the military arm of the government that rules over much of what is left of the world. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Echo: Echo is a faction lead by a secretive cabal of humans with psychic powers. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Erthen: Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Marauders: The Marauders are a loose-knit band of human rebels who specialize in guerrilla warfare. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Order of the New Dawn: The Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Soldiers of Light: The Soldiers of Light are humans who believe the fall of mankind was brought about due to a dependance on technology.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Probably this is because there is no explanation. It seems absurd that one of the four players should have to stand out of every game.<br/><br/>And if the game is one of skill, as is confidently asserted, its value is much diminished by the exposure of one of the hands.<br/><br/>In whist each player knew only what was in his own hand. He had to use his reason or his imagination to decide what was in the hands of his partner or of his two opponents.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBridge Without the Dummy.In the various forms of bridge his partner's hand is exposed once the bidding is over. Each player knows two hands, and so much of the real interest of the game is lost.<br/><br/>It is these things that have led to the invention of contract whist, or &quot;bridge without the dummy,&quot; as set out by Hubert Phillips in &quot;Contract Whist.&quot;<br/><br/>This is distinctly a whist game, since each player plays his own hand. There is no exposure of one hand, as in bridge. It is this, the author claims, which gives the game its special fascination. And, indeed, it is a sensible idea.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the bidding and scoring follow the lines of contract bridge, with changes and simplification.<br/><br/>As there is no recognised organisation to frame the rules of contract whist, the author has done it himself. He does not, however, claim to have invented the game. He says that the idea of bridge without the dummy has existed for years. The rule that only tricks actually contracted for can count towards the game is retained. The things rejected are, &quot;Vulnerability, the bidding of slams, and unnecessarily complicated scoring.&quot;<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe Scoring.The scoring suggested is:<br/><br/>(1) A game is secured by the first side that scores 10 points. Rubber is the best of three games.<br/><br/>(2) Points count toward game only when scored &quot;below the line.&quot; These are points for tricks which the declaring side has contracted to make. Tricks at No Trumps count 4 points each. Tricks at a suit declaration count 3 points each. Tricks made by the declarers, but not contracted for are scored above the line, and count only 2 each. Where a contract has been doubled or redoubled, the value of each trick is doubled or redoubled. Over tricks are 5 each doubled, and 10 redoubled.<br/><br/>(3) Where the contract is defeated the defending side scores [above the line] 10 points for each trick which the declaring side has failed to make. If the contract has been doubled the deficiency score is 20 points; if redoubled 40.<br/><br/>(4) Nothing is scored for honors.<br/><br/>(5) The side winning the rubber receives 50 points.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRubber of 100 Points.The average rubber is about 100 points in all.<br/>While the score is the same for all suit declarations, the preference in bidding is the same as in bridge--spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs.<br/><br/>Contract whist differs from bridge in that the play cannot be planned by the declarer from the outset.<br/><br/>The author gives many illustrations which suggest that contract whist could be made a most fascinating game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Long ago, the great Colossus of Argantheon stood upon one of the outer islands, its vast, outstretched arm pointing the way to the Crystal Pool, or so the ancient texts claim. Then, during some forgotten war, the Colossus was shattered, and its parts flung across the Archipelago, to lie in forgotten ruin.<br/><br/>In this expansion for Frostgrave: Ghost Archipelago, players lead their warbands through a series of interlinked scenarios in a race to discover the secrets of the Colossus. Along the way, they will encounter new monsters, discover new treasures, and even recruit a few new specialist warriors to their cause. Perhaps, if they are successful, the knowledge they obtain will help point them towards the ultimate treasure!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spring Awakening is a two player wargame of Operation Fruhlingserwachen, the final major German offensive of World War II. The German plan was to launch a two-pronged attack to secure a defensive zone for the Lake Balaton oilfields in northern Hungary. The offensive failed in the face of Soviet resistance, and the ensuing Red Army offensive swept into Vienna. While historically, the situation was dismal for the Third Reich, the objective is for players to do better than their historical counterparts. Each side is divided into two sub-commands. For the Axis, this includes the Nord Armee Kommando and Sud Armee Kommando, for the Soviets, the Third Ukrainian and parts of Second Ukrainian Fronts, as well as a Bulgarian army and a Yugoslav corps. The scenario starts on 6 March 1945 (the opening of Spring Awakening) and carries through to 16 April (following the Soviet capture of Vienna). Each game turn represents one week of operations. Each hex is 18 kilometers across. Most ground units are corps, representing two to five divisions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal is to take down the Shogun of the other player by moving your own pieces, similar to Chess or Shogi.<br/>However, it has the following distinctive features.<br/><br/><br/>     You are free to place the soldier pieces anywhere you want at the beginning of the game. The players take turns, placing 1 piece per turn. The placement of the pieces shall be determined with ever-evolving strategies while watching the moves and battle formation of the other player.  <br/>     There are only 3 different kinds of soldier pieces.<br/>     You are not able to move the pieces immediately during your turn. You may only move them according to the commands issued by &ldquo;cards&rdquo; in the previous turn. It is not guaranteed that the game pieces will move as expected. <br/>     When pieces of the same kind are aligned next to each other, either in a vertical and horizontal direction, you may move them together in the same turn, up to more than 2 pieces at once. <br/><br/><br/>For example, 3 Infantry pieces in a row may move forward at the same time or multiple Archer pieces may shoot arrows at the same time. In order to win, it is key to establish a good set-up/formation for yourself and break up the set-up/formation of the other player. <br/><br/>     After the initial placement,  the players decide in secret which game piece will become the Shogun piece, which is the defining piece for winning or losing the game. <br/><br/><br/>It is crucial to predict the Shogun of your opponent during the game play. <br/> In order to get a taste of being a real military strategist, we created this game for 2 players and added game elements that will hopefully remove unrealistic game elements that we had experienced in other strategy simulation games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

PBI uses a terrain map made from grid squares to address the old miniatures game problems of micro measuring and determining angles and line of sight.<br/>Army lists are provided that span all the major countries involved and several of the minor ones over the course of the war.<br/><br/>PBI uses a new recon system that is substantially different than the old one, and much faster to apply. Other changes have streamlined gameplay or cleaned up rules that were somewhat confusing in the previous edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It was New Year&rsquo;s Eve at the luxurious restaurant, The Osgood, which sits majestically atop a mountain ridge above a posh ski resort town in the Rocky Mountains. It had been snowing heavily since the morning, and the three-star chef George Osgood had closed his renowned establishment, as he did every year, in order to celebrate with his family and employees in an intimate setting.<br/><br/>At 63, George wanted to retire in the new year. That&rsquo;s why he announced that he would be revealing his successor this evening. Everyone was awaiting his decision with bated breath.<br/><br/>The two chefs, Marcus and Henry, both vying to be George&rsquo;s successor, served an impressive four-course menu. Everyone ate and drank copious amounts. The evening promised to be an unforgettable one.<br/><br/>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, George did not announce his successor during dinner, but by midnight, when the New Year was due to be welcomed with a glass of champagne on the terrace, the evening has taken an unfortunate turn. As the fireworks display over Aspen Mountain started flaring up on the horizon, the renowned chef was found dead on the terrace. Judging by the position of his body, somebody had thrown him head first over the balcony.<br/><br/>The police were informed immediately. Because of the heavy snow, they will not reach the on-mountain restaurant for another few hours. Until the authorities arrive, you are all on your own in solving the mystery. What happened this evening? How could this New Year&rsquo;s celebration have ended so tragically?<br/><br/>What is a murder mystery game?<br/><br/>You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.<br/><br/>You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.<br/><br/>Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.<br/><br/>Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.<br/><br/>GAME CONTENT:<br/>1 Game Manual, 7 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 7 name badges, 1 support code<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

No sooner had he left his home world of Somerset than Clan Jade Falcon attacked, easily conquering the planet and capturing his brother Andrew.

This sourcebook describes and illustrates in full color every character, BattleMech, and vehicle from the show. Detailed accounts of each of the original fourteen episodes include a complete plot synopsis and special background information, and designer notes offer FASA's perspective on the production of the BattleTech animated series. A section of BattleTech rules for the equipment and characters in the show, and scenarios based on the episodes make this book a valuable resource for fans of the game as well as the animated series.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This expansion was... probably inevitable. After all, if you have a cartoon series based on a wargame, then you need to have an expansion for that tv series, to help bring people into the game. This expansion has details of the equipment and 'Mechs used in the BattleTech tv series, which includes a number of 'Mechs already printed in other sourcebooks, and some equipment that's... unusual. While the gameplay value of some of this equipment is negligeable, it certainly has some novelty value. This is possibly of most interest to those who really liked the tv series or are BattleTech completists... and althouigh it's out of print, the current licence holder has it available in electronic form from their website.<br/><br/>",

The British will find that they need to be very aggressive to push through the anti-tank defense.  The Germans have to simply hang on.  Either way it's a cliff hanger.  Obstacle play is important and significant.<br/><br/>Game play is excellent for solitaire play and moves along very quickly.  The game is specifically designed to play in an evening or afternoon.<br/><br/>The Commonwealth forces drove straight into the anti-tank screen.  They were suckered into advancing into the anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns of the Germans behind the ridge and took heavy losses.

Unfortunately it seems that some evil blackguard had put a curse on it and you immediately found yourself inside your own kit. Now there's only one thing for it: construct your way out. And while you're at it, kill as many monsters and take as much treasure back to the real world as possible...<br/><br/>A print &amp; play card game where each card can either be a room on the map or an action. The best rooms are generally also the best actions, so you have to choose which is the best way to use each card. The card pool allows you to see up to 12 cards at a time, of which up to 4 will be immediately available for play, so there is a limited opportunity to plan ahead.<br/><br/>Dungeon Construction Kit - Cursed! was designed for the 2013 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>In this second expansion kit for designer Chris Taylor&rsquo;s tiny titan of a 4X game, Imperial Stars II, designer/developer Alan Emrich expands the boundaries of gameplay between the warring human factions. Building on the first expansion kit (which is required to fully enjoy this second expansion kit), there are new worlds to conquer with the addition of two new maps, each featuring coveted planetary systems (yielding double value). These balanced maps have proven very popular for their &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; they engender during gameplay.<br/> New Event and Technology cards broaden the story scope of the game, particularly with the introduction of Allies to the mix of outcomes. The Thaeon Order and the Free Settlers are off-map rivals who might send forces &ndash; but only sufficient to nudge the balance of power in your conflict. A new &ldquo;Event +6 Ops&rdquo; marker for each side increases the frequency that Events occur, so there are a few more surprises in every game!<br/> New player aid mats now uncouple the Alpha and Beta Zone costs from the map, so that you can experiment with different Ops costs to retrieve ships from them, and each mat includes a cost summary in the Scrap Yard for easy reference.<br/> As a final touch, we have included cubes to replace Planet markers on the board. In this way, you can draw Planet markers from a cup to ensure randomness. All this adds more epic to your space epic, as it can only be told in Imperial Stars II.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stonne 1940 - The Battle for the Stonne Heights: May 15-18, 1940 is an ASL based game, depicting the bitter battle for the crucial village of Stonne, and its dominating heights, during the battle of France, 1940. This is early war tank warfare with waves of B1 bis, H-39 and FCM 36 tanks sweeping into the village of Stonne with orders to force the issue and press the enemy back over the Meuse crossings.<br/><br/>Facing the threat of a collapsing front, the crisis facing the desperate French 2nd Army would be decided at the critical point at Stonne. If they could succeed and throw the Germans back across the Meuse, the enemy attack plan may well have failed. The German objective was to hold open the crucial Meuse crossings and seize the high ground at Stonne. Into this clash was drawn the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland, with its artillery and the attached Stu.Pi.Btl. 43. This elite formation would soon face waves of French tanks, including the heavy B1 bis, in heretofore unseen numbers in this classic and historic struggle.<br/><br/>Stonne 1940 includes a historical game map of the battlefield, special rules, six new scenarios, 32 die cut vehicle counters, and a Platoon Leader 2.1 campaign game.<br/><br/>Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10 and Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1 are necessary to play this game.<br/><br/><br/>A second edition was published in 2007. The second edition included a redone map, which is significantly nicer than the map in the original module. Also, the extra campaign games from Critical Hit Magazine are now included in the 2nd edition,along with a full 16 scenarios.<br/><br/>A third edition was published by Critical Hit in November 2011. The third edition appears to include the counters required for play if you do not own Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10, but you still need to own Beyond Valor. It is unclear whether anything else has changed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>Return to the world of the Second Great War, where Wilson&rsquo;s Peace ended the First Great War on Christmas 1916. Twenty-four years later war returned to Europe, with Russia, France and Italy seeking to overturn the settlement with a war of aggression against the Central Powers of Imperial Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.<br/><br/>Royal Netherlands Navy is the third book in our alternative history series, The Second Great War. In the first book, The Kaiser&rsquo;s Navy, we looked at the High Seas Fleet of 1940 and its campaigns in the North Sea and Atlantic. In the second, The Habsburg Fleet, the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Navy, alongside its Turkish allies, wages war in the Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>In this volume, the fleet the Dutch admirals hoped to build in our world, but could not get approved, finds itself pressured by the Japanese in the Far East and the British and French in Europe. Defending their rights with armed force, the Dutch find themselves drawn into desperate battles in the North Sea, North Atlantic, South China Sea and the interior waters of the East Indies.<br/><br/>In the 1930s, Dutch shipyards stood at the leading edge of naval technology: Dutch submarines first deployed the schnorkel breathing device, for example, and Dutch warships boasted the sophisticated Hazemeyer fire control system that would be enthusiastically copied by the Royal Navy and others.  The Netherlands had the industrial and financial means to create a large and modern fleet, and the oil wealth of Borneo and Sumatra provided the motive.  Seeing deficits as a more lethal enemy than the Axis, the Dutch government of our reality doomed both the home country and the colonies to defeat and occupation.  In the world of Wilson's Peace, things are a little different.<br/><br/>There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces from the old, out-of-print Spice Islands booklet, and 90 brand-new laser-cut pieces (scorchless and sootless!) for 300 total: 120 double-sized &quot;long&quot; ship pieces and 180 standard-sized ones representing task forces, aircraft and smaller warships. The Dutch fleet that never was is present, along with French, British, Japanese and German ships, aircraft and airships. Yes, airships!<br/><br/>There are also thirty new scenarios based on the battles that might have been waged by the Royal Netherlands Navy in this alternate world, plus more of the story of the Second Great War begun in The Kaiser's Navy and continued in The Habsburg Fleet. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Strike South and Eastern Fleet to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

In My Singing Monsters: The Board Game, players can choose one of five Monsters to represent them as they go from Island to Island, levelling up their abilities to be the first to cross the finish line.<br/><br/>My Singing Monsters: The Board Game, is a strategic worker placement set in the world of My Singing Monsters that is designed to grow with players&rsquo; skills. Players can start simple and add new components and rules over time. The expandable gameplay experience allows players to start easy and build up to a full-on strategy game. The evolving gameplay makes the game ideal for all players, from casual gamers and families to the more strategic and experienced board gamer.<br/><br/>After setting up the desired level of difficulty through the addition or subtraction of Islands, each player will draw three Single-Element Monsters that correspond to their selected player board. On a turn, players will place a Monster from their hand onto an available slot on an Island. Each Island has a different action which is triggered when a Monster is played on it. In addition to the Island's effect, players will breed a new Monster to add to their hand and receive Element tokens matching the Monster they've just played that. These Element tokens are placed on a Music card, that once filled, is scored to advance a player's position on the score track. The end of the game is triggered when a player enters the final row of the score tracker, denoted in green. All players will have one final turn before final scores are tallied and a winner is determined.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your survivors can be sent to the titular New Worlds in order to gain points and benefits.<br/><br/>OLD AUTHORITIES<br/><br/>The OLD AUTHORITIES module introduces much more indirect interaction between players with the introduction of 3 Councils that players fight over. Whoever works hardest to appease a Council, receives a special ability they can use every turn. This module greatly encourages early terraforming which influences the gameplay in interesting ways.<br/><br/>The NEW WORLD and OLD AUTHORITIES modules can be added separately to the base game or played together for deeper gameplay.<br/><br/>SOLO CAMPAIGN<br/>Dive into a multi chapter adventure and mark your progress in a dedicated campaign notepad. Each game of the campaign introduces some new twist, new challenge and with that new ways of going through the game.<br/><br/>You start your journey as a captain of a worn down ark and with each scenario you unlock upgrades and eventually new ships. A special card system determines the length of a scenario. The time it takes to complete is varied as are the tasks presented to you. Each completed task is worth experience points which allow you to perform upgrades on your ark. Each game session influences the campaign and shape of the galaxy. Your progress and game status is easily saved in a dedicated booklet which lets you come back and continue playing anytime you want.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Panzer Grenadier: Secret Weapons is a 64-page book supplement to the popular Panzer Grenadier series, looking at some of these laboratory products &mdash; all of which existed at least on the drawing board, and many of which actually saw service.<br/><br/>Origins Award winning author John R. Phythyon Jr. tells of odd programs like Germany's super-heavy tanks &mdash; vehicles like the 180-ton Maus tank and the equally huge Tiger III. None of those actually saw combat, but the world's first anti-tank guided missile, the German X7, apparently did.<br/><br/>Britain's huge tanks are also covered, with the slow and heavy Tortoise and the slow and heavy Black Prince. And there's the awesome Centurion, a design so solid it remains in service in some of the world's armies more than six decades later.<br/><br/>Plus we have flying machines. There are German Fl.282 helicopters (in three versions), Fa.223 helicopters (also in three versions) and the huge Fa.284 helicopter. Plus the P.1003 tilt-rotor aircraft, ancestor of the modern-day Osprey. Finally, German jets make an appearance to lend close support, including the Me.1099 attack plane fitted with a 55mm automatic cannon.<br/><br/>And there's more.

Some holes have special obstacles such as a tunnel, bridge, and a waterwheel. Everything slopes down to the center where a small golfer stands. He is controlled from the side of the board using a knob to pivot him in the direction you want, and a lever that swings his club. On your turn you place a metal ball in the depression in front of the golfer, aim him at the hole you're playing and shoot the ball. If you miss, the ball will drain down the slope and back into the depression. The player who finishes the course in the fewest strokes wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>ITEM POCKET, OKINAWA, 20 April 1944: As the afternoon wore on with &lsquo;G&rsquo; Company unable to release the Japanese grip on the Pocket, Lieutenant Colonel McDonough decided to send up &lsquo;E&rsquo; Company. At 1350 hours the company commander, Captain George R. J. Weigand, was ordered to move up between the two ridges, then turn left, using Fox Ridge as cover. The goal of the onslaught was Ryan&rsquo;s Ridge, or alternately the road cut west of Gusukuma. It was still assumed at that point that contact could be established with 1st Battalion. Weigand completed passing through Ryan&rsquo;s left flank and attacked east toward the crest of Ryan&rsquo;s Ridge, heading toward what the Company Commander thought would be a covered route to the top of the ridge. Weigand attacked in platoons, moving to the point with 3rd Platoon, under command of Technical Sergeant Ernest L. Shoeff. This platoon would find itself attacking alone, after a storm of enemy machine-gun and mortar fire forced the rest of the company to ground. Weigand, Shoeff, and two squads kept moving forward, using tombs at the foot of the hill for cover. Orders were communicated to Weigand by a runner: extend the line at all costs. The Captain and two men soon found themselves cut off from Shoeff and the remainder of the main body. For the rest of the afternoon the company commander was under constant fire and out of communications with everyone. After dark Weigand managed to make his way back to Fox Ridge and rejoin his company. His uniform was shot full of holes but Weigand returned uninjured.<br/><br/>ATS BLOOD &amp; IRON is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Okinawa. The center of the Japanese resistance in the area lay in the &ldquo;I&rdquo; section of Target Area 7777, which came to be called &ldquo;Item Pocket&rdquo;&mdash;in military terminology I is called Item. The pocket was the hub of the enemy position; from it, like spokes on a giant wheel, extended four low ridges, separated from each other by ravines and rice paddies. Potter&rsquo;s Ridge ran north from the hub, Charlie Ridge to the northeast, Gusukuma Ridge to the southeast, and Ryan Ridge to the southwest. Lying between Gusukuma and Charlie Ridges and sloping to the east was a cone-shaped hill called by the Americans &ldquo;Brewer&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo; A gulch ran along each side of the hill&mdash;Anderson&rsquo;s Gulch on the north and Dead Horse Gulch on the south. Both ran in an easterly direction, crossing Route 1 at small bridges just north of Gusukuma. The ground was superbly suited for active defense. Typical Japanese positions were connected by tunnels along the sides and under the crests of the ridges; Ryan Ridge, in particular, was honeycombed with such defenses. From Item Pocket the enemy had excellent command both of the coastal areas to the north and west and the open land to the east where Route 1 ran north-south. The Japanese had long been aware of the defensive value of this position against either a beach landing on the northwest or an attack from the north. Months before the Americans landed, Japanese troops and Okinawan laborers were boring tunnels and establishing elaborate living quarters and aid stations. The area was held by two companies of the 21st Independent Infantry Battalion of the 64th Brigade, 62nd Division, supported by an antitank company, a machine gun company, and elements of antiaircraft, artillery, and mortar units. At least 600 Japanese occupied the Pocket, reinforced by several hundred Okinawans. <br/>&middot; A collection of 517 color, die-cut counters representing the US Army and Japanese combatants that fought in the battle; <br/>&middot; SIX scenarios, ranging in size from small to large, that play on the historical map; <br/>&middot; A 22 x 34 color map of the ITEM POCKET battlefield on heavyweight stock; <br/>&middot; A complete ATS system rulebook tailored specifically to the game; <br/>&middot; Six Play Aid Cards; <br/>&middot; Battlefield Walkaround and Special Rules document (an ATS specialty!) <br/>&middot; A color cover (perfect for your rules binder) and a snazzy ziplock bag to hold it all.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Realms of the Unknown is a pencil and paper game where players take on the roles of Nobles or other leaders of a population.  They give orders to their troops and population, explore, invade other territory, encourage population growth, etc.  One player is the Realm Controller and sets up the Realm in advance, and gives the players the results from their orders.  The game is structured in a way similar to PBM games in that the players hand in their orders each day for a time period covering 1 week in the game.  There are rules for Population growth and characteristics; resources including livestock, mines, farms, logging, etc; Technology development, and combat.  Combat involves a series of formulas taking in as many factors as possible including number and training of troops, armor, troop types, leaders, weather, terrain, and other factors.  This results in a modified strength of each force.  When these are compared the relative strength determine losses for each side as well as the victor in the battle.<br/><br/>The rules come in two books - Player's Manual and Realm Controller's Manual.<br/><br/>See also the roleplaying game listing Realms of the Unknown<br/><br/>",

The 8 dark green tokens are identical on both sides, but the yellow and light green ones have a dot on one of their sides. The components are of excellent quality.<br/><br/>The system comes with four games:<br/>Menos: an evolution of solitaire where the player jumps over the pieces to remove them (for one player).<br/>Esca: a five-in-a-row game, where the board stands upright with the two players on either side. Players try to make 2 5-in-a-rows by placing their tokens, blocking and removing enemy tokens.<br/>Tremplin: a chinese checkers sort of game where players try to reach their respective goals by jumping over pieces. (2 configurations: for 2 or 4 players)<br/>Arriba: an original concept where the board is positioned at an angle. Players try to reach the top row but the holes become deeper and deeper towards it, so multiple tokens have to be positioned in the holes to create stepping stones.<br/><br/>",

It was a popular pastime of young boys when they were herding cattle of goats. The game is almost forgotten today. There were special terms for certain moves and various holes, but no one seems to remember them now.<br/><br/>The board was usually dug into the ground. The game was played with small pebbles or the seeds of the mubuthi tree (Caesalpinia volkensii).<br/><br/>Giuthi was first described in 1925 by the English ethnologue Orde Brown in his book The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Giuthi is played on two-rank boards numbering from five to ten holes per row.<br/><br/>The number of stones in each pit varies from four to nine. Four is preferred on the smallest boards, six on the medium-sized ones and eight on the larger boards. Nine stones per hole on a two-by-ten board gives the first player a big advantage and could therefore be regarded as a kind of handicap when two players of unequal strength are playing.<br/><br/>Each turn starts with a hole that contains at least two seeds.<br/><br/>The seeds are either distributed in the clockwise or the counterclockwise direction into the succeeding holes in the first lap of a move.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last seed) are distributed in another lap in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>If the last seeds falls into an empty hole of your own side, the player moves again, unless he has placed at least one seed into an enemy hole during this move.<br/><br/>If the last seeds falls in one of your empty holes and you have played into the opponent's territory (see proverb (bottom)), then you capture the seeds in the enemy hole just across and the last seed that was distributed.<br/><br/>If this empty hole is followed in an unbroken chain by more empty holes on your side, then the seeds in the opposite holes are also captured.<br/><br/>When the last seed falls into an empty hole of your oponent, the turn is over.<br/><br/>A player must move if he can. He must pass, if he can't, but must move again, if he has something to play with.<br/><br/>The game ends when no longer any moves can be made or when the board position repeats.<br/><br/>Each player scores as many points as he has captured seeds and as he has seeds in his holes at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player who has more points wins the game.<br/><br/>Variants:<br/><br/>The following board sizes were recorded by ethnologues: <br/><br/>     2 x 5 holes. Number of seeds not given. <br/>     2 x 6 holes with 4 seeds per hole. For beginners. <br/>     2 x 7 holes with 6 seeds per hole. According to Driedger a typical starting arrangment among the Kikuyu. <br/>     2 x 8 holes with 4 seeds per hole. Said to be the most popular variant when played on a casual basis. <br/>     2 x 10 holes with 9 seeds per hole. Quite unbalanced - the first player can capture 10 seeds in the first turn without being threatened in the next. <br/><br/><br/>The most challenging variant that is well balanced is played on a 2x10 board with 8 seeds per hole.<br/><br/>Giuthi proverb:<br/><br/>You can't steal the cattle of another man without entering his land!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scenario book for Nuts!<br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never been so damn cold. The snow was flying sideways like, we could hardly see a thing. I&rsquo;d never seen a Panther before, and hearing it clanking up put the fear into me, right to my toes. They hit us hard and fast, knocked us dead. Fierce, them SS Krauts. Even though they were people just like us, scared all to Hell, they fought like no one else. That was The Bulge to me; freezing cold, Kraut tanks, and horror. Horror all around me. Even when we started winning.&rdquo; <br/>-Conversation with Lee Johnson, 391st Engineers, Ardennes veteran.<br/><br/>On December 16th, 1944, three German Panzer Armies hurled themselves at surprised Allied lines in the Ardennes area. This desperate bid to drive to the English Channel for a second time, attempting to recapture the port of Antwerp and forcing the Allies to sue for peace, would be called The Battle of the Bulge. In the end, this massive offensive would fail, costing the Germans the war. But it could have gone differently. PEIPER AT THE GATES is a mini-campaign of branching linked scenarios set during the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper and the 1st SS Panzer Division towards the Meuse River.<br/><br/>Smash through all opposition as the Germans, capturing the bridges at Trios Ponts and driving into the American far-rear. Hold the Panzer advance at Stavelot, stopping them cold with a small rag-tag band of American fighting men. Fight the climatic battle of a lone King Tiger against massed Sherman tanks as Task Force McGeorge attacks the La Gleize Cauldron from the north. Play solo or with friends. Play the Germans. Play the Americans. But just play. The fate of the Western Front is in your hands.<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of Odin and his brothers in creating Midgard, the homeland of humanity from the remains of the vanquished ice giant Ymir. One player-god creates the seas and other the land masses.<br/><br/>The board is composed of 124 equilateral triangles; a 10 x 10 regular grid with 24 additional triangles attached to the middle eight cells along each of its edges.<br/><br/>Player turns alternate starting with the sea player. Each turn, players must place one of their tiles on an empty ice cell which may not share an edge with any other occupied cell and it may not be the center cell. The newly occupied cell is terraformed into a sea or land cell and influences the transformation of its adjacent cells. These adjacent cells are referred to as blizzard cells because what they will become is unclear. Later, sea and land tiles are also placed when regions of blizzard cells are completely enclosed. The blizzard cells are assigned to and terraformed by the player who exerts the most influence on the enclosed regions. A player&rsquo;s influence is determined by counting owned edges around the enclosed region. In the case of a tie, half the cells are filled with sea tiles and the other half by land tiles. The gods have decreed that this will always be possible when a tie occurs!<br/><br/>When the board is completely terraformed or a player has no more tiles in hand, the player with the most tiles on the board wins the game.  If the players tie for most tiles, the player occupying the most perimeter cells wins.<br/><br/>Detailed rules, a Flash MX implementation and a print-and-play sheet can be found in the File section.<br/><br/>Have fun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Transylvania, land of dark forests, dread mountains and black unfathomed lakes, still the home of magic and devilry as the nineteenth century draws to its close. Count Dracula, lord of corruption, master of the undead, and monarch of all vampires, is about to act on his long-contemplated plan for world domination.<br/><br/>Abraham Van Helsing, and his loyal vampire hunter companions, must battle against all manner of horror to save the people of Klausenberg and march upon Castle Dracula. Once inside, can they fend off the three bloodthirsty Brides, in order to infiltrate Dracula's secret tomb, deep within the walls of the ancient castle, and ultimately defeat the dreaded Prince of Darkness?<br/><br/>Consisting of one 90-card deck, the game pits four to eight players against each other. One team takes on the role of Van Helsing, assorted pitchfork-waving villagers, god-fearing priests, and various stalwart companions, and the other team assumes control of Dracula, the Brides, the Hound of Dracula, and numerous hissing, bloodsucking vampires. Each player must manage his hand of cards effectively to win. Gameplay is swift and slaughterous, with vampires staked, maidens drained, holy water administered, vampiric teeth exposed, and crucifixes brandished, frequently.<br/><br/>",

Soon, Clan Jade Falcon became a name to be feared. They seemed completely unstoppable. They piloted strange new 'Mechs. Their armored infantry, nicknamed &quot;Toads&quot; by their stunned opponents, were unlike anything seen before. They nearly killed the heir to the throne.<br/><br/>This ComStar document details the history and development of Clan Jade Falcon from their beginnings in the chaos of the Exodus Civil War to the battlefields of Tukayyid. Contains a complete roster of the invading Jade Falcon forces, along with personality profiles of prominent officers.&quot;<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Providing a counterpoint to the BattleTech: Wolf Clan sourcebook, the Jade Falcon sourcebook gives a crusader-faction viewpoint on some events before delving into the Jade Falcon part in the invasion of the Inner Sphere. Largely useful for background reference in use in MechWarrior, or in forming campaign scnearios for BattleTech/BattleForce. It also provided profiles for four new BattleMechs - the Baboon, Hellhound, Kraken and Vixen, which were reprinted in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3055 Upgrade a decade later.<br/><br/>",

In the future there shall be but one tribe on the island, that one which succeeds first to carry out my order given to you'-&quot; And all in a flash, the magicians found themselves home again and each holding an order of the Chief-Deity in his hand. And thus the last clash of the islanders -- our game -- began.<br/><br/>Each player is a sub-deity of a tribe and tries with the help of his fearful chieftains as well as with that of magicians with superhuman crafts to gain the victory in the last struggle of the savages of the Boomerang Island. And all this happens in the course of the breathtakingly exciting and sometimes humorous game on the lovely coloured fanciful playing field.&quot;<br/><br/>Design: Imre Vincze and the Pancserek<br/>Artwork: Zolt&aacute;n Tarn&oacute;czy<br/><br/>The game can be considered an unofficial Risk spinoff (or even clone) with a different theme, some added features and some different rules. The main difference is the presence of chieftains and shamans (aka magicians) that have a special (random and secret) power and can kill/teleport an enemy tribesman regardless of the dice rolls.<br/><br/>The board pictures an imaginery continent divided into 6 distinct countrysides with 42 areas total and most command cards that players must draw at the beginning of the game requires to conquer 2-3 &quot;countries&quot; of those.<br/><br/>It's very much like in Risk, but the board offers more variety both in area names and in relation to the rules. (Eg. one chieftain's special power lets you swim between lakes, another lets you recruit new tribesmen based upon board graphics.)<br/><br/>Playable by 1-6 players with special rules (victory conditions) for 1, 2 and 3 player games.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s played on the intersections (points) of a square board, which is initially empty. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white. &quot;Kopano&quot; is the Tswana word for &quot;connection&quot;.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTwo like-colored stones are strongly connected if they are orthogonally adjacent to each other, and weakly connected if they are diagonally adjacent to each other without sharing any strongly connected neighbor. Note that two stones of different colors are never considered to be connected.<br/><br/>A chain is a set of (weakly or strongly) connected stones.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayStarting with Black, the players take turns placing stones of their own color on empty points of the board, one stone per turn.<br/><br/>It's illegal to place a stone on a point where it makes a weak connection unless placing an enemy stone on that same point would also make a weak connection. It's also illegal to form a crosscut, i.e. a 2x2 pattern of stones consisting of two diagonally adjacent Black stones and two diagonally adjacent White stones.<br/><br/>If a player can't make a move on his turn, he must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. There will always be a move available to at least one of the players.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

Place the remaining artifacts as you place the final town marker(s).<br/><br/>3. CAMPAIGN PHASE<br/><br/>If you take control of a town with an artifact in it, place the artifact next to the gender tile of the hero that attacked the town.  You decide which side of the artifact is placed face up (artifacts have opposing terrain on each side).  That hero is now considered to be wearing the artifact.<br/><br/>Your hero wears the artifact until that hero is Vanquished.  You may not switch an artifact to it opposite side while your hero wears it.  If you Vanquish another hero who is wearing an artifact, then remove the artifact from that hero.  Your attacking hero may choose to wear it, if you wish.  A hero may never wear more than 1 artifact.  If you do not take an artifact, it remains on the space until any hero without an artifact wears it.<br/><br/>In a 2 player game no player may have more than 1 artifact.<br/><br/>An artifact allows the hero wearing it to use the heraldry symbols as a power bonus in battle.  If you play a creature in battle with a heraldry symbol that matches your hero's artifact, that hero gains +1 power when attacking or defending.  If you play 2 symbols that match your artifact in a single battle, then you may return 1 of your played creatures back to your hand (return 2 if 3 match, 3 if 4 match, etc).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In RPG Merchant Tycoon!!, players take the roles of optimistic start up entrepreneurs, looking to set up shops in the bustling villages, towns or cities spread throughout the world of your typical 8-bit RPG game. However, these said villages, towns and cities aren't big enough for the 2 (to 4) of yas'! So it's time to get busy and dirty, trading and searching for loot to fulfill the growing line of adventurers looking for some gear! Expand your shop, spend your Gold stock (or hoard it!) wisely, trade with other rival shops, keep secret Stock all to yourself, call in favors from your happy Clients.....do whatever it takes to clinch market Dominance and be the only show in town and start reeling in the BIG money! Who knows, maybe that Flaming Sword of Justice you just sold will be used by the Hero that will save the world?!<br/><br/>RPGMT!! is a 30-60min 2-4 Player high strategy card game in which the player's goal is to finish the game with the best balance between: The amount of Client's orders they were able to fulfill; the amount of Gold they personally have by the end; and the total quality's worth of items in their Display.<br/><br/>Each turn Players can take up to 2 &quot;Actions&quot; (unless they get extra Actions thanks to fulfilling certain Client orders) in their attempt to fulfill Client orders for certain weaponry or item...ry. These Actions let the Players manipulate their Stock items (or Hand cards) and/or their Display items (cards face up in front of a Player for everyone to see/trade) in specific ways to try and beat the rush to fulfill those orders! Ran out of Actions for your turn, but you're only ONE Action away from fulfilling that order?! No Worries!! There are &quot;Gold Actions&quot; that you can use in a pinch, which let you spend Gold to do certain Actions that DON'T count towards your Action limit for your turn....WOOHOO!! After all the Clients have been fulfilled, the game ends and Players then move on to calculating &quot;Dominance&quot;, which will determine who the TRUE Merchant Tycoon is!!<br/><br/>The strategic decisions and stiff competition in RPGMT!! really heat up quick due to the fact that Players start out with only a limited number of Actions per turn AND a limited number of cards they can have, so EVERY decision counts! Everything from in what order you'd like to take your Actions, which Client you should fulfill, and should you or shouldn't you use Gold are crucial to Dominance. You might spend all your Action efforts to build up enough items to fulfill an order for a specific Client, but then the Player before you fulfills them leaving you at a disadvantage with items that you might not need now!! Remember, it's not just playing the current Client market, it's also knowing and playing to the weaknesses of your fellow Players!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Rise and Fall of Galactic Empires is a game where the players garden the civilizations through the phases of birth, rise, glory, fall, and death.  It's played in turns, and each turn you do one of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Explore: push the boundaries of the galaxy and find seeds of civilizations.  Mechanically, draw and place a few hexagonal sector tiles and then deal and draft three event cards per player.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Conquer: plant a civilization in a sector, in control over anyone who's already there.  Mechanically, play a card and place a matching disk on a tile.  Cards have special powers that trigger (most often) during this action.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Reap: harvest the power of the civilizations you've cultivated, then decide whether they live or die.  Mechanically, simultaneously sell a card with the other players.  Its value is based on the value of sectors the matching civilization controls.  Then do a simultaneous bid to determine how many disks survive the reaping.<br/><br/><br/>",

Your turn consists of simply placing a token on a tile, but your play tells your opponent where they&rsquo;re allowed to play next. Controlling a tile will trigger that table&rsquo;s special of the day, a unique one-time ability. Will you be shrewd enough to fully serve the most tables and savor sweet victory?<br/><br/>The 9 tiles are arranged like the points of a compass rose (plus the center). Players take turns placing a token of their color. The space in which a token is placed indicates the tile on which the next player will place their token. The player who is first to occupy 5 spaces on a tile controls that tile. Unique special abilities for each tile are triggered at different levels of completeness. Whomever is first to control 5 tiles wins.<br/><br/>",

It could be a city, the Wakandan desert, the Savage Lands, the blue area of the moon or anything you like. In Marvel they fight anywhere.<br/>It is played on a 36&quot; x 36&quot; board so will fit on most tables without a problem.<br/><br/>In a game you will usually have between 4-7 characters on your team. Each of these characters act individually using their own Power to carry out different attacks and use Special Powers.<br/>Many can help or hinder each others though with boosts and actions like a Fastball Special.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to win set scenarios by completing different tasks and scoring Victory Points. These could be anything from take down / save the highest Level model in the team or rescue and keep a Cosmic Relic.<br/><br/>Each character comes with their own Stat Card which shows everything they can do. Attacks, Defence, Skills, Power, Damage and such.<br/>These are then used in a 2 D8 mechanic during the game. For example, 2D8 plus Attack Stat vs Defence Stat or 2D8 against your own Agility.<br/><br/>Earth's Mightiest Heroes joined forces to take on threats that were too big for any one hero to tackle. With a roster that has included Captain America, Iron Man, Ant-Man, Hulk, Thor, Wasp and dozens more over the years, the Avengers have come to be regarded as Earth's No. 1 team.<br/><br/>",

The players may either travel between to neighboring locations or between two locations which are not next to each other, but can be reached by spending a maximum of 24 units gas or 11 units coal.<br/>Gas and coal can be obtained by rolling two dies or by stopping by a location at which gas or coal can be restocked.<br/>The players can obtain merchandise by by flying to a harbor where the wanted merchandise is in stock and file a purchase option with the game master. The next step is to pick up the merchandise with the ship, before an other player too files an option and picks the merchandise up faster.<br/>The players have to pick up 12 different merchandise-cards before they are allowed to obtain gold at one of three possible locations. After obtaining gold, the players return to their starting space. The players may exchange merchandise, gas and coal according to their value.<br/>The first player to return his ship and his planes to his starting space ends and wins the game.

What if there was an octopus involved somewhere? What if the octopus was being worried by a tortoise?<br/><br/>In Beastly Bust-Up, a gang of irascible animals from all corners of the globe come together to duke it out for the coveted elephant head trophy. Players wrangle their teams of fighters, trying to send the right beasts to the right places to win the most points.<br/><br/>Battles take place in various habitats, each worth a number of points. Players take it in turns to dispatch fighters of various ranks to contest those habitats, hoping to have the highest total rank in each habitat at the end of the game and claim the points.<br/><br/>This would all be straightforward enough, but each animal has its own special strengths and weaknesses to throw into the mix. Fierce ones can scare others off, cowardly ones need babysitting, agile ones can avoid being squashed, speedy ones can slip in unnoticed... from the mighty lion to the lowly mouse, every fighter can contribute something.<br/><br/>Beastly Bust-Up is a scaleable game that can fill a ten minute coffee break or launch a multiplayer tournament across several hours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Le Billard Finlandais is a handmade woodgame with a elastic strap shooting device.<br/><br/>The players use a shooting device to shoot a wooden disk and to try to knock over wooden pins, which are marked with numbers from 1 to 12. The pins are initially placed in a tight group in an upright position. Knocking over one pin scores the amount of points marked on the pin. Knocking 2 or more pins scores the number of pins knocked over. After each throw, the pins are stood up again in the exact location where they landed. The first one to reach exactly 50 points wins the game. Scoring more than 50 will be penalised by setting the player's score back to 25 points. A player will be eliminated from the game if they miss all of the target pins three times in a row.<br/><br/>",

Improve your survival chances by using your heroes' special abilities and/or some of the cool stuff you grabbed off the monsters you've dispatched.  Make it through seven rooms and you've survived the dungeon - now tally up the gold value of the items you've escaped with.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple:  take the attacker's attack value, subtract the defender's defense value and then add in a 20-sided die roll (die included!).  If it's over 10 it's a hit, and you subtract the damage.  Or you can use your Special Ability, or one of the items you've picked up from a prior room.  Repeat until there are no monsters or heroes alive in the room.<br/><br/>Play cooperatively, solo or semi-competitively - all in less time than it takes to convince your gaming buddies that playing an Elven Hunter is not cliche.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>No intelligence reports had prepared the German Army for the new Soviet T-34/76 medium tank: a well-balanced vehicle with much better firepower, armor protection and mobility than anything in the German arsenal or even on German drawing boards. In December 1941, the Germany Army&rsquo;s Weapons Bureau ordered two firms, MAN (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N&uuml;rnberg) and Daimler-Benz, to produce designs for a new medium tank to out-perform the Soviet T34/76. A third firm, Skoda, was not invited to participate but submitted a design anyway.<br/><br/>After initially selecting the Daimler-Benz tank and bestowing the name &ldquo;Panther&rdquo; on it, German leader Adolf Hitler later backtracked and ordered the MAN tank into production instead. The Daimler-Benz prototype, known as the VK3002, was shunted aside as was Skoda&rsquo;s T25. The MAN Panther eventually became a formidable weapon, but initial production models suffered mechanical problems thanks to its rushed development. Either of the other two tanks would likely have been available sooner.<br/><br/>Variant Panthers lets you try out these rejected tanks on the battlefields of Kursk, in South Flank and Burning Tigers. The Groundhog Day 2016 Golden Journal includes 24 new laser-cut, mounted pieces depicting these two tanks in both German Army and Waffen SS livery. It&rsquo;s a good-looking set. Plus you get scenarios for their use.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players take on the roll of the mane six ponies from the animated series and work together to prepare for a confrontation with one of the series villains. If the ponies have made enough progress, they can thwart the villain.<br/><br/>Each turn the players move their ponies around the game board, which is a map of Ponyville and Equestria.  They then attempt to deal with plot issue cards by rolling dice; other ponies can help them by rolling additional dice.  Successfully dealing with the issue cards allows them to advance on their Element track.  When they advance far enough, they will gain their Element of Harmony.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the villain is plotting.  The villain has a progress track which advances each turn and when new issue cards come into play.  Villain event cards will come into play as the track advances and which will cause problems for the ponies.  Once the villain track reached the final space, the confrontation begins.  Ponies then attempt to defeat the villain with a series of dice rolls.  Their success will depend largely on how many Elements of Harmony they have obtained during the game.<br/><br/>Each of the mane six ponies has her own special ability: Twilight Sparkle can advance Element tracks by doing research, Rarity can collect gems to help her resolve issues, Fluttershy is good with animals, Rainbow Dash's movement is faster than the others, Applejack is good at helping other ponies resolve their issues, and Pinkie Pie can help other ponies avoid setbacks.<br/><br/>Players can play stand-alone games or a campaign game made up of a series of games, with a different villain in each game.  The ponies can gain new abilities and even become alicorns as the campaign continues.<br/><br/>",

Players do not own anything -- neither the runners that score nor the dice that power them -- so they must always think hard about their opponent's response in order to avoid a surprise score.  Despite the dice, there is no luck in the usual sense -- the dice simply set the stage and then are never rolled again.<br/><br/>Players use the pre-rolled dice to move the three runners up and down the track.  They score points by landing one runner on another -- the higher up on the track, the higher the score.  Each turn one of the twelve dice disappears, so players have just six brain-burning turns to score more points than their opponent.<br/><br/>",

Employing his army of shades to drain their life energy, Xeon the Undead Shadow Dragon has destroyed thousands of worlds throughout the millennia, and the world of Karth is next in his path of destruction. A chance meeting between Llythwain, autistic son of an elf Ranger and Killian, an undead shade has altered the familiar pattern of events, sowing the seeds of a monumental clash between the living and the dead, between good and evil, between the Allegiance and the Shard and Xeon's ferocious undead army. &quot;The Undead Curse threatens Green Valley! The human necromancers are to blame!&quot; With the utterance of those words by the Elven Lords, the Allegiance pact between humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and barbarians weakens, just as that of the Shard races grows in strength. By uniting the ogres, goblins, spiders, orcs, kobolds and hill giants under one banner, Xeon has awakened ancient hatred between the two mighty factions and the Shard is ready for war.

        "description": "Dominion of the Stars is a solitaire game in which you take the role of a world empire expanding its sovereignty into space. This calls for sending starships from your home planet to explore deep space. Along the way you will make various discoveries while trying to colonize as many planets as possible. Colonization of a planet is achieved after its discovery, conquest, and development have taken place. In addition, you must retain control of your planets by protecting them from the game-controlled enemy race.<br/><br/>Planet Discovery<br/>Dominion of the Stars takes place in a fictitious galaxy where many formidable findings await. Among your findings will be planets requiring commitment and investment if you hope to colonize them. Assessing a planet&rsquo;s profile requires the determination of the following key data:<br/><br/>&bull; The value of the planet&rsquo;s natural resources.<br/><br/>&bull; The presence of intelligent lifeforms.<br/><br/>&bull; The difficulty of development/colonization.<br/><br/>Quadrant Accessibility<br/>At the onset, the only major discovery is a WarpGate located within your home quadrant. A WarpGate provides instantaneous travel to other quadrants. As more WarpGates are discovered, more quadrants become accessible. The game provides a total of 7 quadrants that can be explored based on access.<br/><br/>Starship Movement<br/>Normal space travel is performed using hex-to-hex movement. In addition to moving from hex to hex, a player may move from level to level (within a hex). Hex level is represented by counter placement; how a counter is orientated or whether it is inverted.<br/><br/>Starship Types<br/>The player oversees the following types of starships on behalf of the empire:<br/><br/>&bull; Exploration starships &ndash;used to discover habitable planets in deep space (among other discoveries).<br/><br/>&bull; Military starships --used to secure fleets during exploration, and to conquer/defend planets.<br/><br/>&bull; Development starships -- used on one-way missions, these starships are necessary for colonizing planets.<br/><br/>Winning/Losing<br/>There are different degrees of win and loss as outlined by the Achievement Scale. Through the process of discovering and controlling planets, it is possible to win the game. If you are unable to discover and control the necessary number of planets by the end of 26 turns, the game is lost.<br/><br/>Dominion of the Stars is available as a free Print &amp; Play game (uploaded to BGG) or as a Print-on-Demand (see official link). In the Print &amp; Play version, counters replace all the non-cardboard pieces (except for the rolling dice).<br/><br/>",

Containing a host of new scenarios, crewmen types, creatures, and treasure, this volume also includes guidelines for building unique tribes to use as adversaries in scenarios or as allies to the Heritors in their quest.<br/><br/>",

But don&rsquo;t worry, you get to collect 5 (maybe not so useful) items to help you survive. It&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to use them and convince the other players that you would make it out alive!<br/><br/>Each round, a scenario card is drawn describing an intense survival situation that all players must survive. Players draw item cards and choose whether to keep them or discard them for the chance at better items.<br/><br/>Once everyone has 5 cards, players take turns describing how they would use those items to survive the scenario. Your story can be as crazy, funny, or realistic as you like. All players then vote to see whose story wins the round. The player with the most votes after 3 rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>",

How many cards are in a deck, my friend?  Yep.  You can play 52 units on a table!  That is a bigger battle.<br/><br/>In most games, each player can control up to 5-6 units and their Commanders and Heroes without much trouble.  <br/>Games can have up to 8 players without slowing down the game.<br/> Now, you can dig out all your old miniatures gathering dust and have a game ready to go in a few minutes.<br/><br/>Experienced wargamers and new players alike will enjoy this game.  <br/>Bigger Battles is perfect for convention games and just one-on-one contests.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At last you've found it; a legendary and mysterious labyrinth, rumored to hold many treasures! Unfortunately, you're not alone; you've been followed by other treasure raiders, and you'll have to act quickly and shrewdly to secure the plunder for yourself.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/>This is a thematic abstract spatial strategy game for 2-8 players in which players place and demolish walls to be the first to reach the treasures in the center of the labyrinth.<br/>It's recommended to play with 2-4 individual players or 2 teams of 2-4 players each. Game length scales by player count; roughly 15 minutes per player.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>The game is played on a square grid board, which is empty at setup except for 13 treasures near the center and player pawns adjacent to the corners. At the start of the game, players are dealt a hand of labyrinth wall cards which correspond to labyrinth wall pieces which are played on the board throughout the course of the game.<br/><br/>TURNS<br/>Players take turns in clockwise order, choosing to perform one of four actions each turn; moving their player pawn, playing a labyrinth wall card to place a labyrinth wall on the board, weakening one of their own labyrinth walls on the board, or placing their rubble token on any labyrinth wall on the board.<br/><br/>MECHANICS<br/>Pawns can only move orthogonally and can only stop when hitting either a labyrinth wall or the edge of the board, and pass through other pawns. Pawns collect treasure by moving through the treasure's square. Labyrinth walls are weakened whenever a pawn hits them, eventually being demolished instead and removed from the board. Players can only draw a new card when one of their labyrinth walls is removed from the board. Each player has only one rubble token; this can be played on any labyrinth wall on the board and acts as an open square, but must remain on that wall until the wall is demolished.<br/><br/>TEAM PLAY<br/>Playing the game with two teams is the same as playing with individuals, except that collected treasure is pooled for each team on a team treasure board, and public table talk is typically allowed.<br/><br/>STRATEGY<br/>Basic strategies involve placing labyrinth walls to either let your pawn stop in line with treasure, or to block other player's pawns. More advanced strategies include accomplishing both of the above with a single wall placement, using other player's constructions to your advantage, and placing walls to create an unblockable path to one or more treasures. Additionally, being careful to not run out of cards and using your rubble token wisely are both important.<br/>The ability to visualize and plan potential routes and layouts is key to mastering the game's strategy. Team play brings even more strategic depth; teammates can help each other achieve goals and work together to thwart the competition.<br/><br/>GAME END<br/>The game ends immediately once it is no longer possible for the player(s) with the fewest treasures to gain enough treasures to have the most treasures. The number of treasures needed to win per player count is specified in the instruction manual for clarity.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First Strike looks at, well, the &quot;first strike&quot; by British airplanes. On Christmas Day, 1914, float planes were brought near land by the earliest &quot;seaplane tenders&quot; and turned loose on an &quot;air reconnaissance&quot; by planes which just happened to be carrying bombs and looking for Zeppelin sheds. There was also hope of luring out the German fleet, and an unexpected result of having the British naval force attacked by German airplanes.<br/><br/>Who would guess the very first &quot;carrier-based air attack&quot; would happen on Christmas Day, 1914? Yes, it happened! British seaplane tenders supported a &quot;reconnaissance&quot; against the German naval base at Cuxhaven . . . carrying bombs in the hopes of destroying the Zeppelin sheds that were there also.  The fleet was attacked by German seaplanes in turn, and a remarkable adventure ended with few casualties on either side. It would make a great movie, but for now, it's a great game!<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Look upon them and see the signs: pus seeping from festering wounds that never heal; miasmic smogs of corrosive, stinking gas hanging thickly in the air wherever Nurgle&rsquo;s chosen tread; the wriggling, lamprey-mouthed tick-leeches that clamp on to their rotting flesh; the droning billions of plague flies that swarm the battlefields they stalk and the ships in which they course through the stars.<br/><br/>Few armies offer such a rich canvas for painting and modelling as the Death Guard. Every miniature is riddled with gruesome details and grisly flourishes, showing the blessings they have received from Nurgle, and in turn how they will spread the Lord of Decay&rsquo;s infections. With them you can craft a truly head turning &ndash; not to mention stomach turning &ndash; force that can terrify your enemies and be disgustingly powerful on the battlefield. This book is the ultimate guide to the Death Guard, featuring in depth lore and background and the rules that you need to field them in Warhammer 40,000.<br/><br/>Inside this book, you'll find:<br/><br/>&ndash; Background on the reunification of Mortarion with the Death Guard during the Great Crusade, his eventual fall into heresy, and the process inflicted upon the Death Guard as Nurgle's Destroyer Plague took them.<br/>&ndash; Information on the organisational structure of the Death Guard following the Horus Heresy and how their cohesion meant they were better able to enact war upon the galaxy.<br/>&ndash; Incredible photography of units, single miniatures, and armies on terrain, both on their own and as part of battle scenes.<br/>&ndash; Datasheets that cover every unit fieldable by a Death Guard army.<br/>&ndash; Death Guard-specific Stratagems, Warlord Traits, Relics, and psychic powers.<br/>&ndash; In-depth Crusade rules that let you grow your force as it spreads diseases and plague across the galaxy.<br/>&ndash; And more!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "They call me Percival, scholar, dignitary, mystic. I need your help. My studies show that the Cataclysm is approaching. I've been silenced as I beg others to heed my warnings. Luckily I have found a way to stop the Cataclysm. Beneath our very paws is an extensive network of Catacombs, filled with the souls of the mightiest cats before us. I need nine souls from deep within the Catacombs. I would fetch them myself, but my aversion to pestilence prevents me. That is why I hired you. Beware as you cautiously creep through the Catacombs, as there are temptations, monsters, and fates that seek to protect the souls of the lost. Work together to defeat these guardians, using the abilities that the Fates have granted you. You may keep whatever treasure you find, which might help you on your little adventure, but bring me the souls. Learn from the mistakes that lead to their demise as you trudge back into the dungeon. Gather your Clowder and make haste, but beware: For we all know what killed the cat.<br/><br/>Curiosity is a cat themed cooperative deck-building campaign where players work together to attempt to escape the Catacombs. The game has three modes: Campaign, Arcade, and Trials.<br/><br/>In the Campaign mode, players will be helping an NPC named Percival figure out how to prevent the impending Cataclysm in exchange for information on how to escape the Catacombs. Players will be working together to build their individual decks, defeat guardians, and unlock new playable classes. There are over ten scenarios.<br/><br/>In Arcade mode, players will complete a randomly generated scenario. Content unlocked in Campaign mode are also available in this mode!<br/><br/>In Trials mode, players will work together to go as far into the Catacombs as they can before they exhaust themselves, battling hoards of Guardians.<br/><br/>",

Take the tray that will give you the best scoring combinations to earn the most points.<br/>But not so fast: The last player to take a tray earns a cup of coffee - and a bonus action, &iexcl;con caf&eacute;!<br/>At the end of the game, add up the combined score of all your pan dulce to determine the winner.<br/>Every round you play goes better &iexcl;con caf&eacute;!<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect sets of cards that will score the most points.<br/>Divide the deck into four stacks of pan dulce cards, face up, forming the display case. Each round begins by placing one tray per player in the center of the table.   <br/>On your turn, you may select one or two cards from the display case and place them onto one or two trays that are not yet full. Or, instead of adding more cards, you may take one of the trays and all of the cards it contains. You place those cards in front of you, and then pass for the remainder of the round. When only one tray remains on your turn, you must take it (no matter how full it is), but you also select a caf&eacute; card that grants a bonus action.<br/>After three rounds, each player scores the combination of cards they have taken throughout the game, and the player with the highest score is the winner!<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s based on the Austro-Prussian (1866) and Franco-Prussian wars (1871), conflicts that made the unification of German a reality. Players take on the roles of leaders of France, Prussia, Austria and Italy to try to reshape the map of Central Europe to their advantage one more time. The scale of the game may not be as epic as in other expansions or the base Coalitions, but the stakes are high nonetheless!<br/><br/>The Realpolitik Expansion is designed for 1-4 players, with a new solo mode and an emphasis on the competitive 2-player mode in which both players control two nations. The Activator system is modified to fit this mode and the overall theme of the expansion is a bit different &ndash; let&rsquo;s just say, we&rsquo;re not forgetting to take into account the massive impact of mid-19the century railways.<br/><br/>Realpolitik also introduces more asymmetry between the nations than in the Coalitions base game, from highly militant Prussia and economically strong France, to newly but not fully united Italy, and multi-ethnic Austria.<br/><br/>As with the other standalone expansions, Realpolitik comes with its own set of components, including a new Wheel of War and a new game board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

During each turn, each witch plays an action card from her hand to collect new ingredients or take them from the cupboard. You can also use teleport spells to move ingredients (or steal them, ha ha!) between the witches' cauldrons. Finally, you can use a transmute action to magically swap one ingredient for another. As witches are not immune to attacks and traps, the Witch's Reflexes card will save you from more than one trouble!<br/><br/>Witches also get fed up with being cheated, so they can sometimes use spells that will stun their opponents - watch out for them! Among the 20 ingredients, some are very rare. So you'll have to fight for them with other witches to complete your recipe.<br/><br/>Only when your cauldron contains the exact ingredients for your recipe will you be victorious - remember, you must make two to get it!

Louis XVI has just gone to the guillotine, the brothers Robespierre control the destiny of France, and all Europe has joined French Royalists to take down France, end the Revolution, and restore peace and safety for the hereditary principles that have underlain society for 1000 years.<br/><br/>As an ambitious but unknown young artillery officer, who speaks French with a Corsican accent, you would seem to be an unlikely agent of destiny. Can you harness a brilliant mind, titanic energies, and a sometimes terrifying charisma to leave your mark on history? Or will you die a minor footnote in the story of France?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game based on the traditional Korean card game Go Stop, with some differences. The game uses a modernized, more colorful Hanafuda deck. Flower Battle differs from Go Stop in the following ways:<br/>1. Although 4 players may begin, only 3 players may play the main game; there is a pre-round elimination procedure in which player who &quot;dies&quot; may sell his/her Gold cards (called Bright cards in Go Stop) for points.<br/>2. Go Stop decks have 4 or 5 joker/wild cards; Flower Battle has 3 wild cards that are doublers and a blank card for you to customize.<br/>3. Flower Battle has options for scoring such as Wild Boar Hunt (players put their scoring sticks in a box; the player with the boar card wins the sticks) and Clear the Ground (if you collect the last 2 cards on the table, you also receive a plain card from each opponent's collection).<br/>4. Point values differ slightly; in Go Stop, collecting all 5 brights typically gives you 15 points. In Flower Battle, you receive 10 points.<br/><br/>The original version comes with a deck of cards and a pouch of color counting sticks for keeping score.<br/><br/>",

Choose a Survivor to battle it out for new nuclear delicacies while wielding hilarious makeshift weapons fueled with ridiculous visual puns to combat your opponents.<br/> Hostile Hoarders is a game of war and self preservation for 2-5 players. Each survivor plays 4 weapon cards face down in front of them. Choose from one of your attacking weapon cards and pair it with an opponent's defending weapon card. Compare your attacking power to their defending power. The winner of the battle has prevailed and collects their reward. If the attacking player has conquered, they receive a meal that day, collecting one ration card. If the defender has bested the battle, they flip their defending weapon back face down and steal thee attacker&rsquo;s weapon for their own, adding it to their hand.<br/><br/>Various instants can be added to aid in the skirmish.<br/>When you have depleted all of your fellow survivor&rsquo;s defense, go in for the kill.

First things first, it's not about real toys. You have a card deck, where the three parts of which a Deeldo is made - a head, a body and a base - are depicted. You draw your initial hand, compose Deeldoes on the desk, and then wait for your friends while they do the same. Each turn, you draw two cards - and history repeats.<br/><br/>Deeldoes must start with a base, end with a head, and have at least a body part in it. There is no limit to the Deeldo composition - more the colors, more the fun, after all - but remember that there are combos that can bring you more points. Vibrating and studded Deeldoes give you more points, just like color-matching toys.<br/><br/>When a player has completed their 3rd Deeldo, or when cards are finished, the game is over. The player with the highest score wins, and gets the chance to start the following match. The one with the lower score, instead, wears the Crown of the Loser. It's the rules, baby.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "End of June 1866. After several months of growing tensions, war broke out between Austria and Prussia for control of the primacy in Germany. Prussia plans to take its troops through the Sudetenland and into Bohemia through four different passes, with the goal of facing the Austrian main army in a decisive Napoleonic battle.<br/>The end of one of these passages is located here, near the town of Trautenau. On June 27, the 10th Austrian corps pushed back the 1st Prussian corps there. But this tactical victory, the only one for Austria in Bohemia, obtained at the cost of heavy losses will have no strategic consequences: the next day, the 10th Corps is swept away by the Prussian Guard during the Battle of Soor.<br/><br/>New module in the series &quot;Battles in the time of Napoleon III&quot;, Trautenau et Soor, 1866 is the second wargame in a series that will cover the main clashes of the Bohemian campaign of 1866 and will conclude with the battle of Sadowa (or K&ouml;nnigr&auml;tz).

Players begin the game as low-level criminals, earning dirty money and street cred in a variety of ways: controlling turf, committing heists, dealing drugs, and assassinating targets. As you move further up the ranks you can buy money laundering operations and influence elections.<br/><br/>Your turn starts with drawing scheme cards and/or gaining dirty money. Then you choose two actions. Possible actions include: driving on the map, shooting other players or their crew, shopping on the black market (to buy guns, ammo, and items), or doing a location-specific action (such as putting out more muscle on the streets, collecting resources, doing crimes, or laundering money). Gain an additional action by putting more muscle on the streets, but be careful! You gotta be able to pay your crew or they will abandon you.<br/><br/>Dirty money and street cred are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions and can be traded for clean money (points). The winner is whoever has the most clean money at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Key Points<br/><br/>- Plays in 90-120 minutes.<br/>- Resource management, area control, and push-your-luck mechanics.<br/>- Immersive and intuitive gameplay with tons of unique cards.<br/>- Unique end-game bidding-based scoring mechanism.<br/>- Multiple paths to victory.<br/><br/>",

Players who choose the right strategy can win various bonuses during the rounds, such as an amanita basket or gourmet dinner.<br/><br/>In this medium-weight board game for 2-6 players, players place mushroom cards into their own basket and from their hand onto the field each round, creating four ever-expanding piles of mushrooms in the centre of the playing field. The game consists of four main rounds, with a round consisting of five turns. This makes the total playing time between 30 and 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Mushroom picking is also aided by special rule modifier cards...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

You do not earn the Illumination points.<br/><br/>Gula : your Copyist takes 5 Inks at random from the bag.<br/><br/>Invidia : your Copyist steals three Sketches of his choice from the Scriptorium and places them in his personal supply.<br/><br/>Ira : your Copyist destroys another Copyist's Material ; it is discarded but the sketches are kept and join the Copyist's personal reserve at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Luxuria: your Copist's piece moves to the square of the Copist's piece in front of it.<br/><br/>Superbia : each golden Ink from his reserve spent gives 3 additional Illumination points to your Copyist. Spent inks are returned to the bag.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, unforgiven sins cause you to lose illumination points.<br/><br/>",

The first is bidding on damaged cars at auctions to get the best models at the lowest price. Then the player must decide whether and to what extent it is worth investing in repairing the purchased car. The sales phase involves selling the vehicle to the buyer at the highest possible price. The final stage is market updates and preparation for new auctions.<br/><br/>Get ready for hot auctions to win the title of the most successful dealer!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your mission is to make as valuable amulets as possible with these gems and give them to Lord Shiva. The desert robber who managed to win Lord Shiva's favor before sunset will be eternally protected from the terror of the evil spirits!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>A game of Kuldhara lasts 4 rounds, corresponding to a day. Every round, players get 15 energy to perform different actions such as traveling with their camel through the desert, digging up gems in the ruins, transporting and delivering gems... When the active player has created a pattern corresponding to an amulet displayed on a card, (s)he creates the amulet, takes the card and receives the gratitude points displayed on it.<br/><br/>Every round, the position of the sun changes (in the East in round 1, in the West in round 4). The consequence is that the amount of energy needed to travel in the sunlight will always be the highest.<br/><br/>Players  must use their energy wisely, plan their actions carefully, plan how they will create amulets and chain the creation of amulets as good as possible to make powerful combo's.<br/><br/>The player with the most gratitude points at the end of round 4 wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;A competitive collectable battle game where Bosses summon their minions and powerful effects to become the baddest Boss in the multi-verse.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Battle Bosses has you controlling a gigantic Boss, utilizing dice to gain Energy and Crystal resources to unleash devastating moves, spawn Minions to send to battle, and play innovative cards to gain tactical advantage specific to your Boss and Minions.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each game, both players combine and set up their tiles to create a single battlefield, put their boss in the starting space, and draw 5 cards from their deck. On their turn, each player rolls 4 dice which will give them energy and crystals, sometimes even triggering Overload, a critical hit that allows you to reroll dice for extra bonuses. Energy must be spent the turn it is earned to utilize Boss abilities such as movement, creating minions, and unleashing their ultimate move, as well as extra abilities earned by playing cards. Crystals on the other hand, can be saved up or used right away towards cards to unleash additional special moves and devastating effects. Loyal minions are collateral damage as the last Boss left standing wins.<br/><br/>Through our Kickstarter, the Deluxe Tier offers Arena Mode, which boasts MOBA-inspired gameplay for 4 or 6 players, where bosses respawn when defeated and two teams compete to destroy the enemy base.

Gut-wrenching choices will determine the fate of you and your mission, showing if you have what it takes to survive.<br/><br/>It is in part a story-creation game, in part a Tactical level wargame, and in part a Campaign game.

To the &quot;civilized&quot; worlds of humanity, the Periphery is a backwater, not a place where any respectable person would want to live. And many still remember that the nations of the Periphery fought tooth-and-nail against the Star League's attempt to unite all of humanity in a new golden age. Full of hardship, immorality, lawlessness and danger, it is a vast and little-understood region of space.<br/><br/>But that's not the whole story. The Periphery is all of the things that people say about it, but it is also much more. The Taurian Concordat has a better educational system than most Successor States. The citizens of the Magistracy of Canopus enjoy more freedoms than their counterparts in the Inner Sphere. Even the bandit kingdoms are getting into the act, with realms such as the Circinus Federation and the Marian Hegemony making moves towards legitimacy.<br/><br/>ComStar continues its series of sourcebooks detailing human space with a look at the Periphery in all its facets, good and ill. Learn the history of the various nations beyond the Inner Sphere, including the Rim Worlds Republic, home to the treacherous Amaris clan. See how life differs out in the wilds, where every danger is balanced by the freedom to live unfettered by the petty oppressions of the Successor States.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Will you be the most skilled castle builder in the kingdom?<br/>Place room cards to grow your castle, but be careful!<br/>The other builders could use dragons to block your construction!!!<br/><br/>PURPOSE OF THE GAME <br/>Be the most skilled castle builder in the kingdom. You will have to place the room cards of the castle by matching the stairs and the corridors of entry with those of exit of the previous card placed on the left.<br/>The player who manages to put 10 room cards in a row wins first.<br/><br/>PREPARATION AND DEVELOPMENT <br/>For 4 players you have to use all 64 cards<br/>For 2-3 players you have to remove 2 Dragons and 2 Knights of your choice<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards and deal 2 face down to each player, the remaining cards are placed in the center of the playing area to create the draw deck.<br/>The player who last visited a castle begins the game and continues clockwise. During his turn, eachplayer draws 2 cards to add to his hand and creates his own row or row of room cards in front of him starting from the left and adding other cards only to the right of the previous one. Each player can play as many cards as he wants from his hand, the important thing is that to pass the turn he does not have more than 2 cards in his hand. If you have 3 or more cards in your hand you cannot pass the turn but you will have to play them until you remain with 2 cards or less. WARNING: if you have 3 or more DRAGON or KNIGHT cards in your hand and you cannot use them, they will be discarded until you have 2 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>CREATING A ROW OF ROOMS<br/>The rows of rooms are created starting from the first card on the left and adding the other cards always to the right of the previous one, by matching the stairs and the entrance corridors with those of exit of the previous card, it is not possible to add cards to the left of the row. All room cards have two identical symbols, positioned on the top and bottom sides and are an HELMET and a couple of CROSSED SWORDS. When building a row of rooms, it is mandatory that all symbols face the same direction, therefore, if you start a row with the HELMET facing up, all the cards that make up the row must have the HELMETS facing up. If you have no cards in your hand that can be added to a row that you are building and you have more than 2 cards in your hand, then you cannot pass the turn, you will have to start a new row, always matching HELMETS and CROSSED SWORDS, therefore, if your first row has the HELMET symbol facing upwards, the row that you will build must have the same symbol facing downwards. There is no limit to the number of rows of rooms you can build.<br/><br/>USING DRAGON CARDS AND KNIGHT CARDS<br/>DRAGON cards can be used against an opponent, during your turn they can be placed to the right of a row of rooms to block the construction, because from this moment the opponent cannot add ROOM CARDS on his own row. The KNIGHT cards instead must be used on their own row of rooms where a DRAGON card has been placed to remove it and be able to continue building on that row. Once played it must be discarded together with the removed DRAGON card, these cards can no longer be used.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME<br/>The player who first creates a row of 10 ROOM cards wins the game. If the cards in the draw deck finish,and no one had made a 10-card row, in this case the player who made the longest row of rooms wins, if there is an equal merit, whoever has made the second longest row, if there is still a tie, will check the third and so on.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board contains 2 circular tracks, 20 spaces long, and with a coloured dot that separates each two neighboring spaces. In the center is space for 3 plastic containers with a slot in the lid. Each player gets 2 pawns, 5 fuel chips in each of the 4 colours, and 3 sticks. Each player places their pawns on the board, one on each track, next to a dot of their colour. The aim of the game is to be the first player to return both pieces to their starting positions, moving one pawn round clockwise, and the other anti-clockwise.<br/><br/>It is a diceless game: players are in control of their own movement. Any unoccupied space can be reached as long as, and here&rsquo;s the twist, the player has enough &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; to reach that square. Remember those chips? For each square traveled, one chip has to be handed in. The landing space determines which colour those chips should be. Used chips are then put through the slots of the containers in the middle, spread between them at will. At the start of the game, each player only has enough chips to get one pawn round the board. To get both pieces round additional fuel need to be bought. During your turn, you can buy the hidden contents of one of the containers by discarding one of your three sticks. If you have run out of sticks and you haven&rsquo;t got the right chips left to get home than you are out of the game.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a lightweight but rather clever racing game for the entire family, but its diceless movement system sets it apart from most racing games aimed at this market.<br/><br/>Disposition was licensed from B.L.A. and published by Berliner Spielkarten in their &quot;Spiel-O-Thek&quot; range.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hollerith⁵ consists of a 6x6 game board with a hole in each space large enough to hold a marble, as well as marbles in two colors and five perforated plates; each plate covers a 3x3 area, which means that four of the plates together cover the entire game board. Each perforated plate has nine holes so that you can see whether a hole in the game board is filled with a marble, but only one or two holes per plate are large enough for a marble to pass through. (These holes are marked as such on the plates.)<br/><br/>On a turn, you push the fifth plate onto the game board, displacing one of the plates already there, then you insert one of your marbles into an unoccupied hollow of the game board. Players alternate turns until one of them forms a row of four marbles and wins. Note that if you cannot insert a marble into an empty space on the game board, you lose instantly.<br/><br/>",

A promoted piece (king) moves like a chess bishop, and can capture a piece anywhere along its line of movement.<br/><br/>A turn must capture the maximum possible number of pieces. Failing to do so results in forfeiture of that piece. If there is a choice between pieces to use for capturing, the king takes precedence.<br/><br/>",

Rather than just rolling a few dice, the rules allow players to make tactical decisions about how the models that they control will fight - offensively, defensively, or by applying special skills and abilities.En Garde! covers the conflicts of the 16th, 17th and early 18th centuries, when black-powder weapons started to become common in battle but martial prowess still determined the outcome.<br/><br/>Play as Border Reivers, Conquistadors, Landsknechts, Aztecs, French Musketeers, Caribbean Pirates and many more, in scenarios that evoke classic engagements of the genre. Sub-plots (secondary objectives for each side) have also been introduced, making gameplay even more varied and exciting. Simple campaign rules allow multiple scenarios to be played in sequence and permit warbands to develop over time. An appendix is also included to provide brief rules for supernatural creatures of the period - monsters, demons, revenants and witches - and new abilities and equipment to fight them, making En Garde! the perfect ruleset for gamers who want something a bit different from the norm.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Squirrel is a family friendly game of tactical foraging. To win you must gather the biggest hand of acorns before the last leaf of Autumn turns brown.<br/><br/>The game starts with a grid of 9 green leaf piles. Under each green leaf card is a chance to find either a brown leaf or 1 to 3 brown acorns.<br/><br/>Players must each build a maximum hand of 3 cards by hopping their squirrel counter from one leaf pile to the next. After each move they must take 1 card from the top of a neighboring leaf pile to add to their hand.<br/><br/>If their hand exceeds 3 cards or they make a gap in the grid, they must drop a card with its brown side face up. In this way the leaf piles change color from green to brown and when the top card of all 9 leaf piles shows a brown face, the game (and autumn) has ended. Players must then reveal their hands and the player with the greatest total number of acorns is the winner.<br/><br/>Beware. <br/>The best foragers may be pushing their luck. A squirrel who holds more than 3 acorn cards must drop one in plain view. An opponent who stands on a dropped acorn can steal from your hand! <br/>Wise foragers can manage their hand as well as the length of the game by choosing when to voluntarily drop a card and which green leaf piles to cover or reveal.<br/><br/>Squirrel has enough gameplay for adults and older children to enjoy with enough luck to keep young children in the game without constantly feeling out-maneuvered.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Today it's standing in Kuala Lumpur and soon it might be standing in London, Tokyo or somewhere in Germany - the tallest building in the world. All intend to build it, but who will win the race? In &quot;Towers of Hamburg&quot; the competition to have the tallest tower is decided on the gameboard.<br/><br/>Towers.. is a fascinating game that impresses one highly, in spite of its simple rules. The rules are easy to understand and quick to learn. Unlike in other games, e.g. chess, the moves in Towers.. are played upwards. Move by move towers are build - and, intelligently positioned they foil the strategy of the opponent.<br/><br/>--<br/>The game sports very nice components that inviting to play, heavy enough to make them fun to pick up. Every playing piece has troughs on the upper and knobs on the lower side that hold the stacked pieces neatly on the board and onto each other.<br/><br/>",

She, too, knew it was their one chance of getting home again.  The fog that rolled out of the portal had left stones in the fortress slick with dew, so the two of them approached it with caution.  According to what the avatar at the oracle had said, Urrick would be here, and he would be unbeatable without the aid of a spell caster.  That is why, as a sinister form began to take shape within the eldritch mists of the portal, Twoelk&rsquo;s trepidation grew.  He slowly drew the magic arrow from his quiver, and glanced sideways at the amazon.  Alyta&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the portal and the terror within.  They could now discern the immense stature of the Rakshasa as it stepped through the vapors.  It was Urrick.<br/><br/>As the tiger-man&rsquo;s pale eyes narrowed on the two adventurers, he sneered.  He would enjoy eviscerating these foolish humans, and dining upon their entrails.  But before he could pounce upon his victims, an unseen force left him suspended in mid-leap.  It seemed the Twoelk and Alyta were equally stunned.  &ldquo;Now, my friends!  Strike now!&rdquo;  It was the voice of Brannig, whom they believed had been killed in the ruins south of the oracle.  Twoelk stammered, stymied.  &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep a good mage down,&rdquo; Brannig replied to their unvoiced question.  &ldquo;But magic will only keep Urrick immobile a few seconds more.  Now be quick!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Welcome to Talengarde, A world of fantasy and adventure, heroes and quests, magic and chance.

        "description": "Flower of Chivalry is an excellent source book for the miniatures gamer interested in English medieval warfare.  The book begins with 14 pages devoted to medieval weapons and armor, battle and siege tactics and heraldry.  Next the author provides a simple set of miniatures rules and army lists for gaming battles of the period.  The majority of the book is a set of battle scenarios from the Scottish Wars (late 1200's - 1350), the Hundred Years War (1350 - 1450) and the Wars of the Roses (1450 - 1500).  Each scenario has a map of the battlefield, lists of units, and special scenario rules.  (A solo scenario of the battle of Castillon is included.)<br/><br/>The miniatures rules are designed for 1 unit = 5-800 men, 1&quot; = 40 yds., and 1 turn = 20 minutes.  Conversion rules for Tactical, DBA, and WRG 7th edition are also included for those wishing to play with other rules sets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Yodd is a drawless connection and territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons (board). The suggested board size is between 6 and 10 cells per side. Both players must have access to a sufficient supply of black and white stones.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, pass or place one or two stones of any colors on empty cells. On their first turn, Black can only place one stone. At the end of your turn, there must be an odd number of groups on the board. A group is an entire set of interconnected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.<br/><br/>When both players pass in succession, the game ends, and the player with fewer groups on the board wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesDouble placement serves as both a first-move equalizer and a way to make the game playable under the group restriction rule.<br/><br/>Apart from the intended goal of eliminating draws (they would be common otherwise), forcing an odd number of groups at the end of a turn has some interesting tactical implications which make the game feel similar to a single-placement game. For example, groups separated by two empty cells can't be merged on a single turn, since the player runs out of stones to restore the group count to an odd number. Also, the diamond connection (two stones at each end of a four-cell rhombus) is safe if the opponent has exactly zero or two groups adjacent to the intermediate cells, and unsafe otherwise.<br/><br/>Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you'll often want to merge two of your own groups or create another enemy group, but you'll be unable to do so because you can't restore the group count anymore!<br/><br/>",

A place where thriving depends on strategy, tactics and maybe a tiny bit of luck .<br/><br/>Plants compete to be the most successful wild plant. Players will be deciding how to use their resources to best support their plants' success in this game's environment. Conflict of Plants at its core is both an action selection and an area control game, but with a twist. The environment does not always favor the most abundant species.<br/><br/>The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round excluding the first, the player with the fewest points swaps two on-map Non-White Tokens with those of the randomly-chosen icons. Each player, in turn order, sends their cubes to tiles have an icon that matches the icon played to their Player mat. Players then in turn perform one action each three times.<br/><br/>Each player then places one Brown Token onto an empty corner of a tile in the map again matching an icon to what was played on their Player Mat. The map is then examined in order to award points and Brown Tokens. The players then balance each region by removing cubes from each tile until the number of Player Cubes in total is equal to or less than the region&rsquo;s number.<br/><br/>Finally, the players clean up their Player Mats to prepare for the next round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1918, newly independent Finland is in turmoil. The Senate and the Parliament are paralyzed, restless Russian troops are still stationed all over the country, and pro-government and revolutionary paramilitaries are clashing. The Senate flees the troubles from the capital to the north, while its army, the White Guard, starts to disarm Russian garrisons. At the same time in the capital, the People's Delegation declares a revolution and its Red Guard starts to seize power in southern Finland.<br/><br/>In more detail, 1918 is a two-player strategy game of the Finnish civil war. Players are in control of the pro-government Whites and the revolutionary Reds and their respective allies. All factions are unique with different kind of units, creating asymmetrical but balanced gameplay. The game has three scenarios, with different set-ups, objectives, and durations that depict different stages of war. In addition, there is the Grand Campaign, covering the whole war.<br/><br/>Rather than simulating mere fighting and battles, 1918 combines combat, type and quality of units, supply, casualties and fog of war into more complex warfare. On a strategic level, players have to create and maintain an army, keep an eye on the enemy, and secure their supply routes. On a operational level, players must take into account different kind of terrain and infrastructure affecting battles, in addition to their fighting forces.<br/><br/>All factions differ from one another. Factions also differ in every scenario or campaign, both by units available and the phase they come into play. Different objects of scenarios also change the entire way of playing with different sides.<br/><br/>Set-ups, units, and objectives of each scenario and the campaign are converted from real events and situations of the Finnish Civil War. Also each sides' support in the country, their means of support, and the infrastructure and the terrain are taken from respective real-life equivalents.<br/><br/>",

But there was a solemn, deep undertone to all the kidding for we realized fully that many would not come out of it alive.&mdash;Reflection by Samuel Levinger, member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, about the eve of the Republican Brunete offensive.<br/><br/>The first half of 1937 was an almost complete series of disasters for the Republican cause in the north and west of Spain. Only in the territories leading to Madrid and to the south were the Nationalists thwarted, but at an increasingly bloody cost. The Soviet Union sent massive amounts of weaponry and equipment, while volunteers poured in from throughout Europe, the US and Canada to support the Republican cause. The leadership of the Republican military decided to launch a counter-attack against the Nationalists that were deployed directly west of Madrid. The plan was to attack from the Republican held northern salient to take the crucial town of Brunete, and the main highway leading to Madrid to its south. Success here would compel the fascists to withdraw from the territory closest to the national capitol, and give the Republicans a badly needed victory. One of the largest battles of the war to-date was about to unfold.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

Players start off with five cards and pick a card from the deck every time a hand is played starting with the winner of the last hand. The game ends after all cards within the deck have been played.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to get the highest number of points.<br/><br/>A trump suit is randomly selected at the beginning of each game which can be used to dominate all other cards regardless of their point value.<br/><br/>The first card played within each round determines the suit that is in play for that round. It can only be beaten if a higher value card within the same suit is played or any trump card. Players do not have to follow suit during each round.<br/><br/>The player (or team) with the highest number of points at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Operation Albion in part led to the collapse of the Russian Provisional Government and brought the final German victory in the East. The campaign was one of the few joint land-naval-air operations of World War I. The game includes the post-Albion German intervention in the Finnish Civil War of 1919.<br/><br/>Albion is a combined naval-air-land campaign. Players conduct actions which encompass discrete combat, logistical, intelligence, and other operations. A player can conduct one or more actions per turn. All units in the game use a similar combat system, showing the interaction of naval, air, and land forces. Each game turn represents from one day to one month depending on the pace of operations. A player may take multiple actions each GT. One inch on the map represents 40 kilometers. Ground units represent regiments, brigades, and divisions, or equivalent formations. Aircraft units represent squadrons. Ship units represent divisions of one to three battleships or battlecruisers, four to eight other cruisers, flotillas of twelve to twenty destroyers, or various numbers of other ships types.<br/><br/>Components: One 22 x 34-inch game map 176 5/8-inch counters<br/><br/>Published in S&amp;T #342<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Bone Wars, players take on the role of a palaeontologist in the late 1800s. During this time, a bitter rivalry was waged between Othniel Marsh and Edward Cope, two world-renowned palaeontologists. They both tried to outdo the other in discovering new species of dinosaurs, going so far as to bribe workers, steal or even destroy bones. The players are palaeontologists working for one of these legendary men or are perhaps working on their own behalf &ndash; trying to outdo all competition.<br/><br/>During the game, players have to make clever use of their action cards, which they play in the slots under their player board. These action cards can either activate their team - digging up fossils and discovering new species in the field - or their paleontologist - who spend their time publishing species, debunking other players' papers and getting awards.<br/><br/>Published species cards are added to bonus slots at the top of your player board. Each added species card gives a bonus depending on how many species cards are already in that specific slot.<br/><br/>When your paleontologist publishes a paper, it is added to either Marsh's or Cope's side, depending on which side the player is working for. Specific actions will also reward loyalty points with your current patron. At the end of the game, players multiply the number of loyalty they have (both with Marsh and Cope) with the published papers to gain VP. Published papers, therefore, count for all players. It is up to you to make them count the most for yourself.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The series introduces new rules that let Panzer Grenadier players create Leader Characters representing officers in the armies of the great powers that fought World War II. Leader Characters participate in battle scenarios just like normal Panzer Grenadier leaders, but have far more detailed skills and abilities that add a whole new dimension to Panzer Grenadier play.<br/><br/>Each book in the series includes historical campaign games that let Leader Characters fight a sequence of battles where they can gain combat experience, improve their leadership abilities and acquire new skills. Most importantly, Leader Characters can earn medals for bravery and move up the ranks so that by the end of the campaign they can be high-ranking officers in command of large military formations. Leader Characters who survive a campaign can move on to new campaigns later in the war.<br/><br/>In addition to the campaign game scenarios, each book includes rules that let players design their own scenarios and create their own campaigns. There is a detailed point-based force-generation system for players who want to plan an entire campaign in advance, and a random scenario generation system for players who want maximum &ldquo;Fog of War&rdquo; in their campaigns. This gives the system infinite re-playability and lets players take their Leader Characters into any World War II combat situation imaginable.<br/><br/>War in the East includes the campaign games &quot;The September Campaign: 1939,&quot; &ldquo;Barbarossa: 1941,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Battle for Germany: 1945.&rdquo; It also includes historical articles and strategy tips on how to use Leader Characters in battle. It is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front Deluxe, Road to Berlin and White Eagles to enjoy all of the campaigns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Siberia is very sparsely populated, but rich in resources. That alone makes for an interesting Age of Steam variant. On top of that, however, the permafrost offers difficulties of its own when it comes to building. This variant is an attempt to capture some aspects of Siberia in Age of Steam format. It is - quite appropriately - a very difficult map.<br/><br/>The most obvious rule change is that there is no urbanization. There are plenty of towns on the map, but none of them can be urbanized. At this scale none of them can be considered 'big' cities. There are three off-board cities, however: Moscow, Beijing and Vladivostok. Goods have to be delivered to these cities. Goods are produced in mines and the 'Build Mine' action replaces the 'Urbanization' action. Resource locations (where mines can be built) are shown on the map and reflect actual locations of those resources (although not necessarily the most important ones).<br/><br/>",

Frustrated with questions about Presidents (but not about naked Presidents), and rivers (but not about rivers catching on fire), and animals (but not about weirdly-shaped animal penises), we decided to make a game for people like us. It's a game full of hilarious, morbid, irreverent, outrageous, disgusting, ironic, awesome, pathetic, twisted, and downright weird trivia. Each SFB box comes with 600 cards (6 categories with 100 cards each), a timer, die, and a whole lot of love and bad jokes.<br/><br/>The gameplay is incredibly simple- a team/player rolls the die, and then is asked a question from the corresponding deck. If they answer correctly, they keep the card and roll again. If they get it wrong, it's the next person/team's turn. First team to get one card in each category is the winner! Easy, right?<br/><br/>The starter set comes with the following categories:<br/><br/><br/>     Bodily Functions <br/>     Crime &amp; Death <br/>     Drugs, Man <br/>     'Merica <br/>     Nature Calls <br/>     Sexy Time<br/><br/><br/>",

At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Draft Horse is fast and smooth making it very easy to pick up and play over and over again. Its small package makes it great to bring along to the pub or coffee shop. Draft Horse can prove to be a tricky puzzle, however, as every round surprises you with multiple options and difficult choices.<br/><br/>Draft Horse comes with three expansion cards which make the game more variable and dynamic and an advanced scoring mode that makes the game more strategic, giving players the chance to score end-game bonus points.<br/><br/>",

From a deck of cards, players draw a set number of cards but may not look at them. Instead, the cards are held so that all other players see them. On a turn, a player may either play a card from his hand, or say something about another player's cards. Revealing information increases the soul gem contamination level, and this can only be cleansed by drawing witch cards. If the contamination reaches level 3, the game is over, the world is destroyed, and the players have lost. Witch cards can be returned to the witch deck by discarding cards from hand, but once the normal card deck runs out, the game ends.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get cards in the right order onto the table, so that all five magical girls: Madoka, Homura, Mami, Kyoko and Sayaka are fully transformed.

        "description": "&quot;Depths of Courage volume 10&quot; is a solitaire wargame on a proposed Italian mini-sub attack on New York Harbor during the summer of 1943. The active player takes on the role of the commanders of the three, two-man crew S.L.C. (Siluro a Lenta Corsa) Maiale (Pig) class and CA 2 mini-submarines. You must endeavor to overcome the US defenses and night-time visibility to inflict as much damage as possible before being killed, captured or escaping.<br/><br/>An Italian raid with by their frogmen was seriously planned and approved by both the Regia Marina and the Decima Mas. The planned raid was to have taken place in December 1943, but for game purposes I&rsquo;ve moved it up to the summer of that year, before fascist Italy&rsquo;s invasion and surrender.<br/><br/>A raid on the US was desirable for a number of reasons by the Italian naval high command. Potential targets in the Mediterranean were, by late 1942, well aware and experienced with the Italian raiders, and Allied defensive measures were increasingly deadly. The early 1942 German Operation Drumbeat U-Boat offensive, dubbed the &ldquo;Happy Time&rdquo;, exposed serious weaknesses and deficiencies in the US coastal and harbor defenses. A successful strike at the most prominent harbor in the US would be a tremendous psychological as well as military victory for the Axis cause. However, when it was proposed to their German allies in late 1941, Admiral Doenitz declined to support the operation with any U-Boats, but did approve sending any and all intelligence they came across to support Italian raid.<br/><br/>Unlike the frogmen raids conducted at Gibraltar, Alexandria, Algeciras and elsewhere in the Mediterranean, the raid on New York would also include the newest mini-submarine in the Italian navy&rsquo;s arsenal, the CA 2. Armed with two torpedoes, these small submarines were so top secret they were never entered into the Regia Marina&rsquo;s Order of Battle. Similar CA 5 type mini-submarines had raised havoc in the Black Sea and Adriatic, sinking numerous vessels and supporting blockades of enemy held ports. The CA 2 mini-sub and its crew, as well as the frogmen&rsquo;s Maiale submersibles, would have to be ferried to the target area by a much larger submarine. The only one capable of doing so in the Italian navy was the fleet submarine Leonardo da Vinci. Modifications to its hull to transport the CA 2 were made in German occupied Bordeaux, and training of its crew and the raiders done in ultra-high secrecy in the Bay of Biscay. However, in May the Leonardo da Vinci was surprised and sunk by the British destroyer HMS Active and frigate HMS Ness with all hands. By that time Sicily was invaded and the Mussolini government soon over-thrown. The chaos that Italy descended to, and the new government&rsquo;s later decision to cast their lot with the Allies, rendered the raid on New York to the dust bin of history.<br/><br/>Could the Italian navy pull off what no other nation had achieved since the War of 1812? I hope all who play Depths of Courage volume 10 learn and enjoy!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What a time to be a pirate! You have gained a set of scrolls that lead you to magic fish! The more fish you collect, the more magic-y goodness courses through you. Destroy your enemies, gather your fish, and gain arcane magical dominion over the seven seas!<br/><br/>Fish N Ships is a quick combat &amp; hand-management card game set in a fantastical world of swashbuckling seafarers. In Fish N Ships, each player takes on the role of a pirate who must follow the compass points on their scrolls in order to find the legendary fish and gain unique magic powers. Players fire cannons at each other, steal one another's cards, hoard treasure cards to claim special abilities, and play powerful Tide-Turner cards that can change the course of the game entirely.<br/><br/>Each player starts with four cards from the draw deck and a secret goal card listing their unique combination of treasure cards needed to win the game. The moment a player takes possession of the cards listed on their goal card, they immediately win and the game ends.<br/><br/>Players may steal cards from each other's hands by engaging in battle, and could easily lose everything if sailing into battle unprepared. To mitigate (but not completely eliminate) the risk of losing their treasure cards, a player may choose to place a card face-up in front of them, making the card &quot;Locked down&quot; and immune to the effects of battle. <br/>The more treasures a player has locked down, the more special abilities they may claim. Special abilities (such as &quot;+1 to Attack&quot; and &quot;Draw from discard pile&quot;) can only be claimed by one player at a time, encouraging players to race to be the first to claim the most desirable powers.<br/><br/>Fish N Ships uses a structure that rewards planning while also encouraging quick adaptation of play strategy. Players are never eliminated (even if they run out of cards) &amp; are given equalizing bonuses if ganged up on repeatedly. Powerful single-use &quot;Tide-Turner&quot; cards are included in the deck that can be used outside a player's normal turn-actions to disrupt an opponent or bolster a winning streak. Once used, Tide-Turners are removed from the game, encouraging players to use them wisely.<br/><br/>All gameplay mechanics of Fish N Ships are designed to encourage player interaction, either through battle or theft. It is statistically impossible for a player to collect all the treasures listed on their goal card by solely drawing from the deck. Though a player may choose to play a pacifist for most of the game, they will be forced to fight an opponent eventually.<br/><br/>Combat is structured so that neither party will have an immediate advantage (other than the surprise of the initial attack) and the game encourages players to be prepared for battle at all times.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>Of course, your luck could change it's tide at any moment, so best be havin' yer cannons at the ready!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two players will barricade their king, using colored pieces and blocks. Then, the players will take turns flicking their pieces to change position, eliminate enemy pieces, and destroy the enemy base. The first player to eliminate the opposing king wins. The game can be played on a table, the floor, or really any flat, solid surface. A perfect Battler ranges from those who enjoy building cool structures, creating offensive and defensive strategy and extreme competition.<br/><br/>Barrier Battles is fun for all ages (with younger ages, sometimes the game gets a little destructive). A single set of Barrier Battles is good for a 1v1 match, but with the accumulation of multiple sets, players can play larger solo matches, and even team matches.<br/><br/>In the box, players will receive: 15 red blocks, 15 blue blocks, 5 red pieces, 5 blue pieces, 1 orange piece, 1 purple piece, and a cloth travel bag. A brief set of rules (with pictures) are included on the back of the box, and for a full set of rules and regulations, players can check the official website (displayed on the box).<br/><br/>With the addition of more sets of Barrier Battles, players can play with more players in one game. While we recommend maximum of 6 players, with appropriate room to play, there is no limit to the number of players in a single game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Is it worth taking a detour on your path to Doomrock to accomplish one of these challenges? Sure! Nothing could possibly go wrong, could it? Once earned, these points can be used to level up the game semi-permanently. This is comparable to a legacy mechanic, but completely reversible: powered up cards can be removed at any time.<br/><br/>When spending an honor point, Heroes choose which of the 3 types of decks will be upgraded and draw 3 cards from the powered up decks of the Roguelike Expansion. One of the 3 drawn cards is chosen and will replace the card with the same name already in the deck.<br/><br/>The new cards are more powerful versions of their originals, bringing minor advantages like improved stats or reduced attribute requirements.<br/><br/>When upgrading the Ability Deck, cards will often have more powerful effects or easier/improved dice results. As you complete more challenges, more powered up cards will be present in the game decks. These powered up cards will show up in the game more often, tempting you to pick them up from SHOPS and during Level Ups.<br/><br/>This expansion will add some additional decision making and richness, and make the game marginally easier each playthrough.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>During the late 1800s, two emerging industrial powers began to build large modern fleets: the United States and Germany. Perhaps inevitably, tensions rose between them. Each entered the imperialist race very late and had to content itself with the leftovers which the British and French had passed by. When the United States seized Spain&rsquo;s colonial empire in 1898, German jealousy raged hotly. Some German business leaders lusted for the Philippines and Puerto Rico, urging the Kaiser to purchase them from the Spanish before the war ended, or from the Americans afterwards.<br/><br/>German and American squadrons did not, as legend has it, almost come to blows in Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War &mdash; the British spread that story, eager to cultivate American public opinion. But the German and American admirals on the scene did cultivate an intense dislike for one another, and the feelings spread to the top on both sides.<br/><br/>Black Waters is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on American plans to fight Germany. Most of the scenarios take place in the Caribbean Sea, but some actions are also placed in European waters.<br/><br/>There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces, the same pieces that originally appeared in our now out-of-print U.S. Navy Plan Black.  The Americans get ships ranging from three examples of the South Dakota class through the first American dreadnoughts, the South Carolina class, and the last of the American pre-dreadnoughts, the Connecticut class. There are also a pair of light carriers based on American plans to convert big armored cruisers.<br/><br/>The Germans add three of the GK4531 battle cruiser design and three representatives of the GK4251 battleship. And of course Germany receives an aircraft carrier, the proposed conversion of the huge liner Imperator. Argentina and Brazil receive part of their fleets, and there are two hypothetical Mexican battleships and small contingents from the Netherlands, Venezuela and Colombia.<br/><br/>There are over two dozen new scenarios, including the &quot;War Plan Silver&quot; subset based on Woodrow Wilson's very serious threat to go to war with Italy in May 1919, plus revised versions of most of those originally seen in Plan Black.<br/><br/>This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of U.S. Navy Plan Gold is required to play most of the scenarios and Mediterranean, Jutland and U.S. Navy Plan Red to play all of them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guildhaven City is a solitaire tactical combat game that puts you in the role of a superhero you create from the Golden Age of Comics. The game mechanics are somewhat similar to that of Gloomhaven by Isaac Childres.<br/><br/>A game session of Guildhaven City consists of reading from the Plot Book and finishing a 30-60 minute scenario. Each scenario is unique and forces you to make decisions that will alter your campaign path and make changes to the Guildhaven world. Once you complete a 20-hour campaign, you can replay the game with different powers and make different decisions, making Guildhaven City highly replayable.<br/><br/>This game was entered in the 2018 Solitaire PnP Contest where it won multiple awards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each turn represents one day and each hex is about 2.5 km across. There are five kinds of basic units, including infantry, artillery, cavalry, tank, and HQ. The scale of the basic unit is one regiment size. Players activate the divisional HQ to command every unit in range to barrage, move, fire, and advance after combat respectively.<br/><br/>Players choose the command chits they plan to use in every turn. Then one player draw one command chit to activate units in the same division. Then units can barrage adjacent enemy units, move toward different terrains, then attack adjacent enemy together. Use CRT to resolve barrage and combat result. Occupy target hex and eliminate enemy units can get victory points. Player who gets more points win the game.<br/><br/>To occupy city hex can increase your supply points which can use to barrage heavy artillery or get replacement units. Every scenario has asymmetrical setup forces, different victory condition, reinforcements, and tactic chits to better simulate the history.<br/><br/>There are five scenarios in this game: &quot;Liberation in Siping&quot;, &quot;Defense of Siping&quot;, &quot;Siege of Siping&quot;,  &quot;Battle of Siping&quot;, and &quot;Return to Siping&quot;.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    1 A1 Color Map<br/>    1 A4 Player Aid (Siping map area zoom)<br/>    333 die-cut counters (5/8 inch)<br/><br/><br/>NOTES: Rules in Chinese translated in English.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 8-scenario pack from Lone Canuck covers actions from early in WW II for the elite German Grossdeutschland unit.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>10 May 1940... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland reinforced by artillery and engineers crossed the Belgian frontier about midday encountering little resistance. The report of a force which had taken up positions in Etalle comprised of elements of a French Cavalry and motorized reconnaissance units. The Infanterie Regiment Grossdeutschland was dispatched to handle the situation. Upon arriving in village of Etalle, Grossdeutschland found the fighting was serious. Houses had been shot up, telephone wires hung down everywhere, on the corner sat a bullet-ridden civilian automobile. The bridge at the entrance to the village was barricaded and held by the French under heavy rifle, and machine-gun fire coming from the houses behind it. Major F&ouml;st assessing the situation personally took command of the 5th Company and moved to launch an attack.<br/><br/><br/>10 May 1940... While the bulk of the Grossdeutschland Regiment drove towards the Luxembourg frontier. Elements of the 3rd Battalion under Oberstleutnant Barski took off from airfields near the German-Belgium border in 100 three-seat Fieseler Storch. This force was earmarked for the air landing operation codenamed &quot;NIWI&quot;. The 400-men of the Garski Battalion were to be flown 15 km behind the enemy&rsquo;s front lines, with mission to cut communications, hinder reserves reinforcing the front lines and attack the enemy&rsquo;s fortifications from the vulnerable rear. Oberstleutnant Garski&rsquo;s landed at 0600 hours and was only able to link up with nine men of his force. Radio contact was established with XIX Panzer Korps and Garski learned from reports that to the east of Wity, Belgian Ardennes Mountain troops were putting up stiff resistance. Using the earlier commandeered automobiles, Garski quickly moved his force to the western outskirts of Fauvilliers.<br/><br/>11 May 1940... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland spent the night on the hills northwest of Villiers-sur-Semois screened by a thin line of pickets. The 1st Battalion carrying their machine-guns, ammunition canisters and mortar bases which weighed heavy on men, passed west of Mellier and pushed on towards the village of Suxy. The attack on Suxy developed into a perfect training school attack supported by the Regiments&rsquo; heavy weapons, including artillery and assault guns. The infantry supported by the assault guns stormed into the village and the enemy forces, a French Cavalry reconnaissance company, suffered heavy losses while putting up a stubborn defence.<br/><br/><br/>19 June 1940... The headlong advance south towards France&rsquo;s second largest city Lyon by Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland continued with an assault gun from Lt. Von Werlhoff&rsquo;s platoon leading the way. The first serious French resistance was met near Neuville-sur-Seine. There was a barricade in front of the village, which had a heavy machine gun, two light machine guns and a 47mm anti-tank gun. The assault spearheaded by the 6th Company, Infantry Regiment GD approached the barricade, machine gun and rifle fire suddenly erupted from every house and near-by park. The assault gun immediately went into position and blasted the barricade.<br/><br/>5 July 1941... By midday of 4 July, Grossdeutschland reached Stolpce and Swerzen, about 3 km to the south was the regiments objective, Tschweren. Urgent orders were received to move a strong kampfgruppe into the area northeast of Stolpce where the 15th Infantry Regiment was involved in heavy fighting with an attacking Russian force. By evening, the 1st Battalion GD reached an area near Odceda northwest of Stolpce and set up a hasty defensive position. As the morning fog lifted, a firefight broke out as masses of Russians stormed out of the woods towards the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s positions occupied during the previous night. These first waves were beaten back, however heavy fire continued from the impenetrable wooded area and companies of the 1st Battalion were order to clear out these pockets. The Grenadiers of the 3rd Company rose and moved widely spaced towards the woods.<br/><br/><br/>5 July 1941... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland received orders to ferret out Russians that were forming up just inside the woods for a break out. 12 km southwest the 6th Company, together with a platoon from the 18th (Pioneer) Company, heavy guns of the 15th Company and elements of the 1st Platoon, 20th(Flak) Company, were ordered to move immediately to Kamienka and launch an attack on the village. The attack against Kamienka and the near by wooded areas began at 0545 and was supported by the heavy infantry guns of the 15th Company. Rapid defensive fire met the attacking German companies, which nevertheless pushed forward with great &eacute;lan, effectively supported by the heavy weapons.<br/><br/><br/>14 December 1941... The German spearheads had got to within a few miles of the outskirts of the Soviet capital. The Soviet realized that their hour had arrived. The projecting wedge of Guderian&rsquo;s Second Panzer Army presented the Soviet&rsquo;s southern group with an opportunity for envelopment from three sides. As dawn broke, Soviet artillery began firing into the village, as the rumbling of tank engines and near by shells burst heralded the Soviet&rsquo;s arrival. A few metres farther stood the anti-tank guns of the 14th (Panzerj&auml;ger) Company, which was fighting with the 1st Battalion. The Panzerj&auml;gers watched as the tanks rolled through the snow, firing as they came. As machine gun fire rattled against the protective armoured shield of their 5cm Pak 38, the Panzerj&auml;gers began their firefight. As the smoke cleared, three enemy tanks were set a fire and Soviet infantry littered the snowy fields around the village. Together with the surviving 35 grenadiers of the 1st Company they had stopped the Soviet breakthrough.<br/><br/>20 February 1942... The heavy Soviet attacks against the weakened German lines continued, but they were unable to make any significant territorial gains. Once more, the Grossdeutschland was tasked to attack. The Regimental commander was forced to merge the two rifle battalions into a single Rifle Battalion Grossdeutschland; as it arrived at its assembly area in preparation for a counterattack. The attack on Kosowka and Tschuchlowo had all the preparations made to ensure the success of this difficult attack. Upon reaching the gully, the Grenadiers began suffering heavy losses as they were opened up upon by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the smoking buildings in the village. The men of Grossdeutschland waited for darkness to withdraw. The pitiful group that returned numbered 3 officers and 30 men. It was all that remained of the once proud Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PANZER WAR is a set of game rules simulating World War II armored warfare using 1/285th scale miniatures. Each player assumes command of an Allied or Axis platoon or company. <br/>PANZER WAR includes rules covering most weapons, troops and vehicles used during the period 1942 to 1945. Battle action is simulated in a detailed and realistic manner, but with an extraordinary ease of play once the basic rules are understood. Many things that will seem difficult in reading will become almost second nature after just a few games. Once the basics of play have been mastered players will want to include some of the more interesting and complex optional rules dealing with artillery and aircraft.<br/><br/>(from the rules booklet)<br/><br/><br/>Typical 1970-1980's game style with charts to depict the warfare of 1/285 scale armor vehicles on all fronts of World War II. Key application of these rules is the modular movement to simulate both player moving at the same time in leiu of ugoigo systems that prevailed at the time. Sandwiched between the infantry movement was 4 separate movement phases with six different firing phases taking place after movement. Very chart driven.PANZER WAR was designed for 1/285th miniatures in mind, but can be adjusted for other scales.<br/>Game Scale for 1/285th is 1mm = 2 meters.<br/>Each vehicle or piece of equipment represents one such unit.<br/>Each miniature soldier figure represents 3 actual men.<br/>Each turn represents from one to three minutes.<br/><br/>The First Edition was published in 1979; the production run of 250 units was sold out.<br/><br/>The Second Edition was produced in full color in 1981. A print run of about 1000 units was produced. This version came with:<br/>1x Rules Booklet.<br/>1x Chart Folder with common used tables printed in the two inside pages and back page.<br/>1x Sheet of Aspect Diagrams (Three diagrams).<br/>11x Vehicle Battle Charts.<br/> - 3x German<br/> - 2x British<br/> - 2x American<br/> - 1x French<br/> - 1x Italian<br/> - 2x Russian<br/><br/><br/>The Third Edition of the game is distributed for free on the author's website.<br/>The rules were later used as the basis for the Panzer Command PC game by Matrix Games.",

        "description": "Portcullis features an upright wooden board shaped like a castle gate, which is very thick to prevent players from seeing each other&rsquo;s pieces before placed.  It has a 6x6 grid of holes into which 36 playing blocks&mdash;18 dark, 18 light&mdash;can be pushed.  There are two wooden trays for each player to sort their wooden playing blocks.  (When not in use, the pieces, trays, and board are all able to stack on top of each other for display.)  The blocks have one of four different flags painted on either end, always a different flag on each side for a total of six combinations of flags.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player must create a pattern of flags on his side, the shape of which is to be agreed upon before the game.  It can be a square shape (A) or a flag shape (B):<br/><br/>AA<br/>AA<br/><br/>B<br/>--BB<br/>B<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>---B<br/>BB<br/>---B<br/><br/>Typically the flag shape is used, as it is harder to block.  A player&rsquo;s pattern may utilize flags from either player&rsquo;s pieces (the directions the flags point is of no consequence) and the pattern is not affected by any other flags in the board.<br/><br/>Players take turns choosing their blocks in secret and placing them according to a key painted on the upper right hand corner of each side of the board, pointing the flag on the player&rsquo;s side according to the key in order to remember what flag is on the opposite side.  When either player sees a complete pattern on their own side, they turn the board and the game ends.  A draw can occur if all blocks are played with no pattern completed.  The rules provide for several variations that include bluffing, different goals, pushing blocks out, and different endings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Neverborn crew includes Jakob Lynch (leader), Hungering Darkness, and 3 Illuminated.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/>Jakob Lynch is a support master, able to manipulate fate and stack your hand. His totem is the heavy hitter of the pair and, some would argue, the thing in charge. The Hungering Darkness not only can do damage but he can infect models with the Brilliance which it then uses to control and manipulate them. The Hungering Darkness has a parasitic relationship with the rest of its crew using them to keep itself fed with Brilliance.<br/><br/>Lynch is not the offensive powerhouse that his totem is, but he does bring several options to the table:<br/><br/>Ace in the Hole<br/>Lynch plays with two Red Jokers, because he's that kind of honest. The &quot;normal&quot; one, and just for him, as in, the Lynch model, the Ace of Masks counts as a red joker, i.e. 14 in duels and Severe damage. Nice, eh? Better really if you have it in your hand, because you're more likely to flip it for one your minions.<br/><br/>The Source<br/>A very straightforward spell, if you're on Brilliance (as most of his crew should be) then you get a small movement buff. Due to the small range of this aura, the models need to be beginning their activation close to Lynch, making this a good Turn 1 spell to help you get out of the gate that much faster, especially when combined with Mr. Graves and the push from Bar's Closed.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Hand<br/>This is Lynch's signature spell and probably where most of his action points are going to be spent. The spell allows you to draw three cards, adding them to your hand, and depending on the even/odd value of the card flipped, your opponent will either get to draw a card or be forced to discard one. This spell is especially useful for helping to stack your hand (as you will gain all three cards except for aces and eights) before going into a big push with the Hungering Darkness. Due to the random nature of the spell's effect on your opponent's hand, it is not a reliable way to drain their hand of cards, and will generally provide them with the ability to card cycle more than anything else.<br/><br/>Holdout Pistol<br/>Lynch has a reasonably decent Cb with his pistol, along with a middle of the road damage range and gunfighter, as you would expect with a pistol. The pistol does have a very interesting trigger, Malifaux Roulette, where rather than flipping damage as per usual, you instead randomly select a card from your opponent's hand. Based on the suit of this card, one of several effects is applied to the target model: This trigger is rather situational, but can see use if the target has high armor or your damage flip has several negative twists where the normal shot is unlikely to be of any serious utility. Most of the effects are debuffs (Paralyze, Poison, lowered stats) so if intending to use the trigger, try to pick a target that has yet to activate, where you'll get the most use out of the effect. Additionally, this trigger allows you to see a card in your opponent's hand, knowledge with is never bad. (Of note, if the card chosen is a Black Joker, your opponent gets to chose an effect to apply to Lynch instead!) His other pistol trigger, Pip the Ace, allows you to discard cards from your hand to receive additional positive twists to damage. This lets you discard low value cards from your hand to easily ramp up the pistol damage.<br/><br/>Slave To Darkness<br/>One of his signature abilities, this allows Lynch to place (not summon) the Hungering Darkness on the table whenever a model with Brilliance dies for the low price of two cards of the same value. The Hungering Darkness enters play with wounds equal to half the value of the cards, rounded up. Maximizing the amount of wounds that the Hungering Darkness comes in on is not necessarily a high priority, as it is a Spirit and has multiple ways to heal itself. Although this ability is not restricted and can be used when you kill one of your opponent's models, it will give them an entire activation to deal with the totem, as it does not immediately activate like the Dreamer or LCB. One common way to use this ability is to run a Depleted into a mass of your opponent's models. If it dies to a melee attack, it explodes, causing damage, spreading brilliance, and bringing in the Hungering Darkness.<br/><br/>The Illuminated are those who have been exposed to The Darkness' Brilliance for too long and it builds up inside them to turn them into tough, form shifting brawlers. It serves the role as a damage dealer and brilliance spreader when used with his preferred Master, Jakob.<br/><br/>",

This expansion gives wizards the option to hire a captain, a special type of soldier, to help lead their warbands. Unlike other soldiers in the game, captains may choose their own weapons, have a few special abilities known as 'tricks of the trade', and gain experience. Of course, such experience and versatility comes at a price, so captains are going to want more than the retainer given to most soldiers &ndash; they want a cut of the treasure! Also included in this expansion are three new scenarios designed to give soldiers more of a chance to shine. All feature some type of limitation or obstacle to spellcasting that will force wizards to think a bit more about how much they rely on their magic.<br/><br/>",

There are three restrictions:<br/><br/>1. Every new piece must share an edge with at least one of the pieces already on the board.<br/>2. No two congruent pieces may share an edge.<br/>3. No four cells in a 2x2 arrangement may all be covered by pieces.<br/><br/>Each piece has two black squares and two white squares. Players attempt to make large groups of squares of their color (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections count). When no more pieces can be played, whoever has the largest such group wins. In the event of a tie score, the player who made the last move wins.<br/><br/>",

Emerging from the sewers, from the heart of their lair, the ghouls are now joining the Mythos faction.<br/><br/>Cthulhu Mythos Call #4 introduces some creative gameplay because all ghouls have the Burrower special ability. Thanks to this special ability, Ghouls may move underground, approaching their preys as close as possible, before engaging in a close combat assault, their greatest feature.<br/><br/>However, don&rsquo;t wait too long to get the ghouls to the surface or you&rsquo;ll risk getting caught, and face the consequences&hellip; Although they&rsquo;re heavily specialized troops &ndash; with only one life point &ndash; the ghouls are rather fragile.<br/><br/>The Ghoul Clan is lead by a ghoul priest with the disrupting habit, even for necrophagous ghouls, to play with food. This character benefits from the Master of the Dead special ability, supporting his clan&rsquo;s powers by raising Zombies.<br/><br/>In closing, these punchboards contain a set of thematic options to reinforce your ghouls as well as different terrain elements filling out the elements in Battleground Set #5 - The Sewers.<br/><br/>This product is accompanied by a digital booklet, downloadable from our site, containing the rules to play with The Ghoul Clan as well as two scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's fun, mildly addictive,  and almost too easy to learn.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>The game consists of 162 cards and an 8-page rulebook:<br/><br/>- 55 Attack cards<br/>    - 55 Counter cards<br/>    - 42 Injury cards<br/>    - 10 Special cards<br/><br/>How does Pass-a-Fist work?:<br/>How does a typical, figurative fist fight play out, you ask? Keep scrolling and we'll lay it all out!<br/><br/>To start, shuffle and divide the Fight cards and Injury cards into two separate piles. Players will draw from each throughout the game. Next, deal 5 Fight cards to each player.<br/><br/>To begin a turn (or, &quot;round&quot;) - a player draws a Fight card, and then plays an Attack card on another player:<br/><br/>If at any point an Attack card lands on a player, that player can play a Counter card to stop it, or redirect it:<br/><br/>What about those fancy sounding Special cards we mentioned earlier? Those can be played at any time, and they allow players to do... well... special stuff:<br/><br/>If an Attack card lands on a player, and they don't play a Counter card, they place an Injury card face up in front of them:<br/><br/>Once a player has received three (valid) Injury cards, they're out of the game.<br/><br/>The last person standing wins!<br/><br/><br/>Pass-a-Fist is a great time for anyone ages 12 and up (as long as you're okay with cartoonish violence, that is). The game has been very well received by a wide range of people, young and old, who've had a chance to play it. Turns out, everyone likes a pretend fight, especially if it results in some seriously good laughs.<br/><br/>The game is incredibly easy to learn, and only takes about 2 minutes to figure out. There's no mastering it, though - every new round brings about a different style of chaos. No two games are ever alike (...it's not even close).<br/><br/>The game plays pretty quickly (10-15 minutes) with a small group (4 players), or a bit longer (20-25 minutes) with larger groups (8-10 players). Easy game play and rules make it pretty adaptable to most groups, too. Play it with kids! Play it as a drinking game! Play it regularly and demand future expansions!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The designer says &quot;This game is customizable pinball, where you build the common board and launch balls of different materials (glass, wood, iron). Who earns best points?&quot;<br/><br/>In the game, the players begin by placing the components of a wooden pinball machine. The device does not have paddles to keep the ball in play. Instead, the game more closely resembles a pachinko machine, which are very popular in Japan. The ball falls freely after it is fired.<br/><br/>The flat area of the board has regular pinholes, and players start by placing pegs and barriers as they wish. Then they take turns firing a ball into the area. The base of the device has a series of slots with different scoring values. The players are trying to get the different types of pinball to fall to the more valuable slots to win.<br/><br/>The game includes a metal, magnetised peg.

Constructed largely of duraluminum and welded steel tubing, the airplane was light, sturdy, and very fast, with many features that were revolutionary for the day. It was the most common French two&ndash;seater in 1918 and was also used by USA and Belgium. This aircraft was widely used for both day and night bombing in the last year of the war. About 8000 were built before the war ended.<br/><br/>Breguet BR.14 B2 (Escadrille Br 111)<br/>Breguet 14s were assigned to Escadrille 111 in October 1917. During the war, the unit scored 15 victories. This model includes cards for optional armament and crew skills.<br/><br/>Breguet BR.14 B2 (Audinot/Hellouin De C&eacute;nival)<br/>Audinot and Hellouin de C&eacute;nival flew several bombing missions of Escadrille BR 127 from November 1917. They were shot down by enemy fighters during a daring mission, on March 28, 1918.<br/><br/>Breguet BR.14 A2 (Stanley/Folger)<br/>Gilbert Stanley and H.T. Folger belonged to the 96th Squadron, that operated from June 12, 1918 to the end of the war engaging in daring bombing missions across the front.<br/><br/>Each WW1 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Lore and timelines explore the long, shadowed history of these malefic warriors, from the dark days of the Horus Heresy to their renewed assault on realspace following the opening of the Cicatrix Maledictum. Collected art and illustrations bring the dark world of the Chaos Space Marines to life, while rules allow you to field an army from the Black Legion, Alpha Legion, World Eaters, Night Lords, Word Bearers, Emperor's Children, Iron Warriors, as well as renegade warbands, including ones of your own devising.<br/><br/>You'll be able to choose from a dark arsenal, containing everything from frothing, zealous Cultists to daemonforged war engines like the Defiler. Faction rules let you tailor your strategy and tactics to the legendary Traitor Legions, like the bloodthirsty World Eaters or relentless Iron Warriors, while a huge set of Stratagems offer you all manner of dirty tricks to unleash on your foes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the book is a fantastic resource for collectors, containing tips for building your army, examples of Chaos Space Marines forces, and loads of invaluable reference material and alternative colour schemes for painters.<br/><br/>This book contains:<br/><br/>- Let the Galaxy Burn: the terrible origin of the Chaos Space Marines, their betrayal of the Emperor during the Horus Heresy that ushered in an era of damnation, a timeline detailing the Ages of Betrayal, Retribution and Apotheosis with key battles and atrocities in gruesome detail (with a further timeline detailing the horrors of Abaddon&rsquo;s various Crusades) and a map detailing the current, tainted state of the galaxy<br/>- Information and details of the 7 major Chaos Legions &ndash; The Black Legion, Alpha Legion, Iron Warriors, Night Lords, Word Bearers, World Eaters and Emperor&rsquo;s Children &ndash; with histories, key battles, heraldries and colour schemes for each<br/>- An in-depth look at each of the characters and units available to each Chaos Space Marines army, with appropriately grisly background<br/>- A showcase of beautifully painted Citadel miniatures, depicting the colour schemes of the Chaos Space Marines expertly painted by the&lsquo;Eavy Metal team.<br/>- 45 datasheets covering the Chaos Space Marines range, featuring their rules and statistics for use in games<br/>- Army abilities and wargear lists, alongside a brief explanation of their use and the use of keywords<br/>- Rules profiles for every piece of wargear and every weapon in the Chaos Space Marines&rsquo; arsenal<br/>- Points values for all miniatures, weapons and wargear for use in Matched Play games<br/>- Rules for Battle-forged armies &ndash; 8 Legion Traits, 1 for each of the original Legions and 1 for Renegade Chapters<br/>- 24 Stratagems of which are Legion-specific; the Dark Hereticus psychic discipline with its 3 powers specific to the Marks of Tzeentch, Nurgle and Slaanesh and 14 weapons and artefacts available only to Chaos Space Marines<br/>- 6 Warlord Traits usable by any Chaos Space Marines Warlord and a further 7 which are Legion-specific<br/>- 6 unique Tactical Objectives for Chaos Space Marines.<br/><br/>Important Note:<br/>In 2019, Games Workshop released a second edition of the Codex to correspond with the release of Vigilus Defiant, Vigilus Ablaze, and Shadowspear. This newer edition contained new art, lore and updated rules encompassing new content from Imperium Nihilus: Vigilus Ablaze, including Prayers to the Dark Gods, updated units, and more.

        "description": "nestorgames GP is a fast and furious racing game for 2 to 8 players, derived from Top Speed by the same designer, that simplifies many aspects of its predecessor (same mechanism, but using dice instead of cards) and also adds some fun twists such as special items or shortcuts. It is a tribute to the arcade racing games of the 80&rsquo;s, such as SuperSprint or Nitro.<br/><br/>GAME OVERVIEW (please refer to the rulebook)<br/><br/>The player with the highest qualifying value goes first in the pit lane, with the rest of the players going in the same order as they are sitting and counterclockwise.<br/><br/>On your turn, if your car is belly up (you crashed on your previous turn) flip it over and pass the turn. You car doesn&rsquo;t move.<br/><br/>Otherwise, roll one of your dice. Then you can opt to stop rolling dice on roll another one, and so on until you&rsquo;ve either stopped rolling dice or you&rsquo;ve rolled the same number twice. Notice that you can&rsquo;t roll more than 6 dice.<br/><br/>One of these three things can happen:<br/><br/><br/>     You&rsquo;ve rolled the same number twice but the car is not on a corner: Your car does not move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     You&rsquo;re rolled the same number twice and the car is on a corner. You&rsquo;ve crashed! (see Crashing) Your car does not move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     You&rsquo;ve stopped rolling so you don&rsquo;t have repeated results: Add up all the values of the rolled dice and move your car forward exactly that many spaces along the track. Other cars don&rsquo;t block your movement.<br/><br/><br/>If your car moves and ends its movement on a non-corner space occupied by another car, you bump into it. Move that car one space forward. If, as a result, that car bumps into another car repeat the process. If a bumped car moves into a corner, it crashes (see Crashing). If there was another car (or more) on that corner then all of them crash on that space.<br/><br/>CRASHING: When a car crashes, flip it over belly-up, take one of its dice and place it on its &lsquo;box&rsquo; by the side of the pit lane. You won&rsquo;t be able to use the dice that are in your &lsquo;box&rsquo; unless you Fix the car (see Fixing your car).<br/><br/>Races are usually played to 3 laps, but this can be agreed upon. The first car crossing the finish line after that many laps wins.<br/><br/>Additional rules include fixing your car (recover a die), using a shortcut once per race, picking up and using special items (bombs, wrenches, turbo boosters, rockets and oil spills), championships, teams,...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game continues until all fatigue cards have been taken, at which point the player with the least fatigue wins.<br/><br/>Unchained reimplements Nightfall with some notable changes:<br/><br/><br/>    An asymmetric starting draft with no pre-set starter decks, so the action starts on turn 1.<br/>    Streamlined card costs and abilities for a broader audience.<br/>    A new 3x3 purchasing grid system inspired by fan variants of Res Arcana.<br/>    Tokens to track card offense and defense.<br/>    A shield that can be activated to negate the player's next fatigue card.<br/><br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

If Union General Sherman had proceeded with haste, the Federals could have captured Vicksburg and delivered a master stroke against the Rebels seven months before Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, 1863. Historically, the Union took four days to launch their &quot;Grand Assault&quot;, giving the Confederate defenders in their trenches ample time to receive much-needed reinforcements. Can you do better than Sherman?<br/><br/>The Prelude to Vicksburg game system is from Revolution Games' popular Blind Swords series that utilizes a chit-pull mechanic emphasizing the three &quot;FOW's&quot; of military conflict: Fog of War, Friction of War, and Fortunes of War.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The world is being explored by Humans who have recently discovered it.<br/><br/>In the game players use approximately 5-10 miniatures to represent their warband and there are several scenarios that give goals to each player such as capturing an artifact.<br/><br/>ShadowSea is a stand alone game, but uses a modified version of the Song of Blades and Heroes rules as its basis.  Like Song of Blades and Heroes, this game uses short, medium and long measuring sticks rather than measurement in inches or centimeters.  Also, six sided dice are used for determining action points available and resolving combat.  ShadowSea adds an expanded magic system, equipment rules, rules for resolving non-combat actions, and new special abilities to the basic Song of Blades and Heroes rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ever since the passage of the Prohibition Act, Lake City has been struggling with bootlegging and organized crime. Recently, things have taken a turn for the worse as a new boss has risen to power in the Lake City Mob, and the streets are running over with hooch-addled hooligans. In response, the government has established a special task force, dubbed the Prohibitionists, with the sole purpose of taking out the Boss and bringing the law back to Lake City.<br/><br/>You and the other players are those Prohibitionists, working cooperatively to defeat the mob. Every turn, a new card will be dealt off the Obstacles deck, representing everything standing in your way, from hired goons to secret bases to devious schemes to tie up your resources. In response, you'll play a card from your Tactics deck to dispatch the problem via Bribery, Contacts, Investigation, Subterfuge, or good old-fashioned Violence.<br/><br/>You won't be able to take out every Obstacle with one card, so it's essential to coordinate attacks; with a little luck and good planning you can take out multiple Obstacles in one blow. But watch out, because if you can't keep up with the Obstacles you'll be forced to discard cards straight from the Tactics deck, and if that deck ever runs out, you're kaputski, and the Mob will rule over Lake City.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tokyo Highway: Rainbow City / トーキョーハイウェイ レインボーシティ is a new edition of Tokyo Highway with new gameplay elements and updated components that make the game easier to play...which can be good or bad depending on your taste for collapsing roads.<br/><br/>At the start of play, each player has cars in their color, along with roadways (sticks), gray column pieces, and yellow column pieces. Players set up the city by placing one of their roadways with one end on the table and the other end on a column, then topping it with one of their cars. Next, they take turns placing city objects &mdash; buildings, an airport, a tower, a green area &mdash; around the playing area.<br/><br/>On a turn, expand your highway by adding a new stick to the end of it. When you do so, one end of the stick is placed on the column supporting your most recently played stick and the other end goes on a new column that you add to the table; this new column must contain one more or one fewer column pieces than the column on the other end of the stick. (If you create a column with a yellow piece on top and at least one piece under it, you can break this height restriction rule.)<br/><br/>If you've built this piece of the roadway so that your stick is the first to cross over or go under an opponent's stick, then you score by placing one of your cars on this roadway. If you cross over or go under multiple sticks on the same placement, you place one car per stick you top or bottom!<br/><br/>You can branch once from a column of yours topped with a yellow piece. Also, you can place a stick as an exit ramp if one end is placed on a single column piece and the other end on the table. This piece is automatically topped with a car &mdash; but it's also the final placement for this branch of your highway, so don't get stuck in a dead end.<br/><br/>If you run out of construction materials, you're out of the game. If you're the only one still in the game or you've placed all of your cars, you win.<br/><br/>Tokyo Highway: Rainbow City includes a &quot;mission&quot; variant in which all of the basic placement rules apply, but your goal is now to score the most points. Every car placed is worth 1 point, three roadways in a row with cars on them is 2 points, a loop around a building is 1 point, an exit ramp at the airport or green area is worth 2 points, placing the same type of car on a roadway as the opponent's car on the road above/below you is worth 1 point, etc.<br/><br/>In this edition of the game, the roadways have small tacky pads on each end, which makes the sticks more stable than in earlier editions when you placed wood sticks on wood columns.<br/><br/>",

On the other hand, Games for 6 players arent available that often - and at least not those with simple rules, which work fine for two and for 6 players.<br/><br/>&quot;Stein im Brett&quot; is one of those few games. There is a big bag, which contains the playing pieces in six colours. If you play a two player game, each player will have three colours. At a game with 3 players, everyone gets two colours and with 4-6 players, each person will just have one colour on his own, whereas the remaining ones will count for nobody.<br/><br/>With all constellations, all playing pieces will be at the bag. You will need them in order to fill up the board three times. A round will end, if there are no empty spaces on the board anymore. You only count your playing pieces and get points, if a piece wont have a neighbour of the same colour and is &quot;isolated&quot; from the others of his kind.<br/><br/>On your turn, you grab three pieces out of the bag and place them onto empty spaces on the board. Bribing the others, telling them the -best- positions for those pieces are a vital point in this fun game, where children and parents are equal at play.<br/><br/><br/>Publishers Info:<br/><br/>&quot;Familienspiele gibt es viele, Spiele f&uuml;r 6 Personen sind schon nicht mehr so h&auml;ufig anzutreffen - und Spiele mit kurzen, einfachen Regeln, die sowohl f&uuml;r zwei Personen als auch f&uuml;r 6 Personen gut sind, gibt es ganz wenige.<br/><br/>Stein im Brett ist so ein Spiel. Im gro&szlig;en Baumwollbeutel liegen Spielsteine in 6 Farben. Spielt man nur zu zweit, besitzt jeder 3 Farben. Bei drei Spielern sind es je 2 Farben und bei 4 - 6 Spielern wird jedem nur eine einzige Farbe zugeordnet und gewertet.<br/><br/>Es bleiben also immer alle Spielsteine mit im Spiel - das ist wichtig, denn alle Spielsteine sind notwendig, um das Spielbrett genau 3 x komplett zu belegen. Gewertet wird nach jeder Runde. Siegpunkte gibt es immer nur f&uuml;r Spielsteine ohne gleichfarbigen Nachbarstein.<br/><br/>Da die Spielsteine blind aus dem Beutel gegriffen werden, kommt es sicher zu turbulenten Diskussionen, an welche Stelle ein bestimmter Stein gelegt wird. Es entsteht ein kurzweiliges Spiel f&uuml;r den Familien- und Freundeskreis, bei dem Kinder und Erwachsene die gleichen Chancen haben.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Storms in the East: Finland-Romania 1944 is two games in one;<br/><br/>1. June 1944 marked the beginning of one of the greatest battles on Scandinavian soil, Tali-Ihantala. Stalin gave the order to finish up with Finland in order to concentrate on Operation Bagration that had just begun. Subsequently, Soviet forces had to first batter the fortified VKT-line then quickly break through toward the north.<br/>At the beginning, with the help of the 30th Guards army, the Soviet advance was slow but steady until they formed a salient near Ihantala. Attrition was great in both camps, but the arrival of the Finnish armoured division coupled with a particularly effective artillery fire changed the situation and the following counter-attack led to the pushing back of the Soviets.<br/>Finally, the Finnish forces succeeded with their last reserves and the German aviation to stabilize the lines. Stalin canceled the offensive and negotiated with the Finnish authorities to obtain the reversal of this former ally against the Germans. Finland was saved but at what cost!<br/><br/>2. Continuing their rapid advance across the country of their new ally, Romania, the Soviets were engaged by the Hungarian 2nd army in Transylvania before arriving in the local capital Cluj. Confronted by the enemy avant-guard, the Hungarians went so far as to launch an offensive along the Mureş. After a brief phase of surprise, the Stavka reacted by ordering the Soviet units present as well as the Romanian 4th army, in the process of reorganizing, to reach Turda and its pass. Attacks in several sectors along the Mureş ensued that the Hungarian forces as well as the German reinforcements had a difficult time repelling.<br/>Even the 23rd Panzer Division struggled to contain the repeated assaults by the Soviet and Romanian forces. Fortunately for the Axis, the allied losses were such that the Stavka decided mid-October to circumvent Turda by the east.<br/>As the Soviet, will you be able to break through the front in a decisive way and as a member of the Axis, will you succeed in containing the red waves?<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>&bull; One 59 x 41 cm map (printed front and back)<br/>&bull; 216 die-cut counters and markers<br/>&bull; 1 rule book with 7 scenarios including 2 campaigns<br/>&bull; 1 color player aid<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>",

These battles give us agood look at the Greco-Macedonian military system in action against Rome. However, before Tarentum called in King Pyrrhus to battle the Romans in southern Italy, this Greek city-state had summoned a number of other Greek condotiere to fight the barbarian tribes of the interior - the piratical Apulians, the fierce Lucanians, the savage Bruttians, the mighty Samnites and the stalwart Romans. The Greek soldiers of fortune who answered her call hailed from many directions - Epirus to the esat, Sparta to the southeast and Syracuse to the southwest. The Hellenistic armies they led were similar in composition, but not indentical. Each mercenary captain brouht a core of troops from his homeland, supplemented by large mercenary forces drawn from the Adriatic and Ionian shores, the levies of Tarentum and tge Italiot League and occasionnally friendly Italian tribes. They were not altogether unsucessful, but none managed to achieve permanent r&eacute;sultats. This survey of foreign Greek armies battling to preserve Magna Graecia in the late Fourth Century BC will be presented in two parts. The battles presented provide an interesting mis of clashing military systems: the Hellenistic combined arms army versus a number of barbarian tribes, Samnite cohorts and even the legions of Rome. Part I begins with the campaigns of King Alexander I Molossus of Epirus.&quot;<br/><br/>- The Battle of Sipontum, 334 BC. (Epirotes VS Apulians)<br/>- The Battle of Consentia, 333 BC.

        "description": "Suez Solo: Rommel Drives Deep is a solitaire game where the player takes command of the German-Italian Panzer Armee Afrika (PAA) during the 1942 campaign in Egypt as Rommel drives on the Suez Canal. The game begins immediately following the PAA capture of Tobruk in June 1942 and continues through to the August battle of Alam el Halfa where Rommel was finally stopped. Your goal is to seize strategic objectives such as major cities in the Nile Delta and the Suez Canal. In the game, you control the PAA. The game system plays the Allied Middle East Command (MEC). You will have to deal with a wide variety of situations, from battling against fierce counterattacks to figuring out ways to extend your lines of supply. Your objective: Suez! The game has two levels: the Standard Rules, that gives the player a quick wargame, and the Optional Rules, that give more realism at the expense of more complexity. The time span of turns 1 to 7 is from the last week of June 1942 to the first week of September; turns 8 to 10 cover the rest of September to mid-October. Each turn can represent any amount of time from two days of intense combat to two weeks of refitting and reorganizing. The map scale is approximately 45 km to the inch. Ground combat units represent everything from battalions to divisions. Air units represent two to six groups.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
