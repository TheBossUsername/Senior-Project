Cards have comical names of people within a society, they could call them cliques rather than circles. (examples: Mrs. Get-there, from Butte, Mr. Clymer from Denver and Major But-in (the character who disturbs the social gatherings))  Each circle has a monetary value associated which is paid to the player who collects the entire circle and turns it in to the bank.  The player with the most counters (Counters represent $50,000 each) at the end wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules are very specific and proper etiquette is enforced!!<br/><br/>Typical of the time, early games were designed with religious backgrounds encouraging high sense of morals and etiquette.<br/><br/>",

Before playing, all players write down their answers to some &quot;embarrassing question&quot; and these are placed in an envelope. During play, the roll of a die and movement of a communal piece determines what happens in a round. Activities include charades (get points for making the other players guess which persona you're acting out a particular scene as), trivia (everyone can get a point for answering a true-or-false question), a personal question (you get a point just for giving an answer), nothing (because there's nothing like losing your turn), and arbitrary events such as gaining points or losing your next turn (because there's nothing like effectively losing two turns). Once someone has 19 points they win and get to look at the answers in the envelope before anyone else.<br/><br/>",

Turns are hourly and there is no indication of hex size. Combat units are brigades and divisions with separate leaders. Leaders have four numbers on them (?) while combat units only three (combat, morale and movement). The CRT is by strength point losses and there is a demoralization track as well for each side. The map terrain and its effect chart look very similar to SPI&rsquo;s old NAW system, with a little more chrome. There are additional rules for fortifications and bridges also.<br/><br/>",

There are 756 counters, along with 8 PAC, many of them off-map strength tracks. There is a 28 pg rulebook and a 24 pg Historical Notes booklet.<br/><br/>This is nothing more than a modified version of Kevin Zucker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Campaigns of Napoleon&rdquo; system, period. The differences I can see are not using individual combat units with historical IDs, instead the designer chose to use icon units (such as artillery or infantry) combined with strength point markers to go underneath. Also, leaders are not on the map and forces are represented by numbered force markers instead. There is an AP Table, but no Attrition Table. The CRT is vastly different, with the addition of negative numbered results and &lsquo;D&rsquo; and &lsquo;DD&rsquo; results (would sure like to see those!). There is also the ubiquitous Paris Morale Track.<br/><br/>",

Then go again. As the path grows, you&rsquo;ll be hopping from footprint to footprint and acting out all kinds of things. It&rsquo;s so much fun, Mom and Dad might want to play, too!

        "description": "Space Race is a simple card game designed for two players, though more can play with additional card sets (as there is no player interaction whatsoever).<br/><br/>The object of the game is to complete a round trip through the Solar System by drawing ten planet cards in their proper order. (The order will be unfamiliar, though, as it goes Earth -&gt; Saturn -&gt; Jupiter -&gt; Mars -&gt; Uranus -&gt; Neptune -&gt; Venus -&gt; Mercury -&gt; Earth). Each card features well executed art done in a style similar to golden age science fiction pulp magazines.<br/><br/>The game consists of two identical decks with cards numbered 1-10. These cards represent round trips the the Solar System, starting with &quot;Take Off&quot; (Card 1) and ending with &quot;Landing On Earth&quot; (Card 10). Players take a deck and shuffle it, then place it before them. The first player draws a card. If it is &quot;Take Off&quot; (Card 1), they place it in front of them and draw the next card. If the next card is a planet but not Card 2, they discard it in a discard pile next to their original pile and draw again, until they draw a card that says &quot;Next player goes&quot;. The next player takes a turn, and draws until they get a &quot;Next player goes&quot; card. Chance cards such as &quot;lost on the moon,&quot; &quot;Sputnik,&quot; and &quot;Danger--Comets&quot; can affect a player's turn.<br/><br/>Players may draw from either pile, so there is a memory element, as you must remember which pile your next planetary target was in.<br/><br/>All cards must be discarded in the pile next to the pile from which they were drawn.<br/><br/>The goal is to collect all 10 cards, in sequence.<br/><br/>Rules list a variant for three or more players through using multiple copies of the game.<br/><br/>",

The player has a &quot;corral&quot; where he can hold up to four singles or pairs (including Mr. and Mrs. Noah). When all three parts of the ark are complete, up to eight pairs may be moved on the ark, plus Mr. and Mrs. Noah. When one player has a full ark, the game ends.<br/><br/>Players can play not only to their own ark or corral, but also to other players' arks and corrals. Completing a part of another player's ark, giving another player a pair for his corral or ark, or completing a pair in a player's corral is considered a &quot;good deed&quot;. For each one the player collects a &quot;good deed&quot; card good for points at the end of the game. Good deed cards can also be used to cancel &quot;misfortune&quot; cards drawn from the deck.<br/><br/>",

The game includes an air game system, a ground system and unique rules where command and control are critical for movement purposes. Use of SAM missiles and SAGGER AT play important roles to keep the Israeli at bay. At first, it appears as a &quot;David vs Goliath&quot; battle because of the disparity of forces. The Egyptian needs to create breaches and bridging and move quickly before the balance favors the Israeli. Time is not a friend to either side at various times in the game.<br/><br/>",

Whether it's demonstrating a pet trick, making a sandwich a gorilla would like or learning to hula dance.<br/><br/>Editorial Review from Amazon.com:<br/>&quot;A scavenger hunt in a can, Scaventure Kids provides everything needed to plan and execute a challenging hunt. Included in the cardboard container are 150 cards, instructions, and team stickers. The cards each have four items for a team to find or do. Cards ask players to do things like &quot;Find two bags with different store names&quot; or &quot;Have your team act out a scene from your favorite movie.&quot; Each team takes out cards and has 30 minutes to carry out the tasks. At the rendezvous, the teams share their finds and winners are chosen. For rainy days, vacations, or parties, Scaventure Kids is a simple and creative activity that fosters teamwork and creative problem-solving. --Lee Strucker&quot;<br/><br/>",

With the youngest children you simply have to draw a card and then move the same number as shown on the card. With older children you can choose either to play with addition or subtraction. To move on the board you have to draw 2 cards and move the sum of the cards. When you pass the symbol with the piece of Lego you can take one. The winner is the first player to collect 3 pieces of Lego and then get back to start. There are 2 tiles which can be placed on the board: Either you can have an extra turn or you miss your turn. Playing the game children can learn to count and calculate as well as game-mechanics as turn-taking, drawing cards, taking extra turns and missing a turn.<br/><br/>",

I know you're there!&quot; Hector's voice echoed across the valley. &quot;You can hide behind your goblins and skeletons, but I know you're there, and I am coming for you!&quot; He knew Jason could hear him, and he knew that his arch-enemy could not resist such a challenge. But how would he respond?<br/><br/>The answer wasn't long in coming. A huge boulder sailed across the valley and smashed into the ground just short of Hector's forces. One of his men went down screaming, hit by a sliver of rock. So Jason had a cyclops in his army, did he? Hector looked over to his minotaurs, roaring and waving their battleaxes. They would make short work of a cyclops, and then his ogres would begin the slaughter. He gave the hand signals for his line of mighty beasts to advance. This would be a day to remember!<br/><br/>If he had noticed the shadow that flitted over him, he might have looked up and seen Jason's roc beginning its dive on his forces...<br/><br/>Mythfire is a 2-player wargame of mythical beasts, mostly from Greek mythology. Players choose their armies from an array of creatures with varying abilities, then fight to the death.<br/><br/>",

This was a line of four games that were somewhat larger than a typical boxed microgame of the day.<br/><br/>Hydra! could reasonably be described as &quot;Ogre in Space.&quot; As in Ogre, one player has a single huge unit while the other has many small units. Here the large unit is the eponymous Hydra, which has phasers, proton torpedoes, energy sapper discs, a gyro-de-stabilizer, a molecular structure distorter, and a force field projector.  The other player controls an alien space fleet consisting of frigates, battle cruisers, larger battle cruisers, and mine sweepers. Damage for both sides is marked off on record sheets.<br/><br/>The Hydra player's goal is simply to destroy as many enemy ships as possible, but players are invited to make up other scenarios and some extra counters are provided to facilitate this.<br/><br/>Hydra is identified on the side of the box as product number 7001. However, on its rear cover-sheet the game is identified as product number 7002. This probably explains why some examples of Hydra have been found bearing the rear cover-sheet for the Midi Game &quot;Journey&quot;, as that sheet was erroneously marked as product number 7001, which corresponded to the numbering on the side of the Hydra box.<br/><br/>",

Dear children, dear parents, who is writing these words has designed the animals you see, he is the father of three wonderful daughters Alessia, Alice and Michela who, like all the other children, are always searching for something new to do and to learn from. These unpublished images and these games are inspired at Bookgames a series of books designed to help parents grow with their children in a more simple way, more profitable and fun: PLAYING WITH THEM.<br/><br/>These games aim at those children that, in most cases, can not read yet or they are learning. That is why every character on a coloured pedestal has a big initial and a name completely written with capital letters. Children love to play: that is why every picture to be cut can become a playing card, or it can be folded along the base so that it stands and be played with.<br/><br/>The Kromosauri game includes 54 pictures to cut, one coloured series of (27), one black and white series of (27) (that you can colour yourself) and a series of (27) presentation cards with a brief story where the character presents himself. There are also the rules to 6 different games to able you to use the picture cards you have cut.<br/><br/>Thanks to this material you could have fun with your children getting them involved (and getting yourself involved) by playing with one of the 6 games offered (or you could make up new ones)<br/><br/>",

It is not clear if it was ever published as such.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 12 players plus an umpire, but can be played by fewer (the rules only specifically mention changes for as few as 8 players). The umpire is not strictly necessary, but would make sense if the game were intended to be played by groups of children. The game is played cooperatively.<br/><br/>Each player has his or her own board. Each corresponds to a city or section of a city in the US, and is a stylized representation of one of its commercial real estate districts. Players move around their board by die roll (using the difference of two dice, not the sum) and can buy properties when they land on them. When a player rolls doubles they do not move, but all owned properties pay rent to the owner (from the bank).<br/><br/>There are a few other aspects to the system. When players buy or sell property they may do so at face value or may try rolling a 12-sided die to &quot;negotiate.&quot; Odds are they will do better this way but there is a chance they will do considerably worse. A player may travel to another player's board, which allows them or the other player to propose a joint venture, where both chip in to buy a property. Only the board's player gets rent, but since it is a cooperative game this is not an issue. Finally, there are spaces which cause players to draw event cards which do the usual sorts of things.<br/><br/>Play is for a specified amount of time - 75 minutes is suggested in the rules. At this point the net worth of all players is totaled, and if more than one group is playing (which would require multiple copies of the game), the one with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The theme of this game is summed up in the title.  Players are dealt a hand of six cards, each depicting animals.  Each animal is labeled as either PREY or PREDATOR and has a numeric value based on its strength in the wild.  Players also have a playing piece that's actually a small plastic animal (my set has a zebra, a gorilla, an elephant, and a rhinoceros).<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she may either toss their hand and draw six new cards or play a PREY card face up.  Then, going 'round the table to the left, each player may play a PREDATOR card of equal or greater strength.  The next player in succession can only play if their PREDATOR card is of higher strength than any previously played predator.  Also, any predator played against the prey must also inhabit a common continent with the prey (color coded spheres on the cards--see, educational).<br/><br/>If no PREDATOR cards were played, the owner of the PREY card moves forward the strength of that card.  If one or more PREDATOR cards were played, the owner of the highest one played battles the owner of the PREY card via an on-board spinner.  A player spins and consults the difference in value between the predator and prey (four possibilities: 0, +1, +2, or higher).  Wherever the spinner stops, simply check to see the color of the difference in values.  If that number is yellow, the prey escapes, if it's red, the predator &quot;captures&quot; the prey.  The owner of the winning animal card moves forward a number of spaces equal to the PREY card's strength.<br/><br/>The spinner is divided into only five segments.  Four seem to be of equal size and the larger one (about 40% of the dial) is all yellow.  So, the odds are with the prey.  But with a more-than-plus-two differential, there's less than a 15% chance of escape.<br/><br/>At the end of a player's PREY turn, she replenishes her hand to six cards.<br/><br/>The movement track is 50 squares long.  First animal playing piece to the end is the winner.<br/><br/>This is probably not technically a children's game, but I think that's the audience that it suits best (though the idea of those cute little animals being &quot;captured&quot; by predators might be a bit much for some kids).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Developers:<br/><br/>&quot;This game was developed to fill a need in the sports game market.  Our goal was to develop a realistic football game that could be played anywhere in a relatively short time by almost anybody.  Yes there are some very realistic games out there, but they are too complicated for a lot of people to play, such as a father and a son.  Other games are simpler, but they leave out the drama and agony of tough calls (go for it or punt?).  We feel we have met our goals with Tabletop Quarterback.  You can play a game and keep full statistics in less than an hour.  Some of the &quot;experts&quot; who developed this game have been trounced by wives and 11 year old kids.  We think youl like it and get caught up in the action just like we have.&quot;<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Basic football rules apply; things like 4 tries to make 10 yards, 6 points for a touchdown, 3 points for a field goal.  The risks are here: such as the probability of making a long field goal, an unexpected turnover, a drive-killing penalty.  Usually, sound football savvy will get you through.  But don't be afraid to make some chancey calls as they can work and really turn a game around.<br/><br/>Call play, both players roll dice, compare results to chart.  Repeat as indicated by rules.  Game is over after 4 quarters.<br/><br/>",

The players are not playing against one another, just recreating a season and participating in its progress.<br/><br/>A schedule is preset using twenty of the top college football teams (which can be chosen and ranked by the players). All other teams are represented by a generic &quot;unranked&quot; team. A season is then played out for the ranked teams. The game scores are based on the teams' rankings; the better a team is ranked, the more likely it is do score well and win. Each game takes only a few seconds to resolve (using a specially-created deck of cards), and a scoreboard for each week is created using the results of these games. After each week, the players vote on where each ranked team should be newly ranked (invariably dropping some of them from the rankings entirely), and a new set of rankings is generated prior to the next week's play.<br/><br/>At the end of the season, the major bowl games are determined based on rankings and conference alignment, and then played to determine the final rankings.<br/><br/>There is an option for players to secretly select teams at the start of the season so that they are actually competing against one another.<br/><br/>Betting is optional, either with the basic game or the variant, but a &quot;modified mean&quot; must be used in calculating the rankings to prevent players from skewing the results by ranking their own favorites unreasonably high.<br/><br/>Good for an afternoon of fun for the college football fanatic. Lots of math, though!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sextett is a collection of 6 abstract strategy games packaged in one box.  According to the rules none of these games had been published before, although in fact at least a few are traditional games. Ravensburger catalog #12.026<br/><br/>The game box includes several sets of multi colored pawns used in all games and 3 double sided hard playing boards.<br/><br/>The games included are:<br/><br/>Quicki - a dice rolling race game where players move around an abstract grid of points trying to reach their colored places in the board center, players can be sent back to their starting places by other players choosing to land on their current position.<br/><br/>Ponte - from the translated rulebook: The object of the game is to reach the island by crossing streets and bridges with one figure as fast as possible and then build a tower and reach it by jumps.<br/><br/>The Magic Star - The object of the game is to try to move clockwise around the star on the outer or inner path beginning from the starting point.  The player who manages to get all of his game figures into his own star corner first wins the game.  A blockade figure constantly changes the aspect of the game.<br/><br/>Piggy Back - The object of the game is to get all the figures across the board first, whereby the players are forced at times to carry the opponent's figures &quot;piggy-back&quot; across the board or even to be carried in the same way themselves in order to reach their destination.  The point of the game is to try to take advantage of the piggy back rule whenever possible.<br/><br/>Fox Jumping - A gathering of foxes (2 or 4 fox families make 40 foxes) is disturbed by a hunting party.  Hastily each fox tried to hide in one of the 39 neighboring dens.  But since there is room for one fox in each den, the slowest fox loses the race.<br/><br/>Surakarta - This game originated in Indonesia.   It bears the name of the old time-honored city of Surakarta on the island of Middle Java.  The game is played on a grid of points with all points on the outer edge connected by a curved line that leads back to another board edge.  The idea is to move your pawns around the grid trying to get to a curved line that can be used to move to another side of the board and more importantly eliminate your opponents pawn.  The game is played actively in Indonesia by drawing lines in the ground and playing with pebbles.<br/><br/>",

Each player is a trader in imports and exports, and his success or failure is measured by the profit or loss resulting from his transactions.<br/><br/>---end brochure quote---<br/><br/>The center of the board shows a map of Central and South America, while around the edge are the spaces you move on.  There are two card decks: one shows the countries you can visit, and the other shows dollar figures, both for buying and selling.  When leaving the USA, you pick a card to see where you're bound and another card to see what your cargo cost you (red number). You roll 1d6 per turn until you arrive at your destination, then draw another dollar card to see what you get for selling your cargo (red number, which are usually higher).  You repeat this process for going home, except you roll 2d6 for movement on the way home (7s means you lose your turn).  Game ends when a player has made five complete round trips - whoever made the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

In the running events, players roll the dice and move their pieces along the track. In the jumping events there is some decision-making and push-your-luck involved, as players must decide when to jump. They move their pieces according to the die-roll and will have to decide if they are happy with the result or would like to roll once more, of course risking an illegal jump.<br/><br/>Players may either just play to win, or they may wish to know their actual results in meters and seconds. In the latter case, there are some results tables in the rulebook that can be used. The current WRs, as of 2003, are also noted. Only men&acute;s results are included, and all playing pieces depict men.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>1 gameboard<br/>20 cardboard flat figures w/ metal stands<br/>2 dice<br/>1 rules folder (in Swedish)<br/><br/>",

All six games share in common the Skix Ball Wheel, a kind of reverse spinner in which a marble is launched and spins around the outside rim of the wheel until it lands in one of the many grooves along the inside &quot;hub&quot; of the wheel.<br/><br/>Each game has a circular paper disk that is placed over the hub in the center of the wheel; the disk gives a value or instruction to each groove on the inside hub. A two-sided gameboard is also included for four of the games.<br/><br/>The six games are as follows:<br/><br/>1) BADLANDS: Be the first to travel from St. Louis to Houston, watching for Indians and bandits.<br/><br/>2) HILL CHAMP: Get to the top of the hill by following a crisscrossing path.<br/><br/>3) SPORTS CAR RACE: Race against your opponents and be the first to cross the finish line.<br/><br/>4) TUG OF WAR: Pull the other team onto your side. Only one marker is used in this game, to determine where the center of the &quot;rope&quot; currently is.<br/><br/>5) SPELL-N-SCORE: This is one of two games that is played with pencil-and-paper, rather than the gameboard. Each player spins for five letters -- each with its own point value -- and attempts to make a word worth as high a score as possible.<br/><br/>6) CARDS (Poker, Black Jack, War): This is the other paper-and-pencil game(s). Shoot the marble to determine which cards are &quot;drawn&quot; for each of these games.<br/><br/>",

The other players have one minute to identify the word. The first to identify the word gains (or keeps) control of the dice.<br/>If no player correctly identifies the word, play continues to the left.<br/><br/>This process continues until a winner is determined.<br/><br/>",

Ships with a given total mass can protect a ship whose mass is less than theirs making that ship harder to hit.<br/><br/>The game system is downloadable (PDF) and includes the rules, board and cards.  There are a number of optional weapon systems so that custom designed ships can be developed to fit a particular sci-fi genre.<br/><br/>From the publisher's Web site:<br/><br/>Each player has a control sheet which has 3 rows on it (Ranks) each rank also has a protected area.<br/><br/>Each ship is placed in a rank 1, 2 or 3 dependant on the setup conditions of the scenario.<br/><br/>Each turn the players roll for initiative ( for their side not individual ships), and then alternate activating ships.  Activation consists of moving (if you want to) and firing (again if you want to), you can fire and move or move and fire.<br/><br/>Firing procedure is very easy and is based on the ranks you and your target are in (add them +1 if the target is protected) + bonuses for special abilities.  You declare how much damage you wish to do and roll to hit , the defender applies defenses and marks any remaining damage.<br/><br/>Once all ships have been activated (or all players defer twice consecutively) the turn is finished and any end of turn effects are applied.  Then a new turn starts....<br/><br/>",

The RATZ are a genetically-engineered slave race that earned its freedom in the months directly preceding the rise of Injurius I to the throne of the Empire. Those months were enough for the little guys to spread to nearby systems, and become unkillable - as a race.<br/><br/>Injurius might still have gone to the trouble of wiping them out, for surely there are no more troublesome creatures in the universe than RATZ - but his scientists have told the Emperor that these creatures, though their lives are often shortened by brutality, are effectively immortal. Barring accident, starvation or plague, these creatures don't age once they reach adulthood.<br/><br/>The Emperor decided to use the RATZ as test subjects for his experiments - after all, an immortal Emperor would be a great asset to the Empire. Allowing the creatures to fight in the arena is simply a bonus: any RATZ that are felled in the arena go into the Special Program, and work goes on.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Injurius Games<br/><br/><br/>",

Those who know many bureaucrats and use their knowledge get ahead. Just putting in an honest day&rsquo;s work as a teacher isn&rsquo;t good enough. You get closer to the desired bureaucrats, when the class sizes increase, by playing out new school, school board or ministry of culture facilities. The better facilities attract more bureaucrats &ndash; that much is obvious. When the class sizes shrink, you can increase the number of bureaucrats by skills: new laws, new rules or certificates. To play out facilities or skills you need various cards such as party book, lobbying, intrigue, catastrophe and honest work, which you get for teaching and are therefore easiest to get in the schools. The player with the most bureaucrats wins. But there&rsquo;s also &ndash; although rarely &ndash; justice: The player who manages to get 7 of the 10 school cards receives an award from the government and immediately wins all the bureaucrats.<br/><br/>",

Children today live in a very active and sophisticated world. As a result, they need to know how to react to emergency situations. The best way to teach children is to make it fun. In the game, children and adults are asked safety questions and parents are encouraged to help the child get the correct answer. The child is rewarded with Lifesaver tokens for each correct answer. They could win a penny, five cents, a hug, a &quot;stay up 1/2 later&quot; token, etc. Honoring the tokens makes the family fun last long after the game is over. It also motivates children to play the game again and again, thus reinforcing principles of safety.<br/><br/>",

Some of these titles reveal the type of game: &ldquo;Baseball,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bowlaround,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Impossi-Bowl,&rdquo; are all pretty clear, for instance.  Other titles are Ideal&rsquo;s proprietary titles for games or variations that they have devised for this unique &ldquo;arena-style&rdquo; playing board. It&rsquo;s all explained in the instruction booklet, which illustrates how to play each game.  Gameplay is kind of a mix of Skittle Pool, Zig Zag Zoom, and Rebound or Bumper Shot.<br/><br/>There is a cool little marble-shooter gadget and marbles, of course.  There are other gadgets and equipment, too: tenpins for bowling games, a triangular pin-setting device, a spinner device and an abstract clown used as challenging obstacles during play, and a sidelines bat for baseball-type games.  Any number of people can play&mdash;including solo (which isn&rsquo;t much fun, however)&mdash;but Smack-A-Roo is best suited for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>",

The game is more similar to Army Chess (Lu Zhan Jun Qi) or Stratego, featuring hidden pieces and a hierarchical system of combat, where higher ranked pieces defeat lower ones: the objective is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s flag. Like Army Chess, Gunjin Shogi requires a third person to act as umpire and resolve combat. Unlike Army Chess (and more like Hai Lu Kong Jun Qi), Gunjin Shogi includes planes and tanks.<br/><br/>Each player has 23 pieces, consisting of a flag, 12 officers, 2 planes, 2 tanks, a cavalry unit, two engineers, a spy and two land mines. There is a hierarchy of ranks, with some exceptions &ndash; planes naturally cannot be destroyed by land mines and engineers deactivate land mines, for instance.<br/><br/>The game dates to at least before the second world war (I base this on an incomplete pre-war set I was shown in an antique shop in Japan).<br/><br/>",

The book then moves on to traditional board and dice games such as checkers, backgammon, and craps.  There are many word and guessing games.  Outdoor activities are also listed, including races, snow or water games, lawn games, and full-blown sports.<br/><br/>Ideas for adults' get-togethers include quick-thinking contests and even dancing games.  The book details countless games for children, suitable for everyday play or social events such as birthday parties.  Some of the party games are geared toward specific holidays.<br/><br/>This huge volume devotes one little paragraph to branded games such as Monopoly, Pit, and Flinch.  It only mentions that they exist, and require special equipment, which is purchased along with the rules.<br/><br/>Although you'll find very familiar entries such as bridge, marbles, and baseball, many of the games are less known, or a variation on a more familiar idea.  Some of the names are intriguing in their own right.  Here's a sampling of names of the many games to learn:<br/><br/>Misery Nap<br/>Bierspiel<br/>Anti-nudist<br/>Hearts of Lettuce<br/>Skeegee-Weegee<br/>The G Man Never Takes His Ease<br/>Literary Salad<br/>Strawberries Without Cream<br/>Schnozzle Race<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple trivia game covering the American Civil War.  Each card (two standard decks' worth) has a photograph or etching reproduction on the front and a point value.  On the back are two questions--one &quot;buff&quot; level, the other &quot;scholar&quot; level.  Get either question right--it's not clear, from the rules, who gets to choose which question gets asked, the asker or the answerer--and you get the points listed on the card.  There is often no clear connection between the point value of the question and its difficulty.  The pictures, however, are very nice.<br/><br/>In an odd twist, if a card's question goes unanswered, the answer is then read aloud and the card set aside.  After all the rest of the cards have been dealt with, this pile of discards--whose answers, again, have been revealed--gets shuffled up and gone through again.  Presumably this is to test short-term memory.  The game ends once all cards have been correctly answered.<br/><br/>This is part of a series of &quot;WIT&quot; games from this company, which included trivia games on wildlife, National Parks, and other Americana topics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From reading the rules:<br/><br/>A bizarre and unlikely combination of checkers, Chinese checkers, backgammon, and chess.<br/><br/>Note: production quality of this game is surprisingly high. The &quot;checkers&quot; feel to be made of high-quality material, and feel cool and smooth to the touch, reminiscent of 'Go' stones, but much larger (and flat). They have star outline, star-filled, and star-filled in a circle designed etched into them: 1 set blue etchings, 1 set red etchings. The board is standard hard cardboard. The board art is gray background with white lines, with blue and red stars, triangles, and square delineated colored zones.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>Each player starts with 1 'pawn' (checker) and 1 &quot;King' (checker with a star in a circle design} on their designated opposed short-sides of the 9 x 10 square board. Two dice (each numbered only 1-3) are rolled to determine movement.<br/><br/>&quot;Pawns&quot; (checkers) move forward or sideways and can only jump other &quot;pawns&quot;.<br/><br/>&quot;Knights' (checkers with a star design) are created by jumping a &quot;pawn&quot; with its own &quot;King&quot;, They can jump &quot;pawns&quot; or &quot;knights&quot;, and may not be jumped by &quot;pawns&quot;. When a &quot;pawn&quot; is knighted, the checker is flipped over to it's star-design side.<br/><br/>&quot;Kings&quot; (checker with a star in a circle design) move forward, backward, or sideways. They can jump any piece, but must stay out of the opponent's &quot;holding zone&quot; (a 3 x 3 square area in the middle of the opponent's side).<br/><br/>A piece may enter the board on a player's holding zone when a 2 is rolled on a die, and is moved the number on the other die.<br/><br/>A piece may leave the board when it is in a &quot;destination square&quot; (located on the last rank of the opponents side of the board) on any roll.<br/><br/>Captures are only made by a King. When a king jumps an opposing piece, that piece is placed back in the opponent's 'holding zone' (effectively starting over it's journey).<br/><br/>There is a scoring system in place for end-of game (Pawns with 1, Knights 2, Kings 4), and the doubling-cube is used to issue challenges during play.<br/><br/>The rule-sheet has a small section on strategies, and &quot;Championship tournament&quot; guidelines. Very ambitious.<br/><br/>",

Therefore, if able, appear unable; if active, appear not active; if near, appear far; if far, appear near. If they have advantage, entice them; if they are confused, take them; if they are substantial, prepare for them; if they are strong, avoid them; if they are angry, disturb them, if they are humble, make them haughty; if they are relaxed, toil them; if they are united, separate them. Attack where they are not prepared, go out to where they do not expect.<br/><br/>Each player commands a troop of 25 game pieces: 1 Flag, 1 Army, 1 Corps, 2 Divisions, 2 Brigades, 2 Regiments, 2 Battalions, 3 Companies, 3 Platoons, 3 Engineers, 3 Mines, and 2 Bombs. To win a game, one must either capture the Flag piece or defeat all the movable pieces of the opponent player. When two opposing game pieces are engaged in a battle, the identities of the two pieces are only revealed to the electronic referee system (not to the players) which determines the winning piece and the defeated piece. The battlefield consists of railway tracks along which the pieces can move continuously, country-road routes along which the pieces cannot move continuously, and bases which provide shelters to any pieces occupying them. On each side, the Flag piece is to be secretly placed in one of the two castle-shaped headquarters and guarded by movable troop pieces and unmovable Mines. Lively military figures, numeric numbers, and words in both English and Chinese are shown on the game pieces.<br/><br/>",

See who knows more about me (and what's more important than that?). It's more more fun than &quot;Deviled-egg Nite&quot; at Moe's Tavern!<br/><br/>And guess what?

Concentration and a bit of tactical insight are the only requirements for this game.<br/><br/>Each player gets 30 pins. A 6-sided die determines how many pins you have to use in your turn. You can only build on one square and points are given when a square is finished. All player get point for the number of pins they have contributed in the squares that are finised. The player that finishes a square gets a bonus.<br/><br/>While building finishing one square you are able to finish more squares. Possible squares for points are 3x3 bonus 5pt, 4x4 bonus 10pt and 5x5 bonus 15pt.<br/><br/>In the rules is a table that gives you the number of points you get for the pins in the square<br/>pin 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16<br/>pt 1 2 3 4 6 10 12 16 20 24 28 33 38 43 80<br/><br/>To finish you need to throw the die and use all the pins (when you throw too higj the next player gets the turn).<br/>After the first player all players have to continue building from that spot connected to the already placed pins in a manner to build valid squares (not allowd are 2x2 squares of double rows).

In scoring the player caught out gets a letter marked against then, first the letter &ldquo;S&rdquo; then &ldquo;N&rdquo; and so on the game ends when one player goes out having spelled SNATCH, the winner being the player with the fewest letters. The second difference is that a greater number of sets are used in play compared to the number of players. 3 players 5 sets, 4 players 7 set and for the rest it also uses 3 more sets than players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Original Rodeo Hexagame, a dice and bet game for the whole family&quot;<br/><br/>In turn, each player competes in of 6 Rodeo disciplines, whilst the others place bets on the outcome. An active player can earn good money by successfully completing the task at hand, but the real money will be made by the onlookers who wager wisely.<br/><br/>Cowboys who enter the hexagonal rodeo arena will be randomly assigned one of 6 events: Bull-Riding, Bronc-Riding, Barrel-Racing, Calf-Roping, Team-Roping or Steer-Wrestling. These typically are resolved by rolling a die and moving along a predetermined track until the active player completes the task, fails by landing on the wrong space in the races, or can't land on the required spot(s) before the cattle escapes out of the arena in the roping events.<br/> The overall winner of the game will be the one with the most money at the end of it. Exactly when that is has to be decided by the players themselves, as events can be repeated as long as players are willing to enter them, and bet on them.<br/><br/>Since all the tasks get resolved by die rolling alone, winning cowboys will have been riding little more than their luck, making the Rodeo setting nothing more than a novel theme for a dice betting game, rather than simulating the adrenaline-rush of a genuine wild west gathering,  where skillful cowboys strut their stuff.<br/><br/>On the upside, with detailed playing pieces and 6 different (and all short) events, your average dice betting game suddenly has become very atmospheric, reasonably varied, and does move on at a brisk pace. And even better, as players can keep betting during the races as long as they can find another player who takes them up on the counter-bet, bet money can move even faster than the bulls, triggering personal rivalry around the table that will make even the wildest rodeo-ride look tame in comparison.<br/><br/>This light-hearted simulation is aimed less at gamers and more at the family market, and the detail and simplicity of the rules will mean that it is probably most enjoyed by those with younger children to entertain. The suggested lowest age is 6, which might be a bit young to fully understand the complexities of even simple betting odds. There is no real upper limit to the amount of players that can join in, and the more the merrier the betting. But if all cowboys want their own piece, then 6 is the maximum number of entrants.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Animal Tracks, Make Tracks to Collect the Animals&quot;<br/><br/>A 4x4 grid is surrounded on all sides by 16 tiles with animals on them. Each tile shows a picture with a type of animal, either pigs, hens, sheep, or cows. Players get 2 track tiles each, which are placed (one each turn) on the grid to create connections (roads) between the animals. When a player places a track tile so that it connects 2 animal tiles of the same type, then those animal tiles are removed from the board and placed on that player's scoring stack. Empty spaces are filled with animal tiles from the draw stack, each player also draws a new track tile at the end of the turn and play continues until all animal tiles are collected or all track tiles are played. Track tiles may be placed on top of each other, and matching sets of animals may only be collected if the connection is made by establishing a new(!) route between them.<br/><br/>Each animal tile has one to three animals on it, and each player's end score is equivalent to the total amount of animals on the gained tiles. The one who collected most animals is the winner.<br/><br/>What appears to be a very simple tile-laying games with an appealing farmyard animal theme is quietly hiding a rather clever maze game that challenges children on multiple fronts. There are only four different track tiles in the game, yet there are so many ways to place these that a bewildering amount of new routes have to be considered. Visualizing the one that would connect two identical animal types, let alone spotting the most profitable one can be a challenge even for adults.<br/><br/>But kids love tiles, and kids love puzzles, and the rules are so intuitive that they easily get engrossed in an entertaining game. The best children games do far more than simple entertaining, and by having to match identical animals, create new routes between them, and consider the relative value of two matched tiles (2 hens and 3 hens is better than 1 sheep and 2 sheep) half an hour of fun is well spent indeed. There are 68 animals on offer, so even determining the final scores can be a quick math lesson.<br/><br/>The suggested age range is from 7 upwards, but it is such a good bridging game that it would suit even slightly younger children. For kids at the younger end of the spectrum, it might be simpler to settle for &quot;whoever has the highest animal stack wins&quot;, but even then there is enough left to make this a game worth considering.<br/><br/>Also known as &quot;Dierensporen&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Pistes d'Animaux&quot; in French.<br/><br/>",

The duck having been pushed onto the small nest will then loose an egg (it will fall into the nest). The winner is the duck ending up with most eggs when getting to the large nest in the middle of the pond. It is possible to have more than one winner in this game.<br/><br/>",

Players spin the spinner and move ahead the indicated number of spaces, whereupon they must read the word printed on the space and then say another word that uses the same blend.  For example, a player landing on 'grapes' would read the word and then come up with another word starting with 'gr', such as group or grade.  If they fail to come up with a new word then they are forced to move back one space.<br/><br/>There are also special Astronaut spaces that require the drawing of an Astronaut card.  Cards direct a player to move either forward or backward a few spaces.<br/><br/>Winner is the first player to the end of the track.<br/><br/>Although no year is listed anywhere on the game, it appears to be from the 1960's.<br/><br/>",

The islanders have machine parts from an earlier shipwreck.<br/><br/>In the first game one player represents the engineer and the others the islanders.  The engineer wants to buy machine parts (collect complete sets), but the cost of buying parts goes up the more he buys in one go from any one islander.  The islanders want to get as much of his money as they can, and one of them can win by 'breaking' the engineers bank by holding more notes than he can cover with his supply of gold.<br/><br/>In the second game the islanders are purchasing goods produced by the engineer by bidding. In this game the engineer does not score, but merely acts as banker.  The winner is the islander who has managed to accumulate the most merchandise<br/><br/>The third game represents an experiment by our one-time shipwrecked engineer, now financier.  He has a contract with the islanders by which he pays &pound;200.00 for a complete eneterprise (set of machine cards). To ensure that they can find and supply the complete enterprises to him he lends them money which they can use to bargain with amongst themselves.<br/>This game is meant to illustrate the mutual indebtedness which is the characteristic of banking, and involves considerable amounts of maths.<br/><br/>The Money Game was first published in 1928 but Angell included a 1912 copyright in the game on the grounds that he had first conceived it before the war. The game was presented as a book with the the cards and money in boxed compartments at the back of the book. It included many quotes from people recommending it. Though Angell worked on the game subsequently he never published a subsequent version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This two player abstract strategy game is played on a standard eight by eight Chess board, though the board is oriented diagonally.  Each player is given an equal force of pieces in a different color -- five tall hexagonal Wall pieces, ten numbered Zin pieces (four 2's plus one of each of the other numbers between 1 and 7), and an unnumbered Rogue Zin piece.  All of the Zin pieces are portrayed as stacks of four hexagons of decreasing size.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture the opponent's 1-Zin piece.<br/><br/>The board is set up with the player's numbered Zin pieces behind a row of five Walls, with the Rogue Zin to the player's left near the center of the board.  Players take turns moving one piece per turn, starting with the Black player.  All pieces move in a straight line through unoccupied spaces, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  Zin pieces may end their turn on top of Wall pieces.  The numbers on standard Zin pieces determine the maximum number of spaces that they may move.  Rogue Zins can move up to three spaces and have some special powers which make them more flexible than standard Zins.  Walls move only one space per turn, and only if they are unoccupied.<br/><br/>Pieces are captured by being landed on by an opponent's piece.  Regular Zins may only capture opponents on the same or a lower plane (i.e. they can't capture an opponent on a wall if they are on the surface of the board).  Walls may be either captured or landed upon at the player's discretion.  They may also be promoted to other types of pieces of they reach the opponent's side of the board.  In capturing, as in movement, Rogue Zins have some special rules which make them more powerful than their standard counterparts.<br/><br/>As a special gimmick, the game includes a special extra 1-Zin piece called a zinK featuring a serial number sticker on the bottom.  Players are encouraged to play special games where the winner keeps the opponent's zinK, with the ultimate goal to collect a zinK with as low a serial number as possible.<br/><br/>",

The player then opens his eyes and tries to remember which card is turned over. If the player remembers correctly, he may take one card from his hand and add it to the cards in the center. If the player guesses wrong, a card is added to the center from the draw pile. Either way, more cards are added to the center each turn, making it more difficult for players to remember them all.

The faster you can get round the board - within the speed limits - the more money you can earn.<br/><br/>There are two types of goods, general goods (all one color) and dangerous goods (white with a colored cap).  A player can only collect one item of goods per port visit and vehicles have capacity limits.  Both types of goods cannot be carried at the same time.  Dangerous goods also require a dangerous goods license.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the wealthiest player is determined by adding each player's total assets, including goods (at market value), vans and lorries (at value less finance costs), licenses, passes and contracts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board is one of the most simple: 4 squares in a square. The further material: 13 Dice with different letters on each side. The game is always played in two rounds. In the first one, player A is the &quot;builder&quot;, player B the &quot;killjoy&quot;, in the second round they change roles.<br/>The &quot;builder&quot; begins drawing one die at random and throwing it. His task is it now, to stack the dice on the four squares, building towers as high as possible. There is only one rule for building: the letters of the next die on the stack must be further in the alphabet. The killjoy at his turn draws another die at random and throws it, but is trying to keep the towers low. It is free to both, on which of the four fields they put the die.<br/>If it is impossible to put a die, the player can take the upper die of one tower away and lay it beside, so he can put the drawn one on the top. Therefore he should remember the letter on the die under the topmost.<br/><br/>The game ends after thirteen draws and the towers are counted: each tower counts the square of the number of dice it consists of: 25 for a tower 5 dice high, 16 for 4 ...<br/>After two rounds the player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>The Name &quot;Jenaer Turm&quot; is derived from a real tower in Jena, Germany, which is 26 stories high. The game was part of an edition of small games for the exhibition &quot;Gott w&uuml;rfelt nicht&quot; in G&ouml;ttingen 2005.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An abstract game for 2 or 4 players, played on a 7x7 grid, where players try to move their own playing pieces onto the start positions of the opposing player. First player to do so wins. A game can end prematurely when a player manages to capture all stones from the other player(s), or when all other players had to resign from the game because there was no legal move available in their turn.<br/><br/>There are 16 stones in play. Each player owns 4 stones, and the remainder are neutral. In a 4 player game there is an added twist as each player shares 2 of the 4 stones with other players. One with the player on the left, the other with the one on the right.<br/><br/>In the starting positions, all stones are isolated. Each turn a player can move a friendly or neutral stone the same way as the knight jumps in chess (two straight and one sideways in all directions). Initially, for as long as there are isolated pieces on the board, each piece has to jump to a space neighboring at least one other (a diagonal connection doesn't count). This way smaller and bigger groups will form, and this has to continue until all pieces form one single chained group. Once a group has been established, it is not allowed to break it up again, so after each jump there has to be a single chain present. It is also forbidden to move a neutral stone immediately after it has just been moved.<br/><br/>As soon as there are no isolated stones or groups left, &quot;owned&quot; pieces can be captured by landing on them. Neutral pieces can never be taken. A player wins when all his remaining pieces have reached their target, so losing a stone or two might not be a bad tactic.<br/><br/>A clever use of the knight's move, and the ability to capture pieces, coupled with the restriction to maintain a single group makes this far more than yet another Halma-variation.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (1/1986 Feb-Mar) as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. It later showed up again on the 2002 G&ouml;ttingen Spieleautorentreff, where game designers meet to showcase their self-published inventions, in a wooden version with colored film-spool-lids as playing pieces. As far as I can tell S&ouml;ncke's Iuvo has only ever been published in Spielbox magazine and it also remains his only published game to date (2006).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>&quot;An introduction to an ageless game with a 20th century pace. The game of chess is simple. It is difficult only if you make it so. And Crescendo Chess is as simple as regular chess. It is played by the same rules. The chess men move the same. A full set of rules and instructions that completely cover Crescendo Chess are included. After several moves, you then enter into the exciting world of mobility, power, and cunning. Compounding the power and mobility of the chess pieces accelerates the game and sharpens one's perception of the effects of combining different pieces. Thus one gains a broader insight and a better appreciation of this game. Because of this, Crescendo Chess enhances regular chess.<br/><br/>&quot;Crescendo Chess is a new experience for any chess player. By following the rather simple rules, one can soon learn to think in terms of stacking, capturing and position playing. One important feature in Crescendo Chess is that the chess men have a hole on top and one on the bottom that permits pegging one piece atop another. When this is done, it is called &quot;stacking.&quot; A stack of chess men can then move across the board together. One soon learns not to exhaust the stack ineffectively. Experience teaches how to take advantage of the best stacking arrangements for certain types of attack and defense.&quot;<br/><br/>In one turn the stack moves first as the bottom piece normally would move as in regular chess, then continues as the next piece up would move, etc. It costs one turn to place a piece on a stack. On the next turn, the stack can make its move (see rule8). To give an example, a Knight can be placed atop a Bishop in one turn. Then, on a later turn, the two together would move the permissible diagonal move of the Bishop and the two together could continue, one - one, two, as the Knight would move.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is important that in stacking, the pieces are moved into the stack using their regular move, - that is, a Bishop diagonally, a Rook forward or sideways, etc. Each piece must be free to make its move as in regular chess rules.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Crescendo Chess is so called because it starts as regular chess and then increases in intensity. As stated, the first two moves by each player are made on a regular basis. After that, the next four moves by each player may be made where one piece is stacked on top of another to a two level height.Max. (L2). NOTE: See Glossary &amp; Game Notations at end of rules. It is not necessary to stack the pieces if the player does not wish to do so.<br/><br/>Upon completion of a total of six moves by each player, the pieces may be stacked to a three level height. Max. (L3). This is the stacking limit for the rest of the game. The three can move first as the bottom piece, which then remains, then as the other two would move as a two piece stack.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Critter-Tek is a tongue-in-cheek stuffed animal parody of Battletech that was fully approved and licensed by FASA.  Instead of gigantic high tech robot mechs players construct mechanical TEKs that are powered by animals on treadmills with hamster powered gyros and paper mache armor.  Weapons include spit-wad blowguns, slingshots and left over fireworks.  In fact Critter-Tek uses all the standard Battletech rules and merely renames all the terminology to a furrier anthropomorphic animal genre.<br/><br/>This game includes the RPG TEK-Warrior.<br/><br/>USER NOTE:New elements, not include in standard Battlemech, such as subterranean movement for burrowing animals adds an new and interesting twist to a classic game.  This Beer &amp; Pretzel approach to Battletech was a great way to introduce game mechanics to fairly young gamers.  My sons played allot of Critter-Tek while in grade school.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An early and original abstract game for 2 to 4 players, heavily influenced by &quot;Halma / Chinese Checkers&quot; and &quot;Draughts&quot; and meant to fill the challenge-gap between &quot;Draughts&quot; and &quot;Chess&quot;.<br/><br/>The board depicts three pyramids of 23 fields each (the 3- and 5-layer appear twice). These pyramids touch each other at the tips in the very center of the board, and are angled in such a way that a hexagonal playing area is created. One player occupies the top 6 fields of each pyramid at the center of the board with 18 black pawns. The remaining pawns are placed on the two base-rows of each pyramid, 10 pawns in 3 colors, one color for each pyramid.<br/><br/>One player plays the beleaguered black pawns and tries to eliminate all other pieces. The remaining player(s) try to occupy one of the 3 center fields with a pawn in their color. The 3-player game is a bit contrived as one player will play 2 outer colors.<br/><br/>Pieces move like draught-pieces: they either move one space or capture a piece by hopping over it to a free field behind it. Pawns from the outer colors can only move or capture sideways or towards the board center (sideways to a neighboring pyramid is also possible). Outer pieces can capture only the black pawns with the same direction restrictions. The black pawns can capture any of the other colors in all directions. A player isn't obliged to capture.<br/><br/>In the opening move the outer colors start, opening with two different pawns per color, then the inner player moves one pawn from each pyramid. From then on, outer colors play one of their pawns in sequence, then the black player can play as many different black pawns as there are outer colors left in play, and these do no longer have to belong to different pyramids. If a player cannot move the turn moves on to the next player in line. Play continues until a victory condition is met.<br/><br/>Publication history: the game originally appeared in 1897 as Ravensburger Spiel Nr. 63 and made a bit of gaming history when it was released. Up until that point Otto Maier had been publishing only classic and widely known games as &quot;Chess&quot;, &quot;Halma&quot; and &quot;Reversi&quot;. This was the first time he published an original abstract boardgame through his now famous games imprint.<br/><br/>He quickly discovered all the obstacles to success that are still in force today: it is hard to market a game with rules that aren't commonly known, that has no promotional campaign to attract a critical mass of new players, and that has to be sold by salesmen who are unfamiliar with the game. Overall it became a learning experience, one that made him reflect a few years later when the game was withdrawn from sale after a single print-run: &quot;abstract boardgames are harder to market than those who are underpinned by fitting themes and illustrations&quot;. This realization might have been the beginning of the paste-on theme solution of which the German (and Euro) games are so often &quot;accused&quot;, but which does appear to have a function that is easily overlooked by the &quot;accusers&quot;. Themes draw buyers in, and rules are easier to explain when there is a story to tell, especially to younger players.<br/><br/>The original edition was issued in a remarkably lavish production (for that time in the German market) with great attention to detail. Even the board and box were covered with quality imitation-leather. It then disappeared until 1983, when it was reprinted by Spielbox magazine (1983/1, jan-mar) as the sixth game in their emerging &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen / Game to Remove&quot; series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alternative names for this gambling game are Belankas or Belankai, though I more often hear it described as the latter. Belankas is the Malay name for the King Crab, one of the pictures featured in the game.<br/><br/>The game consists of a four-sided tee-totum. Modern Belankai spinners are made from a thin wooden dowel that runs through a cuboid piece of plastic with the pictures engraved on four sides. The pictures are a king crab, a flower/star/coin (hard to tell - the pictures are all stylized), a fish and a prawn (c.f. Hoo Hey How).<br/><br/>A staking board is drawn on any large piece of paper (or the ground) showing the four symbols. Players stake on the pictures and the banker (who will claim the stakes or pay winnings) spins the tee-totum in wide dish and covers it with a bowl. When the tee-totum comes to rest, it is revealed and players are payed according to whichever picture has come to rest on top.<br/><br/>Dobree describes that a plate of rice is often to be found where this game is played - it is used to hold the dish where the tee-totum is spun and serves to steady the dish and deaden  the sound of the top when it is spinning.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The name of the game is &quot;wargame&quot; translated in English. This game was published in the Netherlands somewhere between 1880 and 1900 (judging by the material used, the publisher and the uniforms in the picture). It was published by a cookie factory for marketing purposes.<br/><br/>The background of the board is an illustration of Dutch troops attacking a revolting native town in the Dutch East Indies colony (probably in Atjeh). There are 90 numbered dots (white and red) on the board, the rules are printed in the lower left and lower right corners.<br/><br/>The game is is played like Game of Goose, with 2 dice and pawns. Each player rolls two dice to decide who goes first(highest roll starts). The rest of the players take their turn clockwise. Each turn a player rolls two dice and moves his pawn according to his roll.<br/><br/>At the start of the game every player pays ten chips to the bank. Whenever a player ends his move on a white dot nothing happens and the next player gets to roll the dice. The red dots are 'special event' dots. These events may be positive or negative for the player. For instance: roll again, get wounded (and move backwards to the hospital) or get killed (and have to start all over again). In most of these cases the player also pays chips to or receives chips from the bank.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to reach nr. 90; the dot at the heart of the native town. This player is honored with the Ridder Kruis (Knight's Cross) and receives all chips in the bank.<br/><br/>",

It has some unique die mechanics that speed things along, and there's little to write down, so a large battle can be played out in a few hours.<br/><br/>The rules come with six different races, each with four main-line ships and one special ship that can bend the rules in some way.

Who knows what you might need on vacation! The gameboard set-up is simple: place the twenty-four colored counters in a circle and arrange the thirty printed tiles face down within the circle. Players choose their playing piece and a suitcase. On his or her turn, a player rolls the die and moves to color counter shown. If the counter has a picture of an open suitcase on it, the player must turn over two tiles. If the color printed on the tiles match, the player keeps the tiles and places them in the suitcase-a slight twist on the classic memory game. If not, the tiles are placed face down in their original positions. Players must remember where the tiles are. The player who collects the most matches wins - and packs the suitcase for a visit to Grandma's.<br/><br/>Contents: 24 counters, 32 game chips, 4 bamboo figures, 4 bamboo suitcases and 1 colored dice.<br/><br/>Age group: 4 to 8 years<br/><br/>Awards: Parents' Choice Foundation Approved Award 2005<br/><br/>",

It simulates all the major aspects of the Falklands War: air, naval, and ground combat.<br/><br/>Game scale:  Each turn represents two hours.  Each hex represents five nautical miles.  Each ship counter represents a single ship.  Each aircraft counter, from one to five aircraft.  A ground unit counter can be anything from a platoon to a battalion.<br/><br/>Turn sequence:  &quot;Each player moves his units and executes attacks on enemy units in turn during each of the air, sea, and land phases [...]  Units expend movement points to move from one hexagon to another.  All air and sea combat is resolved during the movement portions of the turn while land combat is resolved at the end of the movement phase.  To simulate the randomness of combat results, a die roll is used to resolve attacks [...]  As turns are completed, aircraft will cycle through various stages of readiness, ships will run low on fuel and ammunition, and the weather will play havoc with commanders' plans.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Units tend do get into disarray through combat and movement, no big blocks of troops that stay in good order till they run away. Formations are not mandatory but they prove to be useful. You will see WHY they are a good idea, instead of being forced to use them.<br/>And to top it off, the rules are shareware.

Each person rolls his dice in pairs, one of each color, and after rolling all 5 pairs he determines which set of 5 dice of the same color makes a better poker hand.<br/><br/>Most of the standard rules of draw poker apply, including betting.  The key here is that each pair of dice is always rolled together.<br/><br/>For example, if you have 3 of a Kind with your blue dice, and a Pair with your red dice, you might choose to roll two sets of dice (i.e., a blue die and a red one, twice, but ALWAYS rolling the same two dice of each set together throughout the game), hoping for a 4 or 5 of a Kind.  Continuing the example, you might not add to your 3 of a Kind with the blue dice, but maybe you'll pick up a Full House with the red.  No problem -- now you're betting on a Full House.  You can switch back and forth on the hand you're rolling on (blue dice or red), but you must always keep the individual pairs of dice together.<br/><br/>",

Extremely bright &amp; colorful with amusing cartoon art.<br/><br/>The playing board is dominated by a large circle divided into seven sectors (each of which represents a game character) with a centrally located plastic spinner.  There are 28 cards, four each of the seven zany characters that feature in the game.<br/><br/>The cards are dealt evenly among the players.  A turn consists of spinning the spinner and noting which of the seven characters it is pointing to.  The player must place between 1-4 cards in that character's section of the board.  Opponents then have the option of 'accepting' that the player has placed the correct cards or 'challenging' the active player, starting with the player to the left.<br/><br/>If all opponents accept, the player's turn ends and the cards are left on the board.

As a board game, it's at about the level of &quot;The Game of Life.&quot;<br/><br/>Players take on the role of newspaper publishers with the object to be the first publisher to get the paper out without going broke. Players start with $3360, roll the dice, and move their rocket-shaped pawns from the start toward the finish. Along the way, spaces instruct the players to either move ahead a number of spaces, move backward, or collect or pay money.<br/><br/>The instructions on spaces are laced with humor. Some examples: &quot;Your favorite typeface is Helvetica. Back 1 space.&quot; &quot;Your intern just cut off a finger with an X-acto knife.

The Firefight website describes the battle: &quot;The Germans sent in their most powerful armor and even to their own surprise, broke through the first defensive line by 0930. The surrounded Russian regiment fought well and bled for it. The Tigers, Elephants and Brummbars became the King of the battlefield until met by the Russian Beast-eaters. Once the Germans had encircled the Russians in the first defensive line, there was a slight problem: their supporting infantry lagged far to the rear and what infantry had arrived was far too few to destroy the pocket. Immediately ahead was the 2nd Russian defensive line, manned by a Guards infantry division with armor. The first defensive line had crumbled under the classic German pincer movement, but German reserves were not ready to be committed. Nevertheless, piercing the 2nd Defensive belt and reaching the critical hills further south was not the same animal. It was nothing less than a head-on, in your face, battle. After regrouping, the German animals gathered in a armor wedge and began their breakthrough to the other side.&quot;<br/>You must mount and cut out the counters and provide your own d6 and d10 to play this game.<br/><br/>",

An Austrian victory, it prevented Italian seizure of the strategic island of Lissa.<br/><br/>Hearts of Iron is loosely based on the Great War at Sea series of games.  The operational part of the game is very similar; there is an operational map of the Adriatic and central Mediterranean, on which fleets move and attempt to make contact.  The tactical part of the game is more detailed, with armor (or lack of it), rifled and smooth-bore ordinance, ship maneuvering and leadership playing much more prominent roles.<br/><br/>In addition to the Austrian and Italian fleets, there is the American Mediterranean Squadron that the Austrians believed would fight alongside the Italians, and the Turkish European Fleet that entered the Adriatic to support Austria. Plus the British Mediterranean Fleet and a large French contingent, along with the Greeks, Egyptians and several other smaller navies.  There are a wide variety of both operational and battle scenarios, based on extensive archival research into the original reports and dispatches of the Austro-Italian conflict along with many hypothetical engagements.<br/><br/>",

A foam spider is situated menacingly next to the web in its allocated position over a small hole, which contains a small mechanical lever-type apparatus inside.<br/><br/>Each turn, players attempt to remove a critter from the web with a pronged device that is connected to the board with a wire.  If the surface of the web is touched with this, the circuit is completed, the mechanism in the hole beneath the spider is activated and the spider is launched.  Any player disturbing the spider must replace the critter they were trying to get.<br/><br/>The player collecting the most critters from the web without disturbing the spider (touching the web with the pronged device) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Periodically the outcome will be &quot;xx tape  xx&quot; which means to activate the audio cassette tape included and listen to the &quot;play by play action&quot;.  The announcer will then tell you the outcome of the play.<br/><br/>Then the football pawn is moved down the board accordingly.  There are markers for keeping track of what down it is and the score.<br/><br/>Dice are used to determine the success of Field Goal and Punt attempts.<br/><br/>The rules suggest not rewinding the cassette tape until reaching the end of the tape,  thus keeping some level of randomness.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Audio cassette with over 200 highlight plays.<br/>20 Offensive formations and plays.<br/>12 Defensive plays.<br/>Game board<br/>6 sided die<br/>Offensive play holder (also marks scrimage line)<br/>Football pawn <br/>5 colored rings used for scoring<br/><br/>",

Each stand is a battalion, the ground scale is 3&quot; = 1 mile, and turns are 90-180 minutes.  The rules are designed from the ground up to play multi-day campaigns with multiple divisions per side.<br/><br/>Like Bruce's &quot;Great Battles of World War II&quot; rules, one of the primary concepts is that of troops &quot;going to ground&quot;.  Troops start the day fresh and can make dramatic breakthroughs.  But, as damage occurs, troops are less willing to push forward, they will seek out defensive positions and wait for a new day.  Green troops, in particular, will tend to go to ground very quickly, while more elite troops can continue moving forward.  At this level, combat is abstracted, but operational aspects such as air support and corps and army artillery support are key parts of the system.<br/><br/>A number of scenario books are available for the system, including France 1940, Eastern Front, Normandy, North Africa, and the Pacific.<br/><br/>",

Each token is identified by a number, a color and a category. There are 4 colors and 4 categories.<br/>    2 tokens representing a thief.<br/><br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Shuffle all tokens. Each player draws 3 tokens from the pile with all tokens shuffled and keeps them in his hand.

The players use one of their tokens for bidding for the showroom tokens: the one with the highest number chooses first which piece of the &quot;showroom&quot; he gets. The tokens used for betting are discarded. At this moment each player can add one of the tokens in his hand to his own collection &quot;shelf&quot;.

Much like LIFE or MONOPOLY, you use Mighty Max character figures to move around the board while trying to land on certain squares.  Instead of money or real estate, you're trying to gather &quot;tokens&quot; that grant various abilities.  The first one to make it to Skull Mountain, grab the Crystal Of Souls, and make it back to school (where Mighty Max needs to get back to) wins.  Throughout the board there are &quot;Battle Arenas&quot; where you must use your ability tokens to defeat the villain associated with each arena.<br/><br/>",

Rather than two tiles being matched to each other, this game has players matching tiles to the symbol resulting from a spinner<br/>2. Instead of ending when all tiles are matched, the game ends when the fourth stop tile is drawn.<br/><br/>Twenty-nine tiles are laid face-down on the play surface.  These tiles interlock like puzzle pieces, making a chain of tiles when credited to a player.  The game includes a spinner with, six spaces.  Three of the spinner spaces show one shape (triangle, circle, or square), while the other three spaces have two shapes.  Players take turns using the spinner, and then selecting one tile.<br/><br/>If the tile says &quot;free spin&quot;, then the tile is added to that player's chain, and the player immediately takes an additional turn.<br/><br/>If the tile matches the shape(s) on the spinner, then the tile is added to the player's chain of tiles, and that player's turn ends.<br/><br/>If the tile does not match the shape on the spinner, the tile is shown to the other players, and then returned face-down to the available tiles.<br/><br/>If the tile says &quot;stop&quot;, then it is attached to the top of the spinner.  When the fourth &quot;stop&quot; tile is drawn, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

A few of them are fixed amounts, which must be paid when a player reaches a certain step on the way up, some must be paid, when a player misses a chance to buy or purchase goods and therefore has to draw 1 of 80 event cards.<br/><br/>There are six different goods available. A player can purchase 1-3 goods of a chosen type depending on a dice throw. Red goods can only be purchased by throwing a 6, green goods need at least a 5, yellow ones a 4 and so on.<br/>All goods cost 10.000 per piece, but the selling price is higher for the harder goods, from 16.000 - 32.000.<br/><br/>Before selling, another dice throw is required, which needs matching  the throws while purchasing the goods.<br/> Last but not least, the purchase and sale of goods can be challenged by other players, if their  bid  was either lower or higher than the agreed on transaction.<br/><br/>",

A game conducive to language development and communication and also good for shape comprehension and for training fine motor skills.&quot;<br/><br/>Essentially a two-player game, this can be played with more players by forming two-teams.<br/><br/>The two players (or teams) sit opposite each other and each player is given an identical kit with 26 wooden elements (cubes, prisms, bridges, etc).  The lid of the game box is setup as a vertical screen between the two players so that their wooden pieces and building projects in front of them is not visible to the other.<br/><br/>One player is chosen to be the master builder and the other is the apprentice. The master builder begins building a structure with his/her pieces (not visible to the other because of the screen) and verbally describes it as precisely as possible, as the building progresses. The 'apprentice' tries to follow the description givenby the master builder and attempts to build a replica of the structure with the pieces on his/her side of the screen.<br/><br/>Its exciting to compare the buildings when the screen is finally removed.<br/><br/>A further version (for players with practice) is &quot;sign language&quot;, whereby the players may only use their hands to communicate.<br/><br/>",

The hotels are all of the Hilton line (Hilton and British Airways have a shared advertisement on the reverse side of the board.)<br/><br/>The players 'fly' around the world on their personal jets, paying rents on the properties they land upon and purchasing Options to purchase the property on future turns. The game employs a Roll and Move mechanism upon a five-sided board. Players use acquired cards to short cut the process by arriving at properties of the player's choosing. Auctions are held when a player can not meet their financial obligations.<br/><br/>",

Play the course and avoid the hazards. 18 holes of exciting golf - whatever the weather.<br/><br/>HAZARD can be played by any number of players in pairs, foursomes, or alone against the course. Players draw five cards representing a 'wood', 'long iron', 'mid iron', 'short iron' and 'pitch, chip or putt'. Each card has a different stroke indicator informing you of distance, hook or slice, and by using the card in any one of four directions allows you unlimited combinations of shots.<br/><br/>As in real golf, mistakes occur. So when the ball strays from the fairway or into a bunker, 'rough' or 'bunker' cards are drawn to continue play.<br/><br/>Each hole ends when the player lands in a hole or on the green which indicates the number of putts to finish.<br/><br/>Hazard can be played against the course par of 72, or 'hole for hole' as in matchplay.

The board shows 4 administration offices, about 100 houses of 4 different categories and clearly marked streets and places.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a headquarter, where his actions begin. He will hire some tokens, send them out to claim a street, a place or occupy a house. Houses are the only possibility to earn money, but money is much needed, because every location must be defended (with money) against hostile take-overs.<br/><br/>Hiring new tokens is always possible, but the more money you collect, the more they cost.  Streets and places are needed to accelerate the movement of the tokens and can only be used by their owners.<br/><br/>Winner of the game is the player who occupies 3 administration offices first &ndash; or 4, if a longer game is desired.<br/><br/>",

The first player reaching this, is the winner.<br/><br/>Movement is done by throwing 2 dice, one normal die and one colour die. The normal die determines the number of spaces a playing piece can move, the color die enables the use of shortcuts of the appropriate color, though throwing black lets the piece move backwards.<br/><br/>Jumping over pieces is not allowed and landing on an occupied space lets the piece go back to the start.<br/><br/>",

He has 4 animal friends, Pump, Flap, Pingi and Patsch - all are seen here.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 9x8 board. 20 tiles show 4 x Jacob and his 4 friends. The tiles are randomly placed on the board face down. Each player puts the playing piece of his neighbor on an empty space of the board and the game can begin.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to collect 4 tiles with each friend of Jacob. The player who achieves this first, is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Movements of the playing pieces are handled in a very unusual way: each row of the board shows a number, which indicates the distance that a pieces must move (in any direction). If a piece lands on a tile, the player looks at it secretly and keeps it, if he does not have it already. If he finds a piece already in his collection, he puts it back on a empty space of his choice. This can not only confuse the player's memory, it can also be made in a more strategical way, because the movements of the playing pieces are defined by the already mentioned number of the rows.<br/><br/>",

According to the description, the original title of this game from Derek Carver was &quot;Loot&quot;.<br/><br/>6 or 8 (!) players start with 2 treasure hunters and 1 guard in the middle the board to search for 16 treasures of different value. The board has 8 rings with an increasing number of spaces on them; the 16 treasures are placed at some of the 28 outer spaces of the board.<br/><br/>The tokens can have 4 different colors and 4 different shapes in a 8-player's game (3 and 3 in a 6-player's game), but each player has 3 equal tokens. That means, one player may have 3 blue round tokens, another 3 red square tokens, a next 3 yellow hex tokens, and so on - each color and shape on a total of 6 tokens.<br/><br/>Unique is the idea, that treasures can only be dug out by more than 1 player! How many and what kind of tokens are needed, is marked on each treasure chest, which covers the treasure (e.g. 3 tokens of different shape, or 4 tokens of 4 different colors).<br/><br/>Once, a treasure is dug out, it belongs to the whole group of tokens, but it must be transported back to the middle of the game board, where only 1 player can claim it. Needless to say, that several alliances, (broken) promises and other bluffs are usual, especially since the guard pieces can attack the hunters to steal the treasures from them.<br/><br/>The game ends, when all treasures are dug out, or when one player has claimed a certain amount of treasures - or when a certain time limit is reached.<br/><br/>",

You also get 4 leaf themed catapults to launch your insects. The board is held together with 1 large elastic band and the jaws of the Flytraps also snap closed thanks to elastic bands too.<br/><br/>The nice thing is that each bug is different instead of 4 identical ones and that the game looks great when assembled.<br/><br/>",

Depending on the type of city a player&rsquo;s pawn lands a player may raise funds, spend funds to get vote chips, declare vote chips for a state in the hopes of getting a plurality to earn that state&rsquo;s electoral votes or go head-to-head with another opponent in a debate. Lines connect the cities to regulate the movement of the players&rsquo; pawns.<br/><br/>The players divide $72 million dollars and each chooses a different city to start the game. To move, a player rolls the die and advances that many cities unless the roll in a one and that allows a free move to anywhere on the gameboard. The city landed upon regulates what a player&rsquo;s actions are on that turn. After taking one&rsquo;s turn the player advances the calendar pawn one day. The game is over after seventy-two days. The players add up their votes and each state&rsquo;s electoral votes are awarded to the player who has the most votes. Ties go to whomever rolls the higher number. States where no one has any votes goes to the player who has declared the most popular votes in that region. The player who has the most electoral votes is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "East-German cycling game. Each player controls a team of 4 cyclists. The game is not dice controlled and not with cards either. In fact it has quite a tactical system, the rules are quite simple but don't depend on luck. Per turn each cyclist can use either 3,4,5 or 6 action points to move the same number of squares (each number can be used only once). There can't be more than one rider on a square (except the blue ones), so riders can eventually be blocked. The red marks are intermediate sprints, where 4 points are awarded to the winner. The blue squares are punctures. There are also bonus points for a cyclists who helps another cyclist (for example after a puncture), this bonus is added because of 'comradely behavior' (the communist regime clearly showing here). At the end of the race every cyclist gets points (80 for the winner, 76 for the second,...). Now the players add up the finishing-points and bonus points of their 4 cyclist to determine who wins the game. The board (58*32cms.) looks surprisingly beautiful and well designed for an East-German game, the cyclist are also well produced, in plastic. Nice vintage game for collectors of sports games.<br/><br/>",

Resi and Rudi want to know which of them is faster! Ready, set, go: The race over stick and stone is on. On a player's turn, he rolls the die. The end of the caterpillar is always placed ahead of the head, so long as the color collar is ahead as well. Then, the caterpillar's head is moved to that color. If a player rolls a color that the head is already on, then he may put a barrier up in front of the other caterpillar. That player must now navigate past the barrier. As soon as a caterpillar touches the goal flag, the game is over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Siege of Bodenburg is a set of rules for a miniatures wargame scenario. The setting is a highly fictionalized battle in late medieval or early Renaissance Europe. According to game historian, Jon Peterson, Siege of Bodenburg is noteworthy as an early influence on Gary Gygax in the development of the miniatures game, Chainmail and eventually, Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>In the scenario, Count von Boden is expecting a wagon train of supplies from Wernigerode to arrive but is instead attacked by invading Huns and Turks. The castle needs to hold out until the wagon train and its defending Lansquenets arrive, or until the rest of the Count's knights return from the tournament in Quedlinburg.<br/><br/>The rules are close tactical, with each figure representing a single man. They are designed for 40mm Elastolin figures and accessories, but since they give movement allowances and firing ranges in numbers of sectors (squares) rather than inches, the game could easily be played in other scales or even as a board game. The rules are fairly elaborate, with sections for hidden movement, sallies, scaling ladders, supplies, morale, etc.<br/><br/>Siege of Bodenburg was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics Volume I, Numbers 6-10. It is misspelled &quot;Siege of Bodenberg&quot; on the cover of issue #6 and on the map in that issue. Bodenstedt also printed up copies of the rules which he gave out in his store and at conventions.<br/><br/>",

All too often, science fiction films and games assume that starships will behave in the same way as terrestrial ships or aircraft. The truth is quite different as you will see. Once you have played one or two games, the movement rules will become second nature; they're actually much simpler than those used by most other games.<br/><br/>Rules, counters, map, and ship record cards are freely available in Adobe PDF format.<br/><br/>",

Half of the tokes are gained from reaching one of the buildings on the board, and the other half from answering trivia about &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot;  Most questions are easy enough to answer if you've seen a few of the movies, some are more specific to the book.

Immediately after that all players begin rolling all of their dice as fast as possible.  Any time a player rolls the target number they must place any dice with that number in the center of the board and call out how many dice along they are toward getting all five with the target number.  They then continue to roll the rest of their dice.  When a player gets all five of their dice to match, they ring the bell and win the round moving one space on their track.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first player to collect three items depicted on a secret quest card. The items - tokens with a picture of an item - are randomly distributed on the game board face down. Players take turns by moving their pawns on the board by one step. If the move ends on an unexplored token the player will claim the token unless the token is a monster in which case the monster has to be defeated first by rolling dice. Some items - sweets, to be precise - boost a player's speed or combat ability.<br/><br/>Kalevite Maa is a promotional boardgame. It is published by a sweets producer - &quot;AS KALEV&quot; - and 3/4 of the relatively large boardgame box is actually filled with sweets. Yet, it is an interesting and engaging game with components of outstanding quality.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Second Ediiton Notes<br/><br/>With the end of the 2nd. world war, the world enters a new political configuration headed by two great blocs: the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite the climate of hope in the division of defeated Germany, a series of suspicions begin to emerge among the old allies. The Russians with control of so-called Eastern Europe awoke among Western allies suspected of a possible breakthrough in 1946.<br/><br/>The Americans along with the British began to reposition the bulk of their troops on German frontiers and began a program to ship supplies and ammunition to their units. In 1947 the Russians also began to move in this chess, with the increase of their military personnel in occupied Germany. In 1948 the first course occurs when Stalin&rsquo;s armies block Berlin, barring access to supplies and new troops.<br/><br/>The American response comes in two nuclear attacks, one on Moscow with a new American bomb called BlueToddler and another attack on the Soviet heavy industries in the Urals with 3 small tactical bombs known as Nuke Candy. The Russians advance their conventional forces on the allies and a new conflict begins. The allies are now mortal enemies, on the one hand, the Americans, the English, and the French, and on the other hand the Russians and the Chinese, who proclaim themselves communists in 1947, joining the so-called Soviet Federation.<br/><br/>In 1949 is invented by the Russians the engines of macro combustion enabling the introduction of so-called combat mechs. These armaments recover the ground lost by the Soviets, pushing the allies to the borders of Poland. In 1950 the first Russian nuclear bomb explodes over New York, taking the world war to the American soil! In 1951 the Allies entered with their mechs of combat in Europe, bringing the conflict to unimaginable levels.<br/>In this scenario, a powerful organization arises, formed by old Nazis who dream of having a great Germany again: the Werwolf Korps. Hidden in the Bavarian Alps in deep Nazi fortresses, they emerge as a fighting force with fantastic weapons and black magic. These represent one more weight in the pendulum of history.<br/><br/>Luftwaffe 46 is a jet fighter game set in the world of Hotwar, where the war doesn&rsquo;t end in 1945 but continues as Germany launches its other jet plane projects and fights the allies in dogfights. The rules were made for you to play with miniatures in 1/300 scale, in the absence of them, we supply markers to replace them.<br/><br/>What you will need to play:<br/><br/>1 measuring tape<br/>2 six-sided dice (known as d6)<br/>1 smooth surface (a dining room table for example)<br/>Rulebook (you are reading it now)<br/>Paper and pen<br/>Miniatures for 3D printing (STL FILES) - Available for download, links in the end of the rule book<br/><br/>",

Fire back and see if you can be the first player to sink all of your opponent's ships, and win!<br/><br/>From Erik Arneson's website:<br/>Players first play tokens (numbered 3 to 11) on each of their five ships, making sure to put them in order from lowest to highest -- although duplicate numbers are allowed. To attack, each player rolls three dice and chooses two. They place those two dice next to a token, and if the total equals the value of the token, a hit is scored. Rolls of 2 and 12 are always hits. Unfortunately, this clever Battleship-based dice game is not very easy to find. Your best bet is to look in drug stores and grocery stores.<br/><br/>",

The object of this game is just the same. Players have to collect interest badges by successfully answering questions on the subjects chosen.&quot;<br/><br/>Players try to collect five badges and be the first to collect the trefoil badge. Players roll a dice to move around the board. Upon landing on an interest badge space, they must choose one of the tiles from a face down selection. Most of the tiles represent Brownie badges in several categories, a few are hazardous events, and one shows the trefoil, crucial to winning the game. To collect a badge of the revealed category, the player must answer a trivia question relating to the category. Badges are available in the following categories:<br/><br/>Animal Lover; Artist; Book Lover; Brownie Friendship; Cook; Collector; Conservation; Craft; Discoverer; First Aid; House Orderly; Music Lover; Pony Rider; Rambler; Safety in the Home.<br/><br/>If the question is answered correctly, the badge tile is placed on the player's arm card (representing the badge being sewn onto the player's shirt sleeve). If it is answered incorrectly, the tile is turned face down again. When a player has collected five badges on her arm card, she must try to find the Trefoil badge from the face down selection in order to win the game.<br/><br/>Players can steal badges from Brownies who trespass on another player's campsite. Bonus badges can be won by landing on toadstool spaces and answering a general knowledge question. The game can end prematurely if too many Brown Owl spaces are landed on.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;Venture into America's romantic past. It is time when the young Nation is struggling to survive the tragic Civil War years in which over 620,000 lives were lost; families torn asunder; and the assassination of a President is being secretly planned.  It is also a time when a small group of men rose against all odds amassing great fortunes and political power by laying their steel ribbons across America's vast plains and over her towering and majestic mountains. These were America's RAIL MASTERS....<br/><br/>The year is 1862 and President Lincoln has just signed the Pacific Railroad Act granting you $100,000 and a steam locomotive. Your assignment is to safely travel across the United States and deliver five special spikes to your holding company.  The first Railroad to deliver all five spikes wins.<br/><br/>Who will be the next RAIL MASTER?&quot;<br/><br/>The Rail Masters Trust Company is a Trivial Pursuit inspired train trivia game with added economic and pick up and deliver mechanics. Players take the role of one of six holding companies from 1862 and start with $100,000 granted by the government. Starting from the roundhouse, players roll and move around the board answering train trivia questions to get extra moves. There are six spike squares of five different colors the players are aiming to land on where they can purchase a spike from the government. The train playing pieces have slots to hold two spikes maximum, so spikes must be delivered to the roundhouse before more can be picked up. On Rail Crossing spaces, &quot;community chest&quot; type cards are drawn that decrease or increase a player's money. Players can sell their spikes to any other player at any time for any price.<br/><br/>The trivia questions are all multiple choice or true and false, so you don't need to be a train trivia expert to be competitive. If playing against a REAL train buff, you can always take away the multiple choice from that player and make them answer the questions outright to even the field...<br/><br/>",

It has 8 topics: Leaders &amp; Icons, TV &amp; Film, Modern History, Art &amp; Literature, Sport, Science &amp; Engineering, General Knowledge, Music &amp; Theater. The game combines wit, skill and luck to outplay your opponents by getting three pyramid pieces from one area of the board to three new homes.<br/><br/>Nubian Jak uses multiple-choice questions on cards with the correct answer giving an instruction to move forward or throw again. In most cases the least likely of the 3 options carries a penalty for the wrong answer. There is also a Super Challenge Format, which is played by asking the topic card questions without giving the multiple choice options as clues. The correct answer gives the bonus, while any wrong answer incurs the penalty on the card.<br/><br/>Nubian Jak can either be played in singles involving 2-8 players or in teams of 3 with each Jak represented by a player.<br/><br/>",

The game, by &quot;Jimmy Corrigan: Smartest Kid on Earth&quot; author Chris Ware, is a fairly simple roll-and-move progression where players &quot;drive&quot; the various denizens (Big Bad Wolf, Frog Prince, Grandma) of a blighted, suburban fairy-land in an effort to gather like-colored &quot;story chits&quot;.  The chits are assembled on a separate board for each character, and &quot;will complete a story of amusing and rakish details- particularly if read aloud, and with dramatic relish.&quot;  Certain spaces, when landed on, have special, game altering effects, such as &quot;Heisenberg Attack&quot;, which forces all players to switch characters with the person to their right.<br/><br/>&quot;One person play: All rules are the same, though exchange between other players is, obviously, impossible.  Do not despair; someday you will grow up to be a famous cartoonist and all of the kids who made fun of you will have miserable jobs and be desperately unhappy, but you will get to draw stories for lots of money about how you still hate them all.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game offers players the thrill of the big city within the comforts of the parlor - a perfect armchair traveling experience. -- from the book The Games We Played by Margaret Hofer (2003).<br/><br/>This is a variation on Pachisi, strongly related to Milton Bradley's Parcheesi, but obviously, marketed by a competitor. In his biography of Parker Brothers, The Game Makers, Philip Orbanes describes Broadway as a deliberate attempt to re-theme their popular seller, Pollyanna, for boys. Ultimately, Broadway was dropped after the 1933 catalog, while Pollyanna persisted for most of another four decades.<br/><br/>",

To play the game, each player takes turns by pressing a lever on the front of the house resulting in a puzzle piece popping out.  The puzzle piece is kept if it matches the player's puzzle outline.  If the puzzle piece does not match the player's puzzle outline, it is either passed to the player with the matching puzzle outline (Easy Game) or inserted into a slot in the roof of the house (Advanced Game).  The turn passes to the next player, and the game progresses until a player completes their puzzle.  The Advanced Game contains two Bear/Luna pieces that allow a player who popped it out on their turn to keep it until another player ejects a piece that matches the player's puzzle.<br/>The puzzles are colorful and include Bear's missing friends, Tutter, Treelo, Ojo, Pip, and Pop.  Using the lever to 'pop' out the puzzle pieces adds a fun element for young children.<br/><br/>",

Players set up pieces of hidden value, advance them, and capture opponents pieces by moving into occupied spaces and having the piece of greater rank.<br/><br/>However, there are other differences beyond the multi-player capability. Players do not seek a hidden flag; rather, they strive to reach visible target spaces in their opponents' territories that may only be occupied by a Spy piece. Challenging is optional; i.e., multiple players may have pieces co-exist on the same space as long as a player moving in declines to ask, &quot;Who's there?&quot; Finally, each player has a piece that cannot be captured called the Secret Police, which may only capture an opponent's Spy.<br/><br/>The first player to move his Spy onto an opponent's Palace space or Coat of Arms space is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is basically Risk using the United States, instead of the world, as a map. There are 51 territories (the states and the District of Columbia) in which to place the four colors of plastic chips (each representing &quot;an army of 1,000 soldiers). Set-up, by alternate picking of territories, and die roll combat is identical to Risk. The came contains 153 cards (infantry, cavalry, and &quot;governor&quot; cards for each of the 51 territories), and card play is significantly different from Risk, as a card from a stack of shuffled infantry and cavalry cards is picked every time a territory is conquered. If a player acquires both the infantry and cavalry cards for a state, the player is awarded the governor card for that state and immediately takes that state over. If another player has the other card, there is a one-die showdown to determine control. Play continues until all 102 infantry/cavalry cards are drawn, and the winner is the player with the most territories at that time. The game is well-made, with front &amp; back box printing, a mounted board, plastic insert, 153 cards, 6 dice, 4 sets of 64 plastic chips, and three rules booklets (English, Spanish, French).<br/><br/>",

It took place around the village of Suomussalmi and along the road leading to this village from the hamlet of Raate. The battle was fought between the 163rd and 44th divisions of the Red Army, the latter being a motorized division, against a composite Finnish division which was eventually called the 9th and had only a few artillery units and nothing else in support of its infantry battalions. The battle was fought from early December until early January and resulted in the complete destruction of the Soviet divisions.<br/><br/>The map covers the area around Suomussalmi and Haapavaara. It is divided into hexagons (hexes) each approximately 2.6 km across. <br/>The counters for the two armies are slightly different in the information they contain as well as in the color. Soviet units are red and Finnish units grey. The unit size designations and arm-of-service designations are the standard NATO designations with two possible exceptions. Two lines at the top of the unit marks a battalion and three a regiment.<br/><br/>",

The easy way is in the price of the objects. In each type, there are four prices. Most expensive is to be sold first. The prices are 3500, 2500, 1500 and 1000. Players collect the eight objects in a set, without doubles.<br/><br/>Players try to buy the objects that would complete other players' sets, especially to double the price when selling to the player who needs the object (and reap greater profits).<br/><br/>But, while objects are purchased from most-to-least expensive, they are sold least-to-most expensive.<br/><br/>",

In his hand was a report of goblin raiders attacking farms to the north. On his desk where other requests for aid, complaints about bandits along the high road, undead shambling about a local graveyard and many more calls for aid.<br/><br/>Leaning forward the high magistrate called in his assistant, a small, frail looking man with small eyeglasses perched on his thin nose. &ldquo;Yes milord?&rdquo; the small man asked with a swift bow.<br/><br/>Handing the report on the goblin raiders to the his assistant, the Magistrate told him to give the job to, &ldquo;That dwarf, what was his name? You know, the one that help us out with the troll some weeks back. He and his band of adventurers did a good job on that assignment, let us see how they fair with goblins.&rdquo;<br/><br/>With a bow, the bespectacled man turned and left, calling for a runner to go find the dwarf, who know doubt was drunk in some tavern, rewarding himself with the gold he had earned on his last job for the city&rsquo;s chief trouble shooter.<br/><br/>This is Heroes for Hire, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions. Take the role of a city bureaucrat, as you seek to solve one problem after another. Most of your day-to-day dealing though, has to do with adventurers, their hiring and then sending them off to solve one of the many problems that plagues your city. Can you build up a stable of reliable heroes who will slay the dragon you need dead, or find the grand treasure that you need to offer as a wedding present to the king&rsquo;s third cousin. Seek glory through the blood and sweat of others, and rise to the top position within the realm.<br/><br/>",

It is easy to set up, the rules are easy to follow and the game can be conveniently stored when not in use.<br/><br/>The board is modeled on the America's Cup course, by now familiar to most Australians.  Basically, each yacht progresses around the course according to the number thrown on the dice.  If a yacht sails onto a Red mark a Wind Shift Card must be turned up to see whether wind conditions are favourable or unfavourable.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia and Australia to get points along the way<br/><br/>An exciting tactic game for 2-4 players in from 6 and above.<br/><br/>The game board is a map of the world, devided into 286 squares (13x22). One (1) square is red with a big white S, six (6) of the squares are red with a white number - there is one on each continent. The 24 squares have a white circle with a number on (10, 20, 25, 30 or 50).<br/><br/>Before the game all the &quot;white&quot; spaces gets a blue token on, with the consistent number of the field; this will leave 10 tokens of each 10 points in spare, which is put aside together with the red &quot;proof tokens&quot;.<br/><br/>All players start on &quot;S&quot; which is located on a field which have Iceland to the west, England to the south and Norway to the east.<br/>The players take turns by rollin the die (D6) and move the amount that the die shows. They can move North, South, East or West (not diagonally) and can move in zig-zig (Example on the roll 5: North, West, North, West, South). A player can not move into or pass a square where another player is on.<br/>When a player lands on either a point-field (white circle with red numbers) the player takes the point on the board, if it have not been taken before. If a player lands on one of the red fields on each continent, the player can take the matching number from the pool if (s)he do not have this number yet. The red &quot;proof tokens&quot; are put infront of the player, visible for everone.<br/>Each time you pass Equator you get 10 points from the pool, as long as there are still points left to take.<br/><br/>When you have at least fice (5) of the six (6) &quot;proof tokens&quot;, you can move back to the &quot;S&quot; , and this will give you 100 points.<br/>Second one back to base get's 50, third gets 25 and the last don't get any points for returnin. When everyone is back you add the points (Home-coming, red tokens (75 points each) and blue tokens (10-50 points each). The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The questions are difficult enough so that no one is expected to know the correct answer, but everyone is required to &ldquo;take a wild guess&rdquo;.  The person reading the question competes against the other players, who work together to arrive at a consensus answer. The interaction between the other players generates conversation and laughter and often a reasonably close guess. Points are awarded to those that are closest to the exact answer and to any answer that falls on or within the &ldquo;margin of correctness&rdquo; (50% either side of the exact answer).<br/><br/>There are five categories animals, 19th century America, science, military, and the 21st century.<br/><br/>Sample Question:<br/>During the last Ice Age's coldest stage (approximately 18,000 years ago), the average temperature in what is now Kansas was how may degrees Fahrenheit colder than today?<br/><br/>The correct answer is 18 degrees.<br/><br/>If the reader was closer than the consensus answer of his opponents he receives 1 point for each player. If the consensus answer was closer each player, except the reader, receives 1 point.<br/><br/>Bonus points are awarded if the closest answer falls within the specified margin of correctness. For this question the margin of correctness is 9 degrees to 27 degrees.<br/><br/>",

Pick up a dagger and strike the vampire in his coffin... but tread carefully or he'll awake with a flash and a screech!<br/>A spine chilling game for children over 7 years and adults too!<br/><br/>A game of chance and skill - pit your wits against the Vampire. Get him before he gets you!<br/><br/>Game Summary: Players race to move one of their daggers to the centre of the board and slay the vampire. Each player begins the game with 5 daggers, and places one of them on the starting 'foot-print' at the beginning of the game. Each turn every player gets 6 movement points to share between his daggers (ie move 1 dagger forward 6 footprints, or 2 daggers 3 footprints each, or any combination up to a total of 6). You can 'leapfrog' your own daggers, (but may never have 2 daggers on the same footprint) and at the end of each move the dagger is 'stabbed' into the board. When a dagger is placed in one of the randomly selected footprints the Vampire will let out a bloodcurdling scream causing that dagger to be removed from the game. Players have to remember which footprints will wake the Vampire and avoid them for the rest of the game. The first player to reach the centre of the board and stab his dagger into the heart of the Vampire wins!<br/><br/>",

The remaining cards in the other suits (A to 10 in spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds) make the other four suits.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re starting a hand, you must play one or more cards of only one suit (S, H, C, D, royals). Play passes to your left.<br/><br/>When play passes to you, you may pass or play. If you pass, play passes to your left. If you play, you must play a homogeneous set of cards that beats what was most recently played. The rank of the card you play is irrelevant, but the number of cards you play and their suit is relevant.<br/><br/>Suit Ranking:<br/>Hearts beat spades and clubs. Clubs beat hearts and diamonds. Diamonds beat clubs and royals. Royals beat diamonds and spades. Spades beat royals and hearts.<br/><br/>If the most recent play was one heart, you can play one club, or one spade, or two hearts. You can not play more than what you need to beat what was played; you can&rsquo;t play three or more hearts or two or more clubs or spades.<br/><br/>Short play example:<br/>Alice starts a hand by playing two clubs. Bob plays three clubs. Cathy passes. Dan plays three diamonds. Alice passes. Bob passes. Cathy plays three royals. Dan plays four royals. Alice plays four diamonds. Bob plays four clubs. Cathy plays four hearts. Dan passes. Alice plays five hearts. Bob, Cathy, and Dan all pass and Alice takes the hand.<br/><br/>If play passes back to you and you were the last player to play, you get the ewe totem and all of the cards played go face-down into your Wool Pile. You get a one-point bonus to your score. The hand is over.<br/><br/>If all players have cards left in hand, the player to the left of the player with the ewe starts the next hand. If at least one player is out of cards the round is over. If you have cards in hand at the end of a round, you lose one point for every card in your hand. If you have the ewe at the end of a round, you get a two-point bonus to your score.<br/><br/>If the round is over, count the number of cards in your Wool Pile and have the scorekeeper add that to your score. If one or more players have 100 points or more, the game is over. If the game is not over, collect and shuffle all of the cards.<br/><br/>If you have the ewe at the end of the game, you get a 5-point bonus to your score.<br/><br/>",

Players alternate moving one of their armed forces pieces until the war is over.  These fighting forces move and capture in any direction up to their maximum range.  Strategy and skill are the keys to victory.  Players set hidden defensive traps, carry out hit and run raids and multiple captures, set up formidable geographical barriers, and launch nuclear attacks.  POWARVASION(tm) is easy to learn, fun to play, and a superior war game challenge!&quot;<br/><br/>The board (with a sample setup, less the hidden traps and presumably cities) is shown on the back of the box.  9x9 square grid, Country Capital (white house), ICBM and Bomber (counters?) look like the King &amp; Queen in chess, flanked by two sets of helicopter, artillery and jet pieces in the knight/bishop/rook configs.  3 tanks and 6 infantry round out the pawn row (tanks at ends and center).  From the board, it looks as if the next two rows you can choose where to set your 3 mountains; single river, lake and forest pieces, as well as two minefields and a missile site, along with between 6-9 &quot;hidden&quot; pieces (one side has 6, the other 9).<br/><br/>The side of the box has a picture of Col.

        "description": "From the Website...<br/><br/>&quot;Monster Quest is a fun and exciting game, with nine years of play testing by fantasy gamers. If you like dungeons and a dragon or two than you will love a game of Monster Quest. The game doesn't take days or weeks to prepare it's ready to go in minutes right out of the box. Monster Quest is a mythological board game that leads a player through a magical land of action and adventure. Monster Quest has 226 spaces on the board and 450 cards.  There are Spell cards, Wisdom cards, Map cards, Monster cards, and even Property cards that can be bought during the game.  The cards are one of the ways that a player develops their character.  Also, the cards give the player the ability to move about the land of Monster Quest rather than relying solely on the chance of the dice.<br/><br/>There are 12 different parts to the game-board, a main trail that connects all of the different parts of the game-board together, a Town Adventure, a Dungeon, six Inner trails, and three Outer trails.<br/><br/>Each player has a pegboard to keep track of their Hit Points (HP), Armor Class (AC), Platinum Pieces (PP), Gold Pieces (GP), Silver Pieces (SP), Jewels, and the Experience (Exp.) that a player will gain during the game.<br/><br/>Monster Quest uses two sets of dice, two six-sided and two eight-sided.  The dice are used to Battle Monsters, win treasure, and move about the land of Monster Quest.<br/><br/>A game of Monster Quest can last anywhere from three to five hours depending on the level of difficulty you wish to play.  Monster Quest can be played by two to four players.  There are six jewels in the game protected by monsters; a player must collect all six jewels to win the game.  Monster Quest is a whole world on one board where strategy is key.<br/><br/>Beyond the City Gate treasure awaits in dark Caves, along Wooded Trails through the Emerald Forest on Shipyard Docks across the Black Sea to thirst in the Desert wandering the Foothills to the Mountains of Doom on your way to the King?s Castle to save the Princess.  BEWARE of the Dungeon on your quest young squire and if you have what it takes the jewels can be yours.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It appears to be published/supported by a host of Dutch business, particularly those based in Delft. One of the businesses is Jumbo games. Several forewords from the various companies involved in the game are found in the rules book.<br/><br/>The board is a 12 X 12 square grid superimposed on a map of Delft. The object of the game is to place tiles on the board, with the coordinates determined by rolling two dice (with opportunities for two re-rolls). When a square of four tiles is on the board, it is considered completed and is turned over to show an 'object worth seeing'. Rolling doubles allows one to roll a special die, which could result in an extra turn, being allowed to place two tiles anywhere on the board, or missing the next turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone has completed five objects worth seeing. Scoring points is based on where the tiles in completed objects lie. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Text from the introduction in the rules:<br/>The witches keenly stare at the magic bowl.... in a few seconds the magic symbols will appear. The witches are as quiet as mice and even the cauldron has stopped bubbling. Finally the symbols can be clearly recognized. Immediately the witches yell their magic spells, as only the quickest witch to shout the correct spell will become the new superior witch!<br/><br/>This is one of Haba's Tumble-dice games, characterized by using dice in a domed container, a clever way of ensuring the dice don't get separated and lost.<br/><br/>The contents of the game are:<br/>- A clear-domed tumbler with seven red six-sided dice (each die with 2 cats, 2 bats and 2 brooms) and one die with one, two or three black dots, or one, two or three red dots on its six sides. <br/>- One orange wooden witch meeple<br/>- 30 cards showing either a scene with many witches or a scene with one witch. The backs of the card show the face of one of three different witches. <br/>- The rules.<br/><br/>The tumbler is placed in the centre and seven cards are dealt face up around the tumbler. The witch piece is placed on any card and during the game only moves in a clockwise direction. The player whose turn it is shakes the dice and all players simultaneously try to see what spell is indicated and which they must recite. The spell to recite is determined by where the witch lands. The die with one to three spots in two colours determines where the witch lands. If it is a card with many witches, the players must recite the spell corresponding to the type of animal that appears the most times on the dice. If it is a card with one witch, the players must recite the spell corresponding the type of animal that appears the least number of times on the dice. The first player to recite the correct spell gets to keep the card that the witch was standing on. The witch then moves clockwise the number of steps indicated on the pipped die and a new card is placed in the space vacated by the witch.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to get three of the same witch (on the card backs) or any five witches.<br/> The rules provide for a professional variation, where the colour of the dots, either black or red, on the pipped die makes a difference. The cards have little signposts with a black star or red mushroom. The movement of the witch will then be in the direction of the red star or red mushroom accordingly .<br/><br/>",

The goal is to get cards of the different types (Luck, Inheritance, and Corporate Know-How) for each of the eight phases of Hughes' life (as defined by the game) in turn. The phases are entered via &quot;doors&quot; on the board and the cards are turned in for money, which is tracked on a small board for each player. In true Hughes style, players may purchase injunctions to prevent movement through certain areas of the board. The object is to amass $2.5 billion dollars, the publisher's estimate of Hughes' fortune at the time.<br/><br/>In addition to the rules, the &quot;Study Guide&quot; booklet contains 21 pages of material on the life and investments of Howard Hughes and an extensive bibliography.<br/><br/>Although the name &quot;Urban Systems&quot; does not appear on the game, this is presumably the game in the case Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Urban Systems, Inc. (72 Misc.2d 788, 789-90, 340 N.Y.S.2d 144, 145-46 [Sup.Ct.], modified, 42<br/>App.Div.2d 544, 345 N.Y.S.2d 17 [App.Div.1973]). This case resulted in a judgement for Hughes against the game publisher, requiring them to withdraw the game from sale.<br/><br/>",

First to get their monkeys to the top wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is essentially a 3D 'Snakes and Ladders' with a number of subtle changes; each player has two monkeys, both of which must reach the top of the tree to win, each player's section of the tree has two creepers (which are the 'ladders'), but most importantly the pair of snakes on your section of the tree can be moved! Each player races his own pair of monkeys up the tree whilst attempting to avoid the two patrolling snakes, should a monkey and a snake end up on the same space, the monkey falls and has to start the climb over again. On your turn you can roll the dice and either move one of your own monkeys, or any snake (either to clear a route for your own monkeys or attempt to knock an opponents monkey back to the start).<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game the cards are dealt and the coins distributed evenly. One player takes the first turn at being auctioneer. He takes up the gavel and declares an item for sale from his cards. The trick is the auctioneer can only describe the item by it's number of legs. Many different items have the same number of legs, so players have to bid on the chance that they are getting the item they need, without really knowing it. The purchaser of the card becomes the new auctioneer. As players earn pairs they set them aside and are assigned a value. When all cards are exhausted the winner is the one with the most value in pairs and in coins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Which Way, Please? is a map reference game for children Ages 4 and up. It is designed to teach small children about the concept of grid maps. It consists of six collecting boards divided into nine grid squares, and 54 picture cards that magnify the village images on the collecting squares. The picture cards have grid references on their backs.<br/><br/>There are three games that can be played. The Solo Game asks the child to go through the picture cards one by one and match the grid references to the correct square on the right collecting board. When all cards are placed, the child then turns the cards over to see if the pictures correspond to those on the boards.<br/><br/>The Lotto Game doles out the collecting boards to each child. Each child in turn takes a card and shows it to everyone. If a player recognizes it as one that belongs on their board, that child gets the card. The first one to fill up the board is the winner.<br/><br/>In the Skill Game, the boards are connected to create a large village. The cards are turned up one by one, and the first child to call out the correct grid reference wins the card. The child with the most cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the game, players take the role of bystanders, cops, and killers.  These secret identities are revealed throughout the course of the game.  Cops attempt to make an arrest.  Killers attempt to kill their target.  Bystanders can help influence the outcome one way or the other.<br/><br/>A more informative description: The game comes with a full set of english rules already and its game components are fully language independent.<br/><br/>Cop &amp; Killer is an interactive game for up to 10 players, where the gameplay focuses on a Killer trying to kill his Target and the Cop tries to capture the Killer before he is on his victim. At the beginning each player randomly receives hidden an identity marker which identifies him either as the Cop, the Killer, the Target or a Bystander. These identity badges are kept by the players in their hands under the table, and before a game round starts the players can secretly exchange the badges on a one to one base so that nobody knows the true identity of the others. The ID badges come in different shapes to avoid looking at the badges while exchanging them, so that the players know which badge they are holding, so there is no need for them to look at them under the table.<br/><br/>When the badges have been assigned by the players, the meeple in form of a bullet is placed on the gameboard and playing commences. In turn, the players now roll a set of a red and a blue dice, and they may move the bullet clockwise around the board for a number of spaces corresponding to the number rolled with one of the dice. During the course of the game, the identities of the players may be revealed, and when this has happened to Cop, Killer or Target their rules for using the dice will be slightly changed. So, the Cop now must use only the blue dice and moves the bullet clockwise, but he may decide to move less spaces than rolled by the dice, to simulate the chosen path of investigation (coffee ? Yes or no?). The Killer on the other hand uses the red dice and must move the exact number of spaces, but he may chose to go clockwise or counter-clockwise. Finally, the Target may use the result of one or both dice and move the bullet clockwise around the board.<br/><br/>On the gameboard, the players will encounter a number of spaces which allow them to perform an action, but before describing those actions let me say a little bit more about the mechanics of the gameboard. So, each action space either has a blue or red background colour, depending on whether the action is beneficial for the Cop or the Killer. A player who lands on such a space and performs the action afterwards takes a coin of the corresponding colour, representing either a reward for helping the Police or a bribe for helping the Killer. When the round ends, either the Cop or the Killer will have been successful, earning the player of Cop or Killer one victory point. However, in addition the two players (Bystanders) who helped the successful Cop or Killer most and earned most coins of the winning colour also will be awarded one victory point, and then a new round of play will start until all 10 victory points of either Cop or Killer have been distributed.<br/><br/>At this place, it becomes important to notice that the gameboard is double sides and can be flipped from a side depicting the Cop's office to the Crime Scene and backwards. The side with the Cop's office shows more actions which are beneficial for the Cop and the players who have chosen to assist him, whereas the side of the Crime Scene features more red actions which can be used by the Killer and his henchmen. The change of both sides of the gameboard is triggered by one space on each side, featuring either a car key or an office key, and the player who move the bullet onto the corresponding space flips the gameboard over and receives a correspondingly coloured coin.<br/><br/>The action blue spaces which are favourable for the Cop and his assisting players are the following:<br/><br/>* Circumstancial Evidence: the active player may chose any other player- That player must reveal his identity.<br/>    * Successful Investigation: The Cop has finished his investigations. All identity markers are uncovered.<br/>    * Interrogation: The active player may chose another player and ask him a direct question which must be answered truthfully by &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. It may be asked whether the questioned player has a specific identity, and if this turns out to be true the player's identity must be revealed. However, the question may also be of a more indirect nature, only asking whether a player would try to assist the Killer during his next turn etc. In this case, no identity marker will be revealed, but the questioned player is bound to his answer on his following turn.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the following red spaces are more useful for the Killer:<br/><br/>* Informant: The active player may ask an other player whether he is the Target. If this is ture, the Traget must reveal his identity.<br/>    * Betrayal: The player entering this space must reveal his own identity.<br/>    * Target in sight: The Target must reveal its identity.<br/><br/>When Cop or Killer are revealed, they discard all coins they have collected during this round, since from now onwards they are pursuing their own aims which are not quite congruent with those of the Bystanders. However, until then they should collect coins and normal, and they possibly have the chance to put the other players onto a wrong track by the colour of coins they collect.<br/><br/>Finally, there are also a blue and a red action space which lead to the climate of the round: the blue Arrest space and the red Assault space. For an Arrest, the identities of Cop and Killer must be revealed, whereas an Assault needs Killer and Target to be revealed. If the Cop or the Killer decide to act, two dice are rolled, and if the acting player (Cop in case of Arrest, Killer in case of Assault) rolls a higher result on his dice than on the other dice, he may shoot that number of arrows with the included Dartgun at a target marker which has been set up at a chosen distance. If one of the darts hits, the round is over and the shooting player and his two best assistants will have won, but if no hit was scored the game continues. However, if the shooting was successful and if, after the distribution of victory points, all ten victory points of one colour have been used up, the game ends and the player with most victory points will have won.<br/><br/>Wow, this game plays astonishingly well, and the playing mechanism certainly is not just a vehicle which forms the background for some otherwise senseless dartgun shooting. Quite the opposite, the gameplay is quite multi-faceted and offers a good degree of playing depth which is somewhat counterbalanced by the interactive element of shooting. The guessing and deduction of the players starts at the end of a round when the identity markers have to be exchanged, since no player may keep the badge of Cop, Killer or Target for two consecutive rounds. Depending on the positioning of the players around the table, each player may make some first deductions on who might now have which identity badge. During the game itself, it will be especially the Bystanders who will try to spoil an early victory of Cop or Killer, since they first want to collect enough coins to participate in the distribution of victory points at the end of the round. So, it will always be a few players who want to move for ending the round, while the others want to postpone the inevitable end until the get into a better position themselves. For this reason, especially the Interrogation action is rather useful, since a player who is asked a question is bound to his answer on his following turn. This may lead to a considerable restriction of his actions, depending on the way a question is asked.<br/><br/>The extensive care which was put into this game is reflected by the artwork, the components (including a very robust and seemingly durable dartgun from a German manufacture) and the body of the rules. Special provisions for only four players for teamplay with 7 to 10 players are included, as well as a full English version of the rules. Even the details are harmonious, with a real-looking bullet as a playing piece and a carboard-piece resembling a yellow &quot;Police Line&quot; which is used to mark off the line after which the shooter must stand. To my mind, Cop &amp; Killer is a really outstanding interactive group game, and with people who do not mind the somewhat violent topic really thrilling games should be possible.<br/><br/>Most of the text is originally written by kulkmanns gamebox as a review by Frank Schulte-Kulkmann on boardgame.de<br/><br/>",

The board contains spaces with numbers, as well as spaces without numbers.  Players place their pawns on a non-numbered spot to begin the game.  A card is drawn showing a number that corresponds to one of the numbered spots on the board.  Players take turns attempting to land on that spot. How many spots a player moves on his/her turn is determined by a spinner.  Whichever player lands on the spot first collects the card.<br/><br/>Another card is drawn, and the same routine continues until all cards are distributed and the winner is the player with the most cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The battle is for the treasure islands. You have to defend your own island and conquer your opponents island. On the boardgame you have tropical islands, reefs and treasure islands.<br/><br/>Filibuster is a loosely pirate-themed game where players take turns to move black and white plastic ships across a 13x13 square tile board. Apart from sea tiles there are skerry tiles (that cannot be entered), island tiles (which offer protection) and two treasure island tiles (which are the objectives of the game).<br/><br/>Each player has ten corvettes and three galleons at their disposal. Corvettes can land on islands but cannot sink other ships. Galleons, conversely, cannot land on islands but can sink an enemy ship by entering its tile at the end of a full 5-step move. The game ends when one player lands a corvette on the other player's treasure island.<br/><br/>Although there's no explicit art credit, the board bears the legend &quot;Tegnestuen Den gyldne n&oslash;gle&quot;, Danish for &quot;Studio The Golden Key&quot;, the firm name used by the Pagermans (professional artists both). The cover painting, however, showing generic pirate ships closing for battle, has a clipped, unreadable signature that doesn't seem to match either of their names.<br/><br/>",

The top tier is a copy of the bottom tier, but reversed -- it contains the destinations that the players are racing to reach.

        "description": "A straightforward edge-matching placement game consisting of 32 square tiles (called 'stones' in the rules), each a red plastic frame inset with a white plastic square which has symbols cutout on the edges. Each edge has either no cutout (a blank edge), or half a square, circle or diamond.<br/><br/>Players take turns to add tiles to the layout, always matching edges. Scoring is simple: whenever a player completes a square or rectangle of tiles of any size they score points equal to the number of tiles in the square or rectangle.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 10 stones, and must play if possible each turn. If not, they take a stone from the reserve. As soon as one player has played all his stones the game ends and the scores are tallied. Any stones remaining with a player count as -1; if he has taken from the reserve at any time during the game then each stone remaining counts as -5!<br/><br/>The game was made in England by Merit, and appears to date from the 50s or 60s (no date is given on the game materials). The so-called stones are nicely made components that fit neatly into the small square box.<br/><br/>The rules suggest that there are 35 stones in the game. The combinations of symbols that appear on the stones are:<br/><br/>     4 symbols the same (all 4 possible stones)<br/>     3 symbols the same, 1 different (all 12 possible combinationss)<br/>     2 pairs of 2 symbols, matching pairs are adjacent (all 6 possible combinations)<br/>     1 pair the same and 2 other symbols, matching pair is adjacent (12 of 24 possible combinations, including one of each mirror-image pair)<br/>     4 different symbols (1 of 6 possible combinations).<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This simple game consists of tiles with parts of cute colorful snakes. The players try to make the longest snake.Serpentino is a Dutch game for younger children. There are two ways of playing, one more suited to very young kiddies.<br/><br/>The 54 cards are used, to form seven snakes. Four of the snakes have seven parts to their body plus a head and a tail, whilst three other snakes have four parts to their body plus, again, a head and a tail.<br/><br/>Four children can play the simpler game. The cards are shuffled and placed face-down in a stack. In his turn, a player takes the top card and if it is a head, he places it in front of him. Now, on future turns, another card is drawn. If it is a body part, it is added to the head and so on. The idea is to for each player to make a snake as long as possible after drawing a head, but if a tail is drawn, that completes the snake and a new snake must be 'started' by drawing another head card. Unusable cards are discarded and are shuffled once the draw pile has been exhausted. The winner is the player who has made the most snakes or, as an alternative, the player who has made the longest snake.<br/><br/>The slightly more difficult game only uses the four snakes with nine parts. A single child can probably have fun just making snakes, perhaps consisting of a head, 40 body parts and a tail.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a Hokkien gambling game played in South-east Asia. Lien Poh literally translates as 'turning treasure'. The cube is the Poh or 'treasure' and the metal box is the Poh Kam or 'treasure cover'.<br/><br/>Most Poh have the same face on all sides, with the functional part being the red and white colouring/marking. The red portion is a stylized Chinese character, Tong, and the white portion is another character, Ying. However, there are examples where the design is completely abstract and sides may have different designs.<br/><br/>There are known instances where the characters are 寶 and 通 (bao and tong).<br/><br/>In order to play the game, a betting diagram is roughly drawn on paper - a square sheet is divided into four triangular areas by two diagonal lines. Punters bet on which area the red side will end up facing.<br/><br/>The person operating the game puts the Poh into the Poh Kam, leaving a bit of room for the Poh to be rattled around inside. It then settles into the smaller part of the metal container and the Poh Kam is closed all the way. The whole block is then spun. When it comes to rest, the block is placed in the centre of the diagram so that each side lines up with one of the 4 areas. The cover is lifted and the red side will be facing one of the 4 areas - punters who bet in that area win their bet.<br/><br/>The game is described in C.T. Dobree's book, Gambling Games of Malaya (q.v.) and it mentions that the name of the game in Kelantan is 'Ewok'. There's also a description of how operators of the game could cheat at it.<br/><br/><br/>The game is also described in Stewart Culin's book &quot;Chinese Games with Dice and Dominoes&quot; on pages 507-508. He writes:<br/><br/>The po tsz', or covered die, is not, properly, a die game at all.  It consists of a small wooden cube, which is placed in a square receptacle in the top of a brass prism, over which a brass cover fits very closely.  A specimen exhibited by His Highness, the Sultan of Johore in the section of games at the Columbian Exposition consisted of a wooden cube about one-half an inch square, having one-half of each face painted red and one-half white.  The prism in which the cube fitted was slightly convex on the bottom, and, when placed upon a smooth surface, could be twirled rapidly.  The game is played by placing the box containing the po in the center of a square crossed by diagonal lines, which is drawn upon a mat.  One of the four divisions of the square is painted red.  One of the four divisions of the square is painted red.  The players lay their bets upon the other divisions and the box is spun rapidly by the gamekeeper, who repeats the operation until it comes to rest squarely with the corners corresponding with the indersecting lines.  The cover is then lifted, and those who have staked opposite the red side of the die win.  The banker wins when the red side comes opposite the side of the square painted red.  There is said to be a current notion, amounting to a superstition among the Chinese in Johore, that if a player stops the box as it is spinning the luck will surely go against him.<br/><br/>Another specimen in the Sultan's collection, called at Johore, kong poh (Chinese t'ung po), &quot;current treasure,&quot; furnishes an explanation of the name po.  It consists of a wooden die, with a face 1 3/8 inches square, and three-forths inch thick, which fits into a brass box with a broad base.  A wooden cover fits over the box.  This die is not spun, but is concealed in a bag which accompanies it, and there adjusted by the gamekeeper.  The face of the wooden die is carved with the characters t'ung po, on one side in the ordinary, and on the reverse in seal characters, the character t'ung being painted red, and po white.  The inscription t'ung po &quot;current treasure,&quot; occurs on the face of all modern Chinese coins, and the common name of the game is evidently derived from the character po, which occurs on this block.<br/><br/>It should be noted that when Culin refers to &quot;po tsz'&quot; he most likely means &quot;t&oacute;u zi&quot; (骰子) which is usually translated as just &quot;dice&quot; and not &quot;covered die.&quot;  When he refers to the die with the characters &quot;t'ung po&quot; written upon it, he is refering to tōng bǎo (通寶) which means &quot;open treasure&quot; not &quot;current treasure.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jenga Cubes is part of the Jenga series of games.  The logo printed on the tower matches the Jenga logo on the rest of the series.<br/><br/>The game consists of 25 dice-like black cubes, each with blue, green, and red faces.  The cubes stack nicely inside a Plexiglas tower that has slots cut out on alternating sides at each level (24 on the tower and 1 dislodged cube).  It is possible to carefully push out cubes leaving the above cubes in place by ensuring that that the remaining cube supports the ones above.<br/><br/>The rules of the game differ from those of the traditional Jenga in which, the players will each be assigned a color (by way of rolling one of the dice) and will try to make one of the faces of the tower all of their color (e.g. orange player will try to make one of the faces of the tower orange).<br/><br/>Every turn the player will roll the dislodged cube, and take the color face-up and push it against in the tower (using any side) until a cube on the opposite side falls out. If it is not possible to push that color, the dice is re-rolled.<br/><br/> Note: if the cube that comes up lands with the face-up of your color, you get another turn (no limit on turns as long as your color keeps coming up).<br/><br/>",

The board features a weaving path that goes through the Iron Rod, the Mists of Darkness, the Great and Spacious Building, and the River of Filthy Water. Players draw colored cards that determine what square s/he will go to next. Some special cards allow you to skip ahead, go to a certain part of the board, or force you to go backwards on the path. The winner is the first player to reach the tree of life.<br/><br/>From the publisher: Around 600 BC there lived a prophet named Lehi. Lehi dreamed about a straight and narrow path that led to the Tree of Life. In the center of the path was the Ironrod. By clinging to the Ironrod and pressing forward, one could reach the Tree of Life. Along the path, one must be very careful not to slip away and get trapped in the Mist of Darkness, the River of Water, or the Great and Spacious Building. The consequence for slipping away would cause a prolonged arrival to the Tree of Life. In order to win the game, one must reach Lehi and the Tree of Life by taking the shortest path. The surest way to reach the Tree of Life first is to stay on the path and follow the Ironrod.<br/><br/>",

The cover artwork of American soldiers in the field in Europe is superb, but the game itself is simple. It comes with 10 counters (5 of each color) and 1 dial. The game board features 5 lines of 26 dots on each line.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture your opponent's men. Players use a spinner to determine the number of spaces they can move on any given turn. With each spin, the player can move any of his five pieces. In order to capture an opposing piece, a player must spin and land by exact count on the opposing piece on that line. There is a &quot;shell hole&quot; on each line that offers safety from capture.<br/><br/>Capturing a piece closes that line, and the capturing player can then place his free piece on any other still open line, increasing the opportunities to spin the exact number needed to capture another enemy piece on that line. The first player to capture all of the opposing pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>",

He moves these around the board winning converts and establishing churches as quickly as possible. Unlike most games, players do not compete against each other. They cooperate as the early Apostles did to spread Christianity throughout the world. Competition is provided by the game itself, through two sets of cards, many of which inflict persecution or misfortune upon the various churches and Apostles. An intelligent group of players, cooperating with each other, can overcome this opposition and successfully spread Christianity throughout the Roman Empire, thus winning the game.&quot;<br/><br/>Gospel Explosion: the Acts of the Apostles has been awarded U.S. Patent Number 4441718.<br/><br/>",

If the pyramid is still facing away from them at the end of the game, they earn points for it, depending on size. When a piece is dropped, it can &quot;turn&quot; one or more other pieces - that is, change the direction of other pieces along the path in which it is pointing, so that those pieces are also pointing away from the player who dropped the piece. The number of pieces a piece can turn is dependent upon its size; a large pyramid can turn three other pieces, a medium two, and a small piece only one.<br/><br/>On your turn, you choose a piece to drop, and then you turn the correct number of pieces in front of the piece you just dropped, so that they are all pointing away from you.<br/><br/>However: only pieces that are lying down are turned. Pieces that are standing upright are left standing upright. This means that in some cases, particularly early in the game, you won't get to turn any pieces even if you drop a large piece.<br/><br/>Rules can be found on Wunderland.com<br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>    Icehouse Pieces<br/><br/><br/>",

But being elected isn't as easy as it seems, as the other candidate will want to put a negative spin on your campaign at every turn.<br/><br/>A number of cards representing States or groups of States are set up from left-to-right on the table.  The final one, of course, is Florida.<br/><br/>Each player holds an identical set of action cards in their hand. These action cards are further divided by colour, indicating the type of action the player will attempt.  Possible actions range from complimenting your opponent all the way down to &quot;dirty tricks&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is a bluff/counter-bluff game. One card colour counteracts another colour, but is crushed by the third colour. Given that each player begins the game with the exact same cards, a battle of wits and nerves is sure to follow!<br/><br/>After the first preliminary visit to each state, the aspiring candidate must decide which States to pursue and which to leave for their opponent.  Sometimes it will prove to be good strategy to play a weaker card and save the real muscle for other States!<br/><br/>After two trips around the country, the electoral votes are counted.  Being American politics, only the slimmest of margins is necessary for victory in any given state. The candidate with the highest number of electoral college votes is the winner, and the next President of the United States.<br/><br/>How will you play your cards?<br/><br/>",

Each have three pieces, moving by rolls of a die along interconnected paths that lead to the treasure. The paths are organized in three distinctive levels with paths between them. The players can knock out other player's pieces by landing on them so they start over (just like in Ludo). The paths include special spots, including green spots (skip three turns), red spots (slide down to an earlier path, like in Snakes&amp;Ladders) and blue spots (entrance to the next level).<br/><br/>It is clearly of german origin since it is designed by Rolf Kauka, a famous german cartoonist. German publications and name are unknown. A swedish low-cost version was sold in Sweden in the 1970's, most likely produced by Klee. Although Klee is not printed on the game, Klee made other games in identical boxes with similar part numbers.<br/><br/>The game is mostly known in Sweden through a famous comedy sketch from the late 60's, with four adults trying to socialize by playing the game but the play quickly turns into bickering. This makes the game particularly interesting as a game that everybody knows about but few have played.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Boardgame<br/>12 playing pieces 4x3 <br/>1 dice<br/><br/>",

To be played on Finnish side.&quot;<br/><br/>The Finns and the Soviets each have unique custom decks of cards. The cards depict attacks, events, and weapons of the historical campaign.<br/><br/>Each turn the Finn player may play any standing defenses from the cards in his hand. One to six Soviet cards are then turned up (as determined by a die roll.) These cards represent the Soviet attack for the turn. The Finnish player tries to play a defensive response with a higher total Force Value than the Soviet cards. If the total Force Value of the Soviet cards is higher, the different in Force Values represents the number of casualties suffered by the Finns and is subtracted from the Finish troop count.<br/><br/>The player wins if there are no cards left in the Soviet deck and there are still troops remaining. If all 100 of the Finnish troops are killed, then the player loses.<br/><br/>",

It was evidently printed in many editions because at least one copy seems to date from about 1919 based on the ships depicted, even though the original copyright date is 1896.<br/><br/>The ships are divided into &quot;fleets&quot; of four similar ships, mostly historical class sister ships ranking from &quot;A&quot; through &quot;M&quot; with each ship in the fleet numbered from &quot;1&quot; though &quot;4.&quot;<br/><br/>For example, the &quot;A&quot; fleet comprises the battleships Oklahoma, Nevada, New York and Texas. The &quot;M&quot; fleet comprises the submarines Plunger, Porpoise, Shark and Moccasin.<br/><br/>Each card lists its identifying number &quot;A-1, M-4&quot;; the name of the ship in larger type with the sister ships in smaller type; a photograph or drawing of the ship and a three-line description.<br/><br/>For example, the Plunger's description reads: &quot;PLUNGER -- Submarine torpedo boat. Holland type, operated by gasoline when in the surface and electricuty when submerged. 63 feet long. Has 3 14-inch Whitehead torpedoes for sub-sea attack.&quot;<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect &quot;fleets&quot; of four cards with the winner being the player with the most &quot;fleets&quot; at the end of play.<br/><br/>Five cards are dealt to each player with the surplus forming a common draw pile.<br/><br/>The player to the dealer's left begins by asking any one player for a specific card . For example, &quot;Do you have H-3 Massachusetts?&quot; If the player has the card he must give it to the caller, who can then ask for another card from anyone around the table.<br/><br/>If the targeted player doesn't have the card, then the caller must draw one card from the draw pile and play passes to the left.<br/><br/>Once four cards in the same fleet are collected the player paces them down on the table face up.<br/><br/>If a player has no cards then he is entitled to draw two cards from the draw pile.<br/><br/>Once the draw pile is exhausted, play continues with the cards in hand only until all the fleets are formed.<br/><br/>The rules don't say, but presumably players who have no cards and can't draw from the draw pile can still continue to play and acquire cards for a fleet, although they would be vulnerable to poaching from other players.<br/><br/>",

Although many mysteries surround K'uhul, it has remained fairly harmless over the past 1000 years.<br/><br/>Now two rival shamans have arrived to worship at the sacred site and discover that they are in violent disagreement over the origins and purpose of K'uhul. The only thing they agree on is that K'uhul is a gate to untold power.<br/><br/>As their increasingly heated arguments begin to disrupt the local village--the village Head Man decides to end the bickering by holding a contest: the first shaman to be able to successfully activate the power of K'uhul will win the respect and riches of the village, while the loser will be sacrificed to appease Coatlicue--who is no doubt annoyed by the constant bickering.<br/><br/>The contest is held on a 3x3 grid within the ring of sacred statues. The ring of statues is formed by making piles of &quot;gate chips&quot; which surround 9 single chips which form the gate itself. The gate chips come in two styles, Runes and Stars, and the 3x3 pattern they form must be manipulated to match that of one of the special &quot;gate cards&quot;. By arranging the chips to match the pattern of a gate card, a shaman can &quot;unlock&quot; the gate.<br/><br/>Gameplay is further complicated by the presence of several types of &quot;special&quot; chips as well as &quot;spell&quot; cards that are activated when a gate card is &quot;unlocked&quot;.<br/><br/>The first player to successfully &quot;unlock&quot; two of the face-up gate cards PLUS a final gate card from their own hand, will be declared the winner. The loser is then sacrificed during the ensuing celebration to the merriment of all.<br/><br/>",

These pieces are placed upright on the wooden playing board (15 x 7 inches), at the center of which there is a pendulum made of a one inch diameter wooden ball affixed to a 10 inch long string.  Players take turns pulling back the ball and letting go it, allowing it to free-swing in any direction around the board.   A player wins the round by knocking over the opponent's 7 pieces before all of one's own pieces are knocked over by the pendulum.<br/><br/>Variants described in the instruction booklet include St. Louie (&quot;The Pendulum Dice Game&quot;), Tower Tumble (noncompetitive), and Bowling.<br/><br/>Pendulum has a small 16 page instruction booklet which includes 14 black and white photos, most of young children playing the game.  There is one picture (from about 1900) of an outdoor game of 'quilles', described as &quot;an early pendulum game developed in France in the 14th century.&quot;<br/><br/>According to the booklet, Pendulum's &quot;composition is of a Folk Toy Style.&quot;   Its board design is &quot;taken from a 12th century A.D. Jain Temple at Kathiawar built to honor Patala, a land devoted to games.&quot;<br/><br/>The game book is attributed to Anne Rivers and Carl Chase.  The game and package design are attributed to Carl Chase.  Pendulum was distributed in the mid-1980's by Pinocchio's, located in Kalamazoo, Michigan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Arthur Saves the Planet: One Step at a Time, Arthur and his friends &amp; family work together to solve environmental issues threatening his hometown of Elwood City. From littered beaches to endangered tree frogs, from deforested parks to wasted water, the team has its work cut out for it. And ANYONE can help! Pick an Arthur character and collect colored resource cards representing time, expertise, friends, effort and advice.<br/><br/>Arthur Saves the Planet provides a unique and challenging design for children to actually experience the joys of strategic gaming with their parents and friends! Players aged 4 and up must decide whether to move their character to a specific location on the board, or collect another resource card. Never leave your house and you won&rsquo;t solve any problems, but if you don&rsquo;t take time to collect resources, such as helpful friends and expert advice, then you&rsquo;ll never find the right solutions!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clipper Race is a sailing game published around 1935.  Players (2,3,4) use a spinner to determine movement along predefined naval routes. The objective is to sail from: Boston, New York, Philadelphia or New Orleans to Shanghai and then return to one of the USA ports.  The player must land exactly on Shanghai and the USA port.  Along the way there are spaces that direct the player to go back spaces or sail to a different port before resuming course.  Landing on an opponent sends him back 10 spaces.  The shorter routes have more penalty spaces. The game comes with 6 beautifully crafted clippers (2 extra) in low relief that are painted in semi reflective paints.<br/><br/>",
