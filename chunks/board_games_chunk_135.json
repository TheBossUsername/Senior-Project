        "description": "From the designer notes:  &quot;JITO is a multi-game format rather than a single game.  It can be simply competative, like most games.  It can be a sophisticated game that features competitive cooperation, or it can be a completely cooperative game.  You are invited to invent your own game using the board, but we would suggest that you start with the usual competitive game to learn how to balance cards most effectively and how to guess future peg locations with the greatest success. (Remember that the longest dimension of a card is from one corner to another.)&quot;<br/><br/>In Game I., 2 players (or 2 teams of 2 players) compete to be the first the cross the board from one site to the opposite side with a continuous bridge of cards balanced on pegs.<br/><br/>Play progresses by each player throwing 2,d6 dice then a player may place a peg in the area on the board that matches the number thrown.  After placing a peg, you may attempt to balance one or more cards on your peg(s).  You may not overlap or touch an opponent's card bridge or share pegs.  You must place a card within 20 seconds or lose your turn.  The game ends when one of the players spans the board from one side to the opposite side (side to side, up and down, or diagonally).  A completed bridge is worth 3 points.  The usual match is to 6, 9, or 12 points.<br/><br/>Game II variant:  This variant is a cooperative/competitive game for 3 players.   Three players attempt to cross the board, but at any time 2 players may voluntarily decide to merge and build a bridge together.  If they succeed in reaching the opposite site first, each player receives 1.5 points.  The usual match is to 4, 5, or 7 points.<br/><br/>Game III variant:  This version is fully cooperative and is for 2, 3, or, 4 players.  All players work together to build a successful bridge. Individual scoring is assessed by counting the same-colored number of cards belonging to an individual player.  You may also desire to set a time limit as the goal for building a bridge together.<br/><br/>",

Players have to choose between opening up more programs or using their money to decrease their debt and build large public works projects which give victory points at the end of the game.  Sometimes borrowing large sums of money pays off and sometimes it lands you in the poor house.<br/><br/>",

Be an axe wielding barbarian, a spell slinging sorceress, or divinely protected priest and battle monsters, survive traps, and talk your way past the guards to obtain their treasures. When things get tough, team up with a friend, but only until they outlive their usefulness,  because there can be only one winner in Dungeon Crawl!<br/><br/>How it is played:<br/><br/>Players choose one of 10 unique, fantasy-archetypical characters (fighter, priest, rogue, sorceress, etc.), each with different stats and powers.  They then move from town to different randomly generated locations where they have to complete combat, skill, and trap encounters to earn loot and experience points.<br/><br/>The random and modular nature of the game means that there are over 15 billion combinations in which encounters and locations can occur.<br/><br/>Players can team up to form parties, making it easier to complete encounters, but splitting the rewards with their group, or go solo where things are harder, but they get 100% of the rewards.  They may also use bonus tokens gained from successfully completing encounters to aid themselves or hinder their opponents.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first level 5 dungeon is completed, and the player with the most experience points when the game ends is the winner.<br/><br/>",

A pack of Red, White and Blue Cards, called Route Tickets, four STEAMSHIPS for travel on the water, and four TRAINS with Engines of color corresponding to the ships, for travel in Europe. It will be noticed that the trains of cars used in playing this game are like the European trains in appearance. Each player should take one STEAMSHIP and one TRAIN OF CARS of the same color. Each player should in turn draw a Red Ticket, without looking at it previously to taking it in his hand, and should put the prow of his Steamship upon the Red spot indicating the City first named on that ticket and from which port he is to sail. When traveling upon the WATER, Use the Steamship ; when going from CITY TO CITY IN EUROPE, each player should use his train as his piece, removing his Steamship from the board as soon as he begins to use his Train, and removing his train from the board when he again uses his Steamship. A player should put the front part of his Train on the City at which he is supposed to be. When ON THE WATER he should use the prow of his ship to indicate his position.<br/><br/>PLAYERS HAVING MADE THE FIRST MOVE continue in turn to move their pieces to the next place mentioned on their respective ROUTE TICKETS, thus: A player drawing the Route Ticket New York, Storm, Queenstown, Liverpool, and London: will it five moves, reach the latter point (using the Steamship from New York to Liverpool, then removing the Steamship front the board, and playing his Railroad Train from Liverpool to London). A player drawing the ticket New York, Rescue, Southampton and London, will, in four moves, reach the latter City, etc.<br/><br/>Players who prefer to use ordinary pieces instead of the Steamships and Trains of Cars, may use the four wooden pieces enclosed in the game, but if the Steamships and Trains are used, the wooden pieces are not. As a player moves his pieces, he must call out the place or city to which he moves. When a player reaches the last City named on his Ticket, he throws his Red Ticket aside (as it is not used again in the game), and continues to play and draw front White Tickets until he reaches Constantinople.<br/><br/>After a ticket has been used it is thrown into a discarded pile or placed under the bottom of the stack from which it was originally drawn. The players, by this process, eventually reach CONSTANTINOPLE, which is the turning point of the game.<br/><br/>AFTER REACHING CONSTANTINOPLE, a player must draw Blue Route Tickets, which will eventually bring him back to Boston or New York. The player making a TOUR OF EUROPE, as far as Constantinople, and first arriving at the last City mentioned on his return card (either Boston or New York), WINS THE GAME.<br/><br/>It will be seen that a player may make the trip very quickly, or that it may take a long time. The first Red Card that he draws will take him across the Ocean, but he may have to play upon the cities mentioned on several WHITE Cards before he reaches Constantinople, and he may draw several Blue Route Tickets after reaching Constantinople ere he gets back to Boston or New York.<br/><br/>N. B. &mdash; Players must move on EVERY City mentioned on EVERY Route Card they draw. Players can only move to the next City mentioned on Their Route Card, in one turn, therefore it will take six turns to reach the last City mentioned on a card having six names of Cities, etc. The red dots on the Ocean, such as Storm, Rescue, Fog, etc., supposed to represent incidents in the ocean trip, are used in the game exactly as the cities are.<br/><br/>GOING TO DINNER. It sometimes occurs that Two players meet in the same City, in which case they go to DINNER together, that is, both pieces are put upon the Dinner space, or picture, in the corner of the board. Players do NOT remain upon the Dinner space but remove to the next City on their routes (the Dinner only being an incident in their journey).<br/><br/>It does not require a SEPARATE turn to go to Dinner, the pieces being immediately placed on the Dinner picture on their meeting in any foreign City. Remember that you draw a Red Ticket on the first turn only. The White Tickets are used to carry you to Constantinople, and the Blue ones to bring you home. This will be easily remembered from the order, Red, White and Blue.<br/><br/>The board (from the 1st edition) sits on top of a wood framed bottom and there is a sliding drawer in the side for the game pieces to go into. The 2nd edition comes without sliding drawer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Epic Wars is a modular and expandable tile exploration and miniatures skirmish game set in the &quot;Classic&quot; Fantasy genre, with multiple game types and solo, co-op, and pvp modes.<br/><br/>Miniatures Skirmish - PVP mode:<br/>Traditional tabletop miniatures battle game that can be played on your existing terrain, or on our Wilderness Tiles (sold separately). Each mini will have a stat card with abilities, and players will have event/action cards they can play on their turn. Each mini has an initiative and turns alternate by each individual mini, and NOT by entire squad. Squads are formed by a point system where each squad has a &quot;point pool&quot; and each mini has a cost.<br/><br/>Miniatures Skirmish - Solo, and Co-Op modes:<br/>Similar to PVP mode with additional movement and &quot;AI&quot; rules (still being tweaked), to allow play against &quot;the game&quot;. The player(s) will determine enemy squad size (point pool), and scenario prior to starting.<br/><br/>Tile Exploration - Solo and Co-Op modes:<br/>A traditional dungeon tile exploration game with a few differences. Epic Wars will not only have collectable enemies cards with different levels of rarity (different stats, XP, and rewards), but all the dungeon tiles, event cards, treasure cards, trap cards, etc... will have different levels. Players will determine if they want to &quot;free play&quot; or if they want to use a set scenario with different objectives to complete.<br/><br/>And while the &quot;wilderness tiles&quot; are sold separately, we will be including the &quot;dungeon tiles&quot; in the core game. The main reason for this is many people that play tabletop skirmish games probably already have terrain of some sort, while few will already have dungeon tiles.<br/><br/>I'm sure this write-up has raised more questions than answered. Our goal is to maximize depth and re-playability. There is nothing worse than getting a game you are excited for and end up playing once or twice because it has the depth of a melted ice cube. Epic Wars is all about expandability and customization. And depending on your luck with the card draws and dice rolls, you could have a wipe after 5 minutes, or an Epic War lasting all day.<br/><br/>At this time we are still early in design and all elements are subject to change. Please send me messages and check our website for updates. Follow us and spread the word.<br/><br/>",

The idea of the game is to get to know the geography of Norway better.<br/><br/>Each player are represented on a board (map of Norway) by a plastic car. The die is rolled, and the player move forward accordingly. Landing on a yellow or red field triggers an event for that player, either through a text on the board or a random card drawn from a deck, like: &quot;By the Malang water falls you are fishing salmon. That takes some time. Roll a 3 to move again&quot; or &quot;You drive through a herd of goats. Pass one roll.&quot;<br/><br/>First player to drive through all of Norway wins.<br/><br/>",

But to do so, you do not only have to found companies, expand them, and sell them again, you also have to be smart, as knowledge tests are built into the game, and a certain number of knowledge markers is necessary for some of the actions.<br/>Players move around a track; each track field allows a specific action, such as buy/develop a company, get an event card, pay other companies, secure international presence. Players get knowledge tokens by answering design- and print-related questions; these tokens can buy domain-specific knowledge markers which in turn are needed to develop the companies and give an advantage in buy-out attempts.

The board is oriented with a side of six cells next to each player. These nearest six cells are called the &ldquo;bank,&rdquo; and to start the game, each player has six pieces called &ldquo;men&rdquo; in his own color, one on each cell. In the next two rows, referred to as a &ldquo;mooring,&rdquo; each player starts with twelve &ldquo;boat&rdquo; pieces of his own color. These pieces are large enough for the &ldquo;men&rdquo; to easily stand upon.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving one piece at a time, man or boat. Men may move any number of spaces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, but not back towards their own bank. Between banks, men may only move about on or over boats. Only one man may ride a boat at a time. Boats move in the same manner as men. Men may ride a boat of either color, but the boat&rsquo;s rules of movement do not change. Men may not be removed from a boat of their own color, but may be thrown overboard from one of their opponent&rsquo;s boats.<br/><br/>Men may throw the other player&rsquo;s men overboard by landing on or jumping over their boat. To do this, the opponent&rsquo;s man must be in an adjacent cell; the capturing player must land on that boat or land on an empty boat opposite. A man thrown overboard returns to any empty cell on his player&rsquo;s bank and begins again.<br/><br/>When a boat and man reach the opponent&rsquo;s mooring, they are permanently removed from the board. The first player to remove all his own pieces from the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Four lines of small holes extend vertically and horizontally from the pit to the sides of the board, and continue around all four sides making a border.  Near each corner of the board are four more small holes.  Printed on the board over the lines of small holes are the outlines of footprints leading in one direction, ultimately towards the hideout.  Printed over the groupings of four holes are a bomb, a noose, a gun, and a knife.<br/><br/>Four players have four pegs each in their own color.  Play begins with their four pieces resting in one of the four corner groupings.  Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine the length of their move.  Any one of the player's pegs may be moved, but most be moved the exact number of footprints rolled on the die.<br/><br/>If landing on a hole occupied by another player, the first peg is returned to its home base to begin again, and the peg in play is moved five extra spaces.  Players may not land on a footprint occupied by one of their own pegs; they must choose to move a different peg.<br/><br/>The hideout may only be reached by an exact roll of the die.  If no other moves are possible, that player forfeits the turn and the peg remains in place.  The first player to move all four pegs into the hideout wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tilt is a self-published card game system which utilizes a 66-card deck. The cards are divied into eight suits (A, B, F, L, O, R, S, U) with eight cards per suit (HIGH, DOUBLE, 4, 3, 2, 1, TWIN, LOW). Two other cards are included, the ROYAL E and a WILD card, each of which have a rank of 0 when necessary.<br/><br/>The 34 page rulebook describes seven games:<br/>Regular Tilt<br/>Reverse Tilt<br/>Double Tilt<br/>Royal Tilt<br/>Chain Letter<br/>Vocab<br/>Tilt Crossword Solitaire<br/><br/>The Tilt family of games are trick-taking games where certain ranks are worth 1 or 2 points. One suit per player, plus one extra for a dummy hand, are used. Players bid for the right to name a trump suit, and the winner draws two cards from the dummy to improve his hand (and discarding two unwanted cards). The different versions change the rules or scoring in various ways.<br/><br/>Chain Letter is a stops-style game where players try to discard their hand by matching the last-played card. Only suits count, not ranks.<br/><br/>Vocab is a spelling game where players use the cards as letters, trying to make three-letter words. The TWIN cards count as two letters, so TWIN L is LL, TWIN A is AA, etc.<br/><br/>Tilt Crossword Solitaire is as it sounds, a solitaire game where the player fills an 8 by 8 grid with cards. Points are earned for letters in words or abbreviations, while they are lost for empty spaces in the grid.<br/><br/>The game and rulebook are copyright 1946 by William H. Mulder.

Everybody has access to them, everybody uses them.<br/><br/>The graviton is tamed and has sent the solar system abuzz, teeming with ships, robots and people.<br/><br/>But the dark side of humanity is showing its claws. The human civilization has been polarized by the people who want to acquire and maintain their power over the masses. The earthlings and the spacelings of this world are in conflict.<br/><br/>One man has breached the very wheelwork of Nature and has found a way to go anywhere in an instant, jumping through space as if walking through open doors between worlds.<br/><br/>The leaders of the United Planets Alliance are trying to find this man and obtain control over the greatest achievement of mankind: the obliteration of any barriers of space.<br/><br/>It is your destiny to intervene and set mankind on its path to the future you wish for.<br/><br/>Join your forces with others like you, breathe life into your faction, take part in events happening in the solar system and beyond, and bring ruin or triumph to a world which finds itself in the agony of childhood.<br/><br/>No man or woman has ever been closer to the future of this world. Reach up and embrace your destiny, for you have the power to bring change!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDescriptionThe Gardener of Thoughts Card Game (GOT CG) is a competitive card game for 2 players, with a science fiction theme and atmospheric lore.<br/><br/>The game can be played by casual players right out of the box with excellent balance. There is a single deck of cards, no other play components. Advanced players may add custom cards.<br/><br/>The main mechanics are: shuffled cards, card drawing, turns, card playing, abilities (whose rules are applied when cards are played), and combo actions (= combining the abilities of multiple cards played in a single turn).<br/><br/>The system's logic is based on the diversity of the (rules of the) abilities present on the cards, and has an emphasis on combo actions. Combo actions emerge fluidly from the abilities, and have to be created on the spot by the players. To master the game, a player has to master combo actions.<br/><br/>The typical game duration for veteran players, without advanced gameplay, is (consistently) 30 minutes. Beginner players (who already know the rules) need about 60 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplay SynopsisMost of the time, a player has to engage (= play from hand) during his / her turns cards whose total sway (= numeric card value) is at least equal with the total sway of the cards engaged by the rival, thusly obstructing the rival.<br/><br/>Normally, during a turn, a player may engage only 1 card, but the abilities of the engaged cards allow for more cards to be engaged or drawn. This multiple engagement of cards is called combo action and forms the game's logic. Combo actions with 10 cards are not rare, and even with more than 20 have been seen.<br/><br/>From time to time, a player will not be able to obstruct the rival because he / she will not be able to create combos that are strong enough. In such a case, the player must discard 1 card from his / her reserve. Reserve is a play zone of each player, zone which contains a number of cards which is fixed at the beginning of the game; the number is normally 3, but advanced players can increase it by recruiting (= choosing) cards at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>By discarding a reserve card each time when a player can't obstruct the rival, the player will have fewer cards to engage during the last turn of the game, the turn which will determine the winner of the game. However, simply having more or fewer cards in the reserve at the end of the game doesn't guarantee winning or losing the game, it just increases or decreases the chances. This is because each player also has some random cards in his / her hand, and this randomness affects the ending.<br/><br/>",

The goal of Prescience (as determined by which scenario you play) may be simple, but things become more complicated each time the players travel back in time to relive the opening of the game.<br/><br/>Players always control the most current version of themselves, but they have the opportunity to use their knowledge of the past to interact with their former selves &mdash; or the former versions of their opponent. Through special abilities such as pushes, pulls, and stuns, they can change the course of the previous generations. However, each time they change the past, the effects of that change continue to ripple forward as the game progresses. Players who are able to use their knowledge of the past to their advantage will be victorious in Prescience!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bypass is played an a 12x12 square grid of circles, all of which are connected horizontally and vertically.  There are four areas of the board in two shades each of red, blue, yellow, and green.  On two opposite sides of the board is a black border numbered one through five, then skipping two spaces, and numbered five through one.  A similar red numbered border exists on the board's other sides.<br/><br/>The game is played with up to six pieces for each player in red, blue, yellow, or green.  The object is for a player to start the game with their pieces in the opposite corner of the home area of their color, and to move at least three of their pieces into that home area before their opponents, to win the game.<br/><br/>Movement of pieces is determined by one red and one black six-sided die; a piece will be moved to the spot where these two coordinates meet.  There then follows a series of rules governing the exact part of the board the piece can move to, and what goals must be met for the piece to move further, and what happens when pieces become &quot;triangulated,&quot; or captured.<br/><br/>Notes: The rules are detailed but something less than clear on some important details.  Also, like other games from this publisher, the game board is a printed sheet of paper held between a transparent sheet of plastic in a black plastic frame.<br/><br/>",

One black marble (the wolf) and twelve white marbles (the sheep) are included with the game, and rest easily in the board's holes.<br/><br/>To start the game, the wolf places his marble anywhere on the board.  The sheep then places a marble anywhere on the board. The wolf may begin moving to one adjacent hole in any direction.  The sheep must continue placing his marbles one at a time anywhere on the board until they have all been placed.  At that point, the sheep marbles can move the same as the wolf.<br/><br/>The wolf can capture any sheep in an adjacent hole by jumping over it to a vacant hole on its opposite side and removing it from play.  Multiple jumps are possible.  The sheep cannot capture but must try to crowd the wolf so that it cannot move, either with white marbles or against the edge of the board.  If the sheep trap the wolf, they win.  If the wolf can no longer be trapped, he wins.<br/><br/>This is a variant of Fox and Geese.<br/><br/>",

A score pad is also provided.<br/><br/>On each turn a player rolls the dice and removes pegs based on the outcome, then tries to remove as many more pegs as possible by jumping as in Checkers or Solitaire puzzles.  When no more moves are possible, the score is tallied exactly as in real bowling games.  A second roll of the dice is then allowed, to attempt to remove any pegs remaining.  The next player then resets the pegs and takes his turn.<br/><br/>Rolling a double on the first dice throw is a strike, rolling a double on the second throw is a spare.  Players track their scores in a regular bowling score format, with the winner being the player scoring the highest number of points in ten frames.<br/><br/>",

The object of the four player game is to be the first to move one's Lion and Mouse pieces from their color's Start space to the corresponding Lion's Den space. In the two player game, each player controls two colors and must move both of their Lion and Mouse pieces to the appropriate dens.<br/><br/>Each piece has unique traits: the Hunter can &quot;trap&quot; (lock down) a Mouse or send a Lion back to its Start space; the Mouse can free a Lion from a trap; the Lion can send a Hunter back to its start space from outside a trap space. The spinner determines which piece may move, though some spinner spaces permit the player to choose.<br/><br/>",

A secondary object is to &quot;win&quot; the game by either controlling the entire city and forcing the other players out of the game or possess the most cash value at the end of an agreed on time period - 60 minutes, 90 minutes or whatever.<br/><br/>To start the game everyone begins at Independence Hall and receives $1776.00. Players take turns in order moving the allotted number of spaces (dice roll) in a clockwise direction around the board. If a player lands on a property with special instructions, they must be followed. If the player lands on an unowned property, it may be purchased. If the player lands on a property owned by another player, then rent must be collected. If the player lands on a property they already own, that player than receives rent from the bank. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again. A second roll of doubles send that player to the Roundhouse.<br/><br/>A player may sell any properties they own to any other player at any time during the game. The bank is forces to buy back any property a player choose at 67% of the original cost. The rent of each property is 10% of its original cost. If a players owns two properties of a kind (for example the Art Museum and the Academy of Music - cultural institutions) the rent is doubled. If a player owns three properties the rent is tripled. A player may not collect any rents while his pawn is at the Roundhouse or on the Expressway.<br/><br/>Whenever a player rolls a &quot;one&quot; that player gets to draw a Travel card. Whenever a player rolls a &quot;six&quot; that player gets to draw a News card. If a player rolls both a &quot;one&quot; and a &quot;six&quot; on the same roll that player can select either type of card, but not both. If double &quot;ones&quot; or &quot;sixes&quot; are rolled, that player draws nothing. When a player ends their turn on a block marked &quot;Travel Card&quot; or &quot;News Card&quot; that player draws the appropriate card. A player that ends their turn on either the Free Library or Franklin Institute gets to answer a Quiz card drawn by the player on their left. The &quot;correct&quot; answers to the Quiz cards are left to the discretion of the game players.<br/><br/>",

Several segments of the race track have special rules, like the results of the die counting double or half.

The red spurt cards allow the car to advance from a space with a yellow arrow to the next space with a red tableau. The green attack cards allow a car to exchange it's positon with any one opponent on the throw of an even number. But beware: If the die shows an odd number, the car remains on it's position and doesn't advance at all.<br/><br/>",

The board is divided into three 3x3 sections, with each player claiming one side and the central territory in dispute.  Three each of a player's &quot;spots&quot; are marked with either the number one, two, or three.  The game begins with the three spots in the row closest to the players, the two spots in the next row inward, and the one spots in the next row.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving one piece at a time and try to claim the central area or prevent their opponent from doing so.  All spots move only forward.  One spots move one square diagonally.  Two spots move two squares directly forward.  Three spots move either two squares forward and one square sideways, or one square sideways and two squares forward.<br/><br/>Capture of pieces is by displacement and there are a number of rules governing it.  To win the game, a player must occupy five squares of the central area, or block his opponent from moving, or reduce his opponent to less than five pieces.<br/><br/>",

Some squares are marked with a circle in one of eight colors; these squares form diagonal lines crossing the board from corner to corner and side to side.

The game includes 154 square tiles: 15 red, 25 orange, 35 yellow, 35 green, 25 blue, 15 violet, and 4 &quot;stopper&quot; tiles, which are half black and half color.  Racks are included for each player.<br/><br/>The tiles are placed face down in a &quot;pool.&quot;  Each player draws seven tiles to make his &quot;hand,&quot; and will continuously draw again to maintain a hand of seven.  Players begin placing their tiles on the board, attempting to make &quot;sequences&quot; of colors.  The rules provide for a number of these, including a rainbow sequence, a hot spectrum sequence, a cold spectrum sequence, and more.  These sequences incorporate the existing colors of the board and are governed by still more rules.<br/><br/>Different levels of points are scored for each sequence as players complete their turns.  Play continues until no more sequences are possible; the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Games provide a good alternative, but in most &quot;educational&quot; games, the learning comes slowly as players must wait their turn to get a question and rarely get the same question twice in the same game.<br/><br/>In State Master, all players participate in every turn, so everyone is learning and testing their knowledge constantly. Player who get the wrong answer take a quick moment to study all six facts on the state card and then try to get the same card the next turn, immediately putting their new knowledge to use.<br/><br/>State Master is fun for all ages and its a game in which younger players can often beat older players as they tend to be better at retaining facts.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t================ HOW TO PLAY<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t================NUMBER OF PLAYERS<br/>2 to 6<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>Finish the game with the most cards.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>50 State Cards<br/>6 Colored Dice<br/>1 Category Die<br/>1 Map Card<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Shuffle State Cards.<br/>Place 5 State Cards on the table with the flag side up for each player in the game: 10 cards if there are 2 players, 15 cards if there are 3 players, etc.<br/>Place the Blank Map face up on the table.<br/>Place the Filled Map face down on the table.<br/>Each player chooses a colored die.<br/><br/>ROUND PLAY<br/>Each player rolls his/her die to decide who will be Player 1 for Round 1.<br/>Player 1 puts his/her die on top of one of the State Cards.<br/>Moving clockwise, each player puts his/her die on of a different State Card.<br/>Player 1 then rolls the Category Die.<br/>Each player, starting with Player 1 and moving clockwise, must then say the correct answer for his/her chosen state for the category shown.

Their fission powered Skimmers speed along future highways ramming each other and firing dangerous energy weapons to try and secure a win in the controversial Light-Speed Cup. When the race starts the clock starts and players have until the time runs out to wipe their opponents off of the track. They can aggressively pursue the other racers and try to destroy them, they can speed ahead and try to force the other vehicle off of the end of track or they can duck and dodge allowing the other Skimmers to tear each other apart before speeding home to victory. Which ever player&rsquo;s Skimmer is in the best condition when the clock reaches zero wins the Cup. This game is a thrill packed adrenaline ride where mayhem reigns and there is never a dull moment!The LSC moto is Action Not Protraction!<br/><br/>This games puts 2-6 players in control of one Skimmer (futuristic race car) each. They race each other along an never ending  treadmil like race track that is made out of 4 rolling tiles. When the race starts an electronic timer is started, it has between 10 and 15 minutes on it per player, and when the timer runs out and the buzzer souds the game is over. Durring the game players have to ram and shoot at each other to try and destroy the enemy skimmers before the timer runs out. Each skimmer has different strengths and weaknesses and players get to choose their own drivers which also have unique talents. There is another way of destroy other skimmers and that is to get so far ahead of them that when the track is rolled they fall off of the back of it. In this way the lightly amoiured fast skimmers can win the game aswell.<br/><br/>",

An adjective card (e.g. Lasting, Sustainable, Lucrative) is drawn each round that the players must use in conjunction with their fact cards to construct an argument. A Judge decides the winning argument using his own criteria. The player with the winning argument wins the round, and the first player to win three rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>Challenge and Persuade is a fun and social card game that challenges players to think about the choices we have in balancing our need for water and energy with the challenge of minimizing climate change.<br/><br/>Smart!<br/>Through play, this game teaches fundamental knowledge about our environment, challenges players&rsquo; understanding of facts, and guides players to construct solid and convincing arguments. Challenge and Persuade teaches concepts and strengthens communication strategies required to engage in scientific discussions concerning our world today. Developed with a team of experienced scientists, gamers, and educators, Challenge and Persuade is aligned to national science standards and may be used in a variety of science, government and policy courses.<br/><br/>Fun!<br/>This game, developed with teenagers and adults in mind, is engaging and stimulating for a wide range of ages. The game can quickly turn into a lively discussion involving current topics on water, energy, and climate.<br/><br/>Social!<br/>Challenge and Persuade is an intensely interactive game in which players either act as Presenter or Judge. The presenters draw fact cards and construct convincing arguments to present to the judge. While the judge decides which argument is strongest, any player may challenge an argument!<br/><br/>",

This is the bonus card.<br/><br/>Players may draw 1 FB card per turn from the deck or the discard pile. They then check their FB cards for 3 of a kind and place them face down on the table. The player then draws a MV card, and follows what it says. It can either affect your hand's value or have you draw another FB or MV card.<br/><br/>When a player has no more FB cards in hand, that player gets a $150,000 bonus and the bonus card is revealed. If a player has a card that matches the bonus in hand, that player receives a $250,000 bonus. The other cards on the table are then scored.

Each player controls a space refinery and four repulse cruisers. A turn consists of moving a piece one space in any direction, jumping a cruiser in or out of hyperspace (off the board; jumping in allows the cruiser to go to any space), or firing a cruiser's repulsion beam at an asteroid. The beam causes the asteroid to move away from the cruiser; ideally the player's space refinery is on the other side of the asteroid, allowing it to be captured. The player who manages to capture three of the six asteroids wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The cosmic forces of intuition and chance meet head on with the powers of observation and logic in this multilevel game for two players. Like the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, each players seeks to build and possess a pyramid by stacking cards drawn from the special 92-card deck. Until the last card is played, you will be hanging on the edge of your throne.<br/><br/>Description:<br/><br/>Pyramad is played on a 6x6 square grid using 92 square cards. Each card shows a pattern of four squares colored red, blue, or white; red and blue are the players' colors and white is neutral.<br/><br/>On a turn a player either draws a card or plays a card (playing is required if a player has five cards in hand). A card can be played on an empty space or on the intersection of four cards, but the latter play can only be made if the intersection has fewer than three squares of the opponent's color.<br/><br/>The object is to either place the single card on the sixth level of the pyramid or make it impossible for your opponent to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monster Breeder is a fast paced worker placement game with a bluffing element. This game is tiny (in its simplest form the game consists of 2 cards and a dollar's worth of pocket change).<br/><br/>In this game, each player takes on the role of one of over 30 different bosses. Each boss has its own unique combination of monsters that it can summon and/or spells that it can cast. In this game, all of the monsters are represented by coins. Pennies are the smallest monsters, nickels are bigger, dimes are bigger still, and quarters are the most powerful monsters that can be summoned.<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player selects a boss card to use and takes 3 pennies as starting monsters. The game consists of 5 rounds. On each round, players will simultaneously place their coins. They can create new monster and/or cast spells by placing coins on their boss card. They can attack other players by placing coins face-up next to their boss card or defend by placing coins tails-up next to boss card. At the end of the 5th round, each player adds up the points for his/her monsters (pennies are worth 1 point each, bigger monsters are worth more). The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>There are over 5 different modes of play. Some modes (free expansion rules) will accommodate 3, or 4 players. Free Print and Play version available!<br/><br/>",

Give that player the Sultan pawn, the Sultan cards, and the dice.<br/><br/>(Play) Summarized From the Box Top:<br/>The Sultan, using the dice, adds 10 jewels of the rolled color into a single pile for that round. The Sultan then divides the pile in any manner they choose among each of the players, so long as each player pile contains at least one item. Finally the sultan secretly determines which color will score at the end of the given round using the Sultan cards.

Within the card desk, there are 16 cards that contain NO questions. These cards have some strange characters that will give instructions that MUST BE FOLLOWED, some will help you, others will definitely not.<br/><br/>It is basically a trivia game. At the start of the game you start with 544 dollars (yes, 544) you then put 100 dollars in the pot. The first player rolls the dreidel (yup, it's a dreidel with numbers on it). The spinner then gets asked 3 questions, each one harder than the last. For each one they get right, they get money out of the pot corresponding to the amount shown on the card for the question. If they get it wrong, they pay the amount shown on the card to the pot. When the pot is empty, the game is over. The most dollars at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Will you bribe to politicians to control the crime underworld? Will you become into the new &quot;Capo di tutti capi&quot; by controlling the streets and the monopolizing the smuggling rings? or will you do it controlling the unions?

Por si fuera poco, las otras familias de la mafia luchar&aacute;n por el control del crimen en la ciudad y no estar&aacute;n demasiado dispuestas a compartir el pastel.<br/>La mec&aacute;nica de Broad City Affairs se basa en el control de zonas y la colocaci&oacute;n de trabajadores obligando a un alto nivel de interacci&oacute;n entre los jugadores y permitiendo que cada jugador defienda sus negocios y estorbe a sus oponentes.<br/><br/>Las partidas duran aproximadamente 90 minutos y presentan muchas opciones para alzarse con el triunfo. &iquest;Te har&aacute;s con el control del mundo del crimen por medio de los sobornos a los pol&iacute;ticos? &iquest;Ser&aacute; el control de las calles y el monopolio de las redes de contrabando los que te convertir&aacute;n en el nuevo Capo di tutti capi? &iquest;O tal vez lo har&aacute; tu mano de hierro sobre los sindicatos?

All players then use their own deck of 30 cards (28 bidding cards and 2 blocking cards) to win as many of the six dice as possible by placing one card next to each die.<br/><br/>The highest bidding card for each die wins that die and its points, unless someone plays a blocking card for that die.  A blocking card blocks ALL players from winning the die, including the person who played the blocking card. Used cards must be discarded at the end of each round.<br/><br/>If a player wins a &ldquo;TRIPLE&rdquo; (a group of any 3 dice) in a single round of play, they get to roll 1, 2, or 3 of the black dice for additional bonus points, depending on the numbers on the three dice in their TRIPLE.  Roll 1 bonus die for a BASIC TRIPLE (any three numbers), 2 dice for a STRAIGHT TRIPLE (numbers in sequence), and 3 dice for a THREE-OF-A-KIND TRIPLE (all the same number).<br/><br/>The player or team with the highest score after all five rounds of play (when all cards have been used) wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Lantry and Andrea Sfiligoi.<br/><br/>As with Songs of Blades and Glory, it uses an action-point system that requires no book-keeping. The rules are designed to be simple, fast and fun so that a mini campaign of several games can be played in a single evening.<br/><br/>The Basic Game follows closely to the SoBG model, i.e., the game includes statistics for 180+ monsters and heroes, and details to be able to create your own. Also there are campaign rules where your warband grows more powerful after every battle, and six basic scenarios.<br/><br/>Advanced Rules include the use of an expandable and customizable deck of cards used fro initiative, environmental effects, defence and building a result into historic proportions.<br/><br/>The game offers co-operative and competitive play Adventures, and can be played in 15mm and 28mm.<br/><br/>Funding for this Kickstarter project was canceled by the project creator on May 30 2014.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Investars is a collaborative game, where players work together to collectively achieve Big Goals, accumulate money in their retirement savings account, use their individual salaries to Invest in companies, and try to get all their pieces back Home to retire and win.<br/><br/>Investars is played in rounds, each simulating a decade in your life.  The team starts in their 20s with a salary, multiple Stock Tokens to invest in companies, and empty savings accounts.  Every round starts with paying salaries, doubling the value of each savings account, and rolling the dice to find which companies pay off investments - or potentially go out of business. If companies go out of business, their tiles are removed from the game, potentially blocking players' paths to the Big Goals and Home. Then, it is the team&rsquo;s turn, and each player makes several actions toward winning the game: Move, Invest, Achieve, Save, or Withdraw.<br/><br/>With good planning, lots of teamwork, and a bit of luck, players will achieve their Big Goals and retire in style as successful Investars!<br/><br/>As a bonus, while you're having fun playing Investars, you'll also learn a bit about compound interest, savings accounts, and planning for long-term goals. In short, you'll learn how to be better investors!<br/><br/>",

Faced by tough competition and a lack of good management, there's a risk of business going bankrupt. It's up to you to take up this challenge and save this family business.<br/><br/>Salt Merchant is a card game of business, luck, math and strategy. Each player becomes a salt merchant and tries to outplay other players and become the first to set up the maximum number of salt manufacturing factories and hence earn maximum money. Your challenges are to acquire good labor and factories, dig more salt water wells, and automate your factories. There's tough competition, too, so you have to be smart, make the right moves, and set-up factories of all different types if you want to regain lost glory.<br/><br/>",

Its thoughtful pace is great for bringing young and old minds together and its universal appeal transcends language and culture.<br/><br/>Twizmo! is all about creating sets of three matching icons.  Players take turns twisting the cube, with the goal of creating &ldquo;three-in-a row&rdquo; groups of similar icons on the top panel.  A &ldquo;3-in-a-row&rdquo; set on the cube allows a player to collect all of the visible cards with the matching icon.<br/><br/>When players have collected 3 cards with the same icon, they may turn that set face down; that card set is &ldquo;closed&rdquo; and cannot be taken by another player.<br/><br/>To win the game, collect the most card sets, or at any time during the game, collect a set of all nine matching cards for an instant win!<br/><br/>",

The two board games are distinct, different, and have different rules. The two board games can be united together and played following the instructions as &quot;The Deluxe Game&quot; or &quot;Super KGB&quot;.<br/><br/>In &quot;Project CIA: the secret formula&quot;, 17 envelopes are scattered in designated spots on the board game. One of the 17 envelopes has the secret formula. By rolling the dice, players move around the board game and as they pass over the positions where the envelopes are, they pick up the tile and see if it has the secret formula printed on the bottom of the tile. The winner of the game is the one that exits the board game from one of its four entrance/exit gates.<br/><br/>There is a clear moving piece representing a security guard that moves around from one room to another room. If a player finds himself inside a room with the security guard, he/she has one turn to exit the room.<br/><br/>In Game 2, you're either an agent trying to identify the double agent, or you're the latter, sabotaging the training camp. Deception and deduction will keep you scrambling!<br/><br/>Super KGB is what you get when you combine both games 1 and 2. Waddingtons included extra pieces in both sets so you could play a Deluxe version of either game using both boards. Super KGB can be played by up to six, whereas the component games are limited to four.<br/><br/>This is the version from Waddington's with both games in one box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Humanity finally left the safety of Earth to settle, terraform, and extend their dominion to the other celestial bodies of the Sol system. Aided by the Maanen drive, which allows ships to travel exponentially faster between planetary bodies, and humanity's never-ending push for autonomy, the colonies soon became independent planets. In the ensuing wars, both cold and hot, two powers rose to dominance: the Republic of Mars and United Terra. The political and military impasse has existed for much of the majority of the citizens of the system...<br/><br/>Sol Rising focuses on the conflicts, big and small, of the Sol system primarily involving United Terra and the Martian Republic. You are a Fleet Commander put in charge of the squadrons of your star system. How will you perform your duty when war comes to the Sol system?<br/><br/>Instead of being tasked with merely destroying the enemy every time, every mission is crafted to have unique experiences and objectives. These include things like capturing the enemy space station with marines, escorting a merchant to safety so he can warn the fleet at the next mission, stealthily avoiding detection to plant rebels on an enemy moon, and more. In some missions, your accomplishments and choices will affect the next, triggering ripple effects that make your play through the campaign unique.<br/><br/>In Scenario Play, the players will participate in a single scenario pitting one side against another; the winner is determined by victory conditions set by the scenario (ex. the scenario gives the attacking side the mission of wiping out their opponent and to minimize casualties as much as possible, while the other side is trying to get a specific ship to escape the sector and then to take out as many of the attacker&rsquo;s ships as possible).<br/><br/>Players in a Campaign game participate in a number of scenarios, each having an effect on the next as the story unfolds; the winner of one scenario will have a better starting position in the next (although care has been taken to ensure there will not be a runaway conquest because of this) and the ultimate victory condition is to win the final scenario in the campaign (if the example scenario above was used as a part of a campaign, the second scenario would change based on the outcome of the first; the number of ships the attacker gets and their starting status in scenario two is determined by the ending of scenario one, and if the defender managed to get their special ship out of the sector they get to choose the starting locations of their ships, rather than using a predefined, unorganized starting layout).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Macysburg , a Command and Maneuver scenario, portrays a meeting engagement between two well-matched armies converging on a town that&rsquo;s important as both supply point and road junction. Two players maneuver armies composed of units representing infantry, cavalry, cannon, skirmishers, and leaders, to capture and hold Macysburg, and chase off or destroy the opposing army. The battle lasts for 3 days, 36 day turns divided by 2 night turns.  Units arrive at diverse points on the field during the first 2 days. At night, the armies separate and rally some of the units lost each day.<br/><br/>Command and Maneuver is a simple abstract strategy rules set that allows very rules-light wargames to be constructed.  But as Macysburg demonstrates, it does not necessarily mean a light wargame. By abstracting all of the &ldquo;fiddly bits&rdquo; of wargames, what gets represented are the basic ideas of command control, supply, and maneuver to obtain both strategic and tactical advantage over your opponent. Since all combat is deterministic, players aren&rsquo;t trying to overcome the randomness of combat results tables or dice towers or card draws. But they are trying to overcome chaos created by the combination of the combat and leader rules, which often result in units being out of command.<br/><br/>Armies are fragile in this game, and they &ldquo;feel&rdquo; that way. Combat is very bloody and unforgiving. If you are not careful in your dispositions and advances, you can lose a major chunk of your army in a very few turns, without adequate compensation. Players quickly find themselves adopting combined arms tactics and using formations and units in ways that look very much like standard tactics of the era. By doing things very differently than most wargames, the CaM games tease out and examine different aspects of war.<br/><br/>Macysburg, an abstract riff on the Battle of Gettysburg, is just one of the scenarios you can build with the CaM package, available in a Print and Play and in a Vassal version. The terrain (woods, hills, and town squares) is movable, allowing for a different set-up of the game each time. The elements of the scenario are broken down, laid out, and discussed for players to see how the scenario is constructed and how to vary it. Other scenarios are available and more will be provided. Players are encouraged to experiment with the system.<br/><br/>",

It is similar to both Othello and Go.<br/><br/>Players first take turns placing starter tiles (coins) on the game board. Then, they draw a hand of 3 coins, each having a different ability defined by the arrows on the coin. Placing a coin points to one or more other coins not owned by the player, and that player lays claim to those coins by placing a colored token on them. On subsequent turns, claimed coins change hands.<br/><br/>Once a coin is completely surrounded either by other coins or the edge of the board, it is captured by the last player to successfully claim it. This means a coin captured on your turn could go to an opponent.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of the spaces have been filled with coins, and all of the coins have been captured. Each coin has a number on it, add those up and the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Battles that the 08th had paid for in blood against the CEF over thirty cycles ago and now the enemy had returned. Corporal Vandenbosche gripped the control sticks on either side of him in the dark cockpit of his Koala. Anger welled up inside of him as he thought of the loss of his family in the orbital bombardments dropped so casually on his home town.<br/><br/>Today, he would repay the invaders for their crimes. His regiment would drop from the skies and rain hell on the enemy. Looking through his gear's omni-camera, Vandenbosche saw the green light and his squadron commander readying himself to jump from their Orca transport. As Sergeant Mason engaged his gear's SMS and leaped out of the open bay door, he called over the radio, &quot;Boys, I'll meet ya on the ground.

The players take on the roles of noble lines during the Swedish Empire Era. Together, they will populate the kingdom, build ships for overseas trade, build armies for overseas war and build forts for defending the gains. Instead of fighting each other, they will have to fight the enemies around the Baltic Sea, competing for the same provinces. However, the best for the kingdom is not necessarily the best for your noble line. You have to decide what benefits you most: production or trade, consolidation or expansion, war or peace. But will your objectives coincide with your opponents' objectives? Beware, if you fight internally, your external enemies will conquer the entire kingdom and put an end to both the Swedish Empire Era and the game!<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include<br/><br/>1. Player balance: The players have a limited number of units, preventing one from growing too strong. <br/>2. Game balance: The rate that the enemies grow is related both to the number of players and to their current strength, preventing them from getting too strong or too weak. <br/>3. Production vs Trade vs War balance: The players may choose different strategies for growing and one strategy chosen will bring negative effects to the other strategies. <br/>4. Cooperation: The players build fleets, armies and forts together and they also fight battles together. <br/>5. Prisoners' dilemma. One player may benefit by not cooperating but if all do so, all will lose.<br/><br/>",

Doing so allows you to expend resources in order to add buildings, statuary, bill boards, and groups throughout the city. These installations expand your influence, giving you control of city sectors.<br/><br/>The first player to control a predetermined number of city sectors wins the game.<br/><br/>ENACTING AGENDA<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player selects a faction-oriented Agenda Card to put into play. This is called enacting an agenda.<br/><br/>Agenda Cards list five different types of Missions your agents must complete. Once they have completed three or more different missions from the list, the agenda is considered realized, and you are awarded a specified number of Influence Points. These points can then be spent on placing installations on the game board.<br/><br/>COMPLETING MISSIONS<br/><br/>Mission Cards list five different types of Actions our agents must complete while in neutral- or enemy-controlled locations. Once three or more different actions from the list are completed, the mission is completed. You gain the listed benefits from the mission, and the Mission Card is then placed face-up under the Agenda Card (for scorekeeping purposes).<br/><br/>COMPLETING ACTIONS<br/><br/>Each agent in the game has a primary function; such as: eliminating, seducing, capturing, corrupting, or turning enemy agents. To perform its function, an agent must be in a city sector, or sector location, that contains a keyword matching the same keyword on the agent's card.<br/><br/>CyberPsi utilizes polyhedron. An action attempt may require you to roll 1d4 or 1d12 to determine how many Action Points an agent musters when attempting the action. Asset Cards that are equipped to the agent sometimes adds to an action attempt's Action Point total.<br/><br/>Thus, a Rank 1 Hacker in a location with the keyword INTERFACE may try to &quot;Steal (1) Data Card from target enemy Database.&quot; The Action Point Value needed to successfully perform this action is (12). In order to be able to reach this, you roll 1d8 (as indicated on his card) and add (2) Action Points provided by his &quot;Jac-in-Boxx&quot; Asset Card and (1d4) Action Points provided by his &quot;Virtualization Headgear&quot; Asset Card. The total number of Action Points your Hacker gets is (13), which exceeds the target value of (12). Thus, the action attempt is successful, and your agents enables you to take anyone Data Card from the target player's Database.<br/><br/>RESOURCES<br/><br/>During the course of the game, you will assign agents to undertake activities that generate resources. You can then expend these resources to put other agents into play, to buy Asset Cards, and to unlock cards that can be placed into your draw deck.<br/><br/>COMBAT<br/><br/>Combat in CyberPsi is resolved by rolling each combatant's die type (d4, d6, d8, etc), adding any modifiers provided by Asset Cards, and comparing the results to each other. Damage is determined and applied, and the battle continues or ends, depending on combat situational factors.<br/><br/>Some agents have Combat Abilities that impact attack order, targeting, and damage.<br/><br/>",

Carefully researched, tested, trialled and refined, TAOC Christian offers new angles and avenues to think about, and discuss, Christian faith and life.<br/><br/>Louise Howland and Keith Lamb, authors of the original best-selling titles, TAOC The Art of Conversation, have collaborated for this special edition with Ross and Suzette Bowerman.<br/><br/>With 300 Christian Communication-builders ranging from the profound to the light-hearted, plus a comprehensive Christian Communication Guidebook, TAOC makes it easy to share and discuss feelings, ideas and experiences related to faith and religious living in a harmonious way.<br/><br/>Like all TAOC editions, it&rsquo;s not a quiz &ndash; and whilst there are myriad of opportunities to learn, it&rsquo;s never about who knows the most. Rather, it&rsquo;s a communication tool that draws on personal experiences, thoughts and reactions to facilitate fascinating discussions and new insights. It also encourages clear communication and respectful listening.<br/><br/>TAOC is a handy icebreaker when a new group of people come together and helps people who already know each other take their relationships to new levels. Ideal for small groups, bible study, fellowship, education and the home, TAOC can be played by family, friends, workmates, students or even solitary players. TAOC is suitable for players aged from four to 104.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To the Ends of the Earth is a fully-cooperative adventure game based on the 1930's adventure serials. Players take on the roles of intrepid explorers traversing the globe in search of ancient artifacts while trying to outwit and outrun enemy agents.<br/><br/>The game begins with the players choosing a mythical artifact, which will serve as the McGuffin for the game. Each artifact will have a series of clues that are distributed around the world.<br/>Clues take several forms: They can be excavation sites, scraps of historical documents, ancient relics, or even people who may be able to help the players deduce the location of the artifact. Each clue that is collected brings the players on step closer to discovering the artifact&rsquo;s final resting place. Players will have to act fast as enemy agents (controlled by the game) will be hot on their heels collecting clues and setting ambushes at every turn!<br/><br/>Combat in EotE takes the form of action sequences, or confrontations with the enemy villain that happen periodically throughout the game. Players work together to defeat enemy minions by using their weapons, special abilities, teamwork, and most importantly, the environment around them. Furniture such as crates, explosive barrels, tables, and even bottles of whiskey can be used and manipulated by the players to give them the upper hand in any battle. Find yourself staring down the barrel of a Tommy Gun? Flip over the nearest table for cover! Cornered by a band of hired muscle? Grab the nearest whiskey bottle, set it alight, and toss it at an explosive crate to create the perfect getaway!<br/><br/>To the Ends of the Earth is the board game where you, the players, truly determine the course of your adventure! Fight vigilantly to defeat the enemy villain, recover the artifact, and win the game!<br/><br/>EotE features a unique Action Dice allocation system to determine the options available to each player during their turn. Each player will choose an adventurer to control for the duration of the game. Each adventurer has three &quot;stats&quot;, which determine their proficiency for different tasks:<br/><br/>Brawn determines a character&rsquo;s Strength, Speed, and Endurance, and is used for physical tasks such as brawling, climbing, or using melee weapons.<br/><br/>Skill describes a character&rsquo;s Dexterity, Coordination, and Awareness. Using firearms, disarming traps, and driving vehicles are made much easier with a high Skill Stat.<br/><br/>Wits relates to a character&rsquo;s Intelligence, Problem-Solving, and Inter-Personal skills. A high Wits Stat is needed to conduct research, excavate dig sites, or issue commands to allies and other characters.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, a player will roll their available Action Dice (five six-sided dice if their character is healthy). Each die rolled below a Stat may be used for an action that requires that Stat.<br/><br/>Actions include movement, researching artifacts, brawling with enemies, using firearms, or manipulating the environment. Special abilities and equipment broaden the choices available to each player, and with so much potential to strategize, there is never a &lsquo;bad roll&rsquo;. Every action you take will have consequences that ripple through the rest of the game, creating a unique adventure each time you play!<br/><br/>",

Acquire Spirit Points to win! Defend yourself with the help of Angels! Demolish your opponents with twelve different Demons.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with an equal number of Character Cards, 4 Orb Cards, 1 Angel and 1 Demon. The board is set with 5 Orb Cards to draw from, and the rest of the Orb Cards are placed to the left of the pool. There are Black, Red, Blue White, Green and WILD Orb Cards. Black &amp; Red Orbs can be used to purchase Demons. Blue &amp; White Orbs can be used to purchase Angels. Green Orbs are used to by Action Cards, and a combination of all 5 colors gets you a Gate Key.<br/><br/>On a players turn, they may choose to do one of the following actions: 1) pulling Orb Cards 2) spend Orb Cards 3) Attack a player<br/><br/>You obtain Spirit Points by: Purchasing Angels and Demons, going through Gates using Gate Keys and White Orbs, buying Action Cards (some of them are just Spirit Points), or Battling other players!<br/><br/>In a battle, the attacking player uses their Demon Cards and the defending player uses their Angel Cards. Each player starts with 10 hit points. Players take turns rolling dice to try and damage the other player. 5's and 6's are hits wile 1-4 miss. Angel and Demon Cards consist of either Battle Cards that last for the entire battle (i.e. Armored Angel - You cannot be hit by 5's) or Attack Cards that are played before a player rolls the dice (i.e. Fire Demon - On your next roll, 6'd hit for 2 damage). The first player to bring their opponent to zero Hit Points wins.<br/><br/>Finally, the Character Cards in the game all give slight advantages and manipulate all of the mechanics listed above!<br/> Now...Bow your head, say your prayers, and prepare for Spiritual Warfare!<br/><br/>",

They'll have to distribute their forces all over the world, conquer the production places of drugs (for example: Colombia or Afghanistan) and the markets (cities like Los Angeles, Amsterdam or Tokio), organizing the flow of 4 kinds of substances that have different perks. This way players will gain soldiers that can be used to attack or defend; cooperation is acceptable, regulated and sometimes very useful. There are also cards to be drawn at each turn, inspired by historical or fictitious events related to the criminal world. They can have good or bad effects, and often there are choices to be made.<br/><br/>The goal is known at the beginning of the game, when each player draws a goal card (all different but balanced) that has to remain secret until the conditions of victory are fulfilled. There's also a semi-randomized countdown towards legalization: an event that in our point of view (and according to the ideas of many economists) would terminate the business of Cartels. When this happens (after 2-3 hours, according to the players' choices) the game is over and victory is assigned by points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Let's Go To College game employs a gambling technique, with chips, to allow players to complete courses as a freshman, a sophomore, a junior, and a senior. Prentice employed illustrators to produce bright graphics in his games and utilized high quality materials as well.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>SETTING UP THE GAME. The playing board with the colored chart is placed in the center of the table. The playing cards are lined up with the four packs of picture cards, face up, on one side of the playing board. They should be in this order: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior. On the other side of the board the four packs of Fun, Sports, Re-Exam and Flunk cards should be placed with these words up. The chips are divided among the players so that each has an equal amount of l's, 2's, 3's, 5's and 10's.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME. The player on the left of the host plays first As a Freshman entering I. O. U., he stands up each time he plays. If he fails to remember this, he must draw a Flunk card as a penalty, altnougn he does not miss his turn. He pays 5 chips, registration fee, to the business office. He then rolls the dice on the playing board as he tries to pass his first course. Only the dice which remain on the board alter rolling , may be counted, using only the top numbers. He multiplies the dice total by ten to find his grade for the course. After rolling the dice, the player proceeds all follows: If, after multiplying, his grade comes to 120: he must pay 2 chips to petty expense, on the playing board, placing the chips so they do not interfere with the chart. If his grade is 110, he must pay 1 chip. This means he has tried too hard to pass. In either case he rolls the dice again, right away. If his grade is 100, 90, 80 or 70, he can draw the top Freshman Course card and keep it. He also must take or put chips into petty expense as indicated opposite his grade on the chart. If there are not enough chips to take, he is out of luck, and can take only what is there. This happens quite frequently throughout the game. If his grade is 60, 50 or 40, he must place on playing board the indicated number of &quot;put&quot; chips. He then has his choice of drawing a Fun, Sport or Re-Exam card. He must read his card aloud and after fulfilling the duties, he returns it to the bottom of the same pack. <br/>If his grade is 30, 20 or 10, he must place on playing board the indicated number of &quot;put&quot; chips. He then has to take a Flunk card and follow its instructions before returning it to bottom of pack. If both dice roll off the playing board he receives a zero, and must place 15 chips on the board and draw a Flunk card. As soon as a player has completed his turn, the next player on his left rolls the dice to obtain his grade for his first Freshman course, and so on. To pass Freshman year and become a Sophomore, a player must hold two Freshman Course cards. The first to finish Freshman year receives all chips in Petty Expense. As soon as each player finishes his first year he must pay 5 chips, registration fee for Sophomore year, to the business office. Sophomore year is the same as Freshman year, only players may now be seated while playing. Sophomores must have two Soph Course cards before becoming Juniors. The first to finish receives all chips in petty expense. As soon as players finish Sophomore year they pay 5 chips, registration fee for Junior year, to the business office. Junior year proceeds the same as Sophomore year. The first to finish receives all chips in petty expense. As soon as a player gets two Junior Course cards he must pay 5 chips, registration fee for Senior year, to the business office. Seniors must obtain the usual two Senior Course cards before graduation. The first to finish Senior year receives all chips petty expense and IMMEDIATELY the game is ended.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game allows 2-4 players (2-6 with the Avant Garde expansion) to experience and survive the chaotic times of the French Revolution. This is the first of nine releases planned for a fun deck building that can all be connected to play as one game.<br/><br/>The Avant Europa series allows you to walk through important times in the history of France and other nations of Europe. Have your own shot at impacting history by making the choices that change it. Witness the events that shaped the national histories of that era, and try to survive them while building your own political Empire.<br/><br/>The Avant Europa - Liberte storyline represents the viewpoint of various small noble factions. Starting out with a small Commune you build up your connections and influences in Politics, Lands, Trade, Economics, Goods, and Military. The goal is to protect France from it's enemies (inside and out), but also to be the one player with the most Victory Points amassed at the end of the game. As your Empire of influence grows at some point you can end up commanding great influence and power across Revolutionary France.<br/><br/>Players begin with a standard deck of 8-10 cards - depending on if playing the basic, intermediate, or advanced rules.   The game runs from 12 turns (basic) to 28 turns (full version), divided into turns called &quot;Seasons&quot;. At the beginning of each Season players draw four cards into hand. Play continues in Rounds until all but the last player have used or played all of the cards in their hand. That player gets one last Round of play and the Season ends.<br/><br/>Each Season player initiative is important because being First Player to start a Season gives that player first go at available cards in the Commons to purchase. Like many deck-building games there is the typical 1-and-1 Round, where a player can play 1 Action and gets 1 additional choice (usually to Purchase cards from the Commons that get added to the owners discard - and thus eventually to the players hand).<br/><br/>In addition players can move cards to their Domain, which reflects their public face to the world.  Cards in Domain are not discarded until used and can be played as if from hand. Many give special abilities and benefits that increase a players ability to response to other players actions, increase income generated by other cards, have special means of defense, etc.  To add even more color to game play these Domains can come with Asset cards that are unique to the controlling player and provide political flavour of the times to expand the options of game play.<br/><br/>This game is a very diverse peek into the life and times of the people of the era's it represents. Actual historical personalities and figures of the Revolution are available as Allies, along with the actual historically political factions, organizations, and local government forces of the day.<br/><br/>Unique mechanics include the ability to Raise Funds that the player can add to their treasury to help purchase cards, make bribes, and pay off Tax collectors -- which were the common bane of public that lead to the Revolution.  Other unique mechanics include the ability to place Bribes on cards in Commons area, the ability to Power Block some cards to prevent others from using or getting them. Players can engage in gathering Goods that can be sold on the open market for increased income. Players have the option of building up basic militia forces to protect themselves against common Bandits or foreign powers, or to use their military to defend against other players once the anger of the French Revolution and civil conflict goes into full swing.<br/><br/>Every card in the game has two or more uses, which is what makes provides the plethora of strategic choices and card combinations. The game promises no two play sessions of this game will be exactly the same, and it is easy to see why given the options. The game will certainly appeal to veteran card fans of games like L5R or Magic who appreciate the artistic details. It will also appeal to players who have played out their copies of Dominion and want something far more immensely real then Ascension or Thunderstone.<br/><br/>There are many roads to Victory, largely based on the acquisition of certain key cards of value -- especially getting control of Cities and Ports of France. This can be done many ways,  through political underhanded activities, military force, or economic control. The person with the most Victory Points accumulated at games end determines the winner. However there are other ways to win the game outright, such as by getting three Historical Events into a players Domain.<br/><br/>The strategic depth of this unique deck-builder game surpasses anything you have played before.  With over 16 core strategies that you can pursue in combination to arrive at final victory, you will find yourself playing multiple times to figure out your own preferred winning combo.<br/><br/>This release Avant Europa - Liberte covers the period of the early French Revolution (1789 - 1793). More expansions are planned to follow, including three covering the rise of Napoleon, and three that cover the early years of French settlement in North America. The truly historical fans will be able to play all the released expansions modules in sequence from start to finish if they wish. You will be able to relive French History from 1600 to 1815.<br/><br/>Available expansions for this game include Avant Europa - Nationale (Age of Sail)which includes the years of trade and exploration before the Revolution (1760-1788).

They place them on the board on the 'PLACE ORDERS HERE' square for any of 12 different stocks.  There are 10 squares above and below this square and rolling the 3 special bakelite dice will tell you which stocks change value and whether they go up or down.  2 of the dice contain the names of the 12 companies on the game board and a 3rd dice has 3 'UP' and 3' DOWN' values.  Each roll will impact 2 companies and the UP/DOWN die will tell how much the value changes.  The player moves his marker up or down according to the roll of the dice.  When the marker get to the top or bottom of the board, you either win or lose depending on whether you chose LONG or SHORT for that stock.

        "description": "In 1936, the Universal Games Company of St. Louis, Mo. published the Mor-Fun Stock Exchange game. It was a bit out of the ordinary as the game board was made of 1/4&quot; thick pressed board stock and had a long heavy metal spinner that spun on bearings. The lowest cost 'Home Model' sold for $5, which was a lot for a game in the 1930s. By comparison, the very popular game of Monopoly retailed for $2.00.<br/><br/>There was no scrip or play money with the game, the only trading was done with stock shares. The players trade stocks; the amount traded and the profit is determined by spinning the metal spinner then throwing the dice.<br/><br/>Each player is assigned a player number and in turn is a 'buyer' and spins the indicator bar.  The player whose number the indicator lands on is the 'seller'.  The number of stock shares will be shown under the players number where the indicator stops.  The 'seller' then rolls the dice to determine the amount of profit the 'buyer' must pay for the stock shares. Multiply the number thrown on the dice by the number of shares to be transacted equals the amount of shares the 'buyer' must pay the 'seller'.<br/><br/>In addition, there are 'Futures', Margins', and the 'Pit' where players may be required to put shares of stock that can subsequently be won by any player as described in the rules.<br/><br/>The player who acquires the most stock at the end of the game wins.  A player who runs out of stocks is eliminated from the game and play continues to an agreed upon time.<br/><br/>There is no scrip or game money, all transactions are completed with shares of stock.<br/><br/>",

Astemaed, 12th Emperor of the greatest empire the world has ever seen, has died without an heir. By law, it falls on the senate to elect his successor. Very few candidates are worthy in the eyes of the senate. You are among them. Through strength, cunning and the power of your wealth, you must persuade the senate to your side and thwart your rivals' attempts to do the same.<br/><br/>No higher seat of power exists, no greater title than Emperor of Vistos. Who's coin shall ring the loudest? Who's might shall overcome? Who's knowledge shall prove greatest? The world watches and waits as you attempt... To Be Emperor.<br/><br/>To Be Emperor is a strategy card game of bidding and resource management. By winning bids on Assets, you gain the resources necessary to maintain Senators you have won to your side as well as to affect game play. By winning bids on Senators, you bring yourself closer to victory. The first player to have persuaded Senators to their side worth 10 or more Influence in the senate is the next Emperor of Vistos. Take care, though. Bid too greedily on senators or use up your resources with haste and you may find the Senators in your pocket seeking deeper pockets elsewhere.<br/><br/>In the files section are PDF and zip files with the rules and all the cards ready for print and play. You will only need to provide tokens (five per player, a different color for each player). All I ask is that you contact me with any constructive criticism and ideas, how many games you played, how many players and how long for each game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While Prof Von Neumann's Mechanikal Marvels may be much admired in academic circles, inside his lab it appears these clockwork amobeas are locked in a brutal struggle for survival!<br/><br/>This game is intended for small parties of up to 8, but the game achieves maximum cerebral satisfaction between a pair.<br/><br/>Each turn a player, gentlemen or lady, may place or move tiles that add to their amobea, strengthening, attacking or shielding it from the predations of others. If they were fortunate enough to have overlapped (and thus devoured) tiles of their opponent on the previous turn, their amobea's increased vitality is expressed by the placement (or movement) of extra tiles in this turn.<br/><br/>The game is simplicity itself, but brings to mind the mental challenge faced by two wrestlers of that delicate Oriental sport, Sumo.<br/><br/>",

They arrived and discovered an ancient alien warp gate floating amongst the chunks of ice that made up the planets' rings. The leaders of Earth activated the gate and sent expeditions to find out what was on the other side. The explorers returned and told tales of new worlds to discover, colonise and exploit.<br/><br/>It is now 2265 A.D and with the aid of the warp gate, humanity has spread out across the galaxy. <br/>You are the sole heir to the wealthy Star House of Tamlore. Your palace resides on a frozen world at the edge of the backwater kingdom of Galsia. You have lived a sheltered life knowing little of the wealth your father created by harvesting the Xerer&rsquo;s asteroid fields that dominate the planets skyline, and trading the goods the colonies that you govern have created. In an instant, you are thrust into a Universe full of danger and intrigue where you and your loyal protector Fenrix, barely escape with your lives following a devastating attack on your home world by the insidious Star House Greaver.<br/><br/>Now completely alone, you must set out to rebuild what you have lost, and seek your revenge<br/><br/>By using innovative board game mechanics The Space Merchant of Tamlore is the next evolution of adventure gaming!<br/><br/>",

The lawsuit brought forth by Harley Davidson in 1997 stopped all sale and production of the game (even though so few had been produced already, as they were only for sale at &quot;The Hog Farm&quot;) an appeal by the owner of the hog farm, Ronald GROTTANELLI, was partially overturned. it was found that The Hog Farm can use the term HOG, but cannot use it in conjunction with items such as this game, effectively ending this board games life span.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to collect nine t-shirt pieces. At the start of each his turn, the player has to answer a question read from a question card. If he answers correctly, he gets to roll a die and move his pawn the indicated number of spaces forward. If he lands on a t-shirt space corresponding to a t-shirt piece that he does not yet have, he gains that piece.<br/><br/>In addition to the t-shirt spaces, there are penalty spaces which will have some drawback. Among the question cards, there are bonus questions. When a player correctly answers a bonus question, he automatically advances to the next t-shirt space corresponding to a piece he does not yet have.<br/><br/>When a player has all nine pieces and passes the start/finish space, he wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There are 6 tile series with different pictures. 3 series of 16 tiles each (steamboat, wonder machine, sun flower), 2 series of 9 tiles each (flowers of the spring, bird), 1 series of 6 tiles (helicopter). The basic idea is that one tile of each series has the least amount of small details, another one the greatest amount of details (like with or without doorknow depicted, a bee with or without wings etc.). These cards must be sorted according to the amount of details picted from least to most in ascending order. A check is possible by turing the tiles around. On each tile back is one half of an animal or thing - horse, train car etc. If the cards are in correct order those halves match.<br/><br/>The rulebook suggests 3 games:<br/>1) Solo game: The solo player takes one or more tile series, shuffles them and must lay them in the correct order. <br/>2) Group game: The short helicopter series is done away with. Each player gets one tile series (well shuffled). Players start to put their series in order. The first player to do this wins - if he did correctly. This can be done with one round or in several rounds. If rounds are played the player who finishes first and has his order correct he gets victory points equal to the number of tiles in the series plus 5 extra points. The other players get one victory point for each tile that is in correct order. For the next round the series are shuffled again and each player gets another series than before.<br/>3) What is disappeared: A series is laid on the table in random order. The picture with the most details is laid in the middle. Players look out for the tile where just one little detail disappeared then the next one etc.<br/><br/>",

It was prophesied that Fenrir would one day devour Odin ushering in Ragnarok. Tyr the god of war took it upon himself to feed Fenrir while he was still a pup, but as time went on Fenrir grew larger as did the gods' fear of him. The gods then decided to bind the wolf with a fetter they called Leyding. The wolf easily broke free of his bonds. The gods then used another fetter called Dromi and once again to no avail. Receiving word of this Odin called upon the dwarves of Svartalfheim to fashion a fetter made up of six magic ingredients, they called this ribbon-like material Gleipnir.

        "description": "Double Check is a game of Checkers adapted for four players in teams of two.  It is played on a 14 x 14 square grid with nine squares of each corner removed, resulting in a cross-shaped checkered board.  The game is played on the dark squares only, and each wing of the board has twelve dark squares to host twelve pieces in their starting positions.  There are pieces of four colors: black, white, red, and green.  Each player chooses a partner and their own color, and sets up their pieces in starting positions opposite the board from each other.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board.<br/><br/>Players move their pieces and capture other players the same as in Checkers, moving only towards the opposite side of the board until their pieces can be crowned in their partner's home row, and moving in any direction after.  Only opponent's pieces may be jumped or captured.  Pieces cannot be crowned in opponent's home rows.  Movements are not otherwise restricted on any part of the board.  The team who eliminates their opponents' pieces, or prevents them from moving, wins the game.<br/><br/>There is one variant provided for in the game's rules, in which players are allowed to jump their partner's pieces without capturing them.<br/><br/>",

There are probably a number of reasons for this but the common perception, especially in the UK, that Great War battles were little more than exercises in mass slaughter ordered by remote and uncaring generals probably has much to do with the reluctance to game this period.<br/>These views are now being re-appraised by a fresh generation of historians and researchers who, without playing down the horrors of the trenches, the scale of the suffering or the terrible cost of a &quot;Big Push&quot;, are challenging many previously held ideas.<br/><br/>Flanders Fields is a set of rules which allows players to war game actions from Regiment (Brigade), to Divisional level actions from the war on the western front between 1914 and 1918.<br/><br/>The rules seek to provide an enjoyable gaming experience for all players, regardless of the final result. As such a degree of sportsmanship is necessary between players, it is perfectly acceptable to seek to slaughter the toy soldiers on the table top but in dealings with other players please maintain a degree of sportsmanship. In cases where the interpretation of a rule might be in doubt, for instance whether a unit is in or out of range let the roll of a die or toss of a coin decide.<br/>The rules are divided into four main sections<br/>A brief consideration of those aspects of the Great War which serve to distinguish it from previous and later conflicts.<br/>The main body of the rules.<br/>Generic tables of divisional organisation which may be used to pick forces for a game.<br/>A number of appendices providing extra information and examples.<br/><br/>",

Combat is generally not 'to the death', and fleets will usually withdraw if overmatched.<br/><br/>Combat is also very greatly influenced by political constraints and the consequent rules of engagement. Similarly, the loss of a capital ship is a major economic loss as it takes a year and a half to build a replacement, and it has significant credit value. (See the Macro Rules for the Humanity Will Prevail Campaign). Captains and admirals are schooled with the prevailing ethos &ndash; which is that if an enemy ship breaks off combat you let it go (after all, it might be you next time).<br/>Much of this was challenged during the Exterminator War &ndash; where the enemy was an implacable machine intelligence &ndash; so when fighting Exterminators the loss of ships is expected. However, that specific threat has now receded.<br/><br/>",

He must then throw successive sixes equal to the number of stack counters plus one.

Fleet of Battle is intended for use with fleets of between six and 20 ships per player with an optimum of a dozen or so for an evening&rsquo;s play. Larger battles can be fought without difficulty, but more than an evening should be set aside for such games.<br/><br/>There is no set ground scale or ship scale. The rules were devised for what felt right using 1:600 model ships. Fleets in classical times were very large, often several hundred ships strong, manned by tens of thousands.With this in mind it is suggested that historical scenarios should be fought using a ratio of one model to 10 - 20 ships.<br/><br/>If using 1:1200 scale models or smaller, use centimetres instead of inches.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The aim of these rules is to simulate combat in the period 1789-1815.<br/><br/>COURSE OF A GAME<br/>Each game is assumed to be one of the following formats<br/>a) Competitive - each player has a force which is balanced using a points system. The game commences with the opposing forces (starting on or off table) and advancing towards each other, with intent to give battle and destroy the opposing force. Starting with initial contacts from patrols and/or vanguards prompting their commanders to respond. The main forces are deployed in attempts to seize and/or maintain the initiative. Finally one force is defeated and the victors may attempt pursuit. The rules are primarily designed around this type of game.<br/>b) Scenario &ndash; each player has a force defined for the scenario which may be based on fictional or historical events. The objectives and victory conditions being defined by the scenario.<br/><br/>REPRESENTATIVE SCALES<br/>There are variable ground and troop scales to allow for varying sizes of engagements. So in effect the ground scale will vary from 1:2500 (i.e. 1mm on the table = 2.5m in life) to 1:30,000 (1mm = 30m). However in any game the ground and troop scales are directly proportionate to each other.<br/><br/>The game is broken into bounds of varying length. For game purposes these are expressed are periods of minutes. The activity of all troops within any bound is directly related to the time span of the bound. For example a five minute bound allows all troops to complete five minutes of activities. However a 500 minute bound allows all troops five hundred minutes of activities. The reason for the variability is to allow for those periods where little or no activity occurs to be passed over.<br/><br/>Troops are represented by figurines and or models based on varying size bases.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to explore the haunted mansion, uncovering rooms and searching for the hidden Treasure.  Along the way you&rsquo;ll make discoveries that can help you out and encounter ghosts that will deplete your courage or hinder your search.  Occasionally you may encounter a benevolent spirit that will help you along the way.  Be careful though, because if you get scared to death you&rsquo;ll become a ghost that can chase down your former friends!  You win the game by acquiring the Treasure and getting it out of the house.  The ghosts win if everyone in the house gets turned to a ghost.  You lose if you are a ghost and one or more players are able to make it out of the house with the Treasure.<br/><br/>",

In Robot Deputies in Outer Space, you are a robot competing to become the new sheriff in town. With the help of an assistant, robots work to collect batteries, a valuable commodity on the planet Scyprus. Batteries are traded to upgrade robot's software, weaponry and disguises. When a robot is equipped, they may choose to venture into space in pursuit of wanted criminals. Once an outlaw has been captured, deputies must decide to take the honest route and put the outlaw behind bars, or free the outlaw and collect bribe money. Taking bribes may allow for bigger upgrades to nail more notorious criminals, but the residents of Scyprus are watching. The deputy who makes the most impressive arrests will be elected Sheriff, while the remaining robots remain deputies.<br/><br/>Robot Deputies in Outer Space is a 2-4 player strategy/ worker placement game.

Players must pass the number of cards required to get their hand down to 5. If players have less than 7 cards, they must pass at least 1 card, unless they have 0 cards, then they don't need to pass a card).<br/><br/>2) Pick (each player, in turn order, select cards in their opponents hands to press their luck, and advance their own runner. Each card has one of three symbols that either advance, stop, or backup your racer.)<br/><br/>3) Play (after all players have picked cards, then players may play sets as a bonus sprint action for your racer)<br/><br/>If a player has successfully completed the necessary laps in the marathon, they are the winner!<br/><br/>During setup, players can set the number of laps required for each racer to either balance difficulty level for different aged players and/or adjust the total game length.<br/><br/>",

A single match takes around 30 minutes, but you can also play a full tournament. Tournaments are 3 matches in a row, tweaking decks between each match.<br/><br/>To win, players must pay attention to the crowd.  A deck of Crowd cards provides new ways of earning Glory as the match goes on, and the rewards are often far higher than those for simply killing your foes. Completing special objectives earns you Crowd Favor, which is worth a huge chunk of Glory at the end of the match. Favor will go back and forth between players during a match, and it is often the favorite who ends up winning.<br/><br/>In the end, only Glory matters. Even if your gladiator dies, you can still win if you had a glorious death.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "About the Game:<br/><br/>This game is an abstract game designed, created and published by me, Magdala Ramirez.  Games people Play is a board game that dares you to go on a quest within the self to uncover your spiritual path. It will take you into the cycles that you encounter in your life and help you to understand how you have evolved. In this world of duality, the system created separation and disconnection within the people. It happened over and over again. Soon, people stopped be-living in themselves and an inner battle began. Chaos, destruction and sadness came into being in the outside world as the human beings became more disconnected and dysfunctional within themselves. Human beings got caught in the cycles that created turmoil within them and peace was no where to be found, until now.  Now the human beings are ready to reach themselves by embracing and uncovering the cycles within the self. They are ready to integrate their hearts and birth a higher perception of themselves.<br/><br/>How to Play :<br/><br/>This is an ancient game of serpents and arrows. The arrows make your energy go up and the serpents take your energy down.<br/><br/>Role a dice and use your marker to move across the board. Read about the number you land on and meditate why you are there and where you are going, and where the synchronicity of the dice will take you. You can start if you throw a one on your dice. Then, the game begins! Use as a board marker something personal that has your energy. It could be a ring, a stone, a crystal etc. As you proceed in the game, you are led to different houses  and  the meaning of each house that you enter into during the game is written in the book that comes with the game.<br/>        <br/>     You win when you became a God-Goddess, the number 68, having perfect control of yourself and using your feminine power with all its divine implications. Meditate on this. Meditate in your circle. You will find this game a beautiful tool to knowing yourself.<br/><br/><br/>",

To do this, you must do the mathematical operations that you consider with the cards you have in your hand.<br/><br/>In his turn, the player may pass, or make 2 actions of all the following (without repeating the same action); <br/>-Grab 1 card from one of the two central decks (numbers or operations)<br/>-Make 1 semi-discard * <br/>-Grab 1 semi-discard card from another player <br/>-recover 1 own semi-discard<br/><br/>When neither player wants to play, or neither player can be able to continue playing, the operations of all players will be solved. Each player must put on the table their cards ordered from left to right representing his mathematical operation. <br/>To the result of  his operation each player will apply a penalty for each wasted card.<br/><br/>The player that with his mathematical operation (applying his respective penalties) gets be closer to the target figure wins the game.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>-100 cards<br/><br/>",

Air War-Korea is designed for 1/600th or 1/300th miniatures, although 1/144th can be used by doubling all measurements. Air War-Korea is hopefully the first in a series of games that will focus on specific eras with the second game being set in the skies over Vietnam. Theoretically this game could be played outside with 1/72nd scale models on stakes (with flags replacing the counters. This is my intention for this as it is less complex than other systems of it's kind.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Air combat rules for 1/600, 1/300 and 1/144th miniatures for the Korean war 1950-1953.<br/><br/>Although jets were used in WW2 and most major powers had developed them by the end of the war, there were no jet vs. jet dogfights. After the war the U.S., England, and Russia frantically improved their engines and airframes, setting the stage for what would be a continual arms race for the next forty or so years.<br/><br/>The Mig-15 came as a shock to Western air forces when it made its debut over the skies of Korea at the start of the Korean War. The first jet to jet dogfights took place with P-80s, F-2 Banshees, and F-84s dueling it out with Mig-15s as North Korean forces attacked down the Korean peninsula, then during the disintegration of those same forces with the UN counterattacks.<br/><br/>When the F-86 Sabre entered combat it completely changed the game and set in motion the classic duel between the Mig-15 and F-86 for the next few years.<br/><br/>Airwar Korea is an introductory level air combat set of miniatures rules that recreates these legendary duels. Players can use F-86s, Mig-15s, carry out ground attacks, and basically any type of mission that was used in the Korean War.<br/><br/>Airwar Korea enables gamers to read through some basic rules, set up a game, and conclude the game in a few hours without having to learn 50+ pages of rules and dozens of charts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Counter Terrorist Warfare in the 21st Century.<br/><br/>This rules set has been developed primarily to focus on an infantry existence in modern day war.<br/><br/>The rules used for fighting a battle with miniature figures on tabletop terrain revolve around basic functions, each of which has many ramifications. A general description follows, and this will offer an overview of what actions a tabletop game covers.<br/><br/>The Book and The Gun is a realistic small unit action war game that is easy to learn and relatively quick to play, while containing the depth needed to meet the players' desire for a realistic tactical tabletop miniatures game. Vehicles and aircraft rules have been abstracted as support for the infantry fight and to that end players should not attempt to recreate large scale mechanized actions with these rules as you will be disappointed.<br/>Players should look at how the rules can be modified to accommodate armies of these periods.<br/><br/>There is no reason, with proper modification, why these rules cannot be used to portray small-scale infantry actions in Vietnam, Korea, and WW2. Indeed, these rules can portray small actions such SWAT rescues and police actions.<br/><br/>So, it is present day, and anywhere in the world you want to take your fire team or squad and fight is up to you and your imagination. Collecting a large army is not necessary in order to play. All it takes is a minimum of 3 soldiers per side and a little bit of model terrain to enter the firefight of your life.<br/><br/>1 full turn equals 2 minutes game scale. Each player turn is one minute in real time.<br/><br/>Troop scale is basically 1 figure represents one man and one vehicle model represents one vehicle.<br/><br/>",

Typical mats, such as those available from Hotz (Sea Blue felt mat) with 2 inch hexes generally work very well.  Alternately, players could utilize 1/600th scale ships (such as Xyston Miniatures) on an 8&rsquo; x 6&rsquo; mat with 3 or 4 inch hexes if they choose to do so.  Both scales work equally well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lightning War is a game of warfare during the age of machinery. It is a game of strategy and tactics where battles (of perhaps more than one day) are able to be played in a few hours.<br/>The basic unit of control is the battalion (or national equivalent). This is a unit of individual bases (usually around four), where each base represents a company (or squadron of tanks). This battalion-sized unit is called a combat unit. A group of these combat units, usually two to four, is called a battle group.<br/>An example of a battle group is a British armoured brigade, where the individual armoured regiments are the combat units. The four bases within each represent the squadrons within the regiments.<br/>The focus of Lightning War is not on detail (for instance, range bands and armour penetration tables) but on troop types, the training of the soldiers involved and command control.<br/><br/>All troops and commanders have a quality rating from one (worst) to five (best). This is not the valour of the individual soldier, but a measure of how effective they are in combat.<br/>A turn is two hours and a combat unit (battalion) can perform one or two actions a turn depending on the quality of the troops and a die roll.<br/>Battle groups move sequentially between sides &ndash; not one side after the other &ndash; depending on the quality of the troops and headquarters involved.<br/>Combat units can become fatigued once they suffer casualties and commands can become exhausted (once half the units within them are fatigued). The effects of fatigue and exhaustion are to slow or even stop advances.<br/>Bases are usually 30mm by 30mm for micro armour, but other sizes can be used. Place as many infantry figures on a base as desired (four or five seems a good number). A vehicle or gun base has one model on it.<br/><br/>",

It is well suited to playing battles from duels to squadron actions; because of the high level of detail large fleet battles can be slow to play and therefore optional rules are provided to speed play in these games.<br/><br/>Earth Expects is designed to represent battles within the solar system between ships capable of manoeuvre at sub light speed. No aliens have been encountered; battles and wars are fought between human factions as they have been since before the dawn of history. Modification for use in a galaxy spanning campaign is straightforward.<br/><br/>",

These include:<br/><br/>    The use of a standard pack of playing cards to determine the order in which units are able to move, fire, and take part in close combat;<br/>    The use of Special Event Cards that the players can use to gain extra movement, firepower, close combat effectiveness, or to rally troops that have failed a morale test and have fled from the battlefield;<br/>    The use of the Jokers to determine:<br/>        When players have to hand back any unused Special Event Cards.<br/>        When the battle will end.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The intent of this small set of wargaming rules is to allow the players to recreate a portion of this battle using miniature figures, scenery and models. Unlike most wargaming rules, all the players in Mog &rsquo;93 play the American forces. The Somalis run themselves on &lsquo;auto-pilot&rsquo;, using a simple scheme of die rolls<br/>to determine where they appear and their actions. The Americans check to see if they get hit any time they perform an action based on the number of armed Somalis who have LOS. These rules assume that<br/>you have some basic wargaming experience, as I have no inclination to write out wargaming basics such as what LOS is and what does and does not constitute cover, etc.<br/><br/>The author&rsquo;s basic scenario assumes that the initial stage of the mission is complete: The Delta operators have captured and secured the targets, who have been loaded on the vehicles and sent off on their way back to base. The first Blackhawk has been shot down and crashed. At the beginning of play, Rangers and Delta Operators (and SEAL and air force personnel as well, if you have the figures) are on the ground, trying to make their way to secure the crash site and prepare for extraction. What happens from there is up to the players and the dice.<br/><br/>Each player will control a &lsquo;unit&rsquo; of American special forces soldiers, typically either a unit of Delta operators or Rangers. The term &lsquo;unit&rsquo; is used because you&rsquo;ll have to decide how many models will form a unit &ndash; it can be as large a stick of Rangers (12 models), to as few as two models each if you have a lot of players. My advice to you is to allow each player 4 to 6 models, maximum, as he will need to keep track of ammunition and wounds for each model.<br/>The Somalis will come into play as &lsquo;mobs&rsquo;. A mob will consist of one or more Somali models, armed, unarmed, or a mixture of both. The Somalis are on autopilot. They are moved according to a protocol described herein, but otherwise perform no actions other than to be on the battlefield, assuming to be firing in whatever direction they are facing at any Americans who happen to be in their LOS.<br/><br/>",

Next players look at their hand for any sixes not in their trump suit, these are to be given to the player who has that suit as trumps.<br/><br/>The game is played in three rounds; keep scores for each of the rounds.<br/><br/>The Play &ndash; Playing clockwise, the player to the dealers left starts by playing any card from their hand face up to the center of the playing area forming the start of a play stack.<br/><br/>Henceforth on your turn take one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1. Beat the top card of the play stack by playing a higher-ranking card of the same color suit or<br/><br/>2. Play one of your trump cards on top of the play stack. Having done this, you must play another card on top of this one; this second card may be of any rank or color suit the player so chooses or<br/><br/>3. Play a card that is not one of your trump cards to the playing area forming a second play stack adjacent to the previous one, the card must be of a different color suit from the one previously lead. Having done this, you must play another card on top of this one; this second card must be a higher-ranking card of the same color suit. Now all the cards of the previous play stack go to the previous player and kept face down.<br/><br/>When a player is unable to take her turn, she must pass and the stack of cards go to the previous player. If all players pass in succession the game ends.<br/><br/>Scoring &ndash; At the end of each round add up all the cards you&rsquo;ve taken, these are worth 1 point each and then subtract 1 point each for every card left in your hand. Tally each players final scores from all three rounds, the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The rules cover the period from when all European nations adopted the three-man-deep platoon firing system up until the rise of the mass conscript armies of the Napoleonic era; very roughly A.D. 1740-1790, when musketry weight of fire ruled the battlefield. The rules do not try to recreate every aspect of 18th Century warfare; for example, the rules ignore most of the complexities of maneuver.<br/><br/>The rules are intended only to model the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; tactics of the period.<br/><br/>The rules are designed for games using 6-12 units per side. A game like this should take about four hours for a pair of opponents familiar with the rules to complete. Typical game setup involves two fairly equal forces facing one another across a game table laid out with terrain models representing hills, woods, streams, etc. Victory conditions to win the game may vary widely, but usually one player wins when a stated number of the enemy&rsquo;s units have been destroyed or routed off the game table before a set number of turns have been played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Voice of the Guns is a wargames system for European Land Warfare for the period from 1850, when the muzzle-loading rifle became widely adopted, to 1916, when the tank made its appearance on the European battlefield. In that time the cavalry lost its pre-eminence on the battlefield, the artillery developed the art of indirect fire thanks to the introduction of the recoil mechanism, and the machine-gun evolved into a weapon to fear.<br/><br/>The period runs from the Crimean War, up through the wars of Italian Unification, the Austro-Prussian and Franco Prussian Wars, the Russo-Turkish War and on to the early days of the First World War. The system may also be successfully used to re-fight the American Civil War and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904.<br/><br/>The system is intended for large-scale actions up to corps and army level. The basic manoeuvre units are the infantry battalion, the cav<br/>alry squadron and the artillery battery. With the possible exception of independent machine-gun companies, further subdivision of forces is not considered.<br/><br/>The system may be used for any scale of figures from 5-6 mm through 10-12 mm and 15 mm up to 25-28 mm and is not dependent upon specific numbers of figures per unit.<br/><br/>Morale and combat systems have been streamlined to cut down calculation as far as feasible. Where possible, outcomes are automatic. While at the same time, command and control is sophisticated and designed to present players with the sort of tactical and practical problems encountered by real-life generals.<br/><br/>",

By the end of the war the Me-262 and Me-163 had been operational for awhile and there were many others either in the experimental stage or on the design board.<br/><br/>Jet bombers escorted by jet fighters were certainly not out of the question if the war had gone late into 1945 or early 1946.<br/>But the Allies weren&rsquo;t exactly unprepared either. Several of their jet designs were approaching the operational stage and could have<br/>set the scene for some fascinating jet battles over Germany.<br/>P-80s escorting B- 29s that are intercepted by a variety of German jets is just one of the many scenarios that these rules will allow<br/>you to simulate.<br/><br/>Dawning of the Jet Age allows gamers to recreate these hypothetical battles as Allied jets try to counter the German jet fighters already in operation. Like many other games in this series,<br/>these rules are designed for a fun and fast game as the basic rules are only a few pages. Gamers should be able to grasp the concepts<br/>and be flying in no time at all and the system can also work for large, multiplayer games.<br/><br/>Feel free to add additional rules, jets, or other WW2 prop driven aircraft to your scenarios. The rules are flexible enough that a little more complexity can be added without loss of playability or more time needed to finish a game.<br/><br/>Dawning of the Jet Age is designed for 1/600th or 1/300th miniatures, although 1/144th can be used by doubling all measurements.<br/><br/>",

I hope my small contribution provides something you will enjoy.<br/><br/>Players will find that the emphasis had been placed on the American War of Independence and American Civil War. This was done to get the particular troop types of that conflict vetted in these rules. There is no reason why these rules cannot suffice for any European war of the same period.<br/><br/>A basic set of war game rules must provide a vehicle for troop movement, a procedure for deciding combat and a method for accounting for the results of combat (casualties and routed units). Laid over all this, the war gamer must be confounded with command and control issues and logistics problems. All this must be done without unduly complicating the rule system and maintaining game playability and realism.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A doujinshi (self-published) simulation of the Battle of Dannoura in 1185 (the sea battle that brought the Genpei War in Japan to a close), Shogyoumujou (Ë´∏Ë°åÁÑ°Â∏∏) is a Buddhist concept translated as &ldquo;the impermanence of all things&rdquo;. This is the main theme of the &ldquo;Heike Monogatari&rdquo;, a gunkimono (war tale) that gives a highly romanticized account of the war and the times that surrounded it. The book details the rise and fall of the Taira warrior house, the losing side at Dannoura. It drives home the point that &ldquo;all that flourishes must fall&rdquo; and that in a world of impermanence even the mighty are eventually reduced to &ldquo;dust before the wind&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a very fitting title, as the battle effectively ended the Taira's reign as a political and military powerhouse.<br/><br/>It has several sub-titles that change according to the game component-the full name is Shogyoumujou: Genpei Arasoi- Setouchi No Koubou-Genpei Saigo No Kassen-Dannoura No Tatakai (Ë´∏Ë°åÁÑ°Â∏∏: Ê∫êÂπ≥„ÅÆ‰∫â„ÅÑ-ÁÄ¨Êà∏ÂÜÖ„ÅÆÊîªÈò≤-Ê∫êÂπ≥ÊúÄÂæå„ÅÆÂêàÊà¶-Â£á„ÉéÊµ¶„ÅÆÊà¶„ÅÑ). This mouthful of a name translates as &ldquo;Impermanence Of All Things: Genpei Strife-Offense And Defense Of The Seto Inland Sea-End of the Genpei War-Battle of Dannoura.<br/><br/>The game features the naval forces of the Taira and Minamoto warrior houses and their assorted allies. In a strange design decision, the historical situation is somewhat reversed-the Minamoto are severely outnumbered but have stronger units than their Taira foes (the Minamoto substantially outnumbered the Taira but the crews of the Taira ships were far more experienced at sea warfare as the clan first came to power by demonstrating their prowess at fighting pirates). Perhaps this was done to reflect the Minamoto&rsquo;s lack of seaborne experience (the reduced numbers) but to show their large advantage in tactics (the increased strength)-their commander, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, purportedly ordered his archers to fire upon the rowers of the boats rather than the enemy soldiers (a violation of the unwritten rules of warfare of the day, something that Yoshitsune was notorious for throughout his career). While the game is relatively simple, it has lots of chrome rules that add historical flavor such as the effects of the changing tide on movement and combat, possession of the Imperial Regalia and the Child Emperor Antoku (both initially held by the Taira), defections, the role of leaders, and giving the Taira a couple of unique ship types. Historically, the Minamoto literally used the &lsquo;turning of the tide&rsquo; to rout the Taira and were aided by key defections during the battle as well as Yoshitsune&rsquo;s less than &lsquo;honorable&rsquo; tactics. The Taira leader, Munemori, was fished out of the ocean (where he had been thrown by an ally disgusted at his reluctance to commit suicide to avoid capture and dishonor) and eventually executed. However, the Taira denied the Minamoto a complete victory when the matriarch of the clan and her attendants jumped into the ocean with the child Emperor and the Imperial Regalia. While the Minamoto managed to recover two of the three artifacts, the child Emperor died and the sword Kusanagi was lost forever. This was a major disappointment to the Minamoto&rsquo;s alleged supporter, Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa. The game&rsquo;s victory conditions reflect all this, factoring both the Emperor/Regalia and enemy losses into the mix. It&rsquo;s a fast (10 turns, a couple of hours) and fun play with a manageable amount of units and good balance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Explore temples and swipe artifacts with your friends! You won't get very far alone, but who knows if your friends can be trusted?<br/><br/>In Ruinous, each player is an adventurer attempting to collect valuable items within dangerous ruins. They must brave these deadly ruins while balancing teamwork and trickery on the way to finding ancient Artifacts - powerful and expensive items that imbue their holders with unique abilities. But be careful: no item or player is safe from treachery! The first player to collect and sell at least $1000 worth of treasure and artifacts wins!<br/><br/>When it's your turn to explore a ruin you may first assemble an adventure party made up of other players in the game. The more people you recruit, the easier it is to overcome traps and obstacles. But keep in mind, they're still your enemies! Offer them a cut of the treasure to encourage cooperation, but remember: in the depths of the world's darkest ruins there are no contracts, there are no witnesses and sometimes only one survivor... So always prepare for an opportunistic backstabbing.<br/><br/>Should you enlist the help of your rivals or attempt to go it alone? Are your fellow adventurers trustworthy? Are you?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forest Sprite is a cooperative game for 1-3 players in which players control a team of sprites and forest creatures on a mission to defend their home from an invading force of evil sorcerers and the monsters and misfortune they bring into your forest.<br/><br/>Forest Sprite can be played as a standalone board game (challenge mode) in which player(s) can choose pre-generated character(s) and play any 1 of the Chapters. HOWEVER<br/>Sprite is best enjoyed by playing in campaign mode. In campaign mode, a player creates his or her own character and uses that character to attempt to beat each Chapter in order. Chapters get progressively more challenging, but as your character gains experience, it may attain new levels. When your character attains a new level, experience points can be spent to add new spells and abilities and upgrade stats. Characters will also pick up items as they progress through Chapters and defeat monsters.<br/><br/>Gameplay is pretty simple. The turn begins with the drawing of a mission and moving of any monsters that are on the board. The player may then take 3 actions using his or her character and/or forest animals in order to complete one of the open missions. When players fail missions, monsters get released. If 6 missions are failed, player loses. If the players draw all of the missions and fail less than 6 of them, they win (and gain experience points in campaign mode).<br/><br/>Forest Sprite is a game full of tense decisions. (starting with creating a good character!) There are no dice (the only luck is in the order in which missions are drawn). This is a game of planning, skillful gameplay, and coordination of resources.<br/><br/>2014 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Awards;<br/><br/>Best Game<br/>3rd Place<br/><br/>Best Art<br/>2nd Place<br/><br/>Best Thematic Game<br/>2nd Place<br/><br/>Best Large Game<br/>2nd Place<br/><br/>Most Innovative Mechanic<br/>2nd Place (tied)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wargames Rules for the Wars of the Late 17th &amp; Early 18th Centuries<br/><br/>The period 1650 to 1712 saw dramatic changes in the conduct of European warfare with the final demise of the pike and the introduction of first the plug-bayonet and then its far handier<br/>successor the socket-bayonet. The heavy cavalry shed most of its armour and began to rely more and more on shock action. The infantry changed over from firing volleys by ranks and adopted the far more flexible platoon firing. Light cavalry began to make its appearance on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Command and control was no less rudimentary. Marlborough&rsquo;s running footmen, on hand to carry his orders to all parts of the field, were the wonder of the day. A general staff, trained to act as a team, was still years in the future.<br/>And as for the name, Corporal John was the affectionate nickname given to John, first Duke of Marlborough by his troops.<br/>These rules are designed to replicate the warfare of Marlborough and Eugene, of Charles XII and Peter the Great, and of the great Cond&eacute; and Turrenne. They might easily be used for the conflicts of Cromwell and Prince Rupert or even the wars of Maurice de Saxe. Whichever you choose.<br/>All models fielded under these rules are organised on &ldquo;element&rdquo; bases. They can be of any size provided that both sides field their forces on the same size bases. There is no figure-scale as such &ndash; the gamer is free to use as many or as few figures as he wishes and the base will accommodate &ndash; and no removal of casualties.<br/><br/>",

The principles of the game are:<br/>1. The game is played on a hex grid. The scale of the ship models doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as they fit in a hex.<br/>2. Each ship has a ship&rsquo;s log to record proposed manoeuvres and damage. These are magnetic boards with paper overlays with details recorded by positioning magnetic counters.<br/>3. The players secretly record their proposed movement each turn.<br/>4. All the ships are then moved simultaneously in accordance with those proposals.<br/>5.

Each of them can be played idependently, so a single act forms an entertaining adventure. But, each act has been prepared and designed to connect with the other acts. Every new act expands the arsenal which our heroes have and presents the players with more difficulties during their adventure.<br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>The scenes are represented in 2D. Players move on tiles of 10 x 7 squares, with a simple system to advance or to attack. The tiles are placed in a random manner, forming a dungeon filled with interesting locations and enemies to fight. As the players advances, new tiles are revealed, with new enemies and connections to other tiles or the exit.<br/><br/>When an enemy is revealed, the players will reach for their weapons in order to defeat it and continue their advance.<br/><br/>The goal is simple. To reach the dungeons, overcome the challenges there, find the heart of the dungeon and then reach the exit to finish the adventure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragon Raiders is a game where players take on the role of the Dragon, raiding the fantasy kingdom for food (to grow bigger and stronger) and treasures (to gain an advantage over the other Dragons).<br/><br/>Game-play consists of a series of Raid phases, broken up into turns by an Accounting phase (where certain play elements get reset). Each Raid phase consists of three sub-phases; movement, reactive board elements, and combat, in that order. Players accomplish each sub-phase in an order determined by their power ranking. Players choose where to move based on what they think they can successfully raid, or may choose to go on adventures in the deepest forest. After the Dragons move, Knights will come out of their keeps to fight any Dragon nearby (i.e., adjacent to the keep).<br/><br/>Combat consists of rolling 1d6 and adding your Power attribute; you must beat the Defense score of the board element in order to win. A Dragon who does not win his combat must retreat, losing half of his carried treasure as he does so. Dragons must fight other Dragons in the same space first; both roll 1d6 and add their Power, highest total wins. The loser gives half of his treasure to the winner and retreats. Ties result in both dragons retreating without losing any treasure.<br/><br/>The end-game is triggered when a Dragon defeats the King, who sits in his castle at the center of the kingdom. The current Raid phase is finished out, and victory points are totaled. The highest total is considered the strongest Dragon and wins the game!<br/><br/>",

A *take* is the act of removing some number of dice from the edges of the pyramid and scoring them according to their original orientation in the structure.<br/><br/>A player may take a group of dice from the pyramid according to certain scoring sets: runs, 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, additive (numbers add to a sum), multiplicative (numbers multiply to a product), and others.  There are also takes that incur penalties, but that might be useful for setting up larger scoring sets.<br/><br/>The players will continue to take dice from the pyramid until either they both take negative scores on successive turns or all of the dice are removed from the pyramid. The player with the highest score at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>",

There is no formal figurescale, the unit sizes being dictated by the base sizes, which in turn are based on the frontages of the prototype units. An infantry battalion might be, for example, ten 25mm figures, twenty 15mm figures or fifty 5 mm figures.<br/><br/>The system is expressly designed for use with large formation games and is unsuitable for actions involving less than brigade strengths. Note that throughout the rules the term &ldquo;formation&rdquo; is used to convey the sense of brigade groupings and higher, whereas the term &ldquo;unit&rdquo; is used of bodies of troops making up brigades.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inspired by a certain sabre wielding hero from 8 bit computer games of the 1980's, 8-bit Jungle Hero is an adventure game played on a map that changes throughout play.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to navigate the labyrinthine jungle paths of the lost valley, surviving the encounters within. Adventurers must locate the lost pieces of an amulet and then make it to the magic portal that will allow them to escape. At the same time travelers must avoid the predations of &ldquo;The Beast&rdquo; a terrible creature who patrols the valley.<br/><br/>Each turn players explore their surroundings, react to encounters, change the map of the valley and move &quot;The Beast&quot;<br/><br/>The map is a grid of tiles with four fixed points - mountains, within it.  As part of their turn players get the opportunity to rotate or move one or more of the tiles of the map, changing the paths through the jungle.  Players also have a short trail of tiles immediately behind them that they have already visited. This moves with them and can change in length depending on the items they are carrying.  This path cannot be changed by other players.  However if &quot;The Beast&quot; picks up this trail it will follow it and may attack the unfortunate adventurer.<br/><br/>Each time they enter a new tile players draw from an encounter deck.  This may produce a beneficial result but more often will reveal one of the jungle denizens poised to attach them.  Surviving an encounter may result in them getting treasure, including pieces of the amulet needed to escape the valley.<br/><br/>Escape from the valley is via a portal that moves around the outside edge of the map each turn.  To escape players must move off the edge of the map onto this portal<br/><br/>",

Plagues, famines, and fire are suffered or inflicted while soldiers march to war in the name of the deities they serve. Only the civilization with the strongest pantheon will prevail.<br/><br/>Pantheon is a card game for 2-5 players created by veteran game designer Timothy Brown (co-creator of the Dark Sun campaign setting), developed by Jamie Chambers with graphic design by Digger Hayes, featuring art by Lindsay Archer, Michael Bielaczyc, Melanie Hayes, Nick Kremenek, and Joie Brown.<br/><br/>In Pantheon you start with a fledgling ancient culture. Grow your population, build temples, advance your civilization, and wage war on your enemies! There are many paths to victory, but when the game ends only the strongest pantheon will triumph. It features gods from ancient Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian mythology.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players will harvest genetic material: the currency with which they may buy mutations to change their species or propagate to increase their presence in the ecosystem. Players must balance strategy, tactics, and guile to compete in the pursuit of several unique win conditions; ultimately to ensure the survival of their genetic footprint.<br/><br/>-- Developer's description<br/><br/>Things Change.<br/>You are a species. That's not an insult, it's the premise of [the] game. In this game, you take on the role of a unique species in a rainforest ecosystem. Your goal is to out-compete your opponents to obtain the largest ecological footprint; and I have given you several win conditions so that you can prove it.<br/><br/>The core mechanic of the game is called harvesting. Each turn, you will harvest genetic material (The game's currency) which you can use to buy mutations to make your creatures better equipped to compete, or propagate to increase your presence in the forest. The amount of genes you harvest depends on your presence and position in the forest. The more you have, the more genetic capital you have to work with. Neat, huh?<br/><br/>Win Conditions.<br/>If you want to win the game, you'll need to be the first to achieve any one of these win conditions:<br/><br/>Survival of the Fittest. This one is straightforward. If your creatures are the only ones alive in the forest, you win. Do this by clashing with opponents' creatures.<br/><br/>Top of the Food Chain. If, at the beginning of your turn, you control three carnivores, you win. Easy, right? Go ahead, make that third carnivore. See what your opponents do.<br/><br/>Ecological Niche. If, at the beginning of your turn, you control a creature in each Floor tile (Blue-green), you win. Who says barnacles can't be winners? Seriously, who says that?<br/><br/>Okay, I think that's it. The game is designed for 2-3 players, but if you have a fourth, you should play in teams. Oh, and one more thing:<br/><br/>It's time to get squishy.<br/><br/>-- from the game manual<br/><br/>",

How do I deliver? Will I make a profit? How should I grow? How can I cut my carbon footprint?<br/><br/>Each turn a player must choose between taking an Air/Sea turn or a Rail/Road turn. You can only do one or the other. Playing your turn then requires 4 same steps in strict order:-<br/><br/>    Step 1 - Deciding whether to buy new assets- planes, ships, trains &amp; trucks<br/>    Step 2 - Paying operational costs<br/>    Step 3 - Picking up an Air/Sea or Rail/Road card<br/>    Step 4 - The last thing you do in your turn is roll the dice to make deliveries. Income is earned by completing deliveries for the amount shown on your Order cards.<br/><br/><br/>These 4 easy-to-follow steps are summarised on an A6 card.<br/>Business on the Move  is extremely versatile and can be played at seven different levels, changing how to play and how to win.<br/>Extensive trials across the UK have seen the game played by nearly 600 young people aged 9-19, teachers and business professionals.<br/><br/>",

In the first phase of each round, the players (in turn order) roll their dice and attempt to get the best score possible. A given die may be rerolled any number of times until a) the player accepts the number on the die or b) the die rolls a 1. If the die rolls a one, that die is locked at one for the round.<br/><br/>Once each player has their starting roll for the round, the scheming begins. Each player must choose to help or hinder an opponent with five possible outcomes (3 outcomes if there are only two players left).<br/><br/>Outcome 1 - Player A helps Player B: Player B adds 3 points to their score for the round.<br/>Outcome 2 - Player A hinders Player B: Player B subtracts 3 points.<br/>Outcome 3 - Player A helps Player B and Player B helps Player A: Each player adds 6 points.<br/>Outcome 4 - Player A hinders Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Each player subtracts 6 points.<br/>Outcome 5 - Player A helps Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Player A subtracts 6 Points and Player B adds 6 points.<br/><br/>At the end of the second phase, the player with the lowest score in the round loses a die. Players gain bonus chips adding 1 point to their score for the next round for each player with a higher score in the current round. The player with the highest score goes first next round.<br/><br/>The game ends when only one player is left with dice. All others have been eaten by the zombie.<br/><br/>",

The objective of the game is to create a continuous connection with one set of blocks that spans the length of the game board.<br/><br/>The game board is a modular square; prior to the game players place &quot;terrain&quot; upon the board using neutral blocks. Each player then must decide how to bridge and/or tunnel through pieces to reach the other side. Once per turn, a player may either place a new piece into play or move one of their existing pieces on the board, as long as it isn't trapped by an opponent's piece. Alternatively, players can use a small selection of &quot;wildcard&quot; pieces that provide a connection for all the players.<br/><br/>A game is won once the first person successfully bridges the board with no edge connections between pieces.<br/><br/>Multiple rule variants possible - this is a family of games about building geometric connections in 3d space.<br/><br/>",

There are nine possible places on the island but each map only shows what is hidden along a specific longitude or latitude. To dig randomly is risky as each place may contain unknown dangers. Instead, the players must challenge each other for the maps or watch where the others dig and then steal whatever they find. To win Find the Treasure!, you must find out the other players' clues while guarding your own, lure them into digging where there are no diamonds and escape from the island before they realize that you have the treasure.<br/><br/>The gameplay is tense and interactive as the players struggle to seek through the island with one eye and watching the other players' hunt with the other. As more and more of the island's secrets are dug up, the pirates will close in on each other, some eager to fight, others to escape, and tactics and deduction rather than brute force will be decisive. May the most ruthless pirat win!<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include:<br/><br/>1. Changing and hidden game board: The island is different in each game and the location of the treasure hidden to the players. <br/>2. Player balance: The players have similar resources (1 pirate and 1 ship) and are always equally strong. <br/>3. Deduction: By acquiring maps, the players can deduce where the treasure is located. <br/>4. Hidden score: The players do not know what the others have found.<br/><br/>",

It is a game about politics and intrigues in 17th century Sweden where each player represents a faction with a hidden agenda. The end of their intrigues is the newly appointed queen Christina of Sweden and their means include persuasion, agitation, manipulation and even assassination. They achieve this by carefully steering the queen towards influence of their own faction and away from influence of other factions. At the same time, they must closely monitor the other players' actions to guess their agendas. But beware, if your own agenda is too obvious, you may yourself become the victim of your opponents' intrigues!<br/> Game mechanisms include:<br/> 1. Card drawing: Cards are drawn or discarded so that each new player in turn is faced with new options. <br/>2. Asymmetric scoring: There are no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; cards but they all score differently for different players. <br/>3. Hidden agendas: The players do not know how much the other players score until the very end. <br/>4. Guessing game: Based on how players play, the other players may gain points by guessing their agendas (or lose points by guessing wrong).<br/><br/>Christina Regina is the third game in the Nova Suecia series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The power of games to teach abstract concepts is more and more acknowledged. Find the Bug! offers an introduction to IT testing through a fast and simple board game.<br/><br/>The application is simulated by a game board divided into a number of components. Each component has a unique number of bugs with a unique level of severity. The test leads take turn to analyse the application (to learn where bugs are likely to find) and to place testers in the application (to find those bugs). Each bug scores a value according to its severity level.<br/><br/>Once a set of components is perceived to be bug free, a test lead may let a tester cover the entire set and thus increase the probability of finding bugs in the next round. However, if the test lead is wrong, the tester's effort is lost so don't be too fast!<br/><br/>The winner is the one who finds most bugs.<br/><br/>Find the Bug! is mainly designed for IT professionals who want to learn testing in a fun way. However, ordinary gamers may also enjoy this deductive challenge where you must use your limited resources efficiently and monitor the other player's actions carefully to Find the Bug!<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include:<br/><br/>1. Changing and hidden game board: The number, value and location of the bugs is different in each game and they are hidden to the players.<br/>2. Player balance: The players have the same amount of testers and are always equally strong.<br/>3. Predictable odds: To find a bug requires luck but the more pre-analysis a player does, the better are the odds for finding them.<br/>4. Open end: The potentially high end game score makes every game open until the very end.<br/>5. Educational: The game teaches IT testing in a game context<br/><br/>",

        "description": "eXtraDICTION is a crossword-type game with some superficial similarities to Scrabble. However, play is quite different, with a trivia element added. Because this game is intended as an educational tool for learning English, much of the information on the cards is also in other languages.  From the publisher (edited for brevity):<br/><br/>In eXtraDICTION, the clues and related answers are selected by the players from a set of playing cards....  Playing card sets are divided into three main categories: vocabulary, general knowledge, specific subjects.<br/><br/>Answers are written into a grid of squares, but the location of the answers is decided by the players. The answers may be words, idiomatic expressions, dates, numbers or mathematical or scientific formulae.<br/><br/>Points are awarded for each answer written onto the game board.... Each square on the board has a pre-alloted value. The board is divided into several contiguous zones. At each turn, the points scored by the eligible player are calculated by totaling the value of each of the squared occupied by the letters or characters in the answer and multiplying that by the number of zones that the answer passes through or into.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of alternating turns where players can take one of three possible actions: infection, placement, or passing.  An infection is the act of swapping two or more dice for one of an opponent's dice.  A placement is the act of putting a die onto the dice pyramid according to a set of specific rules.  A player can only pass if they've run out of dice to play before the other player has.<br/><br/>It's an important aspect of Pidan that the players are ultimately responsible for placing all of the dice in their nest onto the pyramid, including those belonging to their opponent.<br/><br/>When all of the dice have been placed onto the pyramid the players sum the points showing to determine the scores for each side. The player with the highest total on the majority of sides wins the game. Ties are broken by awarding the player whose die resides in the innermost cell.<br/><br/>",

This doujinshi (self-published work) is a simulation of the 1156 battle in Heiankyo (modern day Kyoto), Japan, between feuding factions of the Fujiwara family of kuge (nobles) fighting over who would hold the position of Tenno (Emperor).<br/><br/>Without getting too deeply into the complex web of politics surrounding the battle, the sitting Tenno Go-Shirakawa was involved in an ongoing succession battle with his half-brother Sutoku (the retired Tenno). Sutoku had been forced out by his father Toba years earlier in favor of another son (Konoe), and when Konoe died, Sutoku saw this as his chance to install his own son as Tenno. However, Toba insisted on installing another of his sons, Go-Shirakawa. When Toba eventually died, Sutoku took advantage of his death to plot with supporters to force Go-Shirakawa from the throne. As if this doesn't sound messy enough already, Go-Shirakawa and Sutoku both had supporters among the three major families of the day-the Fujiwara, Taira, and Minamoto. Supporting Go-Shirakawa was Fujiwara no Tadamichi, Taira no Kiyomori, and Minamoto no Yoshitomo. Supporting Sutoku was Fujiwara no Yorinaga, Taira no Tadamasa, and Minamoto no Tameyoshi.<br/><br/>Historically the fighting took place mainly on July 28-29. Minamoto no Tametomo (a Sutoku supporter) suggested a night attack, but was unwisely overruled by Fujiwara no Yorinaga. Instead, the next evening, Minamoto no Yoshitomo and Taira no Kiyomori led a night attack of their own on Sutoku's palace. Despite being frustrated in their initial attacks on the west gate by the incredible archery prowess of Minamoto no Tametomo, Yoshitomo and Kiyomori simply broke off the attack, moved to other gates, and torched the palace, circumventing that whole messy combat thing. Sutoku was exiled and most of his allies were killed in battle or executed. On the winning side, rewards were handed out, but what was seen as an uneven distribution by the Minamoto resulted in another conflict (the Heiji no Ran) three years later.<br/><br/>Hogen No Ran shares its game system with its follow-up, Heiji No Ran. The game runs for 11 turns, taking the action from the tenth day of the seventh month in the first year of Hogen to the 13th day (July 28-31, 1156, two turns per day with a night turn). Forces of the various factions are individual leaders with associated clansmen, rated for both troop strength and leader ability. Chrome rules put an emphasis on the favored tactics of the day, mainly the use of fire to flush out the enemy. There are also special rules for night attacks, allowing players to see if Minamoto no Tametomo's strategy would have brought victory to Sutoku. Victory is determined by unit losses and possession of the Emperor/retired Emperor. Counter numbers are low, the game system is clean and well thought out, and it does an excellent job of simulating the battle as it was recorded in the Hogen Monogatari (a gunkimono-'war tale'-written around the year 1200).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Characteristics<br/><br/>The essential idea behind the development of this game was to create a mechanism that would allow literally infinite possibilities of development, always keeping the maximum simplicity of the game, while keeping to the minimum the dimensions of the board. Ie not wanted to achieve a very large number of possibilities via increasing dimensions of the board, but actually achieve infinite number of possibilities with finite dimensions. I am aware that the property of &quot;infinite possibilities&quot; does not necessarily imply a high degree of complexity. Analyzing the subject I found that a way to achieve endless possibilities in a space of finite dimensions is eliminating the mechanics of boxes and introducing another type of metrics.<br/>I was essentially inspired by the game of chinese origin here known as &quot;GO&quot; which is characterized by extremely simple rules and at the same time maintaining a high degree of complexity. The dynamics of this game is quite similar to the GO, share many aspects, and in fact the purpose is similar, and yet at the same time, they also differ substantially in many aspects. This will be understood by analyzing the rules of the game.<br/>The rules were analyzed consistently with certain typical aspects of war.<br/>Another parameter of design was to attempt to emulate, if not increase, the intrinsic characteristic of the GO of being a chaotic and stochastic game.<br/><br/>The name of the game derives from the Latin expression for the word &quot;dominion / control&quot;.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>Pieces<br/>The pieces are circular, with a thickness that allows its easy handling. These pieces are characterized in that each has a range (a circular area whose diameter is three times the diameter of the piece). Each piece has one side painted white and the other black (like in Othello), and each player may chose one side (color) to play. Both sides have in the center a gray circle (its just decorative), whose diameter is equal to a quarter of the pieces' diameter. <br/>To tell if a piece is within the range of another, just take a piece and place it over the two pieces. If the piece used to measure is supported by the two pieces, one can ensure that a piece is within the range of the other (and vice versa).<br/>    As in the GO, it is assumed that virtually there is an infinite supply of pieces.<br/><br/>Board<br/>    The board has two concentric squares: the peripheral (whose side is equal to 20x the diameter of the pieces) and the central (whose side is equal to 14x the diameter of the pieces). The peripheral defines the playing area, and the central only serves as a visual reference to place the pieces.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/><br/>    Start: At the start of the game the board is empty. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player must make appear a piece in an empty space on the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Disappearance: A piece disappears when it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    End: When a player makes a &quot;suicide&quot; move, the game ends and that player loses. If the game comes to a point where that may never happen, then it's a tie.<br/><br/><br/>Notes about the terms used:<br/><br/>Note 1: it is said that a player makes a &quot;suicide&quot; move when he makes appear a piece in a place where it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces, and since this move does not make opponent pieces disappear (then, only that piece disappears, by the rule of disappearance).<br/>Note 2: it is said that a player makes a &quot;sacrifice&quot; move when he makes appear a piece in a place where it is within the range of four or more opponents pieces, and since this move makes one or more opponent pieces disappear (then, that piece and the respective opponent pieces disappears, by the rule of disappearance).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Expansive Hospital is a board game in which players collaborate and compete to build a hospital with plastic blocks. Players have to build and treat patients at the same time, since the hospital is under constant expansion. There are many different kinds of patients and plastic blocks necessary to treat them. Designing the blocks is difficult because each player is responsible for one aspect of it: architect, engineer, contractor, nurse, facility manager or director. A poor design allows for earning more money but contributes to the hospital bankruptcy, in which case everybody loses the game. The gist of the game is to find a balance between the need to join forces and the greed for money.<br/><br/>The game design is based on a research conducted with three healthcare construction projects in the Netherlands commissioned by Pioneering. The research found that hospital design is often over schedule due to the conflicts of interests between the multiple parties involved. The game reproduces some of these conflicts, such as the engineer wanting to build more pipes than needed whiles the architect wanting to build a high rise building. If the conflict is not resolved between the players, patient satisfaction drops, together with the hospital income. Playing the game is an opportunity to learn the importance and the difficulties of designing for healthcare performance while having fun with the artificial conflict enactment.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Heiji no Ran is a doujinshi (self-published) simulation of the conflict in Heiankyo, Japan between factions of the Minamoto and Taira warrior houses during the twelfth month of the first year of Heiji (January-February of 1160 by the Western calendar). The game's full name is &quot;Heiji No Ran: Heiji Gannen (1160) (Âπ≥Ê≤ª„ÅÆ‰π±ÔºöÂπ≥Ê≤ªÂÖÉÂπ¥ (1160), Heiji Disturbance: First Year Of Heiji 1160)&quot;. Stemming from resentments brought on by the results of the earlier Hogen no Ran in 1156, the Minamoto along with their Fujiwara allies attacked the Taira and attempted to seize control of the government.<br/><br/>When Taira no Kiyomori left the capital on a pilgrimage, Minamoto no Yoshitomo (Kiyomori's ally in the 1156 conflict) and Fujiwara no Nobuyori took advantage of his absence to kidnap both the Tenno (Emperor) Nijo and the retired Tenno (or Ho, retired Emperor) Go-Shirakawa. They imprisoned the two, burned their palaces, forced them to appoint Nobuyori as Chancellor, and executed Taira ally and Go-Shirakawa confidant Fujiwara no Michinori. However, Kiyomori was informed of their treachery and quickly returned to Heiankyo. His rapid return surprised the Minamoto and left them unsure as to how to proceed. The Minamoto were further confused when Kiyomori made a false offer of surrender to Nobuyori. The Minamoto ended up taking no action against a still gathering and vulnerable Taira force, and Kiyomori also managed to engineer a rescue of both Go-Shirakawa and Nijo.<br/><br/>A strengthened Taira force made the first move, attacking the Minamoto in the Imperial Palace. Fujiwara no Nobuyori ran off but the Minamoto gave battle. Luring the Minamoto out with a feigned retreat, the Taira then occupied the palace, leaving the Minamoto with no avenue of retreat. Instead of trying to reclaim the palace, the Minamoto attacked the Taira's stronghold of Rokuhara in southeast Heiankyo. While Rokuhara would have been an easy target earlier, it had now been reinforced and proved too much for the Minamoto. Their forces eventually broke and scattered. Their leader Yoshitomo was later betrayed by a vassal and killed. While the fighting was of a relatively small scale, it had far reaching effects. With all opposition effectively eliminated, the Taira became the most powerful family in Japan and the first warrior house to exert a large measure of influence and control on the Imperial Court. However, they failed to kill off all the Minamoto heirs, something that was to come back to haunt them in 1180 when Kiyomori managed to have his grandson installed as Tenno...a move that provoked a chain of events that led to the Genpei War.<br/><br/>The game shares its rules system with its predecessor, &quot;Hogen no Ran&quot;. Both games put an emphasis on the favored samurai tactics of the time-night attacks, torching the strongholds of your opponents, and misdirection. The map for Heiji no Ran expands upon the one for Hogen no Ran, including the southern portion of Heiankyo as well as the northern. This allows the fighting to take place all over the city as it did historically, particularly near the Taira's headquarters in Rokuhara. The game runs for 11 turns, taking the action from the 26th day of the 12th month (the day the actual fighting began) in the first year of Heiji to the 29th day (February 5-8, 1160, two turns per day with a night turn). Forces of the various factions are individual leaders with associated clansmen, rated for both troop strength and leader ability. Victory is determined by unit losses, possession of the Tenno/Ho, and occupation of certain locations. As with its sister game it does an excellent job of simulating the battle (in this case as recorded in the Heiji Monogatari (a gunkimono-'war tale'-written around the year 1200). Heiji no Ran plays well with a low number of counters, short completion time, and a well thought out game system with sufficient chrome. It's nicely balanced and an early, well thought out Minamoto strike will often bring victory.<br/><br/>",

It's a doujinshi (self-published) game similar in tone to the early SPI folio games-low numbers of counters, compact map, and an easy-to-learn game system used for all the entries in the series. The full name is Mimikawa No Tatakai: Otomo (Tawara) X Shimazu (Takajogawa No Tatakai) 1578.11.12 (ËÄ≥Â∑ù„ÅÆÊà¶„ÅÑ: Â§ßÂèã (Áî∞Âéü) X Â≥∂Ê¥• (È´òÂüéÂ∑ù„ÅÆÊà¶„ÅÑ) 1578.11.12, Battle of Mimikawa: Otomo (Tawara) Vs. Shimazu (Battle Of Takajogawa) 1578/11/12).<br/><br/>Historically, the battle took place in Hyuga province (in the eastern part of Kyushu, Japan's southernmost major island). The Shimazu's increasingly expansionist ways were making the daimyo (feudal lords) in the north of Kyushu uneasy. Otomo Sorin of Bungo province in northeast Kyushu put together a„ÄÄsizable army and sent it south to deal with the Shimazu. The Shimazu in turn dispatched reinforcements north to their outpost at Taka castle. Shimazu Iehisa, Yoshihiro, and Yoshihisa consolidated their forces (along with some troops from their allies in the Ijuuin) at Taka, numbering about 50,000. The Otomo forces dispatched to meet them were made up of about 30,000 troops mainly from the Tawara, Takita, Saeki, and Kuwano families. They were commanded by Otomo Sorin's son-in-law, Tawara Chikataka. On the 12th day of the 11th month of the sixth year of Tensho (December 10, 1578) Tawara made an unwise frontal assault on the castle. After some bitter fighting featuring some of the earliest usage of large numbers of arquebus in Japan, the Otomo forces broke. The Shimazu pursued and many of the Otomo were drowned in the rapid waters of the Mimikawa river to the north. The Otomo lost about twice as many men as the Shimazu, probably about 4,000 or so. The Shimazu continued to push the Otomo back in the ensuing months, eventually forcing the Otomo to request aid from Toyotomi Hideyoshi, giving the warlord and his massive army a handy excuse to add Kyushu to his list of conquests.<br/><br/>The battle is played out in eight turns. Victory is determined by both enemy casualties and possession of Taka Castle. Special rules account for the Otomo cannon (a rare instance during the Sengoku of cannon being used in the field). Counters are rated for morale, combat strength (melee), and marksmanship (in this case, the arquebus). While the Otomo have the numerical advantage in overall combat strength and counters and a couple of cannon, the Shimazu have better morale and more leaders, making things more or less even. An enjoyable play that rewards individual skill.<br/><br/>",

It's a doujinshi (self-published) game similar in tone to the early SPI folio games-low numbers of counters, compact map, and an easy-to-learn game system used for all the entries in the series. The full name is &quot;Hetsugigawa No Tatakai: Toyotomi (Sengoku) X Shimazu-1587.1.20 (Êà∏Ê¨°Â∑ù„ÅÆÊà¶„ÅÑ: Ë±äËá£„ÄÄ(‰ªôÁü≥) X Â≥∂Ê¥•„ÄÄ1587.1.20, Battle Of Hetsugigawa: Toyotomi (Sengoku) Vs. Shimazu-1587/1/20)&quot;. In this case, the 'Sengoku' in parenthesis doesn't mean 'Warring States' (pronounced the same, different kanji) but rather is the name of the Toyotomi commander who provoked the battle with a foolhardy assault.<br/><br/>After responding to a request for aid against the Shimazu by the Otomo, Toyotomi Hideyoshi prepared a huge army to take the island of Kyushu. His vanguard consisted of forces from the Sengoku and Chosokabe (around 20,000 in all)-they entered Bungo province in NE Kyushu and were instructed to stay on the defensive until the Toyotomi main body arrived. Instead, samurai being samurai and not inclined to listen to anyone, Sengoku Hisahide decided to attempt the relief of nearby Toshimitsu Castle (then being besieged by the Shimazu). The Chosokabe protested but eventually joined the assault, figuring that if Sengoku was determined to go through with the assault it would be better to join in than to sit by doing nothing. However, the Shimazu were aware of their advance and increased their efforts to take the castle, laying claim to it before the Toyotomi forces arrived. Undeterred, the Toyotomi forces (also with elements of the Otomo and Sogou, about 7,000 in all) gathered for battle on the 12th day of the 12th month of the 14th year of Tenshou (January 20, 1587). The Shimazu (with a large number of allies from the Ijuuin, the force adding up to about 15,000) provoked an attack with a feigned retreat (a favorite Shimazu tactic), luring the Toyotomi into an ambush and routing their forces. The Toyotomi withdrew from Bungo and this was to be the high point of the Shimazu-things would be far different when the Toyotomi main force arrived.<br/><br/>The battle is played out in eight turns. Victory is determined by both enemy casualties and possession of the two castles on the field. Counters are rated for morale, combat strength (melee), and marksmanship (in this case, the arquebus). The Toyotomi forces face a tough fight as they're outnumbered almost two to one by a Shimazu force with superior morale. Thankfully, they aren't required to be be as stupid as Sengoku Hisahide.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BACKGROUND: By Fire and Sword is semi-historical simulation of the Thirty Years War. The game begins just after the Bohemian Revolt where the very Catholic Ferdinand II (future Holy Roman Emperor) of Austria was elected to the Thrones of Bohemia and Hungary. Many Protestants felt they would lose their religious rights and a small revolt occurred. This revolt soon spread as other Protestant leaders felt emboldened.  The Player represents the Commander of the Protestant Forces with the goal to overthrow the Holy Roman Empire. As the Commander of the Protestant Forces, you must control a significant number of Cities and Towns throughout Europe before the last Campaign Card is Played.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the Protestant Forces. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 16 Cities and 14 Towns before the &ldquo;Peace of Westphalia&rdquo; Card is Played. If the Catholics control 16 Cities and 14 Towns at the end of their Turn, the Holy Roman Empire wins.<br/><br/>By Fire and Sword is a fast and fun game with lots of colorful game counters representing the various military units of the time, including Pike &amp; Musket, Musketeers, Cavalry, Cuirassiers and Cannon. Major leaders of the war are represented and lead forces on the map. Battles and Sieges have, almost, a &quot;miniatures&quot; feel to them as they are resolved on a Battle Mat.<br/><br/>GAME MECHANICS: The Player moves his Leader Counters on the Map along with their Troop Points. If a Battle occurs, Troop Points are exchanged for Tactical Units and combat is carried out in a Tactical manner on a Battle Mat. If there are any Reserve Units in the &quot;Play Area&quot;, he may add them to a Battle Force.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pickup season is open! All thanks to Demoralizer, a love battle where no holds are barred.<br/><br/>This card game by Krzysztof Miller overcomes the classic scheme of game for couples, and makes a perfect example of playing with the form and breaking stereotypes. The game can be played by 2 &ndash; 6 people, who have only one goal &ndash; to demoralize the opponents. Each player takes the role of one of the six available characters: Blondi, Gangster, XXX Actor, Vamp, Scientist, or&hellip;  Grandma. Each character is described by four indicators: sex appeal, composure, cleverness, and morality. The level of these features, however, can be changed while playing the game by the action of cards, which players use during gameplay, as well as a direct result of actions taken by the opponents. To perform a successful pickup, thus depriving the other player his morality points, the level of attacking player&rsquo;s sex appeal must be higher than the composure of defending player. Only adequate calculation and analysis of indicators&rsquo; levels can protect a player against demoralization.<br/><br/>The game is divided into players&rsquo; turns. Each player&rsquo;s turn is divided into six phases: discarding, drawing, activation, playing cards, seduction, and final phase. During the playing cards phase, players play on the table their cards from hand: action, helper, item, event or skill. To do this, however, a player has to pay the cost with his cleverness points. In addition, the character cards determine how many cards of a particular type the player can handle. Seduction phase is optional. A player may, but don&rsquo;t have to, try to attack any number of opponents during his turn. Futhermore, a player can attack not only with his character card, but also with helper cards, if he has got them. The same applies to defense.<br/><br/>When the level of player character&rsquo;s morality drops to zero, that player loses and he is automatically eliminated from further play. The game continues until only one player remains and becomes the ultimate demoralizer.<br/><br/>Demoralizer is a game for those who in the heat of battle do not forget about strategic thinking. Thanks to unique characters&rsquo; features, playing each of them requires a slightly different approach. The differences in the attributes determine strategy - sometimes player's attacks will be more frequent, or on the contrary - he will have to raise composure level and wait for the right moment to pickup the opponent.<br/><br/>The average gameplay takes approx. 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>",

The 4 tokens must be found and placed on each player character sheet in order to a player (or players in coop mode) be able to chalenge the vilain in the end phase of the game.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>To move around, in the begining of the turn, a player must take a random encounter card that tells wich character (good or bad) he encounters in his voyage. These cards must be resolved first according to the symbols printed on them. After this, each player moves its marker the number of spaces indicated on that same card.<br/><br/>Players then explore the boards turning the tokens around and seeing what lies beneath, looking for their 4 objectives.<br/><br/>Hidden beneath the tokens may be be good things, objects or enemys. Players use the power of food and good nutrition to overcome obstacles trought matching food cards color sequences.<br/><br/>MEANWHILE<br/>At the same time that players ares trying to find their objectives, the clock is ticking and they have only 10 rounds to prepare for the final battle against the bad guy....he has is hown character sheet that plays automatically against the players.<br/><br/>Players must find their objectives and at the same time try to find out the villains hidden location in the factory for the final battle, if they fail to do this, even if the their objectives are met, the bad guy wins the game.<br/><br/>THE STORY<br/>Our story takes place in a land called NUTRILAND, where food had enormous powers, called NUTRI-POWERS. People lived happily and had a healthy and balanced life. The big NUTRILAND FACTORY, managed by MURDOCH and a team of good nutritionists, led by NEUS, made ‚Äã‚Äãthe processing and distribution of food to the entire population.<br/>ALEX GRAND, the terrible villain, seized control of his father&rsquo;s factory with the help of NOSE, a despicable bootlicker and his right arm, and subverted MURDOCH&rsquo;s dream using the Factory to produce and distribute GENEX-100, a caloric compound of his making.<br/><br/>Before ALEX destroyed everything, NEUS instructed its seven most experienced nutritionists to flee, so that each one would preserve a food group. Thus they became Nutri-Masters and created the seven kingdoms of nutrition where even today they retain the foods that were entrusted to them and the secrets of their incredible NUTRI-POWERS.<br/><br/>30 years later NUTRILAND became gray and entirely dominated by ALEX GRAND, which gave it a new name - GRANDLAND. The population forgot food over time and ALEX became an businessman adored by all and the GENEX-100 the only food available.<br/><br/>Having realized ALEX&rsquo;s scheme, and having discovered the existence of food, TEO, LENA, BEN and NINA take on the exciting mission to discover the seven kingdoms of nutrition and restore food diversity to GRANDLAND.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This intensely fun and spooky card game is based off the hit series &quot;Skeleton Creek&quot; by Patrick Carman. Just like the books, you must gather your friends and hunt for the ghost of Old Joe Bush! Be cunning, be careful and explore the mystery of Skeleton Creek...<br/><br/>The game starts with 4 cards being dealt to each player face down...one of the cards (placed randomly) is the Old Joe Bush card! At the start of every turn a player draws a card, they may then choose to play a card, but at the end of each turn a player may only have 4 cards in their hand. Each player must also leave their cards face down until it their turn. The game ends when the last card from the draw pile is taken. From there, each player (including the one that drew the last card) takes their last turn. The object of the game is to end with Old Joe Bush in your hand!<br/><br/>Use Night Vision to peek at another player's hand. Use Ryan's Journal to take the top card off of a player's hand. There are countless possibilities and strategies to use to capture the Ghost of Old Joe Bush!!<br/><br/>",

In the first mode, players assume the roles of reporters who are trying to get an exclusive scoop of UFO sightings in the Black Forest, an area of Germany.<br/><br/>Each player is assigned a color and a transmission tower. Their goal is to transport photographs with a hot-air balloon at locations in the state to their towers (transmitting the scoop back to their news agencies). Each player starts with one photo card, and take turns to roll a die, moving their card by the die's result. They draw new photo cards on a &quot;6&quot;. The reporters can deploy Stop Stones to stop other reporters from moving through. The first reporter to transmit back three photographs wins the game.<br/><br/>The second mode of the game is called Top Secret, which is played on the other side of the game board. The game takes place in the news agency and players are racing against time to dig out what the others know. Each player thinks up a secret word at the start. On their turn, they roll a die, move their marker by the result, and can ask another player for one letter of their word. Players get points for guessing another player's secret word. The game ends when one player's marker reaches the end point and the winner is the player who has the highest score.<br/><br/>",

A race to be the first to visit the Moon and return, players answer trivia questions about general science and the Apollo mission to move their golf tee pawns around the Moon and back to Earth. Progressive rules are provided to allow for play by novice astronauts.<br/><br/>Publisher's Box-Back Description<br/><br/>APOLLO is more than a game, it is an encyclopedic work devised to acquaint adults and young people with some of the fundamentals involved in a voyage to the Moon and facts about subjects such as geography, astronomy, units of measurement and practical physics.<br/><br/>The principle of the game is for each player to pilot his Apollo spacecraft from Cape Kennedy to a landing on the Moon and return to the good Earth with a sample of the lunar surface.<br/><br/>Dice are used to tell a player how far to move across the board on each play, providing he doesn't encounter a flight problem during a critical maneuver. There are 270 questions (with answers) which are used to overcome these problems. Typical maneuvers include landing on the Moon, re-docking the Lunar Module with the Command Module and Earth re-entry.<br/><br/>The game will add useful information to each player's bank of knowledge whether he is a fourth or fifth grade student or a professional person in a technology. The unique design of the game allows persons of these different ages and experiences to play the game together with the same degree of challenge and interest for each player. This variable level of play allows the less experienced to progress as they become better acquainted with man's space accomplishments and other topics.<br/><br/>We're sure you'll enjoy our approach to provide excitement and challenge with practical educational material.<br/><br/>",

The two players each get sets of characters (fighters, thieves, and mages) of specified levels and run them through short adventures. The characters may have to confront some monsters and traps, but primarily they fight each other while trying to complete the scenario objectives.<br/><br/>One twist in this game is that each player has their own copy of the map for the scenario being played and cannot see the opponent's map, so the game is played double-blind. A game master is required to mediate; the GM tells each player when they can see the opposing characters. (The GM may also do other things to spice up the game at their discretion.)<br/><br/>Another twist is that the scenario maps are 3D - the game comes with many sheets of cardboard which can be cut apart to make floors, walls, and doors. It also comes with stand-up cardboard figures for the characters and a large number of item and spell cards.<br/><br/>",

Any player can take pick it up if he can swap it with the represented letter.<br/><br/>The Points are calculate when one player have no cards on his hands; He gets 0 points and the other players count the value on the cards they have on their hands. Then the next round can start.<br/>If a player gets 100+ points he is out of the game. The game continues untill only one player is active.<br/><br/>",

The colony of Simiopolis will provide the Simi II and its passengers a place to live. The planet has different types of terrain that include the 3 resources needed to build structures. Unfortunately the engineers have not been given enough time to study the terrain and confirm it's ability to support the massive structures. The crust of the planet is rather thin. Lava like material and massive caverns are occasionally discovered when heavy buildings are built.<br/><br/>The race is on. Who will build the most and highest quality sections of the colony on Simiopolis?<br/><br/>Players work outward from their starting tile by Exploring new terrain tiles, Excavating tiles, Expanding onto the tiles and strategically Exterminating previously expanded tiles.<br/><br/>Players gain points for building (Expanding) structures on tiles, building on the most of each of the 5 types of terrain tiles, for each complete set of 5 terrain tiles they build on and for bonus points received from specific terrain tiles. <br/>Last round starts when a player has built all of his sructures or when two stacks of terrain tiles have been explored. The Engineer with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The greatest rewards can be found to the far west in the C sector, but they are also the hardest to reach as they require long journeys across the sea.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 3 vikings on the board, 2 steel and 2 food tokens, 5 ship tokens and 12 vikings in reserve, and 10 shield tokens.  During each turn players will each have 7 action points they can use for movement, harvesting resources, razing villages, building ships and sailing, constructing runes to the gods, and attacking each other, all of which offer varying victory point margins.  Many of the actions require resources and troops to complete, requiring players to plan ahead in order to carry out their turns.<br/><br/>The game is driven by an event deck of 32 cards.  At the beginning of each round one card is drawn from the event deck, some random events will help all players and some will hurt all players, most of the events are Crusader cards that correspond to the 3 sectors.  When a Crusader card is drawn a die is rolled  for its corresponding sector and a Crusader shield is placed in that village, players can destroy the Crusader shields for points and are encouraged to because if a 7th Crusader shield is ever placed on the map then all players lose the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player places their 10th player shield on a village, or when the event deck runs out.  Players then tally their points for player shields, Crusader shields, vikings and ships on the board, runes, money, attack tokens, and so forth, and whoever has the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 3-Wide you decide how far to push your drivers abilities and the endurance of your race cars as you plot the strategy for a team of race cars.  Winning a race requires a combination of speed, tactics, planning and skill.  You will have to play the right tactics at the right time to improve your track position.  Each race car driver needs to decide if they should throttle back and save fuel, or scorch their tires making a charge to the front.  Will you risk a wreck, or play it safe?  Will you try a bold fuel strategy, or pit with the rest of the field?  3-Wide puts you in the driver's seat, and on the crew chief's pit box!<br/><br/>Each tire of each car has four levels of wear.  These tire wear levels in turn determine the custom colored dice that you will roll to determine the speed of your car.  As the team owner you have a hand of tactic cards which can be played on behalf of your team cars.  Successfully playing tactics is dependent upon the location of other cars around your car, and the timing of when the tactic cards are resolved.  Driver skills are precious resources that can be used to avoid a nasty situation on the track, or to exploit an opportunity on pit lane.  Pit stops become necessary as your tires wear away, and as your fuel gauge is nearing empty.  Planning a good fuel strategy can be vital.<br/><br/>Eighteen different race tracks are modeled in terms of configuration, braking zones, tactical card deck composition, tire wear, and fuel consumption.  Each track also features two different race lengths so you can play a short game or a long one.<br/><br/>Winning is everything, but if you don&rsquo;t come across the line first maybe you can console yourself with how well your team did overall.  You can also string together a series of races and have a championship season!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION: Trench War is a solitaire game of Combat in the muddy trenches in France or Belgium during World War I. The player assumes the role of a commander of an Infantry Platoon during its grueling and miserable turn in the Trenches before they are relieved. As the Platoon Leader, you are responsible for securing your Sector of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: The objective of Trench War is to successfully survive a Tour in the trenches along the Western Front during World War I. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations in the Trenches. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Trench War&rdquo; Cards and once all Trench War Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: Trench War features plenty of colorful Game Counters, Map and Battle Mat, used for resolving Combat. The Game provides plenty of grim themes associated with the War in the Trenches. Counters include Infantry Soldiers, HMGs, Flamethrowers, MK-IV Tanks, A7 Tanks, FT-17 Tanks, Pillboxes, Aircraft, Sub-Machineguns and Light Machineguns.<br/>If you enjoy movies like &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, &quot;The Lost Batallion&quot;, &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, &quot;Westfront 1917&quot; or World War One in general, you will enjoy this game.<br/><br/>",

Each turn a player takes actions with one piece. An action is moving one square forward in the direction facing, turning the ship 90 degrees or firing the long range guns. Gunships have no long range guns, Warships have them with a range of 1 square forward and Commandship long guns can fire with a range of 2 squares forward. Gunships have up to 4 actions when moved, Warships have 3 and Commandships have 2.<br/><br/>To deepen the strategy each side has 5 command tokens that one can be used during a turn to give a ship an extra action. Another strategy element is that when you lose Warships or Commandships you may be able to bring a destroyed ship back to board as reinforcements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Meazy N More! is essentially a game system, comprising 144 dice &mdash; 36 for each player, 6 each in 6 colors.  You can play with two copies of the game to allow 5&ndash;8 players.  An unusual feature of this game system is that there are core rules that all the games use.  The core rules instruct players to roll their dice, form legal combinations for the game they're playing, then put their unused dice back in their &quot;rolling bins&quot;, and pass them to the left.  Each such round of veritable drafting is called a &quot;shake&quot;.  Shakes continue until someone wins the game.<br/><br/>Meazy N More! comes with rules for four games built upon those core rules:<br/><br/>     In Eazy Meazy (30 minutes, ages 5+), you must build a &quot;pyramid&quot; of dice: 1&times;1 though 6&times;6; however, each &quot;level&quot; of one number must be a different color, and once a die is assigned to a level, that level's color is locked.<br/>     Not So Eazy Meazy (30 minutes, ages 5+) differs from Eazy Meazy by allowing the player to choose on the fly which number goes in each level; rearranging is completely legal.<br/>     Meazy Street (90 minutes, ages 8+) is the featured game (ages 8+). In addition to forming a pyramid, you must form a &quot;straight&quot; and a &quot;rainbow&quot;, but these things must be done in a particular sequence. Unlike the previous two games, you calculate your score for the round based on the combinations you form.<br/>     Splitting Headache (90 minutes, ages 8+) is billed as a bonus game. In this game, you try to form the four different types of &quot;splits&quot;, after which you may work to form the &quot;banana split&quot; out of the remaining dice. You calculate your score for the round based on the splits you formed by the time the round ended.<br/><br/><br/>Further games for the system will be released as expansion packs and/or downloads from the publisher's website.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are a farm owner at the end of the XIX Century, but in a pretty weird world, after weird experiments vegetables have come alive and crazy events can make your plan change in a second. Plant crops, buy animals, ghater resources, manufacture products, construct buildings, achieve missions and get those Victroy Points to Win.<br/><br/>There are 5 basic resources (tomato, raspberry, wood, wheat and Corn). You start the game drawing 5 resource cards from the Resource deck, drawing 1 Annual Mission (1 mission/place card and 2 mission/order cards) and drawing 1 Reward Card. Also you place your mini-gameboard in front of you. Resources pay everything, wood for buildings and different costs for Manufacture products and buying/feeding animals.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each season, you fulfill your hand till have 5 cards, but of course this are randomly drawed from Resource deck, and you cannot give it all to random cause you have only 4 season to complete &quot;on time&quot; your mission, and receive the bonus and a Reward card, and there is when Planting crops become important.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each year, each player receives a new annual mission by drawing a mission/place card and 2 mission/order mini-cards. To obtain the bonus specified by the mission/place card as well as a reward, both missions/orders must be completed in time (by the end of the year.).<br/><br/>Each Resource card have the &quot;cost&quot; of planting the crop in the upright corner (i.e Tomato have 2), so to plant, just place a resource card/crop on the table and discard the cards necessary from your hand. ONE token is then placed on the first blank space, in the next turn you place another token or harvest if ready (The crop is ready for harvest on the turn after the last token has been placed). The harvested crops represented by tokens are placed in their corresponding space in the barn, and the card return to your hand.<br/><br/>Each card lists the products that can be manufactured that resource. To manufacture simply pay the cost using either resource cards, and/or resources token stored in the barn, (the cards used go to the discard pile and tokens used are back to the token pile). Then place a token on its corresponding place on the shelve. You may manufacture as many products as desired (or posible) per turn.<br/><br/>There are 2 kinds of buildings in the game. Common buildings (Stables, Dairy, Henhouse, Sheep Yard), each player can build his own.  And uniques buildings (Train Station, General Store, Inn, and Workshop).<br/><br/>The game ends after 12 rounds/seasons, after which the player with the highest amount of victory points wins. Victory points obtained during the game (by completing missions) are added to the points given by Resources,  products and buildings.<br/><br/>",

After the army had been by-passed in the attack of Berlin starting April 15, it became encircled and contained by Russian forces who would deal with it later. However, the Russian units containing it were minimal and found themselves in a precarious situation between the German 9th and 12th Armies. In the Halbe region, west of Berlin. The Americans were west of the 12th Army at the Elbe River and instructed not to advance further. The German forces of the 9th Army were threadbare, yet, determined to move west towards the Americans for better POW treatment. Hitler had ordered 12th Army (also threadbare) to attack east towards 9th Army. That order was ignored. Thus, the last remaining strength of the 9th Army, some 50,000 men and AFV&rsquo;s struck west for 12th Army positions. In between, were Russian rearguard units, each with unclear orders as to how to handle this situation in this backwater of the Berlin area. Only 20,000 succeeded.<br/><br/>",

Some times this actions are imposible like &quot;wash your brain in oil&quot;, but should do something to satisfy Goo Zman.<br/><br/>Each player takes 2 cards (or 1 if there are more that 13 players), this cards must not be shown to other players. Only the player that gets the card named Goo Zman, reveals it so all players can see it.<br/>The goal of this player is to find as many Power Morfys can, and adquire the highest points posible, avoiding &quot;Skulls&quot; and negative cards. To do so, he must pick one player at a time to show one of his cards (the picked player choose one of his cards). Gooz Man will loose if he gets -25 points.<br/><br/>The players must decide if they want to help Goo Zman, or not. Since <br/>they can persuade him to being pick with lies or helping him giving clues to who he should pick, but never reveal their cards until they are picked by Goo Zman. If the player choose to show a negative card, this player will win if Gooz Man loose. If the player choose a positive card, the player will win if Goo Zman wins. When a player already had a picked card and must show his other card, the new card will be his win chance.<br/><br/>There is also an special card named &quot;Diabolo&quot;, this player will only win if he is not picked.<br/><br/>It's a very fun and crazy game that can last from 1 minute to 20 minutes.<br/><br/>",

You can grow your colony by building new hills in the openings.  All is well until one day&hellip;..  you encounter&hellip;  OTHER ANTS!<br/><br/>Soon it becomes clear that this is a contest for domination.  You must build an army for defense, and maybe an attack or two.  But you must carefully watch your food supply and the size of your army because of spoilage and fungus plagues. If you can exterminate another colony's home hill or build a great temple hill, all the other colonies will surrender to you and you will be an instant winner. Or if the forest is cleared first, you can win by having the most wealth.<br/><br/>Ants 4X is a diceless game.  This gives the players choices instead of relying on luck.  Battles are resolved by secret deployment of soldiers ants, simultaneously revealed.  Of course, the explore actions, by necessity, will involve finding random items.  Everything you find will be useful for something, but you may need to change your strategy.<br/><br/>Ants 4X is not an educational or epic game, just a fun, fast playing game that includes all the basic 4X actions, resource management and a dab of ant know-how thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Three Kingdoms is a turn-based, strategy card game in which players - playing as one of the major kingdoms/factions - compete to control the most spaces on the board.  Using elements of both Hand Management and Area Control, players are rewarded for both their ability to optimize actions and by strategically placing Unit Cards to gain points.  Some luck is involved through both drawing cards and unit placement, but players who can master their decks can dominate the battlefield..<br/><br/>Each kingdom/faction contains a set of 18 cards.  Unit Cards are placed on the Board and determine the end of game (once all of the spaces are occupied, the game is over) and the scoring (capturing other units or occupying spaces.  Strategy Cards allow for creating combinations and rule bending.  The 'Board' is made up of Terrain Cards and can be configured to any shape or design - presenting a new set of challenges, potential strategies, and time limit for each new game.<br/><br/>Players are limited to 1 action per turn: Draw 1 Card or Play 1 Card. But, certain cards allow for the creation of combinations and special rule bending - creating a lot of nuance and strategy as the game progresses.  TK is based on the Three Kingdoms period of China and the historical-fiction book, 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms,' by Luo Guanzhong.<br/><br/>",

The players take turn where they try turn a line by lining up with one of their tiles separated by the opponent's tiles. The players play until there is no more moves possible and the winner is the one who has the highest score calculated from the values of the tiles.<br/><br/>Extra tiles are special moves designed to change the tide in one or another's player favour. They are :stop, :swirl, :gold, :bomb and :star (described below).<br/><br/>A stop tile prevents an opponent to turn all tiles in a line up until the stop tile (included) rather than until the opponent&rsquo;s bounding tile.<br/><br/>A swirl tile turns all the opponent&rsquo;s tiles aside in all 8 directions plus all playable line up.<br/><br/>A gold tile behaves like stop tile but cannot be turn ever. It can be laid down at the beginning to add a handicap.<br/><br/>A bomb tile explodes the tiles aside in all 8 directions regardless of the colour. The tile itself can stay on the board for an added handicap.<br/><br/>A star tile gives extra points (e.g. 5 points) and cannot be turned ever but will not prevent a line up to turn.<br/><br/>",

Things quickly turned bad as the virus mutated and became immune to the existing antigen. Rather then accept responsibility, GenTech sat back hoping the virus would stop spreading.<br/><br/>Five years later, and nearly 75% of the worlds population has been affected. Some have been reanimated from the dead, others gruesomely mutated into something that no longer resembles a human life form. Pick your side. GenTech? Rogue military? Civilian? Street Gang? Private security? Government? Scientist?<br/><br/>Build your deck and try to survive one more day.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>Players must construct decks from predefined Base Decks along with optional expander packs to customize their chosen deck. All packs contain no randomization or rarity. Similar CCG themes are present such as playing cards from your hand, drawing from a draw pile and having cards discarded from play through various mechanics.<br/><br/>Various card mechanics allow players to draw additional cards, reduce an opponents hand, introduce survivors (your team), use zombies and mutants to harm your opponent and use defensive barriers and equipment to protect your survivors while trying to defeat your opponent.<br/><br/>Each faction has team members which have skill levels in certain skills. These skill levels give them access to &quot;doing&quot; things through playing cards which match their required skill levels.<br/><br/>For example, a Geneticist has a Skill Level of 3 and can create more powerful mutants then say a Lab Assistant with a Skill Level of only 1.<br/><br/>The end game is to defeat the opposing faction by using your survivors and equipment along with their abilities to either control zombies, engineer mutants or simply use brute force in this post-apocalyptic card game!<br/><br/>",

It debuted in the Bradley Games catalog of 1927 and was sold through 1933. A slightly larger but cheaper edition, at 10 cents, appeared in the 1943 catalog.<br/><br/>This is a simple spin and move game. Every player is the &quot;driver of a fire apparatus,&quot; represented by a simple wooden disc. The goal is to get from the engine house to the fire. Landing on an orange space sends you forward three extra spaces and landing on a white space forces you to take one of two multiple-space detours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Five Planets is a campaign and scenario pack for Quadrant 13 (Q13).<br/> Five Planets contains twelve scenarios set within the Pankova solar system as two adversaries fight over its priceless resources. The action begins on Peach, the outermost planet, a most desolate, moon-like place but the gateway to the system, then moves through the asteroid belt that contains huge amounts of mineral wealth to Cheteria, the ice planet. After Cheteria comes Three, the garden world that feeds the system, followed by D'Var, the desert planet whose sands conceal vast seas of valuable oil. Finally the campaign climaxes on fiery Adeen, closest to the sun, but the source of limitless power.<br/> The campaign is designed to be played through twice: with each player first taking the part of the race invading the Pankova system, the Attackers, and then taking the part of the incumbents, the Defenders. Be warned, sometimes the Defenders are attacking, and sometimes the Attackers are defending: as first one side then the other gains an advantage.<br/> Although written for Q13, Five Planets can be easily adapted for any sci-fi rules system. Each scenario contains a full game briefing, a map, and then a briefing for each player, including a description of the forces available. All players need to do is print off the appropriate pages for the scenario that they want to play, set up the battlefield, break out the figures, and away they go. As the army lists given are generic, players can use them to play any sci-fi army that they choose: whether based on a particular range of figures, background from another ruleset, background from a film or book, or even a background that they have made up themselves.<br/><br/>",

If a player, for instance, rolls a 5 he can advance to a neighbouring tile, that shows 5 dots, or he can go to a tile showing 3 dots and further to a tile showing 2 dots.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Aventura de Caboclo Bernando (The Caboclo Bernardo Adventure) is based in a true history of an unsung hero who saves many sailor lives at Brazilian coast of Esp&iacute;rito Santo at 1887 setember 7th.<br/><br/>This game mixes strategy, cooperation and the thrill of fighting a perfect storm. The players represent the fishermen at beach who should keep the rope firmly to help Caboclo Bernardo (a Brazilian hero) to save the sailors of a sinking ship and bring them safely to shore. The mission is dangerous, the fishermen may even injure themselves while pulling the rope from side to side to control it over the strong winds.<br/><br/>Also, an element of surprise can put everything away! Secretly, one of the players is an evil traitor who tries to sabotage the mission. He will try to cut the rope and pull it the wrong way, delaying the work of other participants until it is too late.<br/><br/>Portuguese edition:<br/><br/>Este jogo mistura estrat&eacute;gia, coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o do time e a emo&ccedil;&atilde;o de lutar contra uma tempestade.

        "description": "Characteristics<br/>With this game I tried to go a step further from what I tried to do when I created Dition, based on the same design philosophy. My intention here was to make a more consistent game, regarding to the formulation of its rules. I wanted the game to have two basic, simple rules. I was concerned about keeping the concept of simultaneity of actions at all times. Some features of GO, such as &quot;once a piece is placed, it can not move,&quot; are not really consistent at all times in the unfolding of the game, regarding the concept with which they were raised. I tried to get rid of all philosophical inconsistency at the time of defining the rules of this game.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>Pieces<br/>The pieces are circular. These pieces are characterized in that each has a range (a circular area whose diameter is three times the diameter of the piece). Each piece has one side painted white and the other black (like in Othello), and each player may chose one side (color) to play (then, the color of a piece is defined only when that piece is placed on the board, and keeps that color has long has its still on the board). Both sides have in the center a gray circle (its just decorative), whose diameter is equal to a quarter of the pieces' diameter. <br/>To tell if a piece is within the range of another, just take a piece and place it over the two pieces. If the piece used to measure is supported by the two pieces, one can ensure that a piece is within the range of the other (and vice versa).<br/>A total of 152 pieces are needed.<br/><br/>Board<br/>The board has two concentric squares: the peripheral (whose side is equal to 19x the diameter of the pieces) and the central (whose side is equal to 17x the diameter of the pieces). The peripheral defines the playing area, and acts has a neutral piece (&quot;gray piece&quot;). In this sense, the central delimits its range.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>    At the start of the game the board is empty. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player can do one or two &quot;relocation&quot; moves. If he cant, the game ends, and that player loses.<br/><br/><br/>Notes about the terms used:<br/>&quot;Belt&quot;: a group of pieces conforms a &quot;belt&quot; if every piece of the group is within the range of at least two of the other pieces of the group.<br/>&quot;Conditioned&quot;: a piece is not &quot;conditioned&quot; to a player when it is over the board, with his color facing the board, and since the group of pieces that are within its range (regardless of color) do not conform a belt. <br/>&quot;Relocate&quot;: a player makes a &quot;relocation&quot; move when he takes a &quot;conditioned&quot; piece from the board or from the outside of the board, and then places it on an empty place over the board or at the outside of the board.<br/><br/>",

When you move from one cube to another, you rotate the cube you are leaving, rotating it in the direction you are moving. If you rotate the cube you just left to the neutral color or your dragon&rsquo;s color, you get to move your dragon again. In this way, the mottled board slowly becomes green when the green dragon moves, then becomes red when the red dragon moves. The goal of the game is to be the first dragon to score 100 points. Points are scored when you are done moving for your turn. Each cube with your color face up at the end of your turn counts as a point, whether you landed on it this turn or not.<br/><br/>",

You compete with other gemcutters to amass the most valuable collection of gems.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a single random gem and the communal Market starts with three random gems. On a player's turn, he or she draws a random gem from the bag and adds it to his or her store. Then, he or she may add one of his or her gems to the Market to gain extra actions equal to the gem's value. The gems are valued 1-5, in order from least to greatest: amber, jet, emerald, ruby, and diamond. Then, that player takes 1 action (in addition any extra actions gained) in which he or she may: trade a gem with the Market, shape a gem, or add another gem to the Market.<br/><br/>When a player trades in a gem, he or she may take other gems from the Market less than or equal to the traded gem's value plus one. For example, if a ruby (value 4) is traded in, it is worth 5 and may be used to trade for a diamond (value 5), an emerald (value 3) and jet (value 2), and many other combinations based on what is available in the Market.<br/><br/>When a player shapes a gem, he or she places it on any of the three appropriate Shaping Tracks on the player aid. A gem may be Polished, then given a Fancy cut, then a Brilliant cut. A gem cannot be given a Fancy cut until it has been Polished and cannot be given a Brilliant cut until it has been given a Fancy cut. Polished gems are worth twice as many points at the end of the game. Fancy cut gems are worth triple and Brilliant cut gems are worth quadruple their values. However, it takes a number of turns equal to its value to be shaped. For example, an emerald (value 3) takes 3 turns to make an uncut gem into a Polished gem. Therefore, the more the points, the longer it takes to shape it.<br/><br/>When the last gem is taken from the bag, the current player finishes his or her turn and then the game proceeds to scoring. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players will use their hands of cards to create resources and currency so they can build various modules.

A unique aspect to Taudelon Station is that these modifications change the game for all of the players, not just for the players who own the modules.<br/><br/>Players&rsquo; hands come from a deck of cards that has five suits, numbered 1 to 9. Players will either play a combination of at least two cards that equal exactly 10 to create a resource (called Elements), or they will play a combination of cards similar to the various types of Poker hands (pair, full house, etc.) to create the currency (called Energy) that works with the resources to let players build the modules.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, unidentified aliens are swarming around the station, and while the game is fully competitive, the players all must defend the station against the aliens or everyone loses.<br/><br/>",

Three stacks of poker-style chips with answers to multiplication tables printed on them are placed in the center of the table. Each player is dealt five cards with single-digit numbers. Each player in turn tries to find two cards in their hand that can be multiplied to match the total on one of the three top chips. The player then captures that chip, discards the two played cards, and draws two new cards. They player may then try to capture another chip (up to three per turn). When the player reaches three chips or cannot capture another chip, play passes to the next player.  If a player makes a mistake and plays the wrong cards to capture a chip, the player must put both that chip and one previously-captured chip on the bottom of one stack and pass his turn. After all the chips are claimed, the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>There are a couple of variants which add extra rules, as well as a solitaire version.<br/><br/>",

You see one to four doorways (spots at the edges of the tile) leading out of the room. This suggests you are in a mappable location. You are obsessed with mapping, and of course have your cartography tools with you. Choose a direction to explore, and try to map all 60 rooms!<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Map the darkness!<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>     On each turn, choose a doorway to walk through (anywhere on your budding map).<br/>     Draw a room (tile), and place it face-up adjacent to that doorway, such that a doorway on the new tile matches with the one through which you just walked. If there are any other adjacent rooms, their doorways or walls must match: You can never have a doorway up against a wall!<br/><br/><br/>Game End<br/><br/>     If the room you drew can&rsquo;t legally fit, you have discovered that you have made a cartographic error, and you go into fits thinking about how you can fix your map!  You lose consciousness, and while you lie on the floor, your mind carefully blocks out the whole experience.<br/>     If, however, you place the 60th room legally, you are quite pleased with yourself, pack up your new completed map, and take a nap.  While you sleep, something gives you a mighty whack on the head and eats your map; you won&rsquo;t remember any of this when you wake.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Earth is a dead husk. Having mined all of its resources, facing a population many times that which could be possibly sustained and slowly mutating it into a massive, cloying, choking city, we had no choice but to set our greedy eyes on the planets around us and conquer new lands.<br/><br/>After the Information War of the 21st century, the Corporations dissolved national borders and began a new war of their own: the Resource War. Like their European ancestors, who conquered and fought over new land, the corporations started to clash for control of the stars around Earth, as if they had claims to them from the moment of their conception.<br/><br/>Thus began the new arms race, but this time the lessons learned from past wars would be embraced and used to leverage as much advantage as possible. Research into more advanced abilities to control not only the battles, but the hearts and minds of the people who fight them would become key to victory.<br/>Vanquish&nbsp;is a game of intergalactic warfare amongst rival corporations in Earth&rsquo;s dark future with a near endless number of system configurations and multiple paths to victory &ndash; through the council, through research of technologies and advanced abilities, via the creation of popular utopian worlds, or by the might of your powerful fleets.<br/><br/>Each player steps into the powerful and all encompassing shoes of the head of one of the five corporations fighting for the control of the universe. You will need to use cunning, guile, diplomacy, deception, and tactical thinking to make the decisions that will hopefully bring victory, control, renown, and respect to your corporation.<br/><br/>In each round of the game, players select four actions to perform. Players in turn perform one of these. Whenever an action is performed, all other players may also perform that action. The available actions are: Fleet (move ships), Research (develop tech), Council (Create votes on new rules), Planetary (develop your civilization), Energy (generate resources) and Logistics (build new ships). Players score points for colonizing worlds, developing tech, building colonies, passing votes and developing their civilization. The game ends when one player has accumulated 15 points, but that player does not necessarily win, as there are bonus points scored for being the best player in each of several categories.<br/><br/>",

Each pair finds a way to make physical contact that hasn't already been done in the game. If they succeed, they each earn 1 point.<br/><br/>Each player receives a quirk card that tells them one way they must behave during the game (e.g. &quot;Avoid Eye Contact&quot;).

Can you move your card without shifting the stack?  It's fun--it's quick.  It's Pick Stick Oh!<br/><br/>Pick Stick Oh! is a new twist on the classic Pick Up Sticks, played with cards rather than sticks.  Players are dealt cards and then take turns tossing them into a pile.  Each card must overlap another card.  After all the cards are placed, each player takes turns trying to take a card off the stack without shifting any other cards sideways (lifting up is okay).  Cards have point values from 1 to 5.  If a player takes a red 2 or 3 successfully, he or she gets another turn.  The player with the most total points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

This is mostly done by filling in a word, folding the sheet to cover it and passing it on to the next player. In the end the sheet is unfolded and read aloud to the amusement of the participants. As a variation, the words are asked for and filled in by a gamemaster, who doesn't disclose the original text until the very end.<br/><br/>Available topics were as follows:<br/><br/>     Series 1: Sekret&auml;r, Lebensart, Literatur I (Assistant, Lifestyle, Literature I) <br/>     Series 2: Inserate, Heilerfolge, Literatur II (Newspaper Ads, Successful Cures, Literature II) <br/>     Series 3: Historie, Biographie, Literatur III (History, Biography, Literature III) <br/>     Series 4: Steckbrief, Gerichtssaal, Literatur IV (Profile, Court of Law, Literature IV)<br/><br/><br/>The Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) design of the games may place them in the early 20th century (around 1900-1910).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the PDF<br/><br/>Welcome to The Belt!<br/><br/>In the 23rd century humanity has been cast to the stars. Hardy spaceship pilots mine the asteroid belt between Earth and Mars for raw materials. It's a dangerous job, but the rewards are generous as the Colonial Administration needs as much of the precious minerals as they can get to ensure the survival of humanity.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>The Belt is a game for two to four players where the objective is to mine as many asteroids as you can and get the rocks back to base before the end of the game. Each player takes it in turns to move their ship towards an asteroid in order to mine it (see Mining). Once the asteroid has been mined the player must move their ship to their base and deposit the asteroid chunks there before moving off to get more asteroids. Beware, though, because pirates roam the Belt and will attack any ship trying to move rocks out of the belt.<br/><br/>The win conditions can be set by the players. You could create a time-limit with the winner being the player who collected the most asteroids; or the first to get # asteroids wins.<br/><br/>Players take turns putting all the asteroid counters within the designated 'field', then the three pirate counters are placed in the centre of the board next to each other.<br/><br/>1D6 die is rolled on each players turn, which provides a random maximum move distance for them that turn. If ships come within 6 hexes of each other or the pirates they may get shot at. Once a player is on the same hex as an asteroid they roll a 1D3 and it takes that many turns to mine it successfully. A maximum of two asteroids can be held by a ship, it must then return to its base to unload.<br/><br/>Rules for targeting and firing on the other ships creates added tension, and repairs can also be affected but leave the ship vulnerable.<br/><br/>",

Questions are designed to stimulate discussion among family members, and there are two levels--for younger and older children.  If a player chooses not to answer the question or do the action drawn, he or she may go back to the original space and re-roll once.  If the re-roll also results in drawing a card, then the player must do the action on the card or go back to the original space and lose his or her turn.  The winner is the first player to reach the Finish space.<br/><br/>An advanced game adds a few extra rules, such as spaces where cards may be given to another player and the need to roll the exact number to land on the finish space.<br/><br/>",

It is an easy and creative way to involve children in learning activities.&quot;<br/><br/>Domino Discovery Fractions is an educational take on Dominoes, with the added element of requiring players to recognize and match equivalent fractions as well as fractions expressed as numbers and as pictures.  From a total of 40 dominoes, each player is dealt five and one starting domino is placed on the table.  In turn, each player must find a domino with a fraction that matches one end of a domino already in play, and play their domino against that one.  If they have not matches, they must draw from the draw pile until they can play a domino.  Play ends when one player successfully plays all their dominoes.<br/><br/>In order to play successfully, players must use their knowledge of equivalent fractions (such as 1/2 = 2/4) as well as understanding visual representations of fractions (such as knowing that a picture of a circle with one of three pieces colored in is equal to 1/3).<br/><br/>",

It was printed in an edition of 20,000 for the Hong Kong edition of the New City Reader which was created specifically for the 'Uneven Growth' exhibition on view at the Museum of Modern Art from Nov 22, 2014 to May 10, 2015.<br/><br/>Ideally, Symtactics is played with 5 players. All players must complete tactical interventions at 8 sites around the Hong Kong region while dealing with catastrophic events. Players can either play for a collective win, working together to beat an ever increasing inequality meter or they can play individually.<br/><br/>Interventions are created by matching resource cards to icons printed on the site hexes. A player must successfully match three icons or use wildcard resources as dictated by the current round's market situation. Once an intervention is completed, the resources used go into a pile as marked on the board. There are 8 piles that correspond to the sites on the map and another 8 towards the north of the board, corresponding to the development of global inequality.<br/><br/>",

After choosing a leader and moral cause that give special abilities to your kingdom, each player draws up to 7 random cards from their Kingdom Reserve deck. They travel through the Environment and scout the Terrain at the battlefield; these are event cards that alter the impending engagement. From the cards-in-hand (i.e. the Warband), each player may select up to 3 Warband Unit cards that face-off with a competing kingdom. After a simultaneous reveal, cards are resolved one-versus-one with additional Supply, Tactics, or Training cards from the Warband that are used to modify the encounter. Winning cards enter the Hoard. Losing cards are flushed into the Barrow. The game ends when the Kingdom Reserves are exhausted and the player with the largest hoard wins.<br/><br/>This game is targeted at the casual gamer and is a gateway to the more in-depth title Before Scotland: 750 AD - Empires which layers in a working economy and geographic constraints.<br/><br/>",

Your group, the mightiest heroes in Kalos, must stop this invasion.  After the invaders (and at least one deadly &quot;boss&quot;) are routed, only one of your number will be granted the title &quot;Exalted of Kalos&quot;.<br/><br/>Exalted of Kalos finds the sweet-spot in between several gaming styles.  It is easy to learn, even for beginners.  At the same time, experience and tactics play a vital role.  EoK plays much like a &quot;board collapser&quot; cooperative game - where the players work together against automated challenges.  However, it also gives each individual their own agenda.<br/><br/>Players each take control of a character with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Players must manage power and timing to make the most of their turns.  This is crucial, not only in surviving as a group, but in making themselves stand out individually.<br/><br/>",

The game allows a lot of interaction between the players, exactly what we want in foreign language teaching.<br/>The game is also very useful for getting rid of the usual shyness that many learners feel. The game is very challenging and educational.<br/><br/>The game Bang the Button is, as mentioned above, very complete and includes a variety of aspects, such as:<br/><br/>     vocabulary<br/>     grammar<br/>     communication<br/>     culture<br/>     movement<br/>     interaction<br/>     constant participation of all players<br/>     a healthy dose of competion<br/><br/><br/>",

It is historical in nature with a rich context and set of mechanics drawn from original sources.<br/><br/>The game begins in 750 AD and lets you play as one of four kingdoms who struggle for supremacy: the Angles, Britons, Gaels, or Picts. After choosing a Leader and Moral Cause that give special abilities to your kingdom, each player works through four seasons each year: planning, deployment, battle, and recovery. During planning season, you collect tax revenues, recruit troops, and identify battle targets. During deployment season, you muster Warbands, travel the environment, and scout the terrain. During battle season, you engage opponents in battle and resolve individual skirmishes. During recovery season, you pay maintenance, retreat units and reinforce adjacent territories.<br/><br/>Actions in each phase affect the outcome of the next phase. For example, by travelling the Environment and scouting the Terrain during deployment season; you will alter the engagements in battle season. The battle system requires each player to select up to 3 Warband Unit cards, from their hand, that face-off with competing kingdoms. After a simultaneous reveal, cards are resolved one-versus-one with additional Supply, Tactics, or Training cards from the Warband, and purchased during planning season, that are used to modify the encounter. Winning cards remain at the settlement. Losing cards are returned to the Kingdom Reserve and must be re-purchased to re-enter the game. The game ends after 5 (shorter), or 10 (longer), years of in-game play and the remaining player with the highest net-worth wins.<br/><br/>This game is targeted at the serious strategy gamer and it is an in-depth title that combines deck-building, a working economy and geographic constraints.<br/><br/>",

On their turn, they may either draw a card from the draw pile or take a card from another player's hand.  They then look in their hand for any pairs that make words (such as &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;boy&quot;) and lay them down.  There are also &quot;Higamus&quot; and &quot;Hogamus&quot; cards depicting the titular pigs that are worth bonus points but must be announced when drawn (so other players can draw from their hands to try to steal the points) and Krazy Kat and Holy Cow cards that deduct points.<br/><br/>A round ends when either any player runs out of cards or a player holds both Higamus and Hogamus in his or her hand.  Players score one point for each card they have laid down, five points each for Higamus or Hogamus and negative five points each for Holy Cow and Krazy Kat.<br/><br/>An alternate version of the game allows players to ask other players for specific cards and play either cards that form compound words or matching cards.  In this version, Krazy Kat and Holy Cow are a match as are Higamus and Hogamus.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game helps kids learn math by engaging multiple learning styles (Social, Visual, Verbal/Auditory, and Logical/Mathematical)  The game is won by collecting goal cards.  Goal cards are won by using mathematical operators to join cards in a grid into other cards which are set aside as goal cards.  The grid cards are revealed and re-hidden during the game, so there is a memory aspect as well.<br/><br/>The game can be played at multiple levels from early elementary (just learning addition and subtraction with two digit numbers) to teens who know multiplication and division well and are learning powers, roots, and the Fibonacci series.  Using a timer (not provided), you can handicap the game so that adults can play against young children.<br/><br/>The game teaches both regular numbers (1, 2, 3...) as well as Roman numbers.  All cards also use images of dice to help kids understand the connection between the abstract number and the quantity that it represents.  This can help anyone struggling with math, but it is especially helpful for certain special needs students.<br/><br/>The game was designed by a group of kids aged 10-15 as part of their First Lego League research project.  The game works well as a team game, if you have more than 6 players.<br/><br/>",

If there is already a chip there, they cannot choose that rolled die number.<br/><br/>A) If the chosen rolled die shows 2-6, that is the player's movement value. Move the pawn forward; each step costs as much as the number in the space being moved to. Repeat until you cannot move further.

Players will build and explore the small world of Myrtille and complete missions what can have some environmental impact.<br/><br/>The game is made of location card (river, house, beach, forest, garbage dump, shop&hellip;), colored pawns, objective cards (which indicates what pawns should go where), two dice (one with colors and one with numbers), and time cards.<br/><br/>Each player has one objective card and a few location cards. The four edges of each location cards have one of three colors.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, one location card is put on the table and will represent the board used by all the players. All colored pawns are placed on this card.<br/><br/>On its turn, a player rolls the two die, and uses only one of them.<br/><br/>If they choose the colored dice, then they add a location card to the board, that will thus get bigger and bigger. To do so, they have to place one of their location card next to a card already on the board such that both adjacent edges have the same color as the die. Also, if the new card is adjacent to more than one card, all adjacent edges must have the same color.<br/><br/>If they choose the numbered dice, then they can move one pawn using as many movement points as shown on the dice, each adjacent card using one movement point. They can only move a pawn whose color matches one of the pawn depicted on their objective card.<br/><br/>An objective card is complete when all pawns depicted on the objective card are on one location card matching the location of the objective card. The group as a whole earns the victory points printed on the objective card.<br/><br/>The game has a limited number of turn, which is tracked using the time cards.<br/><br/>",

From your hand and the two decks, two players go head to head placing players on their basketball team and defining the offense and defense.  First draw from the player deck and play a card, then draw from the coaches deck and play a card each turn.  Player cards will only score for you if they are played in the right positions on the court.  This results in free-throws, jump-shots or 3 pointers. The coaches deck helps you pick which offense or defense both teams are using. Use the REF card to remove your opponents key player just before the quarter ends.

You have only three days to keep Patient Zero alive and discover a successful treatment before it becomes a worldwide pandemic and all is lost.<br/><br/>The gameplay is simple:<br/>There are 4 Disease types infecting Patient Zero.<br/><br/>    Virus<br/>    Bacteria<br/>    Fungus<br/>    Parasite<br/><br/><br/>Patient Zero consists of 6 cards: Head, Torso, 2 Arms, &amp; 2 Legs.<br/>There is one single deck containing &quot;Positive, Negative, and Neutral Effect&quot; cards in 4 colors representing the 4 types of Diseases.<br/><br/>Once you flip cards to determine starting Disease Types...<br/>The turn order is broken up into 3 Phases:<br/>1. INFECTION<br/>2. RESEARCH<br/>3. TREATMENT<br/><br/>Gameplay is broken up into 3 &quot;Days&quot; being the number of times you cycle through the deck. If Patient Zero survives the end of Day 3, you then add your points based on how well your treatment was. If your score is over 100, you lose, treatment was a failure. If under 100, you win! Your treatment was successful and you can start manufacturing a cure! You saved the world!<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you roll the two dice, note the point total, and you have the option to roll both dice again to attempt to add more points to your turn's total.  You can choose to stop after any roll and add your points to the turn to your overall game's total.  However, if you roll a &quot;lobster&quot; or a &quot;turtle,&quot; you lose all points for the turn and your turn ends.  One final twist: if you roll both a &quot;lobster&quot; and a &quot;turtle,&quot; you immediately add 50 points to your turn's score, you add your turn's score to your overall total, and your turn immediately ends. The first player to 200 points is the winnter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Flags of Valour&rdquo; is a toolkit system for war game enhancement.  This particular release is Set 1, and deals with the German, Russian, and Finland forces of the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>FOV is a set of modules that extend the use of any counter based war game so that you can add both the often under-utilized practice of &ldquo;Fog of War&rdquo; OR that of higher level Intelligence Gathering and Logistics to virtually any simulation game.  The game tool is also used to represent hidden assets such as Ammunition Supply, Fuel, and other factors common to any higher level logistic advantages gained via logistical planning.  It is in fact this &quot;Level Over&quot; that FOV uses to bring new strategies and tactics to most war games without changing the underlying game rules. The level of  added realism this tool set provides is rarely found in conjunction with any other current game publication.<br/><br/>What the Flags of Valour systems all do is give players of wargames a way to remove most of your counters from the board at the start of any game, and replace them with national hidden placement counters.  Meantime you have a hidden area where normal game counters are kept on LUC (Logistical Unit Cards) until enemy recon or proximity force the regular unit pieces to be placed on the board and revealed.  This allows war games to start with a form of hidden movement and place that is traditionally thought of as &ldquo;double blind&rdquo; play.  Except in this case you can do the double-blind with only one central board (unlike the awkward and messy way that most double blind games take up a lot of room and require two copies of a board or a game).<br/><br/>Depending on the particular FOV release, some provide for additional hidden rules such as Strongpoints, Air Strikes, Guerilla activity, Supply Lines, and more. Add on rules are completely optional, and are left to the discretionary use of the players using the system.<br/><br/>Each FOV release comes with 2-6 nation state counters.  There are releases for many different eras available, but primarily the counter sets cover WW2 and Modern use.  There are also the &ldquo;125&rdquo; series of FOV releases for use with Miniatures games. Those use larger placement counters and much larger LUC (Logistical Unit Cards) on which to place miniatures hidden off the board.<br/><br/>",

Each meteor contained a monstrous, rock colossus that has come forth from its crater, hellbent on devastating the land.<br/><br/>As dire as a threat these Colossi pose, more than a fight for survival emerged once the rare and powerful Cosmic Ores that compose their bodies were discovered. These special ores are capable of producing weapons and tools of uncanny properties. And so, those guided by greed, power, new order, and even peace (to keep this commodity out of the wrong hands) have quickly assembled bands of warrior-miners to harvest this extremely valuable resource from the Colossi. These warrior-miners&mdash;known as Veinreapers for their ability to crack apart the Colossi through their rich veins of ore&mdash;have been equipped with special Pickaxes forged from Metal Shards scattered by the meteors&rsquo; impacts&mdash;the only metal able to penetrate the coarse flesh of the gigantic creatures.<br/><br/>You will play a band of Veinreapers fighting for the greatest share of Cosmic Ores. The outfit that mines the most ores will rise as the strongest power within Astralevia, taking control of the nation and winning the game.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>Players will take turns placing Veinreapers in Kill Formations against Colossi on the game board while collecting Metal Shards and forging the special Pickaxe that their warriors are equipped with. Each Colossus can only be killed and mined by Veinreapers placed in a specific Kill Formation. The number of Veinreapers engaged against a Colossus and the properties of your warriors&rsquo; equipped Pickax determine how many Cosmic Ores you mine from each Colossus. The game ends when all Veinreapers have been placed and the player who mines the most Cosmic Ores based on these placements wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Every business&rsquo;s worth and location in Synergy are randomly assigned based on game play, which allows every game to be different. During the game, players will have the chance to acquire businesses, improve their net incomes, and build up the value of their businesses. Each player&rsquo;s goal during the game is to finish their career with the highest net worth, which factors in the termination value of the player's businesses and the assets they have acquired over their careers.<br/><br/>Unique dice mechanisms are used to determine player movement and the net incomes of the acquired businesses and action cards are used to create significant shifts in the business landscape. Synergy allows a wide range of business strategies to be applied in a entertaining business simulation game. Each game of Synergy requires the player to assess the business landscape laid out during game play and make reactive adjustments to their strategy, just as they might in the real life business world. To add an extra layer of depth, the game is playable with two separate sets of rules - a Standard Version, for most players, and a Pro Version, for more experienced players who want a greater challenge.<br/><br/>",

This way he can try and clarify the various constructions and tactical maneuvers.<br/><br/>The game is built of two interrelated parts. In one you will be admiral of the navy. On one side are the English ships that need to transport military units in order to to take over New Providence. On the other side is the pirate fleet trying to stop them.<br/>If the British army is successfully transferred to the island it will have to face the pirate band's to repel their attacks and conquer in time three forts that have strategic importance for the conquest of the island<br/><br/>",

All this is amusing and fun, just by playing. Also competing games are in there ... and a portion hidden and open mathematics. The game manual is, however, completely without technical terms. IT is -  written for amateurs and still gives parents, kindergarten teachers and teachers' knowledge of logical and mathematical relationships and thus the background knowledge that facilitates the development of suitable game situations, which in turn develop and support basic skills for thinking of the children.<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/>There are different &quot;boards&quot; included (paper with geometric structures printed on them)<br/>Instead of the figures, stacks of 2 to 3 LEGO bricks are used. There are multiple games which can be played on these boards or without a board only with the bricks.<br/>Included is a 96 pages book full with different games for the material included, and hints for which age and school grade they are adequate.<br/>Some examples for the games:<br/>&quot;Nine mans mills&quot; rule<br/>A pachisi game with changing blocking rules<br/>A logical rule guessing game: stacks of 3 colored bricks.

If, on the other hand, players add little to the ship, it will fail and the player placing MOST on the ship will win.<br/><br/>The players start with cards representing goods at different values. Each turn, they may choose to place cards on the ship, inspect cards placed on the ship or replace own cards placed on the ship. When all four parts of the ships have been completed, the game ends and the ship is launched.<br/>  <br/>The challenge of Vasa Regalis is to correctly guess how much the other players add to the ship.<br/><br/>The unique mechanism of Vasa Regalis is the ambiguous victory conditions. The players can analyze the piles and draw conclusions but never be sure how to win. Should they add as much to a part as possible or as little as possible? They will not know the answer until the ship is launched but then it is too late to do anything about it.<br/><br/>",

However, you want to turn the time your way to have your season dominating the world.<br/><br/>When all your season tiles have been played to the game board or you have a majority of season tiles in one area, your season dominates the world.<br/><br/>The players take turn to play season tiles to one of six hexagonal areas, each of which has six season slots. The six season slots are arranged in a circle where each slot is adjacent to two other slots. The six areas are also arranged in a circle where each area is adjacent to two other areas.<br/><br/>Within an area, season tiles must be placed in seasonal order. Between areas, season tiles must be similar. If they are not, the later season will replace the earlier (e.g. Spring will replace Winter).<br/><br/>Besides placing season tiles, a player may turn one area clockwise so that new seasons end up adjacent to each other, resulting in one replacing the other. To really twist the time, a player may turn all areas counter-clockwise, resulting in several seasons replacing each other. However, since this turn is twisted, earlier seasons will replace later (e.g. Winter will replace Spring).<br/><br/>Once a season is banished from an area, it may not easily return, so the players will gradually increase their local dominance until a global winner emerges. To win Turn of Time, you must find the turns that brings most of your seasons to the board while blocking your opponents' opportunities to replace your seasons.<br/><br/>The unique mechanism of Turn of Time is the so called circular relation between the players where A is stronger than B, B is stronger than C etc. This mechanism, in combination with the revolving game areas, opens up in-numerous strategical paths. Should you accept being banished from one area to expand in another? Should you place your seasons so that they can attack easily or so that they are difficult to attack? Will the benefits of turning one or several areas outweigh the benefits other players may receive? Will you even be able to foresee all turns in the game if all areas are turned? You must find the answer yourself!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Air Traffic Madness is a game for 2 to 5 people where players compete to land as many planes as possible. Each plane will score a variable number of victory points plus bonuses depending on how challenging a runway you land it on. Each player secretly chooses three orders cards to issue to their planes, two direct orders and one general order. Then players take turns revealing their orders and moving their planes. The player who lands the planes that are worth the most VPs wins. Beware, there are events that occur every other round plus bonus cards that players can earn which will change the course of the game. Each player also has a few planes worth zero VPs which could be damaging to you if they crash into your high valued planes. Can you navigated the hectic air space and be crowned the king of the air traffic control?  Are you ready for Air Traffic Madness?<br/><br/>",

You've been appointed Governor of a small struggling settlement in the New World with instructions to explore and settle these new lands for the Glory of your King and country. However, your nation is not alone in these new lands. For your colony to survive you will have to bargain with the powerful Native tribes and deal with your Nation's enemies who also have settlements here.<br/><br/>The New World is a 4x tile laying game for 3-4 players set in Colonial North America. Players can either play the French, English, Spanish, or Dutch with the goal of building your empire and collecting Glory for the Crown. Since each game will feature random exploration by laying tiles, no two games will play the same. <br/>You will win this game by exploring, building your settlements by claiming and purchasing land from the Native tribes, and eventually coming into conflict with your country's competitors in the New World. All this will build up Glory Points in the name of your King.<br/><br/>The game plays quickly with each player on their turn having a choice of a single action from either:<br/><br/>1) Exploring: Paying to launch expeditions to place tiles, claim/purchase land, and placing influence markers (representing traders and missionaries) in the hopes of Allying and trading with the tribes.<br/>2) Economic Turn: Building up your Colony by creating new settlements, building Forts, repairing settlements that were damaged, maintaining troops, and collecting wealth from taxes and trade <br/>3) War: Eventually you will have to deal with the enemies of your King here in the The New World. If you choose this action this is where you will raise your armies and send them across the frontiers. Be forewarned though. War is not cheap. You will need a strong economy to wage successful war. There is only so much that the Crown can do to help your fledgling colony.<br/><br/>The New World is buffed by a large Event deck that brings out the historical events of the times. It also serves to pace the game by having Events that represent the Peace Treaties that ended the big European Wars that spilled over into North America. Whenever a Peace Event is drawn, there will be a few turns of truce and Glory Points will be awarded based on the number of Settlements, the number of claimed territories, and by your Alliances with the Native Tribes. Once 3 Peace Events are drawn the game will be over.<br/><br/>This game is rather unique by it's Exploration/Tile laying mechanic, it's quick engaging turns, it's streamlined easy rules including a nice combat resolution, the ability to bounce back from a disaster, and and a unique, more historical, representation of the native tribes.<br/><br/>",

Obstacles include things like The Bridge of Doom, Potato's House, The Beach, etc. Along the way, players will be instructed to drink, pick cards, and answer slightly humorous questionnaires out loud to the other players. It is designed to be interactive, socially and physically, within the players.<br/><br/>This game boasts 8 pawns in a range of colors, and one blue die, all neatly packed into a drawstring canvas bag to withstand the tests of time longer than the typical heat-sealed plastic bag most games include. This means your pawns and die won&rsquo;t be rolling around aimlessly inside the box once you open them. (Our pawns are made in the U.S.A. They are eco-friendly, filled with postindustrial wood trim.)<br/><br/>This game includes 52 Beer Cards and Bong Cards collectively, which are packed into a playing card box. Our cards are water-resistant and should clean off pretty easily if wet.<br/><br/>This game can be played while easily substituting alcohol with any beverage, using alcohol is an OPTIONAL part of this game.<br/>This game is meant to be played by those of legal drinking age, and is prohibited to be played by any minor. Some tiles include curse words, obscene ideas, and some offensive language and graphics in general.<br/><br/>",

Generals imagined it would be a quick Napoleonic-style war to settle nationalist and imperialist conflicts... but soon enough it became a nightmare. Hundreds of thousands suffered and died, as war raged for four years - from the trenches of Flanders to the steppes of Ukraine, from the mountains of the Alps to the deserts of Syria, from the depths of the ocean to the heights of the sky. No one had a clear understanding of how the war could be won. And in the end, it wasn't. It was only stopped for twenty years.<br/><br/>The Unwinnable War is a block wargame for 2 to 4 players. One or two players may play either side, the Central Powers and the Entente.<br/><br/>The game is PnP, i.e. all materials are freely downloadable. However, players need to provide their own components, including the 70 wooden blocks in order to play the game.<br/><br/>",

Some of the pieces are missing one or two of their corners. After a piece is moved it is inactivated (by turning it 45 degrees in either direction, or from square to diamond). When a piece is moved past an inactive piece it will push that piece back to its active state it if there is a corner of that piece in its path. Players capture (remove from the board) any pieces of their opponent's activated in this way. Their own pieces remain on the board, ready to be played again.<br/><br/>If a player has no more active pieces, they lose the game.<br/><br/>",

These cards will let you modifiy your rolls, make different characters easier to abduct, let you mess with other people's ships, and numerous other effects.<br/><br/>Characters have varying difficulties, representing how well you have to roll to abduct them. You start out with a 6 sided die, but you may buy larger dice with tech as the game progresses. Upon abducting a character, you may choose to brainwash them, netting you influence points, or you may choose to keep them contained to take advantage of their various effects.<br/><br/>Each time a character is abducted, the threat level goes up, representing how aware the humans are of your shenanigans. As the threat gets higher, so to does the difficulty of the game, as the humans start to retaliate or protect themselves in different ways. The game ends once the threat reaches 100, where the humans are finally acutely aware of your presence and ready to retaliate. At that time, each player counts up their influence points, and the player with the most influence points wins!<br/><br/>",

Game can be played in short amount of time or can be lengthy - you decide.<br/>Equipment: Game board, player pieces, sentence log, playing money, sentencing cards, appeal/parole cards and pair of dice.<br/><br/>User Description:<br/>Roll and move game where players go along the outer track receiving money for various life events, but also are at risk of being convicted of various crimes. Cards from the &quot;Sentencing&quot; pile determine how long a player must go to jail (i.e. the inner track) or whether they have received probation. Various spaces on the inner track (each circuit around being one year) also earn you money and random card draws may win you appeals, probation, or an overturn of your conviction. Score sheets (&quot;Sentence log&quot;) allow players to keep track of all the crimes they've been convicted of and how much time they've served for each. According to the game rules, there is no set goal; players must agree on a length of time to play or an amount of money to reach first.<br/><br/>The game is apparently intended as a criticism of the lenient &quot;revolving door&quot; of the U.S. criminal justice system, similar to &quot;Capital Punishment&quot; or &quot;Public Assistance.&quot; Although the game was made in 1995, it fails to take into account the then new but growing &quot;three strikes&quot; system in many states, as well as criminal court's tendency to impose harsher sentences on repeat offenders.<br/><br/>",

Some action cards allow players to swap identities, stumble players, nullify effects and even changing the scenario of the game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each game which is the revealing phase, each player is dealt with 3 Item cards which work as identities. Similar matched identities creates clan which introduce the leader system. Dominant leaders have higher abilities than any player in the game where they have the ability to use their member's cards which is the key to securing the outcasts. Ranks of each player plays the role of power and defence. Ranks are given to those who are worthy of becoming a leader.<br/><br/>In this game there is the Item Deck and the Action Deck. When the game starts, each player is given a choice to choose either drawing an Item card or an Action card. Then the player can either keep those cards or use the Action cards. For every player can only hold up to 3 cards in-hand, it forces players to a good challenge of planning and execution among members. This also leads to multiple strategic ways of winning the game. Backstabbing betrays can happen and so does denouncing friendships for a game! As much as sabotaging is a prominent factor of the game, it is also a heavy cooperative game that fosters communication among players.<br/><br/>After a number of clan members is reached, the game ends with a rank comparison with the outcasts and the dominant leader. The highest rank holder wins the game. With a draw as a result, the dominant team takes the victory.<br/><br/>Dominant Clan is currently in the process of publishing and is estimated to be released in late 2015.<br/>One of the first modern European card games designed by a Malaysian.<br/><br/>",

All multiples of 10 are colored in black. Fields 35, 56 and 68 show hurdles, field 77 a water jump. In clockwise order, players roll one die and move their horses forward accordingly. If a horse stops on a black field, the player loses one turn. On a hurdle the player looses two turns, on the water jump he's out of the game. The player who first reaches field 100 is the winner. If he however exceeds 100, he has to move back the exceeding number of steps.<br/><br/>A betting mechanism is built into the game: Each player has to pay 10 or 20 units to enter the game. Losing a turn costs 2 units, loosing two turns 3 units. Dropping out of the game costs 10. The winner takes it all.<br/><br/>German rules:<br/>1.

That which it has created it will eventually destroy. It is mindless, but all-powerful. The first of its creations to survive and assume intelligence consider themselves Its sons and daughters: the Excubiae. At the beginning of time, they worked together to seal away the Great Nameless, in order to protect the Realms they had created for their own progeny.<br/><br/>In true Shakespearean fashion, these siblings developed alliances and rivalries, and began working with and against one another, all while their Creator attempted to work Its way through their ancient seals...<br/><br/>In The Great Nameless, each player assumes the identity of their very own god. They lord over their own Realm, create miracles, and force their worshippers to do their bidding.  They may even manifest in physical form, greatly affecting the battlefield before them.<br/><br/>The game consists of different decks, tailored to each god, and a central, autonomous deck that represents the unstoppable force that is The Great Nameless.<br/><br/>Players race up and down a doom track to seal away their Realms from the center of the board, and work to help their allies and sabotage their enemies.<br/><br/>Players accumulate victory points for placing seals, destroying the armies of The Great Nameless, destroying the forces of their foes, and playing valuable cards of their own.<br/><br/>",

You only need 4 Board Tiles play. We will include several different pre-made adventures for you and your friends to play, or you can make your own! The board tiles are double sided, and you can lay them out in a variety of ways to build your town your way.<br/><br/>Form your Posse - Bad Lands is a co-op survival game for 1-4 players. While most players will just control 1 Hero per game, you can still quite easily have a larger posse. The more Heroes in the adventure, the more Villains you will have to face, and the tougher the game will be.<br/><br/>Kill Some Bad Guys - Bad Lands features a whole host of vicious Skinwalkers and minion beasts for your Heroes to vanquish. The core boxed game comes with a deck of 30 Encounter Cards. You draw a card, and it tells you what Villains are going to jump out and attack the Heroes.<br/><br/>Get some Loot! - Of course, no adventure is complete without cool rewards. When you defeat tough Villains, they will leave a Loot Marker behind. If your Hero picks one up, you can draw a Loot Card from the deck. Each Hero may carry an unimited amount of Loot Cards, but may only equip and use two.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rolling in the Money is an educational game designed to teach children to count coins and make change. There are two levels. In level one, players roll five &quot;money dice,&quot; (which have the names and values of US coins on each side, as well as an X, indicating no money). They then take the indicated plastic coins from the tray.  Next, they may choose to roll as many dice as they wish that did not come up with Xs a second time, and take the indicated coins.  They may then do so a third time. The goal is to get a total as close to one dollar as possible without going over. After each player has rolled, the player closest to $1 wins. Five rounds are played, and the player who wins the most rounds is the winner. This level teaches counting and adding coins.<br/><br/>In level two, each player starts with five dollars.  On each round they roll two money dice and pay the amount indicated to the bank by making change from one dollar. At the end of the round, the player with the most change left wins, and keeps his change.  All other players put their change back in the tray. At the end of five rounds, the player with the most money in his or her pile wins.  This level teaches making change from a dollar.<br/><br/>Level one offers a small amount of strategy (the press your luck mechanic of deciding whether to roll more dice and how many to roll) while level two is entirely luck.<br/><br/>",

Wires from switches for control run along outside bottom edge of the bridge walls.<br/><br/>The toy is battery operated.<br/><br/>",

Caverns &amp; Crystals is a worker placement game that relies on direct conflict between players as each tries to gather the most resources and build their tribe of Stone Imps to its maximum potential.<br/><br/>The board is made up of six hexagonal cards in a circle representing an asteroid drifting through space. As the game progresses (depending upon the turn cards that are placed in the center)three resources are placed upon the cards: Stone, used for spawning more members of your tribe, Metal, used to beat your opponent into submission and precious power crystals which will win you the game! By tactically placing your Stone Imps onto different Cavern Cards on the board you can dominate an area and ensure it is your imps who bring the crystals home. Be careful however, as somewhere in that asteroid there is a very hungry space squid placed secretly by another player that will devour your tribe and a vacuum that will eject them into space!<br/>Most importantly you have an Imp king leading your tribe who will give your imps a dramatic boost when used with forethought. At the beginning of the turn a set of six cards is passed around to each player who takes one secretly. Each card gives your king a power to use for that turn whether it is sneaking into an opponents home to take their resources or surprising your opponents by teleporting your tribe at the last minute. You will have to think very carefully as you select your card and ponder what your opponents have chosen.       <br/>Caverns &amp; Crystals can even be played Solo where it ceases to be a game of deducing your opponents' actions and becomes an intense puzzle where a player must be as efficient as possible to succeed. The Game Itself comes in a small tin ensuring it remains safe and undamaged between plays.<br/><br/>So do you have what it takes to build your tribe and Rule the Rock!<br/><br/>",

Instead of &quot;Bingo!&quot; the player shouts &quot;Pink Elephant!&quot; Winner of the particular game gets point chips from other player depending on circumstances. PLayers then shuffle cards and start another round.<br/><br/>Overall winner is player who has the most points at the conclusion of play. (The rules are nebulous on how many rounds should be played.)<br/><br/>Another twist in this game is how the squares to be covered are to be selected. Instead of a draw bag as in Bingo a top is used. On the tops spindle are placed two plastic discs. One red and one white. The top with the two discs is spun in the game box bottom which has a gridded board with various colored animals in it.<br/><br/>The red disc indicates what color of animal should be covered and the white disc indicates what animal. There are also provisions in the rules for covering multiple spaces. As an added twist it is acceptable to nudge the top to try and get it to throw a disc off in a particular direction!<br/><br/>",

But there are a couple of twists to the simpler game of Cootie.<br/><br/>To win a chance on getting a body part the player must win a spinner. The catch is that there is one less spinner than there are players. So in each round one player won't get a chance to obtain a Bandersnatch part.<br/><br/>The players all grab for a spinner when any player builds a hand of 4 cards of the same color. So there is an action/dexterity element to the game too.<br/><br/>Play begins with dealing 4 cards to each player. On a signal of go from the dealer all players look at their cards. If no one has four of a kind then each player passes card card face down to player on left. Again on go player pick up card and dtermine if they have four of a kind.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to roll as many joints from your boss&rsquo;s stash as possible.<br/>But what fun is that unless you get to dabble in the goods?<br/>By the time the clock hits 4:20am the player with the most J&rsquo;s is declared King of Toke!<br/>Just make sure you stay awake! Take too many puffs and risk &lsquo;greening out&rsquo;.<br/>Move around the apartment, gather Joints, feed the munchies by raiding the refrigerator,<br/>session up in the living room, or strip down and jump in the hot tub. The night is yours!<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Place the Board in the middle of the table. Place the time marker on the 4:20pm square of the time track.<br/>Shuffle the Kitchen, living room, Hot Tub and Bedroom card decks and place each deck beside the corresponding room on the board.<br/>Place the Joint tokens beside the board in reach of everyone.<br/>Each player chooses a character and takes the corresponding player board and avatar.<br/>The person who&rsquo;s the biggest stoner starts. If you can&rsquo;t decide who that is &ndash; play rock paper scissors to decide.<br/>The Starting player places there character on any room in the house (except the bathroom). In clockwise order each player places their character in any empty room they choose (once again, not the bathroom). Only one player can be in any room at the same time.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>The starting player takes the 5 dice and rolls them all. They can then put aside any die they wish to keep (this is called &ldquo;locking&rdquo;). The player has 2 rerolls (unless stated otherwise like in &ldquo;The Bedroom&rdquo;) so can roll the dice 3 times in total per turn. After your rerolls you apply your results.<br/>Each Turn Consists of<br/>Resolve room power on board if it states &ldquo;Start of Turn&rdquo;<br/>Roll all Dice. Put aside any dice you wish to keep (All clock dice are automatically &ldquo;locked&rdquo; &ndash; see below)<br/>Reroll (this is optional) any dice up to 2 times except &ldquo;locked&rdquo; dice. They must be put aside.<br/>Resolve dice (see below for results and order)<br/> The Dice Results are as follows<br/><br/>    J = Take one J token (1 per J)<br/>    M = Move. You must move to another location in the apartment. If it is occupied by another player they must move to your location as only one player per room is allowed. If 2 M&rsquo;s are rolled you do not move and must take a card from the room deck you are in. If 3 M&rsquo;s are rolled and you have no rerolls left you must move to the bathroom square. Your turn is over and disregard any other dice results except clock rolls. (do not collect J&rsquo;s or dish out puffs)<br/>    C= Clock. Time passes and for every C rolled the time marker moves one square up. Every C rolled is instantly &ldquo;locked&rdquo;. You cannot reroll any C results (unless a card states otherwise).<br/>    P= Puff. All other players take a puff and must move their awake marker up one square on their player boards.<br/><br/><br/>Order in a turn<br/>When applying results, do so in the following order.<br/>1               IF you have 3 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo; Proceed directly to bathroom , Ignore all other dice except clocks this turn. Advance clock if applicable and your turn ends.<br/>2               Take all J&rsquo;s<br/>3               Everyone else takes Puffs<br/>4               Move or take room card and resolve (if applicable)<br/>5               Advance clock<br/>6               End your turn. Pass dice to player on your left<br/> <br/>Bathroom:<br/>Nature called and you had to go to the bathroom. Damn, the locks broken.. How the hell do you get out you ask?! Getting stuck in the bathroom is no fun at all.<br/>As soon as you enter the bathroom lose 5 J&rsquo;s (they fell in!)<br/>Roll dice as usual but.....Bathroom rolls are a bit different<br/>No&rdquo; J&rdquo; results count when rolling dice, you can still make the others take puffs and the clock still ticks on as normal.<br/><br/>Escaping the Bathroom:<br/>The only way out of the bathroom space (unless you have a card)  is by rolling and &ldquo;locking&rdquo; 2 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo;. You must then go to any empty room in the house and play on as normal. If you have any rerolls left this turn you may continue to roll unlocked dice. Resolve dice normally at the end of your turn (ignoring the 2 &ldquo;M&rsquo;s&rdquo; used to escape the bathroom).<br/> Time / Awake Tracks / Game End<br/>If any players awake track hits &ldquo;white out&rdquo; that player has fallen asleep and is out of the game. If all other players fall asleep the last player awake is the winner.<br/>As soon as the time track hits 4:20am the game is over. All awake players add up their J&rsquo;s and the stoner with the most wins! If that is also tied the most awake stoner wins....<br/>If both J&rsquo;s and Awake are tied..... geeeze?!?  Play again!!<br/><br/>",

They travel together, appear on a planet, and cause nations to frenzy. Most recently, they appeared on Gallia. Players represent factions fighting for control of these Artifacts. Some want them destroyed entirely. Some simply don&rsquo;t want them in enemy hands. And still, others want to use their power to enslave the world. Players will have to build their teams and enter the battlefield. Lose, and you have failed your people, perhaps your entire civilization.<br/><br/>Skirmish Dice is a customizable skirmish game. Using powerful leaders, sizable brutes, clever totems, and more, players customize their teams and send them into battle. Units are represented by dice on the field, and each unit&rsquo;s corresponding card holds its actions, abilities, statistics, and more. The game is highly tactical and meant to move, meaning you can get the experience of a skirmish/squad level miniatures or card game in a smaller timeframe.<br/><br/>While the units are dice, the game doesn&rsquo;t suffer from luck-induced chaos. The dice faces are significant to character abilities and are rolled to receive offensive and defensive bonuses. It&rsquo;s streamlined and quick to learn, but the strategy runs deep as team building can offer hundreds of combinations within factions.<br/><br/>",

By early 1944, Army Group North held a front that bore the marks of previous battles; a long line built around Leningrad. Of course, STAVKA&rsquo;s Baltic Front planners were determined to break the hold and finally free the city. 1943 ended with Army Group North facing the Russian Third Shock Army. Fighting had continued unabated through a muddy fall, and on into the month of December. Although the Germans had successfully held their front, the fighting power of Armee Gruppe Nord had been greatly reduced. The dead and wounded landsers were replaced by Latvian, Estonian, and Spanish soldiers. When OKW pulled the 5th Mountain Division out of the line, without a replacement, the time had come for a shortening of the front. The result became known as the &lsquo;Panther Line&rsquo;.<br/>Welcome to the ATS CORE MODULES, all new for 2014.

Each turn comprises of three phases:<br/><br/>The Pre-Show phase - Where players draft wrestlers to their roster and buy special Booster cards (to both improve their Roster and to hinder their opponents). Each player draws a House Show card and books their wrestlers to appear in their show. Finally decisions are made about the outcomes of the various segments such as which wrestlers are receiving pushes.<br/><br/>The Showtime phase - Where players take turns describing (commentating) their Show and roll the dice to determine the results of the various Segments. Even the best laid plans and flawless booking can be undone on the night by bad luck, injuries or a crucially timed disruptive Boosters played by an opponent.<br/><br/>The Post-Show phase - In the aftermath of the show players vote to give the best General Manager award to one player. Additionally, gate receipts are calculated, Rosters reorganised and Wrestler&rsquo;s appeased.<br/><br/>The phases are played simultaneously by the players with the exception of part of the Showtime phase where players take turns to commentate on their own show and roll the dice to decide the results of Segments. During the each of the phases the players will have the opportunity to build a roster of wrestlers for their Promotion.  These wrestlers are further developed with Booster cards, such as pleasing moves, story lines, equipment and arenas, dirty tricks to play on rival player's promotions.<br/><br/>Finally each player will then book their Wrestlers into Shows and Pay-Per-View special events in order to gain Popularity Points (PP). At the end of each Post-Show phase, the players count their Popularity Points; the player who reaches the goal number (different for the different variants) has managed to impress Network TV bosses, signed a TV Network deal and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Flavor backstory:<br/><br/>The Enclave is a city of opportunity and adventure; a place to earn a name for yourself. It's treacherous surroundings offer endless chances to take on daring quests and slay fearsome monsters.Of course slaying monsters requires quality gear, and you won't just find it laying around. But no worries, there are always tasks to be done to earn some coin; such as helping the blacksmith forge some tools, or helping the Inn Keeper fix up the place. While the Enclave has always been known as a &quot;safe haven&quot; from the terrors that surround it, recently it's fortification has been tested due to a Dragon that has made home near by. Although adventurers do come through often, not many are brave enough to go toe to toe with a dragon. That's where you come in! It's about time someone stood up to that gigantic, fire-breathing, armor-like-scale covered, razor fanged, flying pest. No true Hero wants to share that glorious triumph, so your on your own. It's time to forge your legacy!<br/><br/>Gameplay Description:<br/><br/>Each player stars the game by choosing a Hero. There are 4 races to choose from, Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Orc. Each has a unique starting deck of skill cards and 1 unique trait card. The skills are Strength, Dexterity, and Focus. These will be the power behind your actions. Each side of the main deck has 4 revealed cards. One side represents outside the Enclave, the other represents inside it. You will use the cards in your hand drawn from your deck to interact with the revealed cards. This includes slaying a monster, completing a task, or buying gear. Your actions reward experience in the form of skill cards. These are collected and then added to your deck once you level up. You can either buy bigger and badder gear, or upgrade what you have. You can also spend all of the cards in your hand to gain a new talent card which is added to your deck. Once you feel your ready to go, you can face off with the Dragon. Defeat it, and you've not only won the game, but also forged your name in glory for all of eternity! Or at least until an expansion comes out with a bigger dragon....<br/><br/>What makes it Unique:<br/><br/>Experience: Unlike other deck-building games, you don't &quot;buy&quot; cards from the main pool and add them into your deck. Instead you complete tasks and defeat monsters to earn &quot;experience&quot; in the form of skill cards. Those are what get's added to your deck. How does more of the same card help you? Most importantly, adding MORE of these cards allows you to level up your character. This also gives you a chance to really fine-tune your character. If you want to wield a sword, you'll need strength behind it, and so completing Strength tasks earns you more Strength cards. The more Strength cards in your deck, the more often you will draw them. Also, the more cards in your deck, the more turns you can take before you need to rest (recycling your discard pile for your deck). There are also trait cards such as Relentless, Fearsome, Agile, and Clever. Each of these provides a different effect when played. At the end of the game, you've built a truly unique Hero with a unique deck of cards to power it!<br/><br/>Leveling: Each player only starts with a hand of 3 cards, which is then increased by leveling up your Hero. The larger hand size gives the player more potential power behind their actions, which is not only required to defeat the Dragon, but feels very rewarding.<br/><br/>Theme implementation: The tasks in the game are simple labor jobs but the skills required to complete them are intuitive and logical. For example, the Blacksmiths' task requires Strength to forge ingots while the Alchemist' task of preparing potions requires Focus. This helps eliminate that disconnect many deck-building games have.<br/><br/>These are just some of the many unique mechanics that make The Enclave a deck-building game that we feel truly stands out among the rest!<br/><br/>The game is set to release at the end of April, 2015.<br/><br/>",

The assignments indicate how many dice are rolled for each corresponding challenge type and what face results constitute success when the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>Play then proceeds in rounds where each player takes his turn. 2 and 4 player games last 8 rounds while 3 player games last 9 rounds.<br/><br/>During their turn players can choose 2 of 8 possible actions (some actions can only be chosen once)<br/><br/>1. Visit the Guild Healer (pay gold to remove wound tokens)<br/>2. Draw Guild Stipend (gold) (only once per turn)<br/>3. Buy an Item Card<br/>4. Buy a Spell Card (if you have a skill card that allows this)<br/>5. Visit the Guild Sorcerer (pay gold to charge a spell)<br/>6. Draw 2 Secret Objective Cards (keep 1 or none)(only once per turn)<br/>7. Play a Guild Card for its Guild Event text<br/>8. Attempt a Mission Contract Card (only once per turn)<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to accumulate Influence Points (IP). Influence Points can be gained by either successfully completing Mission Contract cards or buying influence cards at the end of the round during the Influence Bidding Phase where cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder.  Each influence card has an IP value and a unique passive special ability that can help the player out during the game.<br/><br/>Mission Contract cards are at the heart of the game and represent assassination targets that the guild has available for its guild members. Players can play Guild Cards face down before the round begins to the revealed Mission Contract cards on the table in order to help their own or hurt their opponents' chances of accomplishing the mission. Missions vary from level 1 to 5 and offer an array of rewards from Influence Points to gold and additional ability die. However, the greater the rewards, the higher the risk that your assassin will be wounded or fail the mission. Take too many wound tokens and you are out of the game.<br/><br/>Each mission is composed of a chain of challenges corresponding to the 4 ability types on the player cards i.e. combat, stealth, etc.. Players determine the level of the challenge (number of successes needed) from the contract card and then select a challenge card from the top 3 revealed cards of the Challenge Deck.  The challenge card indicates the type of challenge and the pass/fail rules.  Players roll the appropriate number of dice, use Guild Cards, Item Cards, Skill Cards, Spell Cards and fate tokens (rerolls) to modify the results and hopefully win the challenge. Players can press their luck along the challenge track to earn better rewards but must be careful as a red skull challenge that is failed means that the mission is failed and all rewards are lost. Sometimes things just don't go well from the start and the player may elect to abort the mission.<br/><br/>Players also have the opportunity to use Guild Card Interrupts to take actions during their opponents turns to disrupt their carefully laid assassination plans.<br/><br/>When the last round finishes players add up their IP from their completed Mission Contract cards, Influence Cards and completed Secret Objective cards(uncompleted cards penalize the player). The player with the most IP wins and becomes the Master of The Assassins Guild in Vance.<br/><br/>",

Players initiate &quot;scrambles&quot; where they roll specially-designed &quot;target dice&quot; to create a target number, then roll &quot;number dice&quot; to see if they can score under that target number. If they do so, they can move their marker a specified number of steps up the mountain. They can choose to gamble and continue their &quot;scramble&quot; until they fail to meet their target.<br/><br/>If the target roll is not met, they will fall back to where they started at the beginning of their turn. Additionally, they must pay a penalty. These penalties are devised at the start of the game by the players and provide the &quot;party&quot; atmosphere, since penalties can be things like &quot;Wash one dish in the sink,&quot; or &quot;Run around the room 10 times.&quot;<br/><br/>Players also have three chances to knock a player's marker back down the mountain. This action, combined with the supposed humorous nature of the penalties, provides as the box says, &quot;An extremely unique and wildly intense party game for two to six players.&quot;<br/><br/>According to the interior of the rule book, the first printing of this 1991 edition was of 3000 copies.<br/><br/>",

Unit's and counters represent squads, individual tanks, support weapons, crews, etc.<br/><br/>This game can be played either stand alone with miniatures for 15mm, GHQ, or HO miniatures. The company also has several hex map and counter add on modules that can be used for more traditional non-miniatures based play.<br/><br/>DOV is a fast paced set of game rules that strikes a good balance between realism in war game simulation play and playability. Unit cards contain detailed weapons, vehicle and nationality based attributes that give players a crisp experience of the small scaled fighting realities of that historical era.<br/><br/>When combined with the add on modules for Flags of Valour, this system also integrates with a new kind of Fog of War set of mechanics never before used in war gaming.<br/><br/>The base rules are an 80 page booklet, 12 page data book, Command and STRAT cards, along with a sheet of control and marking counters for Unit Status.<br/><br/>Comes with data cards on the vast majority of German, American, Russian, British, and Commonwealth troops used during World War 2.<br/><br/>",

So, feel free to explore this dazzling zoo and look how colorful our zoo is, and make sure that you won't feel dizzy after visiting our zoo. Have fun!<br/><br/>Dazzling Zoo is a game that need players to recognize different conditions the next card shows on its back. There are 3 conditions on each card's back, which is 'animal', 'animal's color', and 'living place'. Once the zoo face shows up, player need to figure out the right answer and touch the right tile as soon as possible. However, players should also beware of trapping situation, that if the zoo face is exactly the same as the answering tile, the right tile immediately becomes the wrong tile. Therefore, it is not a game for the quickest player, but for the player with cautiousness as well.<br/><br/>",

If you get the questions right you score extra points in the game, with a bonus if you collect sets of 3 of the card types, by getting all three questions on a card correct. If you do you keep the card and add it to you set of those cards. There are also no double or triple words score blocks on the board, but point amounts for placing a vowel or consonant on a specific place on the board. The board looks like a Scrabble board, but the scoring just works different. The tiles also have a score amount as stated on the board. I would so think of this game as Scrabble, but with more bells and whistles.<br/><br/>",

Whoever scores the highest Reputation (your score) after a pre-set turn limit wins. Lots of things influence your Rep - you lose it when Cons (prisoners) escape, or get injured, paroled, or other things. The MegaJail Inc. management also dislikes you spending too much cash, so keep an eye on your budget!<br/><br/>You get Cons in a draft at the beginning of each turn.

Finally News Events happen, Cons may act out, and a new turn is started.<br/><br/>Just scoring the best isn't enough though - Cons cause Hazards, such as Unrest, Contraband, and ongoing Damage - and Cons can get Angry from overcrowding, high Unrest, or other events. If all the Cons are Angry at the end of the turn, the entire MegaJail melts down, and everybody loses.<br/><br/>Part puzzle, part jail sim, part campy.

The presentation is a large as the battle was ... in terms of importance to Allied hopes to be &lsquo;home for Christmas&rsquo; ... 1944. Those hopes were dashed by bitter German resistance in the dark, dank wooded hills and villages around the Kall River. Names like Kommerscheidt, Vossenack, and Germeter, not to mention the infamous Kall Trail ... ring out in the history of the battle. Every one of those places is depicted, and more, allowing the tactical-level gamer to contest every inch, or pull back and await reinforcements ... or lay in a mortar barrage ... or stand pat and await new orders. Whatever was possible to local commanders is in YOUR hands as you re-make history in minute detail.<br/><br/>The map presentation is extensive, providing almost a dozen square feet of gaming area with evocative terrain artwork by a professional military illustrator What&rsquo;s more, when combined with ATS HUERTGEN HELL, OBJECTIVE SCHMIDT creates another CH monster battlefield measuring some six feet in length ... there just has never been anything like it. You&rsquo;ll be able to gaze across the expanse of the battlefield on both sides of the Kall River, including multiple villages, hundreds of terrain features. And yet, many scenarios play on portions of the overall map area, making the module easy to dive into and get your dice rolling without delay.<br/><br/>The module includes two sheets of 176 5/8&rdquo; die-cut German and American Personnel and Weapon counters, plus a sheet of 108 AFV/VEHICLES in 3/4&rdquo; size, a total of 460 counters in all&mdash;everything you need to play (just bring your standard ATS markers). You also receive 10 scenarios (all playable on the map provided) in color format, and color Battlefield WalkaroundTM special rules in 3-hole format. THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME! Ownership of the ATS 2014 rulebook and play aids plus standard system small and large marker counters is required (plus one or more 10-sided dice).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle Crusaders is a card game consisting of 110 fighter character cards with stats on and 50 magic cards which can change the state of play at any time.<br/><br/>Before the game starts the players can choose how many hands they play in multiples of the number of players. This means that the game can be played for short periods (e.g. 1/2 hour or a few hours). The winner is the player who has won the most hands at the end.<br/><br/>The dealer rotates clockwise round the table and after shuffling the cards, starting with their self, deals out seven cards to each player but also finishing with their self, so they will have eight cards. The reason being that they will go first as will every dealer in turn which makes the game fair. The rest of the pack is then put into the centre of the table and the top card is turned over and laid face up on the table next to the pack. If this is a fighter card the player can either then go against that fighter or, choose to go against the next player in turn with the stats and if the card wins that card is laid down on top of the other one for the next player to fight. If the first card down is a magic card it is ignored and they must go against the next player with a fighter card or lay down a magic card and so on.The winner of the hand is the first person (or persons,which it can be with one of the magic cards)to get rid of all their cards.<br/><br/>The more the game is played the more skilled the players can become, especially with the magic cards,and reading the play ahead.<br/><br/>",

And you have to figure out the best route to take based on the roll of the die. And while Action cards can help you, they can also help your opponents, and even snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. And you don't think the other players are going to sit idly by and watch you move about unimpeded, do you?<br/><br/>Got It! is a game that's easy to learn, but tricky to win -- and since the objects you must get change each game, it's never the same twice. But with skillful use of your moves and a little luck, you'll be able to look at the other players with a grin and say &quot;got it&quot;!<br/><br/>Playing Got It! starts with the deck of Object cards. Each player is dealt five objects, and must roll the die and move around the board to land on the matching spaces. Landing on an object space &quot;gets&quot; the object, but it's not safe until the player gets it back &quot;home&quot; to their starting space. There are specially marked spaces that provide toll passes and boat passes -- a toll pass can get a player from one side of the board to the other quickly, while a boat pass lets players go after objects on the islands. There are also spaces that let players draw &quot;action cards&quot;, some of which are used immediately and others which are held on to and used on later turns. The action cards can provide help (extra moves, extra turns, etc.) or hindrance (lose a pass, lose a turn, etc.). The first player to get all five of their objects home wins.<br/><br/>",

Dice are rolled to resolve combat and morale tests.<br/><br/>4 scenarios are included as are campaign rules.<br/><br/>Although these rules are intended for wargames set in the sixteenth century, they should provide a workable foundation for raiding games set earlier and later in history; they have worked quite well for me with Highwaymen, for a variety of &lsquo;sword and shield&rsquo; skirmishes, and for the medieval border wars between England and Scotland.<br/><br/>",

So, the players at the starting line will all be holding a length of twine (about 12 feet long) and they must pull it backwards so that the twine doesn't sag in the middle and the line should be about 18 inches off the floor. Each player now has a 'Donkey' put on to their twine, as near to the players' as possible.<br/><br/>On the word &quot;Off&quot;, each player has to jog their twine furiously so that their donkey heads towards their chair. The first to touch the chair leg with their donkey's nose, wins.<br/><br/>The game can be modified to allow young children to play.<br/><br/>",

The Fox makes the first move.  Both he and the Hunter can only move along the lines.  Both Fox and Hunter alternate turns moving only one space at a time.  The Hunter tries to force the Fox into a position where the Hunter's next move would be into the same hole the Fox is in.  When the Hunter reaches this position he rolls the dice.  If he rolls an even number, he has netted the Fox.  If he rolls an odd number the Fox may take two moves and thus gets away.  The game continues until the Hunter again corners the Fox.  At this time the Hunter again rolls the dice.  If an even number is rolled the Hunter wins, but if an odd number is rolled the Fox has eluded the Hunter for the second time, and the Fox is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Anywhere from six to twenty left-side cards are laid out in a line.  Each player takes a turn choosing a right-side card and trying to match it with one left-side card to make a rhyme.

Other cards may be added to your deck to help out the harvesting of crops, or change cows or chickens to milk, eggs, or meat, if the patrons request it.<br/>On a player's turn,  they draw and play all 5 cards,  keeping one card from turn to turn if storing it. <br/>The game ends when all the patrons have showed up and asked for their wants.<br/><br/>A solo game exists that has a timer of rounds, in the way of patron cards orders that must filled before you run out of time.<br/><br/>The patron cards pages must be printed 3 times. <br/>The farmers market 10 pages of cards need to be printed once per player. The backside picture may be printed on the back of the harvest cards,  not the patron cards.<br/>A.I art from night Cafe has been used for the playtest pnp files.<br/><br/>",

Each playing card contains eight labeled illustrations of objects having long or short vowel sounds in their names. The purpose of game play is to match each object's game with its correct vowel.&quot;<br/><br/>Vowel Bingo is similar to standard bingo, but in order to place their markers, players must know and match short and long vowel sounds. Each player has a card with as series of pictures labeled with the corresponding words. The caller calls out a vowel sound--long a, for example--and players must search their card for a word/picture with a long a in the word. When a player has a complete row, their card is checked by the caller to make sure the vowels are identified correctly. If so, the player wins. If not, play continues until someone has a correct row.<br/><br/>",

Today, all of mages on the gallows will face their final fate.  One by one the wicked will be executed until only one remains...<br/><br/>...and you want that one remaining to be your client.  That's right you're a lawyer and the mage you are protecting is a secret.  Your job is to protect your mage by making sure all the other mages on the gallows are executed first.  Of course, the other lawyers are also secretly protecting one of the mages.<br/><br/>In The Gallows each player is secretly defending one of the characters in the center.  On your turn you add one vote token to any character and then move one vote token from a character to a different character.  Once a character has enough votes they are executed.  Whoever had the most votes on a character when they are executed scores the conviction worth one point.  When only one character remains in the middle, whoever was protecting them scores an acquittal worth lots of points.<br/><br/>Play consists of players trying to manipulate the votes so they score convictions and prevent their own defendant from getting convicted.<br/><br/>",
