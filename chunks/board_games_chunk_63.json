        "description": "Charles Grant enjoys a great reputation as one of the earliest exponents of the fast-growing hobby of wargaming and has indeed played a large part in contributing to that expansion and popularity. This book comprises a series of monthly articles that appeared in our Meccano Magazine now offered for the first time in book form. It contains a number of suggested rules for wargaming, with tables of score values, designs for score valuation devices plus a sound appreciation of the special values of the various arms of a modern army. Unlike some other publications it is confined almost entirely to wargaming for the periods of World Wars I and II. Useful chapters are also included on valuation of morale in warfare. Whilst suited to the novice, this is really a book to be appreciated by the gamer with a little experience now ready for serious play.<br/><br/>",

The Federation has achieved the technology necessary for interstellar travel, giving us the capability to expand the empire beyond the solar system. However, it turns out that we are not alone in the universe! Five rival alien races &ndash; the Cuthonians, Flesh Eaters, Cybers, and Mutants &ndash; are not too thrilled at the Federation's advancement into what they believe is their territory. Top that off with the lurking threat of a band of fearsome Mercenaries, a race to achieve the best technology, and the ever-shifting tides of diplomacy and war, and Space Infantry Federation is a game that &ndash; both literally and figuratively &ndash; takes place on a galactic scale.<br/><br/>Many things can go wrong on this journey. If an alien race starship is in Sol by the end of one's turn, the Earth is conquered and the Federation has fallen and will be lost to their new overlords. If Federation Stability drops to zero, anarchy will reign supreme. If all of the aliens achieve technology beyond what the Federation could ever dream of.<br/><br/>But even with all of these ways to fail, you are determined, and if you can lead the Federation to take over the exoplanets in the various enemy territories, we will have an established foothold in galactic affairs for millennia to come. However, to do this we must build starships and space stations, maneuver those starships to other worlds, research new technologies, spy on the advancements of our enemies, and keep up the morale on the homefront.  Meanwhile, you must work our ways through the political tides with the alien races which are always in constant flux; There are many ways to win or lose our Federation, good luck Commander.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Heromaniacs: A 2-Bit Dungeon Adventure Card Game (3rd Edition)  is a standalone light-hearted fantasy themed dungeon crawling card game for 2-4 players. The goal is very simple: be the first player to get from Level 1 of the dungeon all the way up to and out of Level 5. To do that, players must gain enough Experience (EXP) to advance through the various levels. To gain EXP, players must defeat monsters. To defeat monsters, players need to recruit Heroes.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. During a player's turn, that player takes one of the following actions: 1) Recruit a Hero, 2) Attack a monster, or 3) Level Up. RECRUIT: To recruit a Hero, the player chooses any number of Heroes from the available pool whose total Strength is 10 or less and adds them to his or her hand, OR a player may choose a Hero card, flip it to the opposite side, and recruit the Hero on the flipped side. ATTACK: To Attack a Monster, the player chooses a monster in play to attack, and then deploys at least one (1) Hero  to that monster. If the total Strength all of the Heroes deployed to that monster is greater than the level of the monster, the monster is defeat and the player collects that monster. If the total Strength of the Heroes deployed to the monster is equal to the monster's level, the monster is defeated, the player collects it, and the player can take an additional action during the turn. LEVEL UP: To Level Up, a player must cash-in a monster in his collected pile whose level (which also serves as EXP once the monster had been collected) is greater than or equal to the EXP requirement of the Dungeon Level that player is currently on. After a player has taken all actions for the turn, play passes to the player on the left.<br/><br/>Play continues in this way until one player on Level 5 of the Dungeon gains enough EXP to escape. The first player to exit the dungeon, wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stack-22 is a tile-stacking game that uses polyhexes of 5 hexagons, called pentahexes. There are 22 different pentahexes (hence the name of the game).<br/><br/>Stack-22 is a new addition to the Pile-Omino family (SEVEN, Pent-Up and Counterplays) by the same designer. All of them play the same, but Stack-22 can be considered a step up from Seven.<br/><br/>Warning: this is not a game for the casual player. It is recommended that you at least master SEVEN, Pent-Up or Counterplays before playing Stack-22, as if you don&rsquo;t know the tactics it can feel a bit cold at the start during the first games. Its depth can be overwhelming (22 opening moves and more than 3000 second moves; the branching factor is crazy), but it rewards those who dare to explore.<br/><br/>Summary of gameplay: Players alternate turns placing one of their tiles according to some simple rules, trying to get the most of their pieces on the topmost layers when the game ends.<br/><br/>a) The tile must be aligned with the hex grid.<br/><br/>b) The selected tile must be placed on the highest level on which it can be placed legally.<br/><br/>c) The tile must be placed either on the table and adjacent to a piece already on the table, or atop at least 2 tiles, regardless of their colour.<br/><br/>d) The tile must lie flat, with every hex directly supported, either by the table or by a lower tile.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Then taking an adjacent flower. Finally taking all isolated flowers from the board (soliflowers; those that don't have orthogonally adjancent flowers).<br/><br/>Optionally, at the beginning of the turn, the players can execute special actions by 'purchasing' them with 3 flowers of the same colour. Each action can only be executed once during the game:<br/><br/>- Randomly pick 3 flowers from the game case (don&rsquo;t look), if there are at least 3, and add them to your reserve1.<br/><br/>- Jump orthogonally (not diagonally) over a peak to a space not occupied by a martian. If there is a flower on it, add it to your reserve. Don&rsquo;t take an adjacent flower!<br/><br/>- Move diagonally to a space not occupied by a martian (you cannot jump over peaks). If there is a flower on it, add it to your reserve. Don&rsquo;t take an adjacent flower!<br/><br/>- Pick any flower from the board and add it to your reserve.<br/><br/>- Swap the positions of your martian and any one peak or planted flower.<br/><br/>- Swap the positions of any one peak and any one planted flower.<br/><br/>- Swap the positions of any 2 planted flowers.<br/><br/>- Move any one planted flower to any empty space of the garden.<br/><br/>- Move any peak to any empty space of the garden.<br/><br/>- Pick the wildflower and add it to your reserve. Do not place a black counter on the circle; when this unique wildflower is gone, this special action is unavailable.<br/><br/>GAME END AND SCORING<br/><br/>If a player can't move her martian to a space occupied by a flower the game ends.<br/><br/>To get your score, count the number of flowers of the colour you have the least (consider the 6 colours, even if you don&rsquo;t have flowers of some of them!). The wildflower acts as a wildcard; it can be used as any colour but you have to declare which one before scoring.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins. Ties are broken by the second colour you have the least and so on. If the tie persists play again.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You can play the game with any one of those decks, while also being able to combine some or all of those decks into a single deck for a longer game or a game with more players. Each deck contains many unique cards, but the gameplay is the same in all cases.<br/><br/>Each player gets a five-card hand and twelve cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern. Each card has colored symbols along each side, as well as a point value and special instructions. On your turn, you reveal one face-down card, then spin any face-up card 180&ordm;. After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols. &quot;Popping&quot; a card means that you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful), then (usually) add it to your score pile. Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards. The game is played until one player has 70/50/40/30 points with two/three/four/more than four players.<br/><br/>The Siege of Mechanicsburg deck features characters and themes from the great battle for Mechanicsburg.<br/><br/>",

They compete against each other to fulfill customer orders as quickly as possible - all in order to become the greatest designer in the Factory&rsquo;s history!<br/><br/>DrawBot is a Roll &amp; Write game in which all players take their actions simultaneously with the roll of the dice. Players aim to fulfill a customer&rsquo;s order before anyone else by drawing on their factory sheet the available robot parts.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, the Workshop Manager rolls the 4 dice that determine the pieces available for robot manufacturing. He or she chooses one that only they can use. This piece is in limited quantity; the Workshop Manager keeps it exclusively for themselves. The other players can take any die other than the Workshop Manager's die. The same die can be chosen by multiple players. This reflects that these robot parts are available in larger quantities!<br/><br/>As soon as the Workshop Manager has chosen a die, all players choose one action:<br/><br/>- DRAW: The player the piece represented on the dice he has chosen<br/>- BOOST: The player uses 2 energies then draws any piece of their choice<br/>- ACCUMULATE: The player does not draw anything and circles 1 energy<br/><br/>Players can only draw on the face in front of them. Before drawing, they can use 1 energy to TURN their Factory Sheet to access the workstation of their choice. The Factory Sheet can do &frac14; or &frac12; turn.<br/><br/>The first one to finish an ordered robot scores 3 points. When a customer&rsquo;s order is fulfilled, the robot is removed and replaced with a new robot design. If a completed robot does not correspond or no longer corresponds to a customer&rsquo;s order, it is worth only 1 point. If two players finish the same robot at the same time, this robot design is worth only 1 point!<br/><br/>The game ends the moment a designer finishes their 4th robot. They circle 1 bonus point for finishing first. At the end of the game, players score originality points. Each designer compares their four robots, including the unfinished ones. If pairs of robots having no symbol in common, the player scores 1 point. The designer with the most points wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Descent on Malta is a solitaire operational level simulation of the planned but never executed Axis airborne assault on the British island fortress of Malta. The player controls Axis forces (Germans and Italians). The game system controls the opposing Allied forces and reaction. The objective of the game is for the Axis to capture Malta at the lowest possible cost in casualties. The design is based on the Crete '41 game (World at War #47). The game includes optional rules that allow for two or more players to control different parts of the Axis invasion. Descent on Malta is an area movement game with 1 inch on the map representing 2.5 miles. The map shows Malta, the adjoining islands of Gozo, Comino and surrounding waters, with displays (boxes) representing Axis units in Sicily and southern Italy (6.0). Ground units represent Axis and British regiments, battalions and companies; Axis air units represent 3 to 6 squadrons. Each turn equals anywhere from 4 hours of intense combat action to two days of attritional warfare and refitting.<br/><br/>Optional rules allow up to 7 players.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters.<br/><br/>S&amp;T #335 May-June 2022<br/><br/>",

The other players will check their blue cards (job cards) and decide which one they will go with as their current job. Then, the Big Boss will take the players cards and shuffle them together so they wouldn&rsquo;t know who played which card. Then, the Big Boss will put these cards in front of the job vacancy and ask the players to put down their qualification cards. Some of the qualification cards have positive effect and some have negative effects, depending on the job and/or the vacancy. Players can either put negative effect to their rivals or put a positive effect on themselves. Cards can be stacked in case one job has multiple positive andand/or negative effects. Then, the Big Boss will call everyone for an interview session. This is the discussion phase. The Big Boss will ask the players for their current job and why they think they would be the suitable candidates for this job. A clever player would use the negative effect that was put on him and twist it to be a positive effect for them. The game depends on persuasion skill after all. A taxi driver can be a minister if you know how to convince the Big Boss. Afterward, the Big Boss will choose the winner which will get points depending on the vacancy.<br/><br/>(Slightly abbreviated description from the designer)<br/><br/>",

The only hope is for their Familiars to dutifully band together on a quest to overthrow the Foes and save their spell-casting partners. They&rsquo;ll bumble their way through new spells, unleash ancient artifacts, and craft crazy combo attacks to succeed. They may just surprise their Witches and Wizards with a few tricks (and Familiars) of their own!<br/><br/>Familiars and Foes is a 1 to 5 player co-operative style game where you play as one of five Elemental Familiars with their own unique abilities - Earth, Wind, Fire, Air, or Aether. The game is played in four waves. Each wave increases in difficulty and reveals a new set of Foes that must be defeated to save a Witch or Wizard.<br/><br/>On each turn a player must choose one of three actions to perform - a physical attack, cast a spell, or use an artifact. The success or failure of the action is determined by a dice roll or coin flip. The rest of the players have the opportunity to contribute to the active player's turn and create combination moves. They can perform team attacks, use special abilities, or cash in rewards to boost the initial attack or benefit Familiar health. Group strategy is key to surviving and beating the game.<br/><br/>The Foes don't just sit idly and take beatings the whole game. They have their own turn each round where they release potentially devastating attacks on the Familiars. The Familiars have a few tricks to defend themselves or they can just hope for a weak attack to survive another round.<br/><br/>The game is won when all four waves of Foes have been defeated, all the Witches and Wizards have been rescued, and at least one Familiar is still standing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal is always to create the best, most unique, interesting or fun stories. In a competitive version of the game, players have to fill in the middle of a story between a start and end card with cards from their hand. They take it in turns to reveal and tell their stories, and then vote for a winner. Voting is done by simultaneous pointing at the person whose comic strip you liked the best. In the collaborative versions, the emphasis is on building stories as a group, either by adding panels, or swapping panels out for new ones.<br/><br/>Comic Turns is also a tool for learning about comics, building stories, inspiring creative writing and sparking the imagination.<br/><br/>",

This expansion gives 14 new, complete, and official army lists.  These lists include updates on the races and nations included in the original Warmaster book, as well as making some lists that had appeared in various GW magazines &quot;official.&quot;  In making the step to being &quot;official&quot; it also shows they have been play-tested and are, for the most part, balanced.    A brand new list, Araby, with magic carpets and genies, is also included.<br/><br/>This list is superior in its presentation of the individual army rules.  Both army composition rules and rules for play, are boiled down to a single page for each race and nation.  Each race's spells are also presented.<br/><br/>Armies included are:<br/>Empire (human)<br/>Tomb Kings (undead)<br/>Chaos<br/>Orc<br/>High Elf<br/>Dwarf<br/>Skaven<br/>Lizardman<br/>Bretonnia (human)<br/>Kislev (human)<br/>Dark Elf<br/>Vampire Count (undead)<br/>Daemon<br/>Araby<br/><br/>This book was made available for free as a downloadable pdf.  It looks like GW originally planned to print it, based on the b/w interiors rather than color, but went the online route instead.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Russo-Georgian War of 2008 is a DTP simulation game covering the military action during that conflict from August 8 2008 through August 12, 2008.  This involved full-on combat between the Republic of Georgia and the Russian Federation plus two breakaway regions of Georgia; Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The fighting began in the Ossetia (the primary Georgian target) and quickly spread to all of Georgia and Abkhazia.<br/><br/>At first glance this seems like a fight between David and Goliath - the vast Russian military against a state with only about 20,000 active duty personnel in it's military and only 7 combat jets - but closer examination reveals it was a somewhat stiffer competition with several points of interest.  It was with this thought that this game was inspired.<br/><br/>The game is relatively straight forward to learn and play and the system, while adapted to the conflict, very familiar to most wargamers.  Learning and playing the game can be done fairly quickly.  The game is play-balanced due to a selection of real-world scenarios, including the historical situation.<br/><br/>This is a Desk Top Published (DTP)game - gluing and cutting of counters is required.<br/><br/>SCALE - Game Turns represent 12 hours, units typically represent battallions of 500 - 1000 men plus some smaller and larger, units and hexes on the map are approximately 12 kilometers across.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragon's Path is a card game in which 2 player race to find the Ancient Dragon. Your deck of cards represents different elemental paths that you can choose from. Each elemental path gives you the power to stop your opponent or it can help to follow the right path to the Ancient Dragon.<br/><br/>The legend has it that the Ancient Dragon reveals himself only to those who complete the Dragon's Path, rewarding them with power and wisdom. Many wizards attempted, only a few of them succeeded.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to collect five different path cards or four cards of the same element in your play area. Each of the five different path cards has two powerful effects. On their turn players:<br/><br/>&bull;    Draw a card. <br/>&bull;    Play a card declaring which effect to use. <br/>&bull;    Wait for the opponent to play a card in response (some effects allow you to play cards during opponent&rsquo;s turn).<br/>&bull;    Eventually apply the effect and collect the card.<br/><br/>In the Advanced Mode you can use unique powerful spell to twist the game! Before starting the game, players take two spell cards. Each spell card can be played by discarding two specific path cards. In addition, players do a best of three game.<br/><br/>Dragon's Path is the first game of the &quot;Deck Box Game Line&quot;: the game box is manufactured by UltraPro and contains 60 cards, the player aids, the rulesheets and three wooden dragon tokens.<br/>Extend the gameplay to four player with another Dragon's Path copy!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The Carthaginians were lead by Hannibal's less famous brother, Hasdrubal, and the Numidians by King Syphax.<br/><br/>Sophonisba is Hasdrubal's own daughter offered in marriage to Syphax to ensure Numdia's continued loyalty after the defection of their cavalry general, Masinissa.<br/><br/>To play Sophonisba and the Battle of Great Plains, you will need SQPR &quot;II&quot;, the second edition rules (from 1994). <br/>The needed counters can be found in SQPR and in the module counter sheet included in C3i #4. (Some counters from the War Elephant and Africanus modules are reproduced in the C3i that players without those scenarios can play Sophonisba.) The Cannae map from SPQR is also required as it resembles the Great Plains battlefield.<br/><br/>",

Players will lead a syndicate competing to control the lucrative and dangerous markets of the underworld. Invest in assets, smuggle, bribe, murder, steal and hire legendary gangsters from a deck of the most iconic criminals of the past century, each with unique stats and abilities. Ruthlessly rise above your rivals to be crowned the boss of bosses.<br/><br/>(website)<br/><br/>Players start with one boss card, but there is a public marketplace that allows players to fill out a tableau (their syndicate) by draft-purchasing up to 3 extra *historical* gangsters, 4 assets (usually venues associated with crime) and 4 upgrades (eg drug boats, evidence, guns, armor).<br/><br/>The tableau allows each gangster to be lined up with an Asset and an Upgrade which increase the gangster's abilities.<br/>The players will take it in turn to activate each gangster, with various abilities including earning money, stealing money, attacking other gangsters, stealing other gangsters, destroying Assets/Upgrades and attempting a narcotics shipment. The success of these actions depends on a dice roll, but increasing the gangsters' abilities increases their chance of success. If they do not succeed, a gangster they have targeted will usually have an ability that allows retaliation.<br/><br/>Some of the Assets (locations) give income at the end of each round, if they still have a gangster assigned to them.<br/>At the end of four rounds, the player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>(NB this is based on the 2018 version of the game)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Things were normally quiet and peaceful in the old mining town of Denney Springs, Colorado. That is, until the Environmental Protection Agency suddenly showed up in nearby Denver. A horrible mine accident occurred near the city when careless E.P.A. workers mistakenly released thousands of gallons of Widgetanium (a strange experimental chemical that was being tested by the U.S. government) into the city&rsquo;s water system. By the next day, the contamination was widespread and infected residents were slowly turned into some kind of zombie-like monsters. There were even rumors of the recently-deceased being re-animated from the city&rsquo;s morgue! These &ldquo;living corpses&rdquo; soon took over the city and infected thousands of others as well. Slowly expanding out from the Denver city limits, the &ldquo;Day of Reckoning&rdquo; was finally upon the citizens of Denney Springs. At first, they were horrified and completely overwhelmed, losing hundreds of their fellow citizens. But the tough community eventually organized, gathered its resolve and fought back courageously. The majority of townsfolk were herded out in refugee columns and headed for the protection of the mountains. A series of distress calls were sent out, begging for help from the Colorado National Guard. A plan was arranged for full evacuation from a quickly-constructed Guard base in nearby Wagon Gap, on the other side of the mountain range. This was a welcome and hopeful plan, but getting everyone there safely was another matter entirely &hellip;..<br/><br/>Dead Reckoning is a light, fast-playing zombie-themed wargame that features a new, streamlined system which allows both players to be constantly involved in the game play, provides challenging decision making and yet easily resolves all combats with the simple drawing of cards. There are no complicated combat results tables, no dice rolling, no factor counting, no lists of modifiers and almost no math calculations. This game is designed to be enjoyed by both grognards and zombie fans alike.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to bring them to the chambers. But each kind of animal only brings victory points if they are in a chamber with just their kind.<br/><br/>Each time a chamber is revealed to the building market two animal tiles are drawn and placed on that chamber. There are 6 different animal kinds in the game, each awarding points at the end, but only if it is kept in a chamber which only has his kind on it. In order to move the animals to the desired chambers a player has the option to play a money card at the end of their turn, moving an animal one space (from building to building) for each value on the card plaid.<br/><br/>The player who organizes their animals most cleverly will earn additional victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Contents: 18 animal chips<br/><br/>Buildings of Power:<br/>The Towers in the game are replaced with new ones, each having a special ability:<br/><br/>Blueprint - The player rolls a die and draws that many building tiles, choosing one to keep. The others are returned to the draw tower in the order the player chooses. The building tile the player kept can be placed on the building market at the start of any player's turns, replacing any already on the tableau. The exchanged tile is placed back in the draw tower.<br/><br/>Loan - The player rolls a die and draws that many money cards from the draw pile, choosing one of them to keep. The others are returned to the top of the draw pile in the order the player chooses.<br/><br/>Discount - The player rolls a die and places it on the tower. Every time the player purchases his first building in the round, he can choose to decrease the value on the die by one to decrease the purchase prize by one.<br/><br/>Pinnacle - The player rolls a die and places it on the tower. When scoring walls that number is added to the shortest external wall. This can propel the smaller wall to be the biggest and therefore score more points for the player.<br/><br/>Contents: 11 alternate tower tiles, 4 white dice, 32 black dice, and 1 purple die<br/><br/>Travelling Craftsmen:<br/>The Craftsman came from the far away&mdash;Carcasonne to Andalusia&mdash;to help build the Alhambra.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player will receive one traveling craftsman which can be used for their ability on a future turn. Once used, the craftsman travels to the next player in clockwise position who then can use him. The craftsman have various abilities that can give a player bonuses on their turns. Following are some of the abilities:<br/><br/>Switch - Before buying a building tile the player may swap two buildings on the building market.<br/><br/>Change - The player may exchange an money card in his hand with one from the display.<br/><br/>Direction - A player may build a building in their Alhambra, rotating it in any direction desired.<br/><br/>Contents: 6 craftsmen cards<br/><br/>",

This action made it clear that Giap&rsquo;s objective was to control the Tonkin delta in order to threaten Hano&iuml; from the south. De Lattre decided to block him by launching a vast operation against his supply lines by occupying the Muong country in the Hoa Binh and Cho Ben sectors between the Da River and the Black River.

The child meeple does not count against your limit of meeples, however if you still have them at the end of the game they can count towards the relevant prophecies on Palaces when using Golden Age.<br/><br/>As a secondary action, you may place a child meeple onto the board, on top of another worker of the same colour without paying gold/god card and ignoring climbing/roaming costs. Resolve tasks as if you just placed the worker below. The worker with the child cannot be retrieved by a Warrior, and the child cannot leave the board once placed.<br/><br/>Solo support: If Axomamma/Pachamama has two workers of the same colour in her supply at any point, she removes the matching child meeple from beside the Village. When this happens, she gains the recruiting reward for that colour another time. Return the removed child meeple to the box, Axomamma/Pachamama will not place them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A MATTER OF HONOR The Battle of Le Bourget - Oct 30, 1870<br/> Long before it became the site of Charles Lindbergh's landing after his first air crossing of the Atlantic Ocean and later of a renowned international Airshow, the town of Le Bourget, in the outskirts of Paris, was the scene of a bloody battle between the French Army and the Prussian forces besieging Paris in October 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War.<br/> A Matter of Honor is an action-packed two-player tactical board game using a simple but effective area impulse activation system. The game captures the dramatic intensity of the Battle of Le Bourget and its desperate house to house fighting. <br/>Added chromes include random event cards featuring historical events players may use to influence the outcome of the battle. <br/>Units are companies of elite Prussian Guards, facing determined French Regulars and National Guardsmen in a fight to the finish and for a matter of honor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>MOTOYAMA AIRFIELD #2, Iwo Jima, 27 February 1945: The Marines of Colonel Kenyon&rsquo;s 9th Marine Regiment had a rough time during their first day in the line, 26 February. They had made two determined assaults on &lsquo;Hill Peter&rsquo;, to no avail. After reorganizing during the night, the 9th Marines were ready for another push to the top of the hill. At 1250 hrs., their break came. Following a ten minute preparation by division and corps artillery, both battalions struck out in a coordinated attack. With the 1st Battalion on the right and the 2nd on the left, the Marines began their move up the slopes of Hill Peter. The 1st Battalion overran the hill and continued on down the reverse slope and up to the crest of &lsquo;Hill Oboe&rsquo; to the northwest. The 1st Battalion&rsquo;s &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company did not enjoy the same momentum on their way to Oboe. &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company was stopped by a small enemy AA detachment with supporting fire from emplaced machine-guns in a small draw on their right flank. &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company rapidly deployed to meet this threat.<br/><br/>ATS SEMPER FI! (aka Uncommon Valor Upgrade Edition) is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Iwo Jima. Three years into the Pacific war the United States Marine Corps had mastered the art of the amphibious landing. The landing force at Iwo still had much to learn about the enemy. Senior intelligence officers did not know until 27 February that General Kuribayashi was in fact personally running the show from his headquarters on Iwo Jima. As the Marines regrouped after their landing, it was obvious that something was different on Iwo Jima. No dense jungles, just ash from the island&rsquo;s volcano, Suribachi. Steam could be seen rising from the natural sulfur water wells which bubbled to the surface all over the island. Worse, the dug-in defenders actually numbered half again the original estimate of 13,000. Kuribayshi was particularly pleased with the quality of his artillery and engineering troops. The Japanese defenders waiting for the advance of the V Amphibious Corps were well armed and confident. The game depicts the confrontation at Motoyama Airfield #2, a war waged with the most vicious weapons available to the combatants, including flame-throwing &lsquo;Zippo&rsquo; Shermans and Japanese heavy artillery. Everything is included to play!.<br/>&middot;    A collection of 517 color, die-cut counters representing the USMC and Japanese combatants that fought in the battle; <br/>&middot;    Six scenarios, ranging from small to large, that all play on the historical map; <br/>&middot;    A 22 x 34 color map of the Motoyama #2 battlefield on heavyweight stock; <br/>&middot;    A complete ATS system rulebook tailored specifically to the game; <br/>&middot;    Six Play Aid Cards; <br/>&middot;    Battlefield Walk around and Special Rules document (an ATS specialty!) <br/>&middot;    A color cover sheet (perfect for your rules binder) and a snazzy ziploc bag to hold it all.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Serial Killer is a real-time party game that uses signaling, bluffing, and deduction.<br/><br/>The game simulates the situation where most of the players are assigned as innocent civilians in a city with an undercover killer and police.<br/><br/>The objective of the police is to find the killer before the killer eliminates all of the civilians.<br/><br/>The killer's intention is to eliminate innocent civilians by means of a secret signal. The killer has less than five minutes to secretly signal their murder target without revealing themselves to the police. If the killer's murder attempt is successful, they will need to wait for at least 10 seconds before making another attempt. In the meantime, the killer is also trying to confuse the police into capturing the wrong player.<br/><br/>Civilian roles make the game more complex and interesting. The Journalist, for example, is an innocent civilian with the ability to expose other player's characters.<br/><br/>The game includes 30 characters with 10 unique roles. Each roles has a different agenda. Various characters can help the police or the killer or even themselves to win the game.<br/><br/>This game is easy to play, and can be played anywhere--in a small circle of friends or with family or as a team-building exercise.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a faction of revolutionaries&mdash;Workers, Students, Neighbors, or Prisoners&mdash;fighting against the State in the streets of a city that change with each game. Build barricades, clash with riot cops, occupy districts, loot shopping centers, and liberate the city before time runs out and the military arrives! Bloc by Bloc features hidden agendas, deep strategy, area control, asymmetrical player abilities, and a special method for randomly generating billions of unique city layouts. Bloc by Bloc 2nd edition features brand new art, streamlined gameplay, improved components and new objectives for the insurrection!<br/><br/>The game lasts up to 10 rounds. Each round is 1 night and each night has 2 phases. During the Nighttime phase, each player takes a turn: 3-5 actions followed by a police response that is controlled by the Police Ops deck and the level of Police Morale. Each player starts with 2 blocs in the city and can add more throughout the game. On a player's turn, they roll dice and take one action (such as looting, occupying, attacking, or barricading) for each die rolled with 1+ of their blocs. Players may use loot cards to enhance their actions. After all factions have taken their turns, the Sunrise phase begins, which is when police go on the attack and factions have a chance to liberate districts.<br/><br/>The police and the State are the common enemies of all factions. Factions must build occupations in all of their own districts for the social insurrection to be successful. However, each faction also has its own secret agenda with a set of specific tasks that faction must complete in order to win the game. The majority of factions will have Social Agendas and they must cooperate to win the game together. But some factions may have Vanguardist or Nihilist Agendas that secretly pit them against the social insurrection. These factions can only win the game alone!<br/><br/><br/>The 2nd edition features a brand new art, streamlined gameplay, improved components and new objectives for the insurrection!<br/><br/>",

The one who commits the most to each state wins it.After the last state has been contested, players move on to The Convention phase where players once again bid to win the remaining states. If no player has the 769 votes needed to win the game. The player with least number of votes drops out and the process is repeated until there is a winner.<br/><br/>The Election Game simulates a presidential election. Both players choose a candidate for president and vice president. Play is simultaneous. A round consists of each player collecting campaign funds, revealing three event cards, secretly allocating resource markers, revealing those allocations and determine campaign results. This goes on for six rounds and then it's Election Day. The results of the campaigns are realized and the player with 270 or more Electoral Votes is the winner.<br/><br/>The game comes with statistics for all of the major candidates from 1972 and fifteen historical candidates such as Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>",

Each check-up has an instrument to use which also reveals a hidden picture. For example, the Thermometer tip is inserted into Charlie's mouth and pressed until the window pops open, or a slide is inserted into the X-Ray machine and a light is switched on to reveal the picture. If the picture of a happy Charlie face appears, you are successful and you take a puzzle piece depicting the check-up and place it in a frame. If an Icky Wicky is the picture, your turn ends and you must perform the check-up again later.

        "description": "Money Monsoon is a simple auction game with some twists. The board is simply a track, and each player has two pawns. The game ends when any one pawn reaches the end space, and the player with the most money then wins.<br/><br/>The turn player rolls an 8-sided die, and the result of the die roll is then auctioned using a silent bid (written on pieces of paper). The high bid wins but pays the second highest amount (like Knizia's Last Paradise), and that player can move one of their pawns the die roll amount. Money is paid to the die roller, unless they win in which case they pay the bank. Rolls of seven and eight have special properties. Moves can be made forward and backward, and this is relevant since when landing on another player's pawn, that owner of the pawn hit pays 50 points to the mover.  There are bonuses for finishing in first, second, and third place also.<br/><br/>",

It bears the subtitle &quot;The Game of Space War in Star Trek&quot; in addition to the less generic &quot;Invasion of Klingon Empire.&quot;<br/><br/>This is definitely a strategic game, given the 4-part mounted map showing the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire (or a portion thereof), the Romulan Empire (ditto), and a large amount of space between these.  Production is clearly important, as there seem to be many rules sections covering factories.<br/><br/>The game definitely appears to have two sides, the Federation and the Klingons.  It gives the appearance of allowing either 2 or 4 players - the map has a line down the middle which would split it reasonably enough for this purpose.  Presumably two players split the Federation and the other side has a Klingon and a Romulan player.<br/><br/>The missions of the USS Enterprise are clearly of some importance to the game.  The green lines on the map appear to chart these (many of the systems have names familiar from the original TV series), there is a rules section labeled &quot;ST Game Enterprise Mission Chart,&quot; and one of the scenarios is called &quot;Missions of Enterplize&quot; (I swear!).  Other missions include &quot;la Brandy de Camus&quot; and a campaign game.<br/><br/>",

Using data from Retrosheet, we've attempted to replicate things like batted ball distribution: your hitters will tend to hit their lazy fly balls and pop ups the other way, while pulling harder hit balls. Similarly, good hitters will tend to hit the ball harder (more line drives and hard grounders and fewer pop ups), and poor hitters will do the opposite.<br/><br/>",

Each Chief, in turn, moves his ENGINES, by throw of the DICE, along the streets to put them alongside the FIRE and put it out.  A 2 ALARM FIRE requires 2 ENGINES to put it out, a 3 ALARM FIRE needs 3 ENGINES, and so on.  If a fire is not put out when another CARD is drawn, it may SPREAD to the North, South, East, or West.  When a fire is &ldquo;put out,&rdquo; the owner of each Engine at the fire gets a POINT.

        "description": "Anchor of Faith warfare in the seventeenth century.  At the beginning of the seventeenth century armies deployed in large units comprising many thousands of men. Firepower, while important, was still subordinate to shock of contact and the use of pole arm weapons. The period can be characterized: - The introduction of smaller formations, reduction in the use of pike and increased reliance on firepower and the development of linear tactics. Anchor of Faith allows the gamer to recreate the battles and tactics of this colorful period.<br/><br/>Anchor of Faith covers warfare in Europe and the fringe nations in the Middle East and Asia. The supplement introduces new rule mechanisms, formation types and army generation tables particular to the period 1600 to 1690. It combines the main rules that allow battles to be played at a regimental scale, and a sub set of rules, the Twelve Apostles, for fighting smaller actions with units typically representing a few companies of infantry or troops of cavalry. The latter being particularly useful for fighting large English Civil War skirmishes.<br/><br/>Anchor of Faith includes a range of new formations definitions including tercios, Swedish brigade, deep line, caracole cavalry, commanded shot, galloper cavalry and war wagons. New period rule mechanisms are introduced to mirror both the abilities and shortcomings of the troops of this era. New rules include revised pursuit rules, morale points by command and new fire rules to reflect the low effect of musketry and the importance of  &lsquo;push of pike&rsquo; in deciding the outcome of engagements.  Many of the new ideas and mechanisms can be used in other Piquet periods.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Piquet: Master Rules for Wargaming<br/><br/><br/>",

For over 50 years, historians have debated what could have happened if a number of events had ended differently. Ted Nomura and Ben Dunn of Antarctic Press have created a fictional world where several key events delayed the allies' victory. Fitting within the broader scope of the Families of Altered Wars fictional time line, Luftwaffe 1946 and Kamikaze 1946 describe WW II in the air from the view of pilots on all sides in the conflict.<br/><br/>What follows is just a brief overview of the circumstances that led to World War II continuing another year, giving the Luftwaffe and their counterparts in Japan a second chance. A chance to overcome their numerical weaknesses and training deficiencies through technology and the courage of their pilots. Suspend your disbelief, consider what might have been, and join us as we explore the people and story of LUFTWAFFE 1946.<br/><br/>",

There must have been at least two print runs, as some game boxes has the publisher&rsquo;s logo in a white field, others in a yellow, but no variation in the game contents have been observed between these.<br/><br/>Confusingly, when the publisher made a Norwegian translation of the similar (and possibly related) Swedish game Wangaratta in the 1970s, they reused the name Shipping for this.<br/><br/>",

From the box; Round up your herd and hit the trail with your Chuckwagon, Cowboys and Longhorns in this exciting new game of the West. Watch out for rustlers, pardner, good luck on your TRAIL DRIVE.<br/><br/>The game includes 40 new Western Cards and a rule card.  For boys and girls Ages 6 - 12<br/><br/>Rules: <br/>How to Play Trail Drive<br/><br/>THE GAME: Try to play as many cards as you can each turn to build a long Trail Drive with a Chuckwagon, Cowboys and Cows, laying your cards in a row on the table in front of you. A Rustler might stop you, but a Sheriff gets you started again.<br/>THE DEAL: If four or more play, deal 4 cards apiece, then play that round, deal 4 more and play again, continuing to deal and play until the deck is used up. If three play, deal 5 cards apiece each round. If two play, deal 6.<br/>THE PLAY: After each round is dealt, beginning at left of the dealer you each play what you can from your hand. The first three cards must be 1 Chuckwagon and 2 Cowboys in any order; then you add cows, the more the better. Discard the rest of your hand, face down. After each round the discards are added to the bottom of the deck. You may play a Rustler card to stop anyone&rsquo;s Trail Drive when it has cows. Then no more Cows may be added, until a Sheriff is played on the Rustler. You may start a new Trail Drive, when your first Drive is rustled (with 1 Chuckwagon, 2 Cowboys, then Cows, as before), but you may not play on more than one Trail Drive in one turn. Therefore, you may not play a Sheriff card and start a new Drive in the same turn.<br/>When Deck is used up, whether or not it comes out even, the dealer calls, &ldquo;Last Round.&rdquo; On the last round, each player passes to the next player the cards he can&rsquo;t use, instead of discarding.<br/>THE WINNER: When all possible plays have been made, you each take out all the Rustlers, plus two Cows for each Rustler. Count the rest. Whoever has the most wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Changing Landscapes game for the piecepack.<br/><br/>In the far future, ordinary racing has become obsolete. The fans have grown bored with driving around in loops at high speeds. So, a new genre of racing is born&mdash;the Chaos Cruiser. These unique hover-vehicles are designed for pure speed and maneuverability. And they&rsquo;ll need every bit of it because the racetrack is not what it seems. The track is made up of individual modules that shuffle about, ratcheting up the difficulty. Also, each driver has radio-controlled drones that can be placed as obstacles in their opponents&rsquo; paths. In the midst of all this chaos, one wily cruiser will prove to be the fastest, most agile, and most crafty of them all. Who will earn the Chaos Cup?<br/><br/>The piecepack tiles are laid out, so as to create a racetrack. Each player controls one cruiser, represented by a piecepack die. The number that is face-up on the die designates the speed of that cruiser. The coins have two uses. The null and ace coins are placed on the track as impassible obstacles. The 2, 3, 4, and 5 coins are used as nitro-boosts or shock-breaks, which greatly increase or decrease your speed. The pawns stand for the gates along the course. When a cruiser enters the tile containing a gate, he checks that gate off on the race progress chart. When all the cruisers have reached a certain gate, a chaos round is initiated, in which each player can move the two obstacles of his color. Also, the player in last place can move 3 tiles of the racetrack to entirely new locations. The first player to complete the race by passing through each of the four gates twice in the correct sequence is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Labyrintus is a miniature game that combines the spectacle and craft of a miniature game with the fun and ease of play of a board game.  A fast paced game for 2-4 players with a playing time of 30 to 60 minutes. Each player takes control of a team of 4 creatures and attempts to be the first to get through the Labyrinth. But beware, things may not always be what they seem, your progress can be thwarted by other creatures, the shifting Labyrinth and even your own tactical choices. <br/>The game will include the complete 75 piece Labyrinth, 16 individual 28mm miniatures sculpted by Victoria Lamb, rules and special dice. The 16 miniatures make up the four factions that will inhabit the Labyrinth.<br/><br/>Note added October 2019: It had been noted as being &quot;still in development&quot; since this description was added in February 2008. The designer had not updated her website since around 2013 and her website is no longer available.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the outbreak of the First World War the greatest concentration of German warships outside of the North Sea was the famed East Asiatic Squadron. Winner of the Kaiser's Cup for two consecutive years, a competition testing the gunnery of His Majesty's warships, the East Asiatic Squadron was commanded by Admiral Maximilian von Spee. The East Asiatic Squadron was made up of fast and modern ships. The flagship was the Scharnhorst, a fast armoured cruiser with 8.2&quot; guns. Her sister-ship, the Gneisenau, boasted the same specifications. In addition to these two armoured cruisers, there were the light cruisers Leipzig, N&uuml;rnberg, and Emden, all very fast and armed with 4.1&quot; guns. This fleet provided the greatest threat to Allied shipping outside of the north Atlantic.<br/><br/>Spee had several options when news of the war reached him. The greatest concentration of Allied merchant shipping in the region was at the approaches to the Red Sea, where convoys from India, China, and Australia passed through the Suez Canal. But there were no places for German ships to coal in the Indian Ocean, and operating there would bring Spee into contact with the Royal Navy China Station and the powerful but slow Triumph. Operating in the northern Pacific was ruled out because of the powerful Japanese fleet, easily the largest in the Pacific. Operating around the Dutch East Indies and Australia was also discarded because it would bring the East Asiatic Squadron within the sights of the Australia, a battlecruiser with 12&quot; guns. With few options, Spee decided to head across the Pacific where he could indirectly disrupt Allied shipping and hopefully cause enough consternation within the Royal Navy that several important ships would be detached from the Home Fleet. The south Pacific had plenty of islands from which Spee and his ships could supply and the islands also provided an effective hiding place. With luck, Spee could reach South America and coal from neutral ports there, enter the Atlantic Ocean, feast on the rich merchant shipping around Montevideo, and maybe even reach Germany.<br/><br/>Not all commanders concurred and the captain of the Emden proposed that his vessel would head west into the Indian Ocean where a lone ship could more easily stay hidden and coal from captured merchants. Spee agreed and the Emden sailed west while the East Asiatic Squadron sailed east, where they were expected to meet the Dresden en route from the Atlantic.<br/><br/>What followed was one of the greatest war time adventures at sea.<br/><br/>Spee eluded capture for months and appeared off the coast of Chile where he destroyed a British fleet at the Battle of Coronel. Crossing into the Atlantic, Spee was finally sunk in December 1914 under the weight of the shells from the 12&quot; guns of the Invincible and Inflexible, two battlecruisers dispatched from North Sea waters to deal with the German threat. The Emden had an incredible campaign of her own, sinking almost two dozen merchant ships and causing panic throughout the Indian Ocean. The Emden also met a tragic end at the hands of the Sydney in November 1914.<br/><br/>In The Pursuit of von Spee you are put at the helm of the German or Allied fleet. Your goal as the German commander is to disrupt Allied shipping, raid Allied possessions, sink Allied warships, and survive for as long as possible. As the Allies you are to capture the German colonies and seek out and destroy the German raiders all the while trying to keep your merchant shipping en route to their destinations and afloat.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of von Spee is a game of deception and subterfuge. One must keep in mind at all times that the winner of this game could very well be the best bluffer. Without knowing exactly where your opponent's ships are, a subtle look could give you the hint needed to find von Spee and send his fleet to the bottom.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of von Spee uses a fog-of-war system that hides the location and condition of the various ships in the game. Naval combat uses a system which takes into account the size of a ship's guns, its top speed, and the strength of its armour at various parts of the ship. The Allied player has a lot of responsibilities to take care of in addition to hunting the German player, while the German player has to choose his battles carefully and keep a close eye on the condition and coal-reserves of each of his ships. The German player also has the ability to bring two other ships into the campaign, the Karlsruhe and the K&ouml;nigsberg. The Allied player receives reinforcements as well during the course of the game.<br/><br/>In your game box you will receive four 12&quot; x 18&quot; map sheets which join together to make one 24&quot; x 36&quot; map spanning from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. The game includes 240 mounted counters (in easy-to-cut strips), one 10-sided die, two blinds, four ship charts, five player aid sheets, and a 17-page rulebook containing all of the rules and setup information required.<br/><br/>This game is of medium complexity but has only a few mechanics to master. Learning the game comes quickly as the phases are simple and straight-forward. In addition to regular playtesting, this game was also play tested with a first-time wargamer, who was nevertheless able to grasp the basics of the game in her first session. Learning the strategy and intricacies of play can take much longer, as the options in this game are endless. Depending on how long von Spee survives, the game can last anywhere from 2 to 12 hours.<br/><br/>",

Players use weapons, ammunition, and other equipment to battle each other in a high caliber fight to the finish. They can compete one-on-one, as teams, or in all out free-for-all death match games.  The FPSccg rules are easy to learn and feature a streamlined turn sequence, an entirely unique resource system, and forward-resolving effects.  Gone are the days of tapping and exhausting and of last-in-first-out.<br/><br/>The FPSccg Edition One base set contains 220 cards of varying rarities.  All rules and card lists are available at FPSccg.com.  FPSccg was developed by Johnson-Chilton Games, an independent company of gamers in Rolla, Missouri, and is printed by TMCards.  FPSccg is not based on a specific FPS game, but is a proprietary title modeled after the entire FPS genre.<br/><br/>",

However, Yudenich&rsquo;s army was exhausted by the time it reached the outskirts of Petrograd, and in the face of a numerically stronger Red Army and lacking the support of the British Royal Navy, it decided to retreat on 1 November.<br/><br/>One turn represents two days and one hex is four kilometres.

The ethiopist Richard Pankhurst learned the same game in 1971 from Abba Pawlos Tzadua of Serae, Abba Zacharias of Akala Guzay, Michael Yacob of Akala Guzay and Gabra Sellas&eacute; Gabra Amlak of Serae. All these players were Christians who either served at the Catholic Cathedral of Addis Abbaba or were students at the Haile Seilassie I University. (...)

The rules use the WITP counters and combat results use the original WITP tables.  Gunfire combat is simultaneous and accounts for target size and speed, gun range (by ship type), and facing. Command control and fog of war are covered as well, so the rules can deal with both day and night combat.<br/><br/>The rules come with no less than eight separate scenarios covering major engagements of the Pacific War so they can be played even outside a WITP game: Java Sea, Savo Island, Cape Esperance, Guadalcanal I &amp; II, Tassafaronga, and the Komandorski Islands.<br/><br/>Published in Chain_of_Command issue 2.<br/><br/><br/>(from the introduction:)<br/><br/>The mechanics of surface combat in the original War in the Pacific have nothing whatever to do with the actual operation of modern warships. [...]<br/><br/>This alternative set of rules has been designed to impart some of the tactical flavor of WWII naval combat.  At the same time, an effort was made to keep the complexity ot a reasonable minimum.  [...] With practice, it is hoped that it will not take any more time than the routine it replaces.<br/><br/>These rules will rectify a few of the inconsistencies in War in the Pacific. They will introduce the players to the awesome Japanese Long Lance torpedo. [...]  In addition certain ship types will be restored to usefulness, such as Japanese CL's.<br/><br/>I hope this effort adds to your appreciation and enjoyment of SPI's classic monstergame.<br/><br/>",

The movement of the pieces is based on Wladyslaw Glinski's Hexagonal Chess.<br/><br/>As with all Shogi variants, the objective is to checkmate your opponent's king. Unlike chess, Shogi pieces are flat, all the same color, and pentagonal. Ownership of a piece is indicated by the direction it is pointing. When you capture a piece, you may on a later turn place that piece on the board and use it as your own.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player has five pieces, which appear from left-to-right in the following order:<br/><br/><br/>     Tokin, which moves like a Gold General (Lance)<br/>     Silver General (Bishop)<br/>     King<br/>     Gold General (Knight)<br/>     Pawn (Rook)<br/><br/><br/>The name in parenthesis is the piece's promoted value; when a piece promotes. it is flipped to its promoted side. However, the unusual feature that this game shares with Kyoto Shogi is that a piece must promote (and demote) every time it is moved.<br/><br/>Because of the geometry of the hexagonal board, some pieces have more, and less, mobility than its counterparts on a square board. For example, the King in Shogi may move in one of eight directions, while in this game, it has a choice of twelve.<br/><br/>",

Kegeln is roughly the traditional German equivalent to Bowling. <br/>The game consists of a large tilted board with a frame on which nine pins can be placed. The players spin tops (two of different sizes are provided) to topple the pins. Because of the incline of the board, it is easy to miss the pins altogether; and toppling all nine with one strike can be achieved only after much practice<br/><br/>You can play it in teams or free for all. Mespi has introduced 3 variants, small (= Mini), medium (= Tiroler Tischkegelspiel) and large (= Meraner Tischkegelspiel), all with similar rules.<br/><br/>The game seems to have been produced since at least 1905 and well into the 1980s.<br/><br/>These sort of table games were merely used in pubs (Bavaria, Tirol) during 19th century, often combined with (forbidden) wagering activities<br/><br/>",

While the core mechanics remain constant, the cards are designed for use in any number of different games. It is most comparable to a standard fifty-two card deck of playing cards. Although it does not have suits and numbers, jacks or queens, Pentology does allow mathematically sound strategy; group, team or solo play; simplicity or complexity; all with the same deck of cards.<br/><br/>Pentology further provides players with a backdrop fantasy theme for every game. With Pentology cards, solitaire games become a mission of saving your allies and defeating your nemesis; poker style games suggest the fun of defining the characteristics of your own hero, and then pitting her strengths against your opponent's; and blackjack feels like a quick skirmish.<br/><br/>Standard playing cards have long been popular because of the vast number of games that can be played with a single deck. Pentology cards boast that same value. Each deck includes a rulebook with rules for five different games, and as creative enthusiasts come up with new game rules and post them on the forum, the list of available games will grow.<br/><br/>With the support of online community, players can continually find new games, contribute their own ideas, and vote on which games to standardize.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kill Ball is a science fiction tabletop sports game for two players created by Gil Nicoll and Adam Watts. It uses tokens or minis on a gridded board to represent a match between two teams of human clones in a gritty arena environment.<br/><br/>Gameplay is an ultra-violent hybrid of handball and hockey. Clones are extremely disposable, and inflicting serious injuries and death upon the opponent&rsquo;s team is a major part of the game&rsquo;s strategy. A decapitation will add an additional ball to the arena which can also be used as weapon.<br/><br/>In leagues and tournaments, each player generates a unique team that carries on from game to game. Clones who suffer injuries or death in the arena will have temporary to permanent reductions to their stats, but are easily replaceable between matches. The ones that survive are awarded experience which can be used to improve attributes and purchase additional abilities.<br/><br/>",

An all-out panic among the archivists is necessary to get their records current! This task is not easy to perform in a hurry because the system of classification mixes different types of numbering!<br/><br/>Players play the role of archivists struggling to clean up their offices and file all of their patent documents (cards) in the Central Archives before the impending General Inspection. Play happens simultaneously and as fast as possible, where players must move, with one hand, cards one at a time from their hand or from the top of a small number of piles in front of them, to the Central Archive, a common play area among all players.<br/><br/>In order to properly file away patents in the Central Archives, a &quot;1&quot; patent may be played on the table, but any other patent must be played atop an existing pile whose patent number is one rank lower than the card being played (a &quot;2&quot; must be played on a &quot;1&quot;, a &quot;3&quot; must be played on a &quot;2&quot; and so on). The trick is that a patent may have an Arabic numeral, a Roman numeral, or a written-out number (e.g. &quot;6&quot;, &quot;VI&quot;, or &quot;Six&quot;), which are all treated interchangeably.<br/><br/>Once any &quot;10&quot; is filed in the Central Archive, play pauses and an Event card is resolved.<br/><br/>The game is over when a player has filed all his patents or when no player can file any more patents.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chivalry is the forerunner of Camelot.  Under development by George S. Parker in 1882, Chivalry was released by Geo. S. Parker &amp; Co. in 1887, and by Parker Brothers in 1888.  Parker called Chivalry &quot;the best game in 2,000 years,&quot; and looked upon it as his personal favorite.  Chivalry is played on a larger board with more pieces than Camelot.  Chivalry, like Camelot, is tactically complex, yet easily learned and quickly played.  It is a clever mixture of American Checkers (British Draughts) and Halma (Chinese Checkers).<br/><br/>The goals of the game is to move two pieces into the two goal spaces on the opposite side of the board. Of course, one has to get past the opponent's piece to do so. Movement of pieces in many ways resembles Checkers except that jumping and moving is omnidirectional.<br/><br/>This game tends to be dominated by key sacrifices and charges for the goal. Since a player has to get two pieces into the goal, the dynamic shifts from just trying to get a single piece into a goal. In other words, players won't make one sudden leap to victory; at least a 1-2 punch is required.<br/><br/>For those familiar with Camelot:<br/><br/>Chivalry is different than Camelot in the following ways:<br/><br/>     The Chivalry board has 176 squares.  The Camelot board has 160 squares.  <br/>     Each side in Chivalry has eight Knights and twelve Men.  Each side in Camelot has four Knights and ten Men.<br/><br/><br/>",

The book includes eight detailed scenarios that can be played alone or together in one of three campaigns.<br/><br/>To accomodate replayability, the book includes a variable order of battle for each scenario which results in unique scenario and campaign replays.  The book includes specific translation rules so that make it compatible with a variety of existing skirmish wargame rule sets.  It also includes a unique generic order of battle listing which will allow for the use of the scenarios in any skirmish rule system.<br/><br/>The scenarios are based on historical research and the book contains background information and a map of the actual campaign for Hamburger Hill.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The fun filled thought provoking discussion generated between players demonstrates the qualities of being unique and being human. To express your opinion of a subject's qualities (player being evaluated), each analyst (all remaining players) must dial their &quot;opinionators&quot; to display a most/least or yes/no answer. Characteristics shown on Ego cards require your opinion of what the player is most and least like. When a statement is read from an Alter Ego card, your yes or no opinion is required of what you think the subject will say. There are no intrinsically right or wrong answers, but answering gives everyone a chance to express their opinions.<br/><br/>Playing The Game: To select the first subject, an Ego card is drawn by each player. The player whose characteristics begin with the letter nearest the beginning of the alphabet becomes the first subject. The subject then collects all Ego cards drawn and places them face up in the Tripper so that each space contains at least one card. All remaining players and the subject then express their opinions of the subject by dialing their opinionators to mach the most/least color combination under the Ego cards in the tripper.<br/><br/>Example: The three Ego cards displayed read generous, expressive and shy. If a player perceives the subject as being more expressive than shy or generous then the player would dial their opinionator to reveal the word most in the color that matches the color under the expressive ego card in the tripper. If the player perceives the subject as being less shy than generous then the player would dial their opinionator to reveal the word least in the color matching the &quot;shy&quot; ego card under the tripper making sure that the Most color already is revealed at the same time. When all players are ready they turn over their opinionators to reveal their opinions.<br/><br/>How to Score: The subject moves forward one square for each analyst opinion that matches his, plus one of his own. Players whose opinions do not match any other player move back one square. Players cannot move further back than the beginner square. Player whose opinions match one or more players remain where they are and are not penalized even if they do not match the subject's opinion. After scoring the player on the subject's left becomes the next subject and the next session is played.<br/><br/>Winning the Game: Play continues with a new subject being evaluated after each session is complete. The player who reaches the winners circle first is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sons of Mithra is a fantasy Chess variant designed and playtested over several years. It uses a 10x10 board and each side has 13 types of pieces.<br/><br/>The basic description is as follows:<br/><br/>Sons of Mithra uses the same basic rules as Western Chess (capture the King), but adds or modifies several pieces.<br/><br/>Piece Descriptions:<br/><br/>Back-rank pieces:<br/>Leader - moves like the King in regular Chess.  Once per game, it can force an enemy piece to make a move instead.<br/><br/>Wyrm - moves like a Queen in Chess.  The Wyrm can reincarnate, however - whenever it is captured, a new one hatches from a hatchling (pawn) the next turn.<br/><br/>Berzerker - moves like a Rook except that it can only move to capture. The Berzerker can move twice in one turn, capturing both times. It may capture friendly as well as opposing pieces.<br/><br/>Teleporter - Can teleport to any empty space. It can also swap places with any friendly back-rank piece (i.e., not Hatchlings, Exploders or Guardians).  Can only capture one space orthagonally.<br/><br/>Ranger - Can attack from a distance. This piece can attack diagonally from up to 4 squares away. It will capture the target piece and stay on the square it was in. If it needs to move, it can move diagonally up to 3 spaces, but cannot capture while moving. It can either capture or move, not both.<br/><br/>Flier - Can fly over other pieces. It moves horizontally and vertically and can change direction any number of times (it cannot change directions back the way it came). However, since it must take off and land, it MUST fly exactly three spaces.<br/><br/>Assassin - The Assassin is a sneaky piece. It can move diagonally up to three spaces and change directions any number of times (it cannot change directions back the way it came). It is excellent for getting around obstacles and is a very good mid-board piece since it covers a good area (especially when combined with the Flier).<br/><br/>Marauder - This piece is like a Reflecting Bishop. It can move diagonally any number of squares and reflects off the side of the board. It can also move (without capturing ) one space horizontally or vertically to put itself on a different diagonal.<br/><br/>Possessor - Can move 2 spaces in any direction, diagonally and/or orthagonally.  Instead of capturing a piece, it possesses an enemy piece and the possessor is removed.  It can also dispossess a possessed piece.<br/><br/>Spectre - Moves like a Rook, but it can move through its own pieces (except the Leader and Guardian). A very good defensive piece.<br/><br/>The following pieces are the front row pieces. They may not be possessed or teleport-swapped.<br/><br/>Hatchlings - like Pawns in Chess, except they can move up to three spaces on their first move, not just two. Hatchlings are numbered from one to eight. The lowest-numbered Hatchling still on the board automatically hatches into a Wyrm when that side's Wyrm is captured.<br/><br/>Guardian - The Guardian is the Leader's protector piece. It moves just like a Queen but cannot capture or be captured. Also, no piece can fly over it, through it, etc.<br/><br/>Exploder - The Exploder is the Wyrm's protector piece. It moves on space in any direction (like the Leader) or it can explode. When it does so, it captures every adjacent piece (except Guardians) - including pieces on its own side! If it captures normally or it is captured, but the Exploder and the other piece are removed from the board.<br/><br/>",

On his turn, a player must perform exactly one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Place one or two stones of his color on empty points of the board. On his first turn, Black can only place one stone. In any case, at the end of a turn, any two like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones must share at least one orthogonally adjacent, like-colored neighbor. Otherwise, the move is illegal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Flip one enemy stone which is sandwiched between two friendly stones adjacent to it on the same orthogonal line. This kind of move is illegal if said enemy piece isn't orthogonally adjacent to any empty point.<br/><br/><br/>If a player can't make a move on his turn, he must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. There will always be a move available to at least one of the players.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tObjectiveThe game is won by the player who completes a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color.

        "description": "Incredible Courage at Elchingen  is the battle where Marshall Ney defeated the Austrian General Reisch just north of the Danube River, just before the surrender at Ulm.  Ney must move 2 of his divisions over the river first and then fight a larger enemy force.  The Austrians helped the French immensely by keeping themselves in their defensive positions.<br/><br/>The game system has a variable strength system that provides for an endless amount of replayability.  This game provides an excellent introduction to the Incredible Courage game system as the forces involved are fairly small, one French Corps vs One Austrian Corps.  This game has some improvements over the Incredible Courage at Austerlitz series with a better organized rulebook and Level of Order markers that better portray what level the unit is currently at.<br/><br/>Play proceeds based on a set of initiative die rolls and Leadership values for Division and Corps Commanders.  Players then choose to either fire or move.  Play alternates between the players until all divisional and corps forces have had the opportunity to move or fire.  Firing is accomplished unit by unit.  Units may perform assault before moving on to other Divisions.  Units are modeled as Infantry Companies (150 men), with Battaion substitute counters, Cavalry Squadrons (100 mounted soldiers), and Artillery Sections (2-3 guns).  Units take losses in Levels of Order, starting at 5 for regular troops and 6 for Elite troops, and when they reach 0 they are eliminated.<br/><br/>Players must use the tactics of the day to put the right forces in the right place at the right time to ensure the success of the mission.  Putting infantry, cavalry, and artillery together will enhance your chances of success.<br/><br/>",

This crew includes Lady Justice (leader), the Judge, and 3 Death Marshals.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica wiki:<br/><br/>Lady Justice is one of the most powerful close-combat fighters in the game. Every opponent dreads facing her Judgement in Melee as her greatsword is capable of felling most with a single swing.<br/><br/>Lady Justice (or &quot;L.J.&quot; to her close friends) often activates before her crew to inspire them to follow and act with greater passion. She is a true inspiration, very straightforward and quite powerful, making her both an easy Master for new players to use and learn the game while maintaining such power and effectiveness that she is still feared by even veteran players.<br/><br/>&quot;L.J.&quot; is one of the only guild Masters that is beloved by the people. Her Crew, despite its secrecy and mystery, share this light. When hunting the filth that has encroached upon Malifaux, she is commonly accompanied by the Judge, and three Death Marshals. The Crew that comes in her starter set is:<br/><br/>Lady Justice (Cache 4)<br/>3 Death Marshals (4-ss a piece [total of 12-ss])<br/>The Judge (7-ss)<br/>TOTAL = 19-ss<br/><br/>This encourages players to look to expand quickly as if you play a standard game (25-ss) with this box set alone, you will be forced to burn 2 Soulstones (i.e. 25-19 = 6-Stones remaining. L.J. bring a Cache of 4-Stones. The max number of Soulstones you can bring at a standard game is only 8, meaning you will have to lose 2 of the 10 Soulstones you have). To avoid doing this, pick up the Scales of Justice, or a different 2-stone Totem.<br/><br/>",

You have three little loyal goblins as your minions at start. You need to help your overlord to defend your dungeon by getting more monsters &amp; traps. You may also send your small army to raid the kingdom above or propose a plan to kidnap the lovely princess. But if you made too much troubles to the kingdom above, more heroes will come to invade your dungeon. So you need to fill your dungeons with more &amp; more powerful monsters to fend off the parties.<br/><br/>This is a co-op + competitive game for 2-4 players. The goal is to gain most favors (VPs)from the overlord, so that you will get the most powerful monsters under your command. At start, a player is assigned to guard one of the 4 floors of the dungeons. The bottom floor is not available yet. You may request to swift floor with another player by playing a plot card in the Court phase. Obviously, you don't want to guard the first floor &amp; let your monsters as cannon fodders.<br/><br/>In Court phase. you may play a plot card to propose a mission like burning the town...etc. If no other player plays a recommendation card, you will lead the mission yourself. If someone play a recommendation card, that player may recommend another player to take the mission instead. VPs will be rewarded for successful missions.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 3VPs. You may lose vps by letting heroes pass your guarding floor, or gain vps by defeating heroes. The more vps you gained, the more say you will have in court phase. Beware! you won't want to see your VPs drop to zero. Your overlord is not a forgiving boss for sure.<br/><br/>",

The first spellcaster opens a round by &quot;casting a spell&quot; &ndash; that is, she chooses up to five cards from her hand that have something in common (either the same number, the same suit, or the same color), then announces the number of cards she's chosen and what they have in common as she places them face up on the table; e.g., &quot;three crowns&quot; or &quot;four yellow&quot;. The following player must either:<br/><br/><br/>    Cast an equal or stronger spell of the same type as the previous player (i.e., the same number of cards &mdash; or more &mdash; with the same common feature), thereby passing the turn to the next player, or<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Take all cards that have been played during this round and place them face down in a pile next to herself. These are her &quot;burns&quot;. This ends the round. She becomes the new &quot;spellcaster&quot; and opens a new round.<br/><br/><br/>When a player must open a new round but has no cards in hand, the skirmish ends and the player with the fewest burns wins. Ties are possible. The game can be played to the best of three or five skirmishes. Mystique includes two advanced rules, covering &quot;aces scoring&quot; and &quot;spell deflection&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Each player represents an elemental Wizard that has a natural affinity to one of the four basic elements: &nbsp;Air, Earth, Fire, or Water.  Players build their Path by using a discard cost mechanic, then use the Focuscroll (game board) abilities to help put the cards in sequence, creating a balanced Wizards Path.<br/><br/>When your Path is strong enough, you will be able to summon powerful spells, known as the Majum.  Use the court cards as support to your Path or petition the allied courts to gain influence.  The game ends at the end of a turn when one or more players have a completed balanced Path.  The Wizard that has a completed balanced Path with the most Path strength, Majum power and allied court influence wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Colonel Timmes and his men received an enormous psychological boost in the form of a telephone line across the marsh to the far shore of the Merderet River. He also had the shaken glidermen who had fallen back to the orchard after the confusion of the night. As dawn broke, the men of the 1/325th were in the process of regrouping, and had yet to dig in. There was no relief in sight for Timmes and his men. The &ldquo;secret ford&rdquo; was a precarious lifeline, swept by fire and barely usable during daylight hours. As casualties continued to mount among the men in the orchards scores of wounded threatened to overwhelm the wholly inadequate medical facilities. And the German determination to retake the crossing would soon prove to be undiminished.<br/><br/>IN EACH GAME YOU GET:<br/><br/>A large-hex 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; two-piece color map on heavyweight stock; researched onsite by designer Ian Daglish;<br/>A Battlefield Walkaround booklet<br/>7 Scenarios printed on heavyweight cards<br/>All the combat counters needed to play, just bring your ATS rules, play aids and markers and a ten sided die <br/>A snazzy ziploc-style bag to keep it all in.<br/><br/>",

The game is played using 'Lab Cards', each featuring a DNA type and an action. Two of these cards are played as DNA to create an amalgimal or single cards are played to perform their actions.<br/><br/>The object is to either collect a full set of amalgimals or attain a specific popularity score for your zoo. Amalgimals are grouped into six sets of five, based on their primary DNA type, and each bestows a popularity score upon its zoo. Certain Lab Cards can also be used to increase your zoo's popularity or reduce that of your opponents.<br/><br/>In addition to splicing them, players can also hunt amalgimals from the wild or steal them from opponents, either through duels with their own amalgimals or using malicious Lab Card actions. Hunting and duelling are based on the amalgimals' inherent attack and defence abilities and the rolling of dice. Hunts and duels can be influenced by any player, during or outside of their turn, using Lab Cards.<br/><br/>The game includes 30 colourful and entertaining amalgimal characters, each with special attributes that help or hinder their keeper.<br/><br/>",

If there are any counters in the Pot, take up to the value of the die you just placed. If the Pot's contents are insufficient, you take all the counters available and your turn ends. If the Pot is empty, you choose either the player to your left OR right, and take counters from her/him UP TO the value of the die just placed but ONLY IF THAT PLAYER HAS 1 OR MORE DICE.

Each card, however, has more than one way to be used, and cannot be used again for several rounds.

Take the right actions and you&rsquo;ll bring joy to the world and ensure that everyone has a Merry Christmas!<br/><br/>Each player drafts a hand of twelve actions, ten of which will be played throughout the game's three phases.  Elves are used in the Workshop Phase to craft toys from the list.  Reindeer are used during the Sleigh Phase to ensure the toys are delivered to excited children.  Items are placed in the Tree Phase to elevate the atmosphere of joy and wonder. Santa makes frequent appearances throughout the game, offering his help along the way.  As Christmas comes to a close, players are scored based on the toys delivered and the joy those toys inspire.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>In 1775 the simmering resentment of American colonists exploded into a bloody rebellion. Beginning in Boston, the conflict eventually stretched from Canada in the north to Florida in the south and lasted eight grueling years. On one side stood the King's redcoats and settlers loyal to their sovereign, later joined by regiments of 'Hessian' mercenaries. Ranged against them was a citizen army under the inspirational leadership of George Washington, supported by militia and eventually French troops eager to embarrass their old foe. Both sides were forced to learn new tactics for fighting in the wild terrain of North America in a conflict that saw heroism and ineptitude in equal measure. This supplement for Black Powder describes the history, armies, personalities and battles of this conflict. Included are scenarios allowing you to recreate many of the battles of the rebellion. This glorious 144-page full-color book, written by Steve Jones, comes with a free Continental officer figure sculpted by Alan Perry himself! Who else would you ask to design a new figure for an American War of Independence book? A copy of the Black Powder rulebook is required to use this supplement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost to history, a new land in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean was discovered by Portuguese sailor Raimundo Peres da Costa at the cusp of the 14th century. The process of merely planning and gaining support to make such a risk-filled journey was a difficult path of its own. Yet, in securing the sponsorship of beloved Queen Isabel of Portugal, Raimundo was able to get the supplies and crew needed to accomplish his dream.<br/><br/>Players recreate this accomplishment in a game that plays out as a 3-act story. First, draft cards representing people who have evidence of the hidden land and plans to get there, in order to gain sponsorship from 1 of 6 important figures. Second, use the resources from your sponsor to draft cards representing the supplies and crew needed to make the journey. Finally, sail the treacherous seas to discover the &quot;Land of Danger&quot; by using your hand of cards to pay for the costs of the voyage.<br/><br/>Gameplay is centered around a deck of multi-use cards that will provide different types of help, depending on the stage of the game, random costs incurred while sailing, and the points gained by completing segments of the voyage. While the game is a race to be first to get to the Land of Danger, points are scored along the way for the difficulty of the voyage and the quality of written journals (hidden scoring cards).<br/><br/>The game is playable solo, and also with 2 to 6 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The First Great War ended in December 1916 with Wilson&rsquo;s Peace, a negotiated settlement that left all parties vaguely dissatisfied (except those called on to die by the millions). The Second Great War erupted in August 1940, with Russian, French and Italian armies attacking the Central Powers in a naked grab for territory and power.<br/><br/>French armies pushed relentlessly into German territory, spearheaded by the massed armor formations advocated by Col. Charles DeGaulle and backed by waves of tactical attack aircraft. Caught off-guard, the Imperial German Army resisted as best it could but gave ground in front of the French and their Belgian and Luxembourgeois allies. To stop the onslaught, the Kaiser&rsquo;s generals decided to deploy their most carefully-guarded secret weapon: the massive armored vehicles known as Land Cruisers.<br/><br/>Land Cruisers is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier game series, set in the same alternative-history background as our Second Great War at Sea games. It is not a complete game: ownership of 1940: The Fall of France and Elsenborn Ridge (and only 1940: The Fall of France and Elsenborn Ridge) is necessary to play all of the 10 scenarios included. Land Cruisers also includes eight double-sized and 72 standard-sized laser-cut and mounted playing pieces.<br/><br/>Notes on editions:<br/><br/>The Gold Club Edition (2015) consisted of a spiral-bound booklet with 10 scenarios and the counter sheet.  The Vault of Treasures Edition (2017) upgraded the booklet to 24 pages and cardboard cover, and included additional background on the land cruisers and the Second Great War.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Magus, the Board Game of Medieval Magic<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of a Magus &ndash; a powerful wizard &ndash; on their quest for ever greater magical power. Along the way they may entreat with Faeries or crush their magical essence from their broken bodies. They may bargain with the Demons of the One Below for power, or dedicate themselves to serve the One Above. They may seek out and drain raw mana from the world from which to study the Arts, and gather the resources to build up their laboratory and libraries where they study the great arts. Their aim is to seek the knowledge and power to carry out the Great Rites when the stars are right and bind into themselves the essence of magic itself.<br/><br/>Magus the board game brings the freedom and flexibility of role-playing to a board game, giving players options and choices to make without setting out what path to follow or in what sequence to carry out actions. The innovative season based turn mechanic ensures the world turns on its cycles around the Magi as they act, constantly offering them new options to consider. It stresses high levels of player interaction with trading, duelling and competing for objectives while excluding player elimination.<br/><br/>Each turn represented a season, starting with part of the board updating depending on which season is happening. Players then choose which action to take - harvesting mana, seeking an encounter with a mythic creature to fight or bargain with it, visit the market to buy equipment and minions or stay in their scantum to research the magical arts. If players compete for the same action, a quick card based bluffing mechanic is used.<br/><br/>",

Invasion 1944 is your gateway to that world.<br/><br/>Based on the battles waged by American troops in the days following the landings in Normandy, Invasion 1944 is specifically designed to introduce new players to the Panzer Grenadier system. Each player commands the troops, tanks and artillery of the U.S Army and the German Wehrmacht, using leaders to activate and move forces.<br/><br/>There are twenty-one scenarios (separate battle situations) depicting the fighting, presented in graduated fashion &ndash; you only need to learn some of the rules to play the first few scenarios, then some more rules for some more involved scenarios, and so on. Panzer Grenadier is already a pretty easy game system to learn how to play, and with Invasion 1944 it&rsquo;s even easier.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s plenty here for veteran Panzer Grenadier players, too: Two new maps by Guy Riessen, depicting the bocage and farmlands of Normandy. 176 new playing pieces (including units, leaders and markers). Twenty-one new scenarios by ace designer Mike Perryman, most of them based on actions of the U.S. Army&rsquo;s 29th &ldquo;Blue and Gray&rdquo; Infantry Division.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The time periods covered in the game are Ancient, Classical, Hellenistic and Roman Greece.<br/><br/>The theme and focus of the game is on Ancient Philosophy and the various schools of philosophy that flourished in these periods, e.g., the Academics, the Stoics, the Epicurean Atomists, etc.<br/><br/>Players take control of a scholarch, or headmaster of a school, and will explore Athens and the world defined by these time periods. Players will move pawns through nodes and pathways on a board representing Ancient Athens. Landing on event spaces will allow players to draw and play from nine different decks of cards, with each card containing both historically and philosophically flavored text and mechanics to implement in-game. Additionally, some spaces will grant players access to various in-game functions, such as a market to buy and sell item cards, a gymnasium to restore health or a temple to supplicate and bid for the help of the gods.<br/><br/>The goal of the game internally is to be the player with the most virtue points. Virtue points are earned by triumphing over other players in the in-game battle system, Dialectics; successfully completing events; recruiting pupils; being in possession of specific items.<br/><br/>While dice rolling will determine successes and failures in the game's event trials, pupil recruitment and actions in battle, players may tilt the odds in their favor when they allocate more of their virtue points to whichever statistic or trait (depicted by the four Socratic Virtues in-game), wager or sacrifice unallocated virtue points for a temporary advantage or collect the abilities of various pupils and items in the game.<br/><br/>And taken from the back of the game's box:<br/><br/>Philosophy is a way of life and the sweetest of the Muses. She importunes you to seek excellence in virtue and cultivate your body and soul. Explore the Classical and Hellenistic periods of Ancient Greece along with its rich Traditions and charismatic Mythos, as you take part in Dialectical arguments in search of Truth, participate in the bustling civic life of Athens, and travel outside of your Mother City seeking opportunities to exercise your Wisdom and practice your Craft on. Aiding you in your Homeric quest for Socratic virtue are loyal pupils, capricious gods and your soul's affinity with the ordered cosmos. Virtue does not come from contemplation alone, but through the application of Reason to right Action.<br/><br/>Game Crafter Shop Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/arete\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/arete</a>:-the-philosophy-board-game<br/>Manual: goo.gl/9dcg3W<br/><br/>",

Food production is being disrupted around the world, and demand is surging for dwindling resources. In the decades to come there will be countless crises, like economic collapse, political revolutions, disastrous weather, failed states, disruptive technologies with unknown consequences, and much more. The only certainty is that when people are faced with famine, they will always migrate and raid their neighbors before starving.<br/><br/>Set in the near future, the players take on the roles of the USA, Western Europe, Russia, China, and India. Collectively, these five major global powers dominate the world&rsquo;s economic, military, political, social, and technological powers. By cooperating and strategizing, the players must put their collective powers into actions to lower carbon emissions while resolving the many crises around the world.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>The world is divided into 15 regions, each with its own population, food capacity, carbon emissions, sociopolitical stability, and likely number of people that would suffer when hit by famine. At the start of each turn a number of crises are revealed to all the players. Each crisis is associated with one of the 15 regions. The players must then decide what actions they will take, unilaterally or jointly, to resolve which crises by implementing their economic, military, political, social, technological powers. Alongside dealing with crises around the world, the players must quickly reduce global carbon emissions and prevent their own regions from becoming a failed state. This can be done by implementing green energies and developing advanced technologies. At the end of each turn the global temperature rises, and if it exceeds a new threshold then food capacity is reduced in every region worldwide. If any region loses its ability to feed its population then famine strikes, starting a chain reaction of refugees, conflicts, failed states, and megadeath! Players must devise innovative solutions to tackle Earth&rsquo;s most urgent problems. Act too selfishly, and you accelerate humanity&rsquo;s demise. Act too altruistically, and you could be overrun by climate refugees and chaos.<br/><br/>EVERYONE LOSES WHEN&hellip;<br/>If the global temperature rises by six degrees Celsius, there won&rsquo;t be any way to stop the runaway greenhouse. It will result in Earth&rsquo;s sixth mass extinction, possibly the greatest one in geologic time! Still, a rising global temperature alone is not the only thing that can bring the end of human civilization. Some regions of the world and its people may be forsaken, mired in conflicts, epidemics, and anarchy. If the chaos consumes most of the world then there will be no safe-haven left for anyone, and all nations will inevitable become failed states. If either condition is met before the end of this century then it is a Global Collapse . . . the beginning of the end of all human civilization!<br/><br/>YOU WIN WHEN&hellip;<br/>If the two conditions for losing are not met by the end of this century, and your region is not a failed state, then humanity is saved and your civilization leads the world into the next century.<br/><br/>",

Units are platoons and the game can scale up to an entire battalion on the board, if you have the table space.<br/><br/>The game features:<br/><br/><br/>     Card driven turn sequence, using a very small card deck.<br/>     Very few (and usually zero) counters, markers or indicators placed on the table.<br/>     No record keeping or tracking for any units, ever.<br/>     Combat rules are quick and straight forward. <br/>     Units are distinctive in play: Tanks are durable but vulnerable to close assault, super heavy tanks are mobile bunkers and massive behemoths can stride right through a defensive line, crushing and terrifying enemy troops as they go.<br/>     Morale system sees units driven off the table and brought back to resume the battle again. You can actually reorganize and redeploy during a game, to open up new fronts or outflank the enemy.<br/>     Army commanders provide special deployment and combat options to their troops.<br/>     Choose from an array of ready-to-play units, put your own together using a fast &quot;Assembly Line&quot; where you simply match up vehicle hulls and guns or use the points system to build your own troops from scratch.<br/>     Unit types that can be built include infantry, tanks, grav vehicles, cavalry, field artillery, giant robots, aircraft, heroes and many more.<br/>     A standard objective-oriented scenario to get to grips with.<br/>     Unit traits included to customize and build unique troops, such as scouts.<br/>     Fully featured map-driven campaign rules, with troop upgrades.<br/>     A small quick-play scenario that should be playable with almost any scifi figures on your shelf.<br/>     Solo battle and campaign rules!<br/><br/><br/>",

There are two ways to have a bounty placed on your head.<br/><br/>Firstly, when you fail an Adventure, instead of taking a Failure card, you may take an appropriate Bounty card. Taking a Bounty card this way means you avoid the immediate penalties of failure, which can be quite an advantage. Secondly, you may succeed at one of the several new Adventures included in the expansion, that while lucrative, are a little bit shady, and also &quot;award&quot; you with a Bounty card.<br/><br/>Also included in the expansion are Bounty Adventures. These are adventures that players may go on to claim bounties placed on other players heads -- to bring them to justice, if you will. Claiming a bounty rewards the player claiming it, and incurs a penalty on the player that had the bounty on them. If you get to the end of the game without a bounty on your head being claimed, you have succeeded in avoiding your dark past being unearthed.<br/><br/>And as a successful bounty hunter, you will add to your Legend.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1950, Alan Turing developed the Turing Test, meant to help distinguish between a person and a machine programmed to behave and respond like a person. Today a new, more sophisticated artificial intelligence has been developed. Its developer, the Programmer, has invited a number of people to participate in the ultimate test of their creation: a dinner party! By the end of the party, the guests attending must determine who among them are actually human and who are artificial intelligence posing as humans.<br/><br/>During the game, players receive Backgrounds to help them assume the role of one of the party guests. Players then receive special character Traits which may be considered either Human or AI behaviors. By asking questions and observing the other guests' behavior over the course of the game, the human players try to work together to deduce who is AI.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the humans know that AI have to follow certain protocols and programming. But since some players themselves may be AI, you can never fully trust anyone!<br/><br/>Halfway through the game and again at the end, the players assign Suspicion Tokens to the other guests, representing the strength of their conviction that certain people are indeed AI... since it these are assigned anonymously, the AI also get to vote and can use their Suspicion to deflect attention away from themselves toward other guests. The attendees who arouse the most Suspicion reveal their identities to see whether or not the AI were caught and passed the Turing Test.<br/><br/>The Turing Test is a social game by award-winning game designer Jay Little with additional development and extensive play testing by students from the University of Wisconsin-Stout. These students contributed to the game through a special Board Game Production &amp; Processes class Jay Little teaches at the university.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>An expansion to the popular Card Game of Oz! The Card Game of Oz introduces an innovative new game system called the Storyline Game System that adds strategy to your challenging and fun adventures through Oz. Each player takes on the role of an author attempting to construct the best story in the world of Oz. During the game, players will attempt to bring together objects, characters and locations that are appropriate together - for example, the Tin Woodman and his Oil Can - while avoiding hazards like the field of poppies and terrible beasts and villains like the Kalidahs or the Wicked Witch of the West. Each round players roll a special set of dice to determine the number of points they have for drawing and playing cards. The number of dice increases during the game, allowing the game to scale naturally while you play. The game ends when a player is able to move a Prime character - that is, one of the main characters of the story - from her Title card all the way to The End, but doing so is no simple race because the character who triggers the endgame is worth no points toward victory. Featuring hundreds of fascinating characters, events, and vistas, Oz is a world that has stood the test of time. Construct an iconic tale that is all your own!<br/><br/>This expansion has three new pre-constructed story packs.  Story Pack #1 (Core Pack), Story Pack #2 (Military Coup), and Story Pack #3 (Restoration of Ozma).<br/><br/>",

Pro player's offensive and defensive abilities directly impact the action on each &amp; every roll of the dice. Play head to head or solitaire and coach your favorite team to victory by maximizing your team's strengths while exploiting your opponent's weaknesses.<br/> Find yourself immersed in a world of momentum changing 3 pointers, fast-breaks, steals, soul-crushing blocks, clutch free throws and last second buzzer beaters. Your decisions are dictated by your team's style of play. Are you built to shoot three's, or do you have a dominant big man to feed in the paint? Do you thrive in transition, or are you better off patiently working the ball up the court? You'll need to know your team if you want a shot at championship glory!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A strategic-level, two-player &ldquo;mini-monster&rdquo; of intermediate complexity, designed by Ty Bomba, covering the entire Russo-German War. Play may end sooner than the historic termination time, if the German player is able to do significantly better than his historic counterparts by advancing so quickly he causes the overall political, social, economic and military collapse of the Soviet Union. Likewise, if the Soviet player is able to carry out his strategic comeback more efficiently than did historic counterparts during the second half of the war, the game may again end earlier than it did historically.<br/><br/>Each extra-large hexagon on the two-sheet map represents 55 miles. The large-size counters provide corps as primary units of maneuver for the Germans, while for the Soviets they&rsquo;re armies. The full order of battle is the most complete ever published in any simulation at this level.<br/><br/>The six scenarios include: the Grand Campaign, 1941-45; The Road Back, 1942-45; Operations Blue &amp; Kremlin, 1942; Operation Citadel, 1943; What If: Manstein&rsquo;s Gambit, 1943; and What If: 1942 (assuming the war didn&rsquo;t start until a year after its historic date).<br/><br/>Contents<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; maps<br/>352 counters<br/>32-page full color rules booklet<br/><br/>",

The units of maneuver are regiments, brigades, divisions or equivalents.<br/><br/>Islamic State: Syria War is a systemic evolution of IS: Libya. The changes in the game system reflect the fact that the later simulated an all-out proxy and civil war, while the later simulates an intervention/pacification campaign by NATO in Northern Africa, away from Russian or Iranian meddling.<br/><br/>In this game, both powers contemplate the pacification and stabilization of Syria, even though the war is being fought simultaneously in Syria and Iraq, and, in fact, the wars in these two countries feed each other. Neither the Russians nor the USA or the UE are considering the partition of Syria and Iraq along religious and ethnic lines (into Kurdish, Shia and Sunni entities). It is also assumed that the USA and Russia have reached an agreement to share intelligence in the fight against a common enemy: DAESH. The size and time constraints forced to simplify the myriad combatant factions into &quot;Islamist Rebels&quot; and &quot;Non-Islamist Rebels,&quot; although the later might include supposedly &quot;moderate&quot; Islamist rebels.<br/><br/>CounterFact Issue 7<br/><br/>",

The time covered by an entire game may represent 8-12 days, depending on events within the game.<br/><br/>The game lasts 7 turns. In general terms, both players will draw a number of cards from a deck of ordinary playing cards, then will play them alternately one by one to conduct different activities with their counters on the map.<br/><br/>Each game comes with 30 counters, an area-movement map of a portion of eastern Slovakia, and short rules. Players will also need a deck of ordinary playing cards (with 2 Jokers) and several six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Published by Hollandspiele in 2017 as part of a two-game package, together with Ukrainian Crisis: Ukrainian Crisis & The Little War. The games within the box use separate components, and only share a rulebook.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Fisherman play style is all about movement and raw goal-scoring potential. They are dominant in the early game and can easily draw one or two goals ahead very quickly. However, mid to late game they need to be wary, especially if they lose a player or two.<br/><br/>They excel at movement and kicking the ball - they are practically all about offense. Their combo play revolves around (re)positioning and exploitation of space.<br/><br/>Whilst not entirely equipped with raw damage soaking defence, they instead have far subtler defensive options that focus much more on space control.<br/><br/>They call it the beautiful game for a reason. When the Fishermen take to the pitch, the crowd holds its breath, waiting for that sublime moment of skill; the perfectly measured pass, the volley that ricochets off the goal, the poetry in motion that is a team operating in perfect harmony.<br/><br/>Playing with the Fishermen's Guild is like mastering the use of a surgical tool. With lightening speed and a penchant for subterfuge, the opposition are left baffled by the wide range of tricks available to a Fishermen's Guild team. With a superstar captain in Shark, a striker beyond compare in Angel, and the mysterious machinations of Siren, Fishermen players can leave their lumbering opponents grasping at air.<br/><br/>This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Fisherman&rsquo;s Guild.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How Savvy are you?<br/><br/>Starting with a random card between 1 and 36, players have to decide whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower to accumulate points... but this is no game of luck!<br/><br/>Each time you choose correctly, you accumulate a point in the 'holding area', and have the chance to choose higher or lower again from the new number, and get another point each time you guess correctly. BUT... guess incorrectly and lose all the points from that turn! The only way to keep your points is to elect to stop, at which point the next player continues from the current number.<br/><br/>Extra care is needed on the first guess of each of your turns too! You can elect to guess and start earning more points, but get your first guess wrong and you will lose half of all the points you have in your 'bank'!!!  Or, if its too risky, pass straight away to the next player, but this will cost you one point from your bank. If you've nothing in your bank, you must call!<br/><br/>Players on low points at the start of their turn, get another go if they get their first call wrong.<br/><br/>Counters mark which cards have already been drawn on a simple mat, so while this is a brilliant game of risk for anyone to play, it's also perfect for developing numerical and probability skills with children of all ages!<br/><br/>For 2-6 players, aged 8 and upwards, and a playing time of 10-40 minutes. The longer time scale relates to six players, the banter, and the liquid refreshment at hand.<br/><br/>More info and game session videos are available on the website at <a target='_blank' href=\"https://savvygames.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://savvygames.co.uk</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Way of the Fighter - Fighter Packs are small packs of cards introducing two new fighters to the game, along with two new techniques for the existing styles.<br/><br/>Aya is one of the last followers of the famous Hashashin, an assassin cult of ancient Persia. She is an extremely mobile fighter with the unique ability to move through her opponent and strike from behind, prior to them changing their facing. She is a perfect fit for aggressive and relentless players. Her mode card Shadow Veil further increases the damage actions she plays during a turn if she moves through the opponent&rsquo;s space that turn. Not all of her actions are reliant on her traversing through her opponent&rsquo;s space. Actions like Deadly Rhythm are mixed into her attacks just for such occasions when an opponent is too far away to get around them.<br/><br/>Ranveer is a well-rounded master sikh warrior, his fighting form is methodical and strategical, thanks to his ability to see the action being played against him before committing dice. Unlike most fighters, Ranveer&rsquo;s actions primarily consist of very powerful modes. The power and effects of his modes are dependant on the number of power dice you roll to determine their priority scores. For example, Garuda&rsquo;s Swiftness can be discarded from play to increase the priority of an action before it is revealed. The increase is based on the amount of power dice that are on the mode when it is discarded. Nandi&rsquo;s Resilience can be discarded to prevent damage dealt to Ranveer.<br/><br/>The Aya vs Ranveer fighter pack also comes with two sets of actions from the Counter technique and Acrobatic technique. The Counter technique for the Soft style makes heavy use of the Counter keyword which can prove very strong against a predictable opponent. The Acrobatic technique for the Fluid style supplements fighters who like to be in constant movement with an additional level of unpredictability and speed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Way of the Fighter - Fighter Packs are small packs of cards introducing two new fighters to the game, along with two new techniques for the existing styles.<br/><br/>Brahm is a brutal Scandinavian metal-head, with an in-your-face aggressive nature. His deck can consist of three technique from the Hard style, and his ability allows him to suffer 1 damage in order to give his attacks Chain 1. Brahm is able to turn the Hard style in a combo heavy fighting form, at a cost. His mode action, Ragnar-Rock, makes it so that opponents no longer cancel his actions when he is damaged, but the tradeoff is that it prevents him from blocking. Brahm&rsquo;s Valhalla Block allows him to recover health that he may have willing suffered for those high damage combos. Health management is a key feature to Brahm playstyle.<br/><br/>Cobalt, an Argentinian and elite ex-commando for the Red Star Committee, has a cybernetic arm that she uses to reposition and strike at her opponents from both near and far. This is represented best with blast actions that only last until the end of the challenge phase. For example when Dragging Hook&rsquo;s blast token hits a retreating opponent, Cobalt pulls the the opponent towards her space. Grappling Thrust on the other hand, will pull Cobalt closer to the opponent when they are hit by its blast token.<br/><br/>The Brahm vs Cobalt fighter pack also comes with two sets of actions from the Push technique and Slam technique. The Push technique from the Hard style provides powerful attacks that push their target away, making it ideal for fighters wishing to distance themselves from an aggressive opponent. The Slam technique is one of the most physical sets of actions from the Fluid style that uses momentum to control the opponent&rsquo;s position in the arena.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Khublai is by far a larger than life character both metaphorically and physically. A giant of a man, boisterous, and a hero of this people, he is the quintessential Mongolian wrestler; powerful, more agile, and faster than he should be. Khublai&rsquo;s weight and size prevents him from jumping very high. In game terms, this is represented by his inability to use the Leap command along with ignoring effects that move him to a jumping position on his actions, making him a huge and static target. He overcomes this hindrance with a powerful effect that allows him to ignore the first point of damage dealt to him each turn. This ability to ignore low damage and his utmost mastery of wrestling techniques, makes him a terror at close range. He controls the board with cards like Unmovable Block and Giant of Bokh. Khublai is a mountain that will crush any opponent that gets within his melee range. Horse Spirit, Ultimate Mekh, and Massive Chop are great options for overcoming his inability to leap with their small burst of speed. Learning how to overcome his inability to leap by playing powerful actions such as these that close the distance between him and his opponent is pivotal to winning with the Mongolian giant.<br/><br/>In contrast, Wattana is small in stature and quiet, but under her serious and brooding demeanor exists an inextinguishable fiery champion. Her bone-crunching Muay Thai techniques are debilitating to the extreme. Her rigorous discipline and training unlocked some her inner phoenix, making her chi surrounding her appear as burning flames. She has very little movement options, and even the Command on her fighter ability encourages her to remain in place. That said, a simple Priority Bonus 2 with a fighter who makes use of hard style attacks is a huge threat, as it compensates for the main flaw of low priority values that come from heavy attacks. Moreover, her access to Chi Actions gives her some zoning control. Her two blasts, Flaming Strike and Phoenix Wings, are frustrating thanks to their Drain effect. Plummeting Elbow is a complete denier, in particular with damage boosting moves or modes. Twin Rising Uppercut is very unique with the ability to make two powerful attacks in a row, serving as the perfect response to weaker blocks. Her mode Art of Eight Limbs is great for building some power dice while also remaining steadfast.<br/><br/>The Khublai vs Wattana fighter pack also comes with two sets of actions. The Brutal technique from the Hard style is a simple technique composed of slow attacks with very high damage output. Use Shattering Strike to set up for a follow-up that is guaranteed to cancel cowardly blocks. The Lock technique from the Wrestle style includes grapple attacks equipped with Trash effects that destroy the opponent&rsquo;s hand. This technique also compliments Severina&rsquo;s hand denial game. Just swap it out with one of the other wrestle techniques from the Turbo set to generate a deadly hand destruction deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game-o-Rama is a boardgame themed around the annual gaming event held in Atlanta. This print-to-play version is available so gamers can learn the game in advance of the tournament to be held at the next Game-o-Rama (February 2018).<br/><br/>Game-o-Rama is a mancala-style game. Each player has their own board and on their turn they pick up all the pieces in a space and drop them one-per-space (in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction) and have an opportunity to score when the pieces in the last space match the icons on one of the cards each player gets. If they match exactly the player gets another turn.<br/><br/>This is a relatively fast and simple to learn game that was called &quot;surprisingly tricky&quot; and &quot;not what we are looking for at this time&quot; by a major boardgame publisher. You will need the cards and player boards to play. Chips, meeples, or cubes can be used for the pieces. A recommended color chart for each icon type is included. More information about the tournament is at the event site.<br/><br/>",

The game is made up of only 9 cards and 18d6 and has a game time of 20 to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The game takes place in either a 4/6 room house or 4/6 room tavern.  The players will take turns trying to stay alive through the night for either 18 or 24 turns; represented as hours.<br/><br/>Zombies have overrun the city and the players have found safety in an abandoned house/tavern.  As the zombies attack, the player must try to build makeshift weapons to destroy the zombies attacking the access points &quot;doors/windows&quot;.  The players can also search to try and find a real weapon &quot;pistol/shotgun&quot; to destroy even more zombies at a time.<br/><br/>Each turn the zombies will randomly attack a window or door at any of the 4/6 rooms, with sometimes 2 zombies attacking at once.  When the zombies reach a max of 6 zombies at a door/window and are not blocked by reinforcing the barricades, they break into the house/tavern and takeover the room.  If 2 or more rooms are lost to the zombies the game ends.  If either player dies before the 18/24 turns are up, the games ends.<br/><br/>Each time a zombie is destroyed they are worth 1 point and 5 points for a super zombie. If the players lose any health they subtract 1 point per health lost.  If a real weapon is found and used a one-time -10 point deduction is made to the total points.  The players are not only trying to survive the night but also reach the highest zombie hit count possible.<br/><br/>",

Players place two workers each round, one at the lowest numbered position of a line of their choice, then one at the highest numbered position of a line of their choice, which are then moved in order to the available resource spots for that line. Points are scored for resources and majority of resources, for contributing to the arks that take them off the island, and for completing a secret goal by the end of the game.<br/><br/>In the game of Ark of Paradise, players are clan leaders in an island which is doomed to sink. They send their workers everywhere in the island to gather domestic artifacts, animals, and plants, and to build arks to evacuate from the island.At the end of sixth round, the island sinks and the arks depart to a new land. Players score points according to amount of items gathered and contribution to ark-building, and the highest scorer is the winner and leads the entire clans on the new land.<br/><br/>This game utilizes unique worker-placemnt mechanism. Each round, available actions are determined by card draw, and action spaces are divided into three groups. Workers don't go into action spaces directory but into spaces which determine a group and priority. You may place two worders in a turn, first one into the top available priority of a group and second one into the bottom. After all eligible workers are placed, each worker is sent to their intended action group in the order of priority. You cannot be fully aware of which actions your workers do until that time. You will have moderate interactions with other players, and that is a fun part of this game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>プレイヤーはほろびの預言がくだされた島の有力な部族の長となり、自らの部下を島中に送り込み、島から脱出するための方舟をつくったり、積み荷を島中からかき集めていきます。<br/>６ラウンドが終わったとき島は完全に沈み、方舟は新天地へ旅立ちます。積み荷の数や方舟の建造に貢献した度合いにおうじた勝利点を手に入れ、もっとも勝利点の高いプレイヤーが新天地における指導者としての地位を得ます（つまり、ゲームに勝利します！）<br/>ワーカーの配置が独特で、中央のボードにまず配置してから、アクションマスのある土地カード上へ送り込まれます。他のプレイヤーとのほどよいインタラクションがあり、適度な悩ましさが面白いポイントです。<br/><br/>",

It's also portable and fits in your pocket, so you can play it virtually anywhere.<br/><br/>Put plainly, PICKLE PICKLE PEPPER is the perfect pastime for people with a passion for point-based pick-up play!<br/><br/>(In this game, alliteration is part of the fun, so get used to it.)<br/><br/>The basics are simple. Players start their turn by shuffling the whole deck, then pledging how many cards they intend to draw; that's your Pickle Pledge. If you're able to draw a number of pickles equal to your pledge amount without drawing a pepper, you can choose to stop and bank your Pickle Points. However, if you're feeling bold, you can push your luck (which we call a Pickle Push). While you're pushing, pickle cards are worth twice as many points, but if you draw a pepper card, you not only score zero points this turn, you lose some of the points you've already banked! Once your turn is over, pass the deck to the next player and repeat. The first player to bank a total of 20 Pickle Points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The British Counter-Attack at Arras<br/><br/>This game is a collaborative design between Grognard Simulations and Stronpoint Simulations of the British Armies surprise attack on Rommel's 7th Panzer Division at the city of Arras.  This game is a lighter version of the Death Ride series and a good introductory game for the series.<br/><br/>The battle is an interesting situation where the British got the drop on Rommel when the Germans were only considering victory and were too confident of success.  This is where Hitler began to get nervous about the ever extending flank of the German armored spearheads.  Luckily for the Germans the British had poor coordination and poor tanks involved in the attack.  While they made the Germans nervous and gave a few units some real problems they didn't have much of a chance of cutting off the German spearheads.<br/><br/>This two day battle is one of the high points of the French campaign for the Allies.  Players will each find a tense situation at the beginning.  The British must try to push hard as far as they can in order to effect a breakthrough.  The Germans must stave off the breakthrough and hold on until help arrives.  Rommel sent the 25th Panzer Regiment forward and left the softer elements of the division behind.  It's these softer elements that come under attack.  The 25th Panzer Regiment is the help and they had to turn around and go back in order to stop the British attack.<br/><br/>Game Scales are:<br/>- Game Turns are 15 minutes; a change from most other Death Ride series games<br/>- Hex Scale is 330m per Hex<br/>- Most units are platoons, British infantry are companies<br/><br/>Contents - comes with (in Full Color):<br/>(4) Map Sections of the Arras France Area of Operations<br/>(3) Counter Sheets with over 600 Units and Markers<br/>(2) Scenario Cards<br/>(2) d10 and (1) d6<br/>58 Pg.

        "description": "Over four years, 1951-1954, players take on the role of a community member in a typical American town. Your goal - ensure that in an age of ratting out, selling out and conspiracy that you emerge the least tainted, the least disgraced and the least shamed. The only effective way to do this, of course, is to ensure that the attention of the authorities remain firmly fixed on everyone else.<br/><br/>Game play is based on the card drafting mechanic and is straightforward. On your turn you select a card from a hand of cards and choose which player in your judgment would be the most damaged by that card. And then you play that card on that player and watch them rack up levels of social shame that would make anyone's grandmother blush. Of course, every other player is lining up to do the same to you, but hey, that's just business in a time of betrayal, me-first and &quot;do it to Julia.&quot; Global Crisis cards are resolved each season that can dramatically change the &quot;facts on the ground,&quot; as they absolutely did during this historical period.<br/><br/>While being historically-informed, this game isn't slavishly historical. The global crises, &quot;ordering institutions&quot; and other obstacles are all directly historical or are composites (like the characters).<br/><br/>Red Menace is a straightforward social game. Once you get the procedure down, the game play itself should take between 30 and 40 minutes. Don't dwell on what you're going to do - almost everything in the game brings social shame to your opponents, after all!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In each round, players present a chicken to the dice fight, roll dice simultaneously, then send losing chickens to the fried-chicken carry-out bucket.

But if you play your cards right and get just a little bit of luck from the dice, it will be winner winner chicken dinner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rate of Fire is a set of platoon level WWII skirmish rules. One figure represents one man and after a couple of games a player should easily be able to command 30-40 figures on the tabletop and complete a game within a few hours. Modifiers and special rules have been kept to a minimum and the emphasis of the game is on the turn order, troop quality, morale and leadership.<br/><br/>The rulebook covers infantry actions and the weapons and equipment associated with that. There are no vehicle rules included in this first book but they are being worked on as the first supplement.<br/><br/>Troops will have various training levels from Green to Regular to Veteran and also variable morale, these affect what an element is able to achieve when it is activated. You`ll find that well trained and well lead troops with good morale are more than a match for poorly commanded new recruits and the rules were specifically designed with this in mind.<br/><br/>Leaders have the ability to use their Leadership Bonus to allow subordinate units to increase their chance of passing morale and rally tests. This will allow your inspirational commanders to encourage and motivate troops, again giving a well led force a distinct advantage over one that is poorly commanded.<br/><br/>As well as the basic rules covering everything you would expect from a WWII skirmish game there are advanced rules that cover smoke, night, weather, engineering, mines, artillery, forward observers, spotting, snipers, hidden deployment and much more.<br/><br/>Rate of Fire includes a points system and victory objectives for those games when players simply want to be able to turn up with their troops and fight an opponent with a fairly even match up. Obviously you may also play specific scenarios that are based on historical actions, though these are unlikely to be balanced games they can provide far more variety and challenge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Yomi is a fighting game in card form in which physical dexterity is replaced by hand management skills. Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.<br/><br/>More specifically, Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.<br/><br/>Yomi Starter Set: Midori versus Setsuki features two character decks, allowing players to face off immediately. Individual character decks allow new matches to be fought between different pairings.<br/><br/>Game Modes<br/><br/>1v1, the main mode<br/>    2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom<br/>    A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent<br/>    A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.<br/>    Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.<br/>    Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.<br/>    Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.<br/>    Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.<br/>    Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck. In that case, time is out and the player with the highest life wins.<br/><br/>Note Contained in:<br/>Yomi (Second Edition)<br/>Yomi: Round 1<br/><br/>",

The players take on the roles of Detective Billy Meowth, Franky (a mafia boss), and Timeowthy (Billy's best friend).  Billy was working as an undercover agent for Franky, but his cover has been blown!  The game is devised by Franky as a way to weed out rats, but he was unaware that Timeowthy was Billy's best friend.<br/><br/>Billy and Franky are each given 10 cards, and the game lasts up to 5 rounds.  In each round, the Billy and Franky players will simultaneously play 2 cards face down to the table.  The Timeowthy player will inspect the cards and determine which players' cards have the larger sum.  Timeowthy will then reveal one of the two cards player by the winner.  Once during the game Timeowthy can lie and reveal a card player by the loser instead.<br/><br/>The game ends when either Billy or Franky has won 3 rounds.  If Franky wins 3 rounds, then Franky wins.  If Billy wins 3 rounds, then Franky chooses 1 round in which he accuses Timeowthy of lying about the result. If Franky is correct, that player wins.  If Franky is incorrect, Billy and Timeowthy both win.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Or 30 etc..<br/><br/>In your turn you can also swap numbers from your board from randomly pickt numbers out of the bag.<br/><br/>When a player is out of numbers the game ends and all the scores (written down by a player) are added to see who has the most points.<br/><br/>A game to use for math leasons and to learn your math skills.<br/><br/>",

Where Morale Napoleon excels is in allowing players to &ldquo;do their duty&rdquo;. You are in charge of a Corps of soldiers ranging in size from 20,000 to 40,000 men. Once you become comfortable with the rules, you can easily double those numbers. Your duty is simple:<br/><br/>Have a plan. Deploy your troops to accomplish your plan. Decide where to place your reserve and when to use it. In Morale Napoleon, once you have sent your troops into action, it is out of your control, just like in real life. Did you plan well? Is your deployment correct? Will you know when the moment is right to launch the reserve? Do you have what it takes to be in command?<br/><br/>Regimental size formations that allow you to easily command a Corps or more. Mechanics that provide a fun game with realistic conclusions &ndash; no &ldquo;gaming the rules&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Army lists for over 20 of the nations that fought in the Napoleonic Wars &ndash; from the major players to their smaller allies.<br/><br/>Reinforcement tables that reflect Napoleon&rsquo;s dictum of march divided, fight united.<br/><br/>Complete rules that allow you to pay solo or co-operatively against the game as well as competitively, head to head.<br/><br/>A light book keeping Campaign System that ties your battles together while giving you a reason to fight and telling you when all is lost.<br/><br/>",

All players start at the starting point but each one can build their route as they prefer since the 3 checkpoints can be visited in any order, as long as they can all be collected.<br/>After this it is determined who will be the first player of the round and the direction in which the turns will be passed. In that same order the characters will be placed at the starting point and 4 cards from the main deck will be drawn.<br/><br/>At the beginning of his turn each player receives 5 energy points, which he can use to move his character or play a card from his hand. These cards can be road cards, action cards or accessory cards:<br/><br/>     The road cards are played on the map always adjacent to a previously played road card and keeping concordance, so that there is an adequate route to gradually reach the different check points.<br/>     The action cards have different effects that can be played on road cards or on accessory cards.<br/>     The accessory cards are stored in a player's backpack (it can be from an opponent or your own) and can have various effects, whether permanent or single use.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of his turn, each player draws cards from the main deck until he has 4 cards in hand again.<br/><br/>The final round is determined when a player collects the 3 check points but the remaining players can continue playing until the current round is completed.<br/>If more than one player manages to collect all 3 check points in the final round, a tie is declared, otherwise the only player who managed to do so wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first &quot;new game mechanism&quot; expansion for Starving Artists from the 2019 Kickstarter:<br/><br/>These cards would be worth no food or points and don't count toward a canvas victory. However, when you complete the card, you can &quot;sell&quot; it (as your free action for the day) and take five paints from the bag of your choice. Not a random pull.<br/><br/>These cards would be available to all players to take instead of a normal buy action. They cost nothing to take, but there's a limited number of them and you can only have one at a time.<br/><br/>They are painted using five of any paint cubes like any other normal paint action.<br/><br/>What this solves<br/><br/>This new Sketch and Study option means:<br/><br/>Players have a better way to convert unwanted/unneeded paints; <br/>Players can use the sketches to better utilize their painting actions (e.g., if you only need to paint once or twice to finish a canvas); and <br/>While they last, there's always something &quot;to buy&quot; regardless of how much paint you have and regardless if the market doesn't have a great set for you personally.<br/><br/>",

Devil's Chess brings modern board game mechanics to an old classic.  With Devil's Chess you get a bit of randomness, new mechanics and card combos, and a whole lot of new tricks to surprise your opponent. Devil's Chess brings Chess out of the 6th century and into the 21st!<br/><br/>Setting up the game is easy.  Shuffle both decks, and set them to the left and right of the chessboard.  Each player is dealt a hand of three Playable Cards. To begin the game flip over one Rule Card.  Players then take turns playing cards and moving pieces.  When a player draws a &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Chess&rdquo; card, another new Rule Card is flipped over.<br/><br/><br/>     At the beginning of your turn, draw a Playable card if you do not have three<br/>     You may use or discard one Playable Card<br/>     Your turn ends after you move a chess piece<br/><br/><br/>The game is over when a King is put into checkmate or when a &ldquo;More Ways to Win!&rdquo; condition is met by a player.<br/><br/>With 30 unique Rule Cards and 90 Playable Cards, Devil&rsquo;s Chess is unbelievably re-playable.  We know you&rsquo;ll make it a mainstay in your game library.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Should you play it safe or just &quot;SEND IT!&quot;?<br/><br/>On each turn, riders choose two actions, which can be the same or different, from the following options:<br/>1. Ride - roll the riding die and move 1-3 spaces along the singletrack.<br/>2. Train - roll the two training dice to gain the skill points you need to send the next feature.<br/>3. Prepare - draw a Prepare card to gain points (which help you recover from a crash and send the next feature) or special skills.<br/>4. SEND IT - if you are on a feature and have the necessary skills, play Prepare card points and roll the 20-sided die to try to send it and pass on to more difficult singletrack.<br/><br/>Just like real mountain biking, crashing can happen in a variety of ways - you can crash while training, while riding or while sending it - and until you recover from your crash you can't do anything but prepare, giving the other riders the chance to get ahead.<br/><br/>The first rider to send the final feature (the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;) and reach the Golden Burrito wins the game.<br/><br/>For a more advanced version, add the &quot;Trail Building&quot; action which allows riders to place the features instead of randomly placing them at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

If the stories are to be believed, Jackson Montgomery suffered a psychotic break and buried his wife and three girls alive at various places on the farm in order to escape the responsibilities of being a husband and father in such a difficult time. He was never seen or heard from again. The newspapers dubbed him &ldquo;The Gravedigger,&rdquo; and before long the stories were enough to transform him into an urban legend who might return at any point to punish anyone foolish enough to trespass on his land.<br/><br/>Fast forward to modern day.<br/><br/>When Museum Nocturnus, a cabinet of curiosities dedicated to all things odd and bizarre, decide to open a Gravedigger exhibit they enlist the help of the S.T.A.L.K. ghost hunting group and plan an excursion to the Montgomery farm to find out what really happened all those years ago. The museum group unexpectedly disappears while exploring the farm, and the S.T.A.L.K. group is left to piece together what happened. One of the only bits of evidence they have is a note nailed to the front door of the Montgomery house impossibly signed by The Gravedigger. It&rsquo;s not possible that Jackson Montgomery has returned from the beyond to murder more innocents. But, if not him, then who? Is this someone&rsquo;s idea of a joke? Or is it possible that someone else has taken up The Gravedigger&rsquo;s mantle?<br/><br/>Join the S.T.A.L.K. group and find out what really happened at a place that the locals call The Body Farm.<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 6/10<br/><br/>",

In battle, however, it is common to find all these Stormcasts fighting as one. Disciplined Liberators and Judicators of the Redeemer Conclaves form the heart of the battle line, while swift Prosecutors from the Angelos Conclaves hunt down those enemies who attempt to flee.

With this set, you&rsquo;ll be able to bring some of Sigmar&rsquo;s most stalwart warriors to your games of Warcry, with fighter rules for a vast range of different units.

        "description": "Overview<br/>GLOBAL CRISIS blends cooperative game play with elements of hidden role games. Your leadership represents a major world superpower and a collective of nations. Can you overcome ancient challenges and bring about world peace? Global Crisis is a collaborative game (with a twist) where everyone is working to stabilize global chaos. The twist is that one player might be an agent of chaos. Yes, might. This potential saboteur raises suspicion and increases the challenge. Trust will have to be earned, hopefully before it is too late!<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>If players collectively score enough points, they win. Players score by passing as many global policies as possible (before time runs out) to address the five overarching sets of Global Challenges. If a player is the &quot;Agent of Chaos,&quot; that player can only win if the group scores in the lowest bracket possible&mdash;thus causing all other players to collectively lose.<br/><br/>This game can be played with 2 to 5 players. All players begin with five cards. In the initial rounds, players gather as much information as they can about the cards in the hands of other players. Next, they will aid each other to remove challenge cards from their hands, organize them by sets (color), and finally try to score on each set. There are five sets of challenges that can score. Scoring is based on how many cards within a set the group can collect and whether the group can form a unique policy on each set&mdash;all before time runs out. Time expires when the players have formed a policy for all five sets of challenges, or when a player attempts to draw a card from the deck, but the deck has run out.<br/><br/>Theme<br/>Global Crisis::, Earth 2265, the world is on the edge of total annihilation. Natural, social, political, military, and corporate forces have pushed humanity to the brink. The words of a Persian mystic and prisoner who foresaw the future 400 years prior stands truer than ever before...<br/><br/>&quot;O ye the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye counsel together, and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind, and bettereth the condition thereof . . . Regard the world as the human body which, though at its creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with grave disorders and maladies. Not for one day did it gain ease, nay its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians . . .&quot; &mdash;Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h<br/><br/>In fits and starts the process of creating global stability has been emerging for eons. Now the world faces it's most dire hour. The super-science of catastrophic weaponry, imbalanced and exploited globalization, and the unlocked potentials of Mother Nature's wrath have all given rise to myriad horrific problems which require a host of powerful solutions.<br/><br/>Forces of light and dark battle openly in public discourse, secretly behind the closed doors of the powerful elite, and deep within the minds and hearts of all people. Despite those who cling to a world long gone, a consensus has formed among the world's peoples and great leaders: a new world must be made. Led by the charge of reason and fueled by a desperate hope, a rallying cry for peace is heard:<br/><br/>&quot;The Great Peace towards which people of goodwill throughout the centuries have inclined their hearts, of which seers and poets for countless generations have expressed their vision, and for which from age to age the sacred scriptures of mankind have constantly held the promise, is now at long last within the reach of the nations.&quot;   &mdash;From &quot;The Promise of World Peace&quot; by The Universal House of Justice<br/><br/>Is it too late to counteract eons of destruction? Can humanity set aside their petty squabbles, age old hatreds, and demagogue-stoked fears in order to bring about what is only dreamed of? And what of suspicions? Is everyone a trusted ally or do some lurk in shadow, attempting to plunge the world into a dark age of fallout and waste?<br/><br/>You are the rulers and leaders who will settle the fate of the world, for better or worse!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players work to evade a wide range of fierce dragon attacks while gathering an assortment of rubies, emeralds and gold. Challenge the dragon alone or with friends as you compete to gather as much treasure as you can before your luck runs out. Do you dare enter The Dragon&rsquo;s Lair?<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>Separate out one blink per player to be treasure hunter (player) blinks and one blink to be the dragon.<br/>Triple click a blink to set to treasure hunter, long press to set blink to dragon (hold off until ready to start the game), double press to set back to lair tile.<br/>Arrange all remaining non-player (lair) blinks around the dragon in any configuration desired as long as each blink has one side open for connection.<br/>Alt Setup - If only playing with 6-9 blinks, arrange blinks in a straight line with the dragon at the end.<br/>Long press the designated dragon blink to set role and start the game.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Treasures randomly spawn into the lair playspace for the players to collect.<br/>Treasure hunter (player) blinks have three colored sides - Yellow (Gold), Red (Rubies), and Green (Emeralds).<br/>Players must match the correctly colored side of their blink to a treasure to score points.<br/>Each red (ruby) and green (emerald) collected gains the player 1 point, while each yellow (gold) collected gives the player 5 points.<br/>Yellow (Gold) treasures require the play to mine (be connected to them) for 3 seconds before awarding their points.<br/>Players collect treasure points until their luck runs out (all 3 luck lost).<br/>One luck is lost by incorrectly connecting to a treasure or by being adversely affected by a dragon attack.<br/>The players current luck count is displayed by the three white lights on the treasure hunter blink.<br/>The Dragon has three attacking moves:<br/>A. Fireball - Orange light (Fire) moves quickly throughout the lair. Any player attached to an actively affected tile looses one luck.<br/>B. Poison - Pink light (Poison) moves slowly throughout the lair. Any player attached to an actively affected tile looses one luck.<br/>C. Void - All light is sucked from the Lair, and players must collect tiles based on their memory. The incorrect matching penalty of one health still applies.<br/>Dragon attacks get more frequent as the game progresses eventually resulting in the end of the game.<br/><br/>Win Condition / End Game:<br/><br/>After a player has lost all of their luck, their blink changes over to score mode.<br/>In score mode, lights of different colors flash in quick succession followed by a several second gap.<br/>To determine your score, count the number of Gold flashes in the group and multiply by 100, and then red by 10 and green by 1. The sum of these numbers is your score.<br/>If playing single player, try to set and beat your high score.<br/>If playing competitively with multiple players, the player with the highest score when their luck runs out wins.<br/><br/>",

EL reloj de arena deber&aacute; ocupar tambi&eacute;n el centro de la mesa junto a las tarjetas durante toda la partida.<br/><br/>C&Oacute;MO JUGAR: Comienza el juego el m&aacute;s joven del grupo. Su compa&ntilde;ero de la derecha tomar&aacute; la 1er tarjeta del mazo y le ense&ntilde;ar&aacute; la imagen del acertijo sin mostrarle la respuesta, e inmediatamente dar&aacute; vuelta el reloj. Si el jugador deduce el acertijo (concepto, frase o palabra) antes de que se cumpla el tiempo, se quedar&aacute; con la tarjeta y obtiene 1 punto. Si no responde correctamente, la tarjeta se devuelve al fondo del mazo, sin que se muestre la respuesta. La ronda contin&uacute;a en el sentido de las agujas del reloj de la misma forma con el resto de los jugadores.<br/><br/>TARJETAS &quot;QU&Eacute; VES PARA TODOS&quot; (para todos los jugadores): Qu&eacute; ves incluye un conjunto de tarjetas que est&aacute;n marca-das con EL REY en color rojo. En caso que a un jugador le toque una de ellas, perder&aacute; la oportunidad de descifrar esa tarjeta en esa ronda y deber&aacute; mostrarla al resto de los participantes. Luego de dar vuelta el reloj, el primero en responder correctamente se lleva la tarjeta obteniendo 1 punto. <br/>En cambio, si ninguno de los participantes logra descifrar el acertijo, se lleva la tarjeta el jugador que la extrajo del mazo y suma 1 punto.<br/><br/>&iquest;QUI&Eacute;N ES EL GANADOR? El primer jugador en descifrar 4 acertijos y obtener 4 puntos, es el ganador.<br/><br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME: Be the first player to decipher 4 riddles.<br/><br/>PREPARATION: The deck (all 200 cards) is shuffled and placed in the center of the table with the riddles facing up. The hourglass must also occupy the center of the table, next to the cards, throughout the game.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: The youngest player begins the game. The player to his/her right will take the top card from the deck and show him/her the picture-riddle, without showing him/her the answer, and will immediately turn the hourglass. If the player deciphers the riddle (concept, phrase or word) before the time is up, s/he will keep the card and get 1 point. If he does not answer correctly, the card is returned to the bottom of the deck, without the answer being shown. The round continues clockwise in the same way with the rest of the players.<br/><br/>&quot;WHAT YOU SEE, FOR EVERYONE&quot; CARDS: The game includes a set of cards that are marked with the king in RED. If a player gets one of them, s/he will lose the opportunity to decipher that card in that round and must instead show it to the rest of the players. After turning the hourglass, the first player to answer correctly takes the card, obtaining 1 point. On the other hand, if none of the players manages to decipher the puzzle, the player who extracted the card from the deck takes it and gets 1 point for him/herself.<br/><br/>WHO IS THE WINNER?: The first player to decipher 4 puzzles (get 4 points) is the winner.<br/><br/>-from the game's official rulebook<br/><br/>",

Light color player goes first, alternate turns taking one move with a stack their control (That is, a stack with your color at the top).<br/><br/>Stacks move a straight line the distance exactly its height, dropping bottom disks exactly one by one for each hex. Dropped disks may capture opponent's stacks and/or merge with own stacks. If your mono-color stack of 3- or more height can make capture, you must do so.<br/><br/>And there are important restrictions; if you do not have the highest stack on a straight line, your stacks on the line cannot make any move along the line. And if both of you and your opponent have the highest stacks of same height on a line, your stacks on the line can move and merge but cannot capture.<br/><br/>The object is to make all stacks you control adjacent each other as a group. You can also win by having two bi-color stacks of 6-height.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

So you guys decide to help each other, even though the helper will decide who claims the treasure. You look forward to collecting the highest value treasure.<br/><br/>Treasure hunting begins now! Each player get 5 cards. The active player plays 1 card face-down from their hand and gives it to another player. The chosen player chooses to either &quot;Receive&quot; or &quot;Reject&quot;. The card will be resolved. The next player will become the new active player.<br/><br/>The end of the&nbsp;round is triggered when at least 1 of these conditions occurs:<br/>1. There is only 1 player left (not having a card in hand doesn't matter).<br/>2. Win by the effect of the card.<br/>3. Any player who has a total value of 7 on the cards wins.<br/>4. When everyone has no cards in hand, the players with the highest total value on their cards wins. If there is a tie, all the tied players win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Renault FT, a French light tank, was used by both French and American forces to turn the tide during the final stages of the Great War (World War I). The FT was aptly nicknamed the &quot;Victory Tank&quot; thanks to its essential role during the war effort. The tank was sure to terrify its opponents fighting in the trenches on the Western Front. In Victory Tank, one of these tanks has gone AWOL... Two opposing armies fight on a fog covered battlefield to capture bunkers and retrieve resources while trying to commandeer the tank gone rogue to increase their own military prowess. Which army will be victorious?<br/><br/>In this quick, light, and tactical game, two commanders will try to lead their armies to victory over a couple of rounds divided into two phases. During the &quot;Fog of War&quot; phase the active player will draw two cards to be added to the ever growing battlefield. Each card depicts goals and bonuses to be placed on the battlefield. The active player gets to keep and place one of these cards while offering the other card to its opponent, providing interesting choices and dilemmas to the players during the game.<br/><br/>During the second phase, the &quot;Command&quot; phase, players will take up to five actions each to influence their literal and figurative position in battle. Players will move their soldiers, deploy new units to the battlefield and attack their opponent. Each player has a limited amount of command cards that the player can utilize to boost their actions, fighting power, or defense strength during an attack. And don&rsquo;t forget that somewhere hidden in the mist, a tank has been abandoned. Finding, operating and fighting with this tank on your side may just bring you victory&hellip;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;How the Union was Saved: the American Civil War 1861 - 1865&quot; is a two player strategic wargame depicting the entire American Civil War. One player controls the forces and resources of the North and the other those of the South.<br/><br/>During each Game Turn, which represents three months of actual time, players must consider how best to spend their precious Resource Points (RPs). These are used to build and maintain the chains of depots necessary to keep armies supplied and enable them to move and fight, as well as to construct fortifications. Generally, the RPs reflect the superiority of the Northern economy and resources; but, the actual number available each Turn is subject to a random modifier and cards depicting some of the most significant events of the war. The latter add historical colour and, often, increase the tension by throwing a spanner in the works of the most carefully laid plan. Those who have played the critically acclaimed How the West was Saved will recognize this approach.<br/><br/>How the Union was Saved it is augmented by a new mechanic which emphasizes the &ldquo;fog-of-war&rdquo;. Only army commanders are deployed on the Game Map. The strength of forces under their command (comprising artillery, cavalry, and infantry) is hidden from the opponent until combat occurs and, even then, the total strength of one or both sides may not be revealed. This device puts players in the shoes of army commanders, able to gain an advantage through the clever use of bluff and deception; but, also vulnerable to a stinging reverse if, for example, they mistake a major offensive operation for a feint. It has produced some really exciting games during testing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Return to Europe: Sicily &amp; Italy July&ndash;Nov 1943 is a Strategic level board-wargame of the Allied invasion of Sicily and Southern Italy. The operation was viewed as only a limited offensive to secure the Mediterranean and force Italy out of the war. The Germans also intended only a limited effort to delay the Allies while a strong defense was established at the far North of the peninsula. Both sides scented greater possibilities in the early going and were drawn into what would become a grueling and expensive campaign.<br/><br/>Using a modified version of rules from Desert Fox Deluxe, one player or team of players commands the Allied forces, the other the Axis. In general terms the Allies are trying to knock Italy out of the war and seize the greatest amount of territory as possible, while the Axis seeks to maintain control of Italian territory for the maximum amount of time.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one month with up to six player impulses in each game turn.<br/><br/>There are two scenarios, but only the campaign scenario included in the printed rules. The second scenario is included in the PDF version of the rules located at the Decision Games website in the E-Rules section for Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine. <a target='_blank' href=\"http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/site/e-rules/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/site/e-rules/</a><br/><br/>Originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #341 - Jul-Aug 2023.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 month<br/>Hex: 6.7 miles / 10 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-10 hours<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to provide two 6-sided die for game play.<br/><br/>",

It has elements of the card games War and Old Maid.<br/><br/>In Dragons vs Ogres, players choose to play as either dragons or ogres and each have ten cards. They draw a hand of five cards to begin the game. A deck of forty villagers is placed at the center of the table. Players flip up a villager, one at a time. The fastest player to capture that villager scores one point. However, the card used to capture the villager must meet one of three conditions:<br/><br/>     Exceed the number<br/>     Match the number<br/>     Be the correct corresponding image<br/><br/><br/>Depending on which condition a player uses to capture a villager, they might return the dragon or ogre card used to their hand, discard it and draw a new card, or shuffle their discard pile back into their deck and draw back up to five cards.<br/><br/>There are forty villagers and only twenty combined dragons and ogres. So each card must be used an average of two times in order to capture half the villagers. If one player runs out of cards, the other may keep playing until they are also out of cards. Players must be quick enough to beat their opponent to the villager but clever enough to make matches.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warzone is the first new contract set for A Billion Suns. It allows players to use A Billion Suns to tell brutal stories of military might and system-shaking clashes of far-future weaponry.<br/><br/>A Billion Suns, played with the Core Systems contract set provided in the rulebook, is a game of cleverly and frugally assigning resources, telling stories of industrial espionage and resource capture.<br/><br/>The Warzone contract set changes the feel of A Billion Suns considerably. The Warzone contract set allows players to play an all-out war between their two corporations. The stories these new contracts tell are different, and you&rsquo;ll find a host of new tactical questions to wrestle with.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A 'hybrid board/app' tactical air combat game for two players that runs on a 'simultaneous turn by turn' basis over a board of hexagons. (Print n' Play)<br/><br/>This unique system allows you to apprehend the flow of an air engagement (dogfight) in a dynamic and realistic way. Hands on throttle-and-stick, you manoeuver to get into your opponent's six, or to get out of the pursuit! It's a duel of minds in which the most experienced pilot will certainly win.<br/><br/>A bomber is not able to turn its nose as fast as a fighter and the latter does not have the same turn rate at different airspeeds. In this game, each aircraft has a specific flight model (energy management chart) which you can study to integrate its strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the resolution of offensive actions takes into account the actual position/attitude of the planes and evasive manoeuvres to determine success.<br/><br/>The app contains the game manual, the scenarios, a link to the pdf document to print and shape and the user interface to easily select and present your choices.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents 8 seconds of flight time, which allows complex manoeuvres such as Immelmann, Split S, High yo-yo or Barrel rolls to be performed in sequence.<br/><br/>The game features 20 skirmish scenarios (involving up to 8 airplanes) that include air-to-air and/or air-to-ground objectives, 5 aircraft types (fighter, interceptor, ground attack, bomber, transport) and 11 weapon/action types (cannon, missiles, bombs, countermeasures,...). Each scenario offers a number of points to be won by each team, the one that has won the most points wins the battle.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea in the northwest, the Ionian Sea in the southwest, the Aegean Sea in the south, the Turkish Straits in the east, and the Black Sea in the northeast. The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined. The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala, 2,925 metres (9,596 ft), in the Rila mountain range, Bulgaria.<br/><br/>This expansion takes place in this beautiful area. It is designed for 3-4 players. The expansion uses the same rules as the original game, with the following exception: the 'Production' action is replaced with the 'Roma' action.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Emissary, you are a young noble sent by your father to gather support from eight neighboring kingdoms. In each kingdom, you engage in a series of debates with their ruler. Using the right amount of force and deference, you must win exactly a certain number of debates per kingdom. Succeed and you may call upon the ruler for future support; fail even once and lose the game.<br/><br/>The Emissary is a solo trick-taking game playable with a deck of regular playing cards, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series. The game begins by arranging the deck's eight kings and queens in a row. The player then &quot;visits&quot; each card, in whatever order they choose, drawing a new hand of eight cards from the remainder of deck at each stop. They then draw cards one at a time from the deck, forming the basis of tricks, which the player answers from their own hand. The catch is that whatever place the king or queen being &quot;visited&quot; by the player is (e.g., 1st place through 8th place), that's how many tricks must be won by the player -- no more, and no less. With only a limited capacity to bend the rules through special abilities, the game becomes an exercise in careful hand manipulation and excruciating trade-offs.<br/><br/>The game is inspired by the decktet game Gongor Whist, which itself was patterned from the standard-deck card game Oneonta Whist. This game also holds the core for the free print-and-play game For Northwood!, which swept top prizes in the 2021 BGG 54-card contest. Familiarity with trick-taking games will make understanding the following rules a breeze. Of course, prior knowledge isn't strictly necessary.<br/><br/>",

These battles were carefully chosen by designer Amabel Holland with an eye toward only keeping those that would propel the game's central themes forward. Some otherwise compelling, engaging, and interesting battles didn't make that list, either because they made the same &quot;point&quot; as a battle that did make the cut, or they introduced a level of complexity that detracted from the narrative.<br/><br/>You probably see where we're going with this! II Grass II Crown is an expansion that provides eight new scenarios: Beneventum, Metaurus, Ilipa, Great Plains, Cynoscephalae, Magnesia, Zela, and the Cilician Gates. These are aimed at experienced players who don't mind tackling a few extra special rules. Also included is a new countersheet with additional units.

As you are the only witness of the robbery, Zumm the policeman asks you to identify the thief among all the suspects.<br/><br/>Diez Ladrones (&quot;Ten Thieves&quot;)is an educative speed game based on the number partners that add up to 10 (9+1, 8+2, etc).<br/><br/>One clue card with tons of suspects (numbers) will be shown in the middle of the table, the first player to put his hand on the correct guilty number will win the card. <br/>There are three possible options:<br/><br/>     If there is an odd amount of numbers you have to make pairs between number partners. The number left alone without his pair is the guilty number. For example, in the card there are: 3,6,7,8,4. Number 8 is the guilty one.  <br/>     If there is an odd amount of numbers and also Zuum (policeman) on it, you don't have to put your hand on the number left alone because Zuum has already caught him. You have to put your hand on his pair, the missing number. For example:3,6,7,8,4 and Zuum. Number 2 is the guilty one. <br/>     If there is an even amount of numbers, all of them have their pairs, you have to put the hand on Zuum's card. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>BGC M&aacute;laga 2023 - Best Spanish Educational Game (Finalist)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pharmacology is a dice-driven strategy game featuring dice drafting, worker allocation, engine building, and strategic chaining of actions.<br/><br/>Pharmacology is for two to five players (plus a solo mode), playing in about 15-20 minutes per player. Lead a pharmaceutical company to victory by developing the most lucrative drug treatments and vaccines. You&rsquo;ll need to send your medical workforce to outbreak locations to secure samples, research drugs, and develop vaccines to fight the world&rsquo;s diseases.<br/><br/>Each turn is a puzzle to solve. How do you maximize your workforce and resources with the dice available to you in the dice pool? Deftly manipulating your drafted dice can create exciting action chains that make for huge turns!<br/><br/>Drafted dice can be used to power locations to generate temporary workers, medical supplies, resources, and money, which can then be used to power other locations to research drugs and vaccines so you can treat diseases to earn points. Outreach Programs provide abilities that can further increase your engine&rsquo;s potential output.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     Unique dice drafting, dice allocation, and action chaining mechanics.<br/>     Simple to learn, but complex puzzles result in feelings of accomplishment every turn.<br/>     Interesting interactions provide layers of depth.<br/>     Build up to amazing turns with action chains.<br/>     Solo Automa provides a challenging competitor that gives the feel of a multiplayer experience. The Automa can defeat you!<br/><br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Pharmacology uses a unique dice drafting mechanic. Everyone drafts from a common pool of Action Dice, which represent your Workforce. On your turn, you will draft dice from the Action Dice Pool equal to your Workforce level, then take your Actions. If there aren&rsquo;t enough dice in the pool you&rsquo;ll re-roll all the dice used by other players and then select the rest of your dice.<br/><br/>Using the drafted dice, you will work to collect Samples, use and upgrade various Locations, hire Medical Technicians, Doctors, and Scientists, develop Drugs and Vaccines, gain benefits through Outreach Programs, and Treat Diseases. You can also increase the size of your Workforce, boost your score by specializing in certain Disease Classifications, Quarantine diseases for easier research, and use profits to buy Medical Supplies, re-rolls, additional resources, and more. In an advanced game, you&rsquo;ll also have opportunities to commit acts of Industrial Espionage and file Lawsuits to hinder your opponents.<br/><br/>Any dice remaining in the Action Dice Pool at the end of your turn are passed to the next player to begin drafting their Workforce. Throughout the game, your Workforce will increase and actions may allow you to draft additional dice. In this way the number of dice passed from player to player changes, resulting in a new puzzle to solve on each turn!<br/><br/>Pharmacology won the 2017 Manhattan Project Dice Game design contest presented by Minion Games. The late James Mathe loved the game, but it was bigger than what he was looking at publishing at the time. He suggested retheming the game (thanks to Troy Pichelman for the new theme idea) and continuing to work on getting it produced.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Around five thousand years ago, a resilient group of farmers and hunters built a thriving community on the Orkney Islands of Northern Scotland. Rather than discarding their empty shells, broken tools, bones, and other waste, they used them to form large mounds of earth over hundreds of years. Later generations dug into these midden piles to create a series of rooms and tunnels to shelter from the harsh winds and cold winter months.<br/><br/>The aim of Skara Brae is to gather various resources in order to feed, clothe, and shelter the growing number of settlers. Players take turns drafting cards and using their workers to furnish, cook, craft, clean, and trade. At the end of each round, players need to provide for their settlers and will likely create more midden that needs to be cleaned up. After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns placing cubes that represent leaves and branches. Unshaded leaves &mdash; that is, leaves that are visible when the board is viewed from above &mdash; count as active and supply their tree with energy to grow further. Your goal is to shade your opponent's leaves while keeping your own leaves open to the sun.<br/><br/>Each player starts with one leaf in a space on the 4x4 game board. On a turn, if you have 1-2 unshaded leaves, you place one piece on the board, whether a branch or a leaf; if you have three or more unshaded leaves, then you place up to two pieces. You can place nothing in a leaf, so a leaf serves as an endpoint for growth. If you place a branch, however, then you can add a branch or a leaf to any available side of that branch. You can have multiple branches growing on the game board, and the branches and leaves can extend outside of the 4x4 game board. If you build high enough, you can shade an opponent's leaves.<br/><br/>When a player has placed their final piece, whether because they've placed everything or they have no legal placements available, the other player goes through a &quot;final growth&quot; phase in which they place everything they can. At that point, whoever has the most unshaded leaves wins. If you ever have zero unshaded leaves during play, you lose immediately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the criminal underworld of villainous vegetables, 10 gangs are vying for supremacy, and ultimately trying to topple the ruthless Cartel that runs the whole racket. The aim of the game is to assemble gangs, destroy your rivals and overthrow the Cartel to win. You do this by collecting sets, stealing from your opponents and matching the Cartel cards. As you play, you&rsquo;ll learn what gangs you gotta collect to topple the Cartel. And then you&rsquo;ll need to bluff, steal and screw people over to get the gangs you need. There can be only one winner; everyone else will sleep with the dishes.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you&rsquo;ll draw gang and action cards from the draw deck, and then take up to three moves. You can lay gang cards in your Turf - that&rsquo;s where your gangs are assembled; you can protect your gang cards with security cards; you can use an action card to steal from an opponent; and you can start a Turf War with the Cartel. But be warned, the more you steal from your rivals, the more likely they&rsquo;ll be to take revenge. And if you don&rsquo;t match at least two full gangs with the Cartel during a Turf War, you&rsquo;ll lose those gangs to the discard pile.<br/><br/>Plant Based Riot is a light strategy, set collecting, card matching tabletop card game for 2-5 players. There&rsquo;s gangs of terrible edibles, there&rsquo;s thieving fruit, and there&rsquo;s tons of card-based carnage. It&rsquo;s got all the brutality of an actual food fight, only with way less clearing up afterwards. It&rsquo;s designed with fluidity and fun in mind. It&rsquo;s adaptable to all experience levels - from beginners to veterans - and age groups from 8 to 88. It&rsquo;s also scalable, so the experience is just as riotous whether you&rsquo;re playing one-on-one or a 5-way battle royale.<br/><br/>A typical game takes between 15 and 30 minutes, depending on the number of players. And, like organic mushrooms, no two games of Plant Based Riot are the same, thanks to its unique mechanic. You won&rsquo;t need any dice or additional pieces to play. Just a dastardly desire to collect and conquer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Both players will fight for control of important locations using specially made dice that represent British and American regulars, Native American allies, militia units, and (for the Americans) French and Spanish forces. Each player also has their own deck of Event Cards that will allow special events and actions to occur, ensuring that no two games will play the same.<br/><br/>Will the Americans prevail and win their independence from the British Empire? Or will His Majesty&rsquo;s forces bring the wayward colonies back under the Crown&rsquo;s control? Find out in Road to Independence!<br/><br/>",

The Greek Army had been unstoppable up to now and the Turks were reeling back to the last stand defenses in the hills just across the Sakarya River. Their morale had taken a serious blow, so serious, that orders were to shoot any Turk soldier caught fleeing during the battle. The Greeks paused for two weeks before advancing across the river, giving the Turks time to build a two lines of defenses. Greek divisions averaged 10,000 men, while Turk divisions averaged 5000. Both sides were feeling the pinch of supply issues, both quite determined to crush the other. If the Greeks won, Ankara, Turkey's new capitol, would fall and perhaps part of Turkey would become part of Greece. The battle and war all reached this pivotal situation, critical to both sides. It would be bloody--over 18,000 died on the hills from August 23 to 30.<br/><br/>Game scale: 12 hr. turns, battalions. Each hex is around 400 yds. Owners of The Great Attack 1922 will easily assimilate the rules, although there are some new ones to learn.<br/><br/>The game comes with one 11x17 inch map, 280 counters and rulebook.<br/><br/>Related game:<br/>Bir Buyuk Turk Saldiri<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>It's a troubled time in the town of Ravenport. A band of monsters has pressed past the guards at Bronze Valley South and made a new home in the once peaceful seaside town. Most of the villagers run in fear of the monsters and their powerful overlord, but not all are so timid. Small forces are resisting the rule of the intruders, taking down the monsters one by one. As they fight, they gain reputation throughout the town and attract new fighters to join their cause. These are the Rebels of Ravenport.<br/><br/>Players take the role of guild leaders who must defeat the monsters and expand their guild. Each player starts off with a small guild of 3 rebels, and can attack one monster each turn. They roll the 3 dice to determine how much damage they deal against the monster. Each rebel deals 1 to 3 damage when a specific number (1 through 6) is rolled. To defeat the monster, they must deal damage greater than or equal to the monster's health. If successful, the guild gains reputation and victory points.<br/><br/>The game board displays the monsters and contains 5 face up cards that the players may acquire. Cards come in two categories - rebels and artifacts. Each turn the players can use their reputation to buy one of these cards, and then replace the empty card slot with the top card of the deck.<br/><br/>Their are two ways for the game to end, so players must strategize toward one (or both) of the goals. First, a guild can select to attack the mighty overlord (who has 12 health) on their turn. If they defeat him, they win the game. Alternatively if the victory point pool is depleted before the overlord is defeated, the player with the most points is the winner. The game is setup with an amount of victory points equal to 10x the amount of players in the game. Points are obtained by defeating monsters, by acquiring cards, and through various card abilities. This two-goal setup creates tension between the players, with some building heavy damage in an attempt to take down The Overlord before the others take the final victory point.<br/><br/>",

Colours don&rsquo;t need to match.<br/><br/>If your placement creates a single-hex hole, you must fill that hole with a cone of either color from the supply, even if it helps your opponent more than you.

        "description": "Winter 830: Disaster looms. The vast realm of Charlemagne threatens to fall apart under his son and successor Louis the Pious. Charlemagne's grandchildren are already competing for the throne, pushing their father aside. Strife and rebellion abound&mdash;the once stable kingdom is on the verge of war. Is there still hope for peace?<br/><br/>In Carolingi, the players assume the roles of the grandchildren of Charlemagne; they are the &quot;Carolingi&quot;, who must live through the difficulties and central aspects of early medieval rule. The &quot;Carolingi&quot; have to wield their power by fealty of the nobility. The nobility, in turn, expect to be rewarded with vast estates, so the Carolingi have to seek more and more land and resources, but as the power base of one Carolingian gets stronger, so does the envy and greed of his royal siblings. There's need for action for the Carolingi, but not everything can be done at a time. Only prudent action will bring peace and stability to the realm.<br/><br/>The board shows the countries and regions of Carolingian times, and the game features an innovative system of action that guarantees an exciting, effortless gaming experience. Each game year consists of four quarters; in each quarter the players add two of their (wooden) action tiles to a bag, from which they are later drawn one at a time. This results in unpredictability (true to its time).<br/><br/>The game includes a competitive version and a semi-cooperative version.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player manages to declare peace successfully. The semi-coop version can alternately end in chaos.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The series is designed to be accessible and fast-playing, suitable for gamers of any experience level. It is based firmly within the core design philosophy of the Blind Swords and Black Swan systems, but will focus on more obscure or over-looked battles and campaigns, including some fictional &quot;what if&quot; battles that could have occurred during the war. The entire series is governed by one relatively simple set of standard Series Rules, which are altered in each game by a few Game Module specific rules.<br/><br/>The Hill of Death is the first Game Module in the Shattered Union series and covers the entire Battle of Champion Hill. This critical engagement was fought just outside of Vicksburg, Mississippi on May 16th ,1863, between the Union Army of the Tennessee (under Major General Ulysses S. Grant) and the Confederate Army of Vicksburg (under Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton). Grant successfully landed his Union army on the shores of the Mississippi River and quickly advanced inland towards the Mississippi state capital of Jackson. General Joseph E. Johnston&rsquo;s Confederate force made only a token effort at defending the city and then Johnston instructed Pemberton to sally forth from the Vicksburg fortress and attack Grant&rsquo;s line of supply. On the morning of May 16th, Pemberton&rsquo;s Army of Vicksburg was in route to fulfilling that mission when it received new orders from Johnston to turn around and join him near the town of Clinton. Pemberton hesitated and as he contemplated his next move, Grant about-faced the Union army. Leaving most of Sherman&rsquo;s Corps to hold Jackson, he began a determined advance against Vicksburg and Pemberton&rsquo;s strung out and confused Rebel army. The Battle of Champion Hill was underway, and the fate of Vicksburg hung in the balance. <br/>   <br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>1 &ndash; 17&quot; x 22&quot; Map <br/>189 &ndash; Counters <br/>45 &ndash; Cards<br/>1 &ndash; Player Aid<br/>1 &ndash; Series Rulebook<br/>1 &ndash; Game Module Rulebook<br/>5 &ndash; Six-Sided Dice (Red, White, Black, Blue and Gray)<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to be the first to place all of your hotels so that their views are captivating.  Players take turns placing interlocking hexagonal tiles on the inclined board, stacking upwards from the shoreline at the bottom. Each tile shows an isometric view of a portion of the village.<br/><br/>A hotel's view is defined as the collection of tiles below it. Each hotel caps a triangular shaped view. Blue domes, a signature architectural feature of the Santorini region, enhance the view (+1). Your opponent's hotels detract from the view (-1). You don't want your guests looking out at your competition, right?<br/><br/>Players start with 6 hotels. Each hotel has a number of windows.<br/>One 1-window<br/>Two 2-window<br/>Two 3-window<br/>One 4-window<br/><br/>In order to place a hotel, its view must contain at least as many blue dome tiles as the hotel has windows. Your opponent's hotels subtract from this number.<br/><br/>The first player to place all 6 of her hotels is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "High in the mountains, the realm of Inkalam is known for its fertile cornfields, herds of vigorous llamas, and the beauty of the lacustrine cities. But it&rsquo;s especially his messengers&rsquo; guild, the Chascis, which makes it so famous.<br/>Inkalam's prosperity depends on the quality of the messages transmitted by the Chascis. You will have to ensure the messages get delivered during a long day, from dawn to sunset.<br/><br/>The first player rolls the 3 dice, chooses one and puts it aside. Then all other players can choose one of the values presented by the 2-remaining dice.<br/><br/>Each player writes the chosen value on one of the Messages located on a Road starting from an already circled Messenger. Then they have to circle the Messenger at the other end of the Road.<br/><br/>If all the Messages located on the Roads surrounding a Region contain consecutive numbers (not necessarily in order), the player cross off a box of the Resource of this Region on their Scoreboard, starting with the lowest value. The next time for this Resource, the player will cross off the next higher value. At the end of the game, for each Resources (Lacustrine City, Corn Fields, and Lamas Herd), each player adds the value of the last box crossed off and the Speed Bonus if checked. Then player add the other bonus/malus of the game.<br/><br/>When you write on a Solar Message, check the Clock which tracks the game length. Once a player has checked the 8th sun on their clock, the game ends !<br/><br/>Add values for surrounded regions and any applicable speed bonuses and compare your scores.<br/><br/>Inkalam comes with two solo variants.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Subtitled 'A Guide to the War of 1812' this booklet covers the 3 year war between Britain and the infant United States.<br/><br/>The booklet contains historical background, tactics, uniforms, flags, and three sets of miniatures rules. In addition it has 10 land scenarios and 12 naval ones.<br/><br/>One set of miniatures rules is called Battle Scale (1 figure = 50 men), and the other Small Unit Scale (1 figure = 15 men). The third set of rules covers naval actions.<br/><br/>Leaders are handled extremely well in this game. Each leader is rated as one of Brilliant, Efficient, Plodding or Buffoon(!). Ordinary playing cards are used to determine a number of actions each leader may initiate. Cards used include Aces (one action), 2s and 3s (2 and 3 actions, of course) and Jokers (2 actions and reshuffle). A Buffoon's deck has only one &quot;3&quot; card in it, but four aces, while a Brilliant Leader's is the opposite. Thus a small, well-led force can run rings around a much larger, poorly-led one. In the land battles actions affect firing, movement and formation changes; in the naval game they affect firing only.<br/><br/>Quick and fun, as well as being adaptable to other, similar periods.<br/><br/>",

Actions are taken by initiative and Combat is run by an extra combat sequence.<br/><br/>The material:<br/><br/>THE HUNT comes as a simple booklet with the rules and counters to be copied and cut out.

Quickly show the next picture/letter combo, and continue in this way until time is up or all five of your words have been guessed.<br/><br/>Play continues this way around the table, and once everyone has had a turn the round ends.  Count up the number of cards in your score pile and record it on your score sheet.  The game lasts a total of three rounds.  In the second and third rounds, each card is worth more points.

        "description": "This matching-sets-for-points game has been played by Nadine Chestnut&rsquo;s family for over 100 years.  It is a tale of two queens, and the historical fate of Scotland&rsquo;s Queen Mary.  Character Artwork has been meticulously painted to capture the likeness of each historical figure from one of the bloodiest stories in the history of Scotland and England, which ultimately shaped the world we see today.<br/><br/>Instructions:<br/><br/>Choose a player to shuffle and deal the cards. Start by dealing 11 cards to each player and finishing with one card turned up beside the deck. The person immediately to their left goes first and will be the scorekeeper. Each player takes turns dealing, in clockwise order. The first player to reach a cumulative score of 1000 wins. If 2 players cross 1000 on the same turn, the person with the highest score wins. Keep track of scores on a piece of paper.<br/><br/>On each player&rsquo;s turn; you start your turn by picking up a card and you end your turn by discarding a card face-up on the face-up pile.<br/><br/>When you pick up a card, you can pick up a card from the face-down pile or pick up the entire face-up pile, based on the most recent discarded card. To do this, you must have at least 2 cards (in your hand) that match the face-up card and place them down in front of you with this top facing card. The remainder of the cards from the face-up pile go into your hand unless you can place any of them down, either by making a new set or adding to an existing set with matching cards. You can only pick up the pile by matching to cards in your hand, not that which is already on the table. During your turn, you can choose whether to place down sets of cards, add cards to current sets, or hang on to cards. Your strategy will drive your decisions. When placing a set down, it goes on your side of the table only. At the end of a round, any cards on your side of the table count toward your score. Any cards in your hand are deducted from your score. You can only place cards down onto your own sets.<br/><br/>Card values are indicated on the bottom right of each card.<br/><br/>You can make a set of matching cards in front of you if you have 3 or more of the same card. You cannot mix and match cards unless they are part of the royal family (see below). You can place as many wild cards that you wish with a set, but the initial set MUST CONTAIN at least two matching cards or 2 cards from the royal family. You can add matching cards or wild cards to any set on the table in front of you during your turn.<br/><br/>A round ends when a player can completely empty their hand by placing their last card with a set on the table or the discard pile.<br/><br/>Scores are counted at the end of each round. It is possible to go into the negative and scores should be tracked accordingly. <br/> The royal family cards are indicated by a crown over the coin in the bottom right hand corner.<br/><br/>Any member of the royal family can be paired with each other (including duplicates of King James). If placed down as an initial set, they can be matched with a wild card as long as at least 2 members of the royal family are placed down with the wild card. Royal family member cards are indicated by a crown over the coin in the bottom right-hand corner.<br/><br/>The crown jewels are wild. This card can be placed with any two matching cards to form a set. It can also be added to any set that is already on the table. If this card is face-up on the discard pile, it may be picked up if you have two crown jewels in your hand. You must show the other players that you have two in your hand to qualify but are only required to immediately play the wild card that was picked up. You cannot pick it up if you cannot immediately play it.<br/><br/>Contents: <br/>108 card deck &bull; Pen &bull; Pad of paper for keeping score <br/>&bull; Game Instructions and more about the key historical characters of this tragic story.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a children's dexterity game where players have a real-time shootout. The board is a long plastic tray flanked with colorful western town inserts. At each end of the tray is a plastic six-shooter (one for each player) that are attached so that they can move freely across the width of the board. The guns are loaded with ball bearings on the top. A slide comes out the bottom and ends flush with the playing surface where a plastic cowboy is attached. When you pull the trigger, a ball rolls down the slide, goes through the legs of the cowboy and shoots across the tray toward your opponent's side. Each plastic cowboy has a tab by its feet that acts as a target. Hit it with a &quot;bullet&quot; and the cowboy gets knock down &quot;dead&quot;. The fist player to shoot the other player's cowboy wins. Each player has a rock and a cactus to use as cover. The trick is that you have to be out in the open (and taking careful aim) to shoot, but also dodging left and right to avoid your opponent's fire.<br/><br/>This game is similar to Crossfire.<br/><br/>",

The Wardancer is the same miniature used in Warhammer Quest: Wardancer and the other miniatures were taken from Mordheim: City of the Damned.<br/><br/>Of note is the fact that the PDF download did not actually have the correct fonts embedded in it, so users had to remake the cards before use.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary: <br/>かいちん (Kaichin) is the name of Japanese sweet made by Ishikawaya-Honpo. This is a noted confectioner in the Ishikawa prefecture in Japan, and the shapes and designs of their sweets are special. The game designer was given permission to use the Kaichin name (it means marble chip) and designs in this game. The game comes with Japanese and English rules.<br/><br/>The game itself is a simple abstract game. Players are secretly dealt cards corresponding to two of the 12 sweets in the game, and another card for one of the 6 colours. You win by moving a specific Kaichin chip that you have the card for across the board to its destination.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the game ends when there are no more available spaces on the board (some empty spaces might be blocked). In that case, the player holding the colour card with the most colour chips on the board wins. The tie breaker is the player furthest clockwise from the start player.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may either move any Kaichin chip, or make an attack. Kaichin chips can move one space (not occupied by another Kaichin chip) and then you place a matching colour chip under it. A Kaichin chip can leapfrog a single adjacent Kaichin chip, but cannot move onto or over any Damage chips. A Kaichin chip can move two spaces, if the first space has a colour chip of its colour. If a Kaichin chip ends on a colour chip of the wrong colour, that gets swapped out.<br/><br/>Damage chips are placed when an Attack occurs. If they hold the matching Kaichin card, a player simply declares a Kaichin chip is the attacker, and damage is assessed in 1 of the 6 directions around the attacker. Only the first Kaichin chip on a line that is vulnerable suffers damage. A Kaichin chip under attack is flipped to show a black border and a black damage chip is swapped under it. If a Kaichin chip suffers two damages in the game, it is eliminated. Kaichin chips not in play yet are immune but cannot attack. Damage chips are never removed.<br/><br/>During the game, nobody declares ownership of any Kaichin chip. During an attack, the player making the attack simply damages the target Kaichin. Only when the game ends can you discover who owned which Kaichin.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>「かいちん」とは、金沢の昔の方言で「おはじき」という意味だそうです。<br/>ゲームタイトルは、金沢「石川屋本舗」様のお菓子の名前です。<br/>「石川屋本舗」様に許可を頂き、タイトル・チップデザインに砂糖菓子「かいちん」のデザインを取り入れたゲームを作りました。<br/>ゲームは「陣取り＋旗取り＋正体隠匿」のハードな造りですが、きらびやかにお菓子を並べて、その美しさもお楽しみ下さい。<br/><br/>プレイヤーはあらかじめ「かいちん」カード（2枚）と、「色」カード（1枚）を配られます。<br/>このカードの内容はゲーム終了まで他プレイヤーに公開しません。<br/><br/>プレイヤーは以下のいずれかで勝利を狙います。<br/>・自分のカードの「かいちん」チップをゴール（スタート地点の対面）まで移動する<br/>・全てのマスが埋まった際に、自分の「色」チップが最大面積となる<br/><br/>プレイヤーは「かいちん」を「移動」あるいは「攻撃」できます。<br/>「かいちん」は移動するごとに、足跡のように「色」チップを置いていくので、これで盤を埋めていきます。<br/>他プレイヤーに気付かれずに「かいちん」を移動するか、盤を埋め尽くすか。<br/>シンプルながら駆け引きの悩ましいゲームです。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Mars La Tour&quot; is an introductory-level wargame with plenty of meat on the bone for the seasoned grognard, inspired by Mark Herman&rsquo;s recent Gettysburg. With a 17x11 large-hex map, fewer than 32 large counters and a pair of 10-sided dice, players can experience the furious battle of Mars la Tour in less than a half-hour, easily played several times in one sitting. The OOB and order of appearances are tweaked for historical effect, representing the French at the corps level with some of their less aware forces starting off-map, while Prussians are represented at the divisional level with their normal historical appearance.<br/><br/>To explain some of the changes from Mark&rsquo;s original;  a d10 is used for more granularity in combat results (for those times when the modifiers reach +4 to +6); the Prussians win on all ties; French Chassepot fire allows Prussian units to move only once after switching to Battle Formation; Prussians receive an Artillery Bombardment marker to reflect their improved artillery; death-charge rules for cavalry; and, finally, the French receive a Mitrailleuse fire marker which functions like the Sharpshooter marker from Gettysburg.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space Plague is a modern strategy game of planetary conquest for 1-4 players.  The four major galactic powers -The Slimes, The Reptilians, The Rams, and The Flat-Earthers - all want one thing, galactic dominance.  Their commanders ready themselves, the armies follow orders, and everything that can shake, shakes.  The race to conquer new planets is the most important game in the galaxy and those that win it will gain for themselves and their species a brand new spherical land mass to rule and to populate.<br/><br/>In Space Plague, players will employ hand management and hand building strategies to efficiently guide their plague soldiers through various ecological environments while collecting energy (the game&rsquo;s currency), adapting to planetary events, and overcoming the opponents&rsquo; obstacles that await them on their unwavering march toward the planet&rsquo;s core.  Survival of the fittest is the name of the game as the faction with the greatest number of soldiers to reach the core will be crowned the victor and given the deed to the planet.<br/><br/>The keys to victory are careful planning and adaptability. Everyone will begin the game with the same starting hand of action cards.  These will be used each round to spawn, move, shield, or evolve your aliens. Additionally, certain factors will give variability to each game.   Each planet you conquer has its own defense mechanisms which will force you to employ unique strategies and play styles.  Planetary events are randomized and could spell riches or doom for your advancing soldiers.  Additionally, the in-game marketplace offers dozens of evolutions that will improve the capabilities of your hand or grant you unique ongoing or temporary powers ensuring a different game every time.  These elements not only force interesting decisions but also give the game extensive replayability.<br/><br/>Fellow commander, are you ready to join the plague?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Space Plague es un moderno juego de estrategia de conquista planetaria de 1-4 jugadores.

Among the many changes are: a newly researched order of battle, with revised counter values and reinforcement schedule; cleaned-up rules including a solitaire play system; and a drastically revised map with a different ground scale and treatment of terrain. Nicely die-cut, two-sided counters and a 17 x 22&Prime; map with nice art by John Cooper!<br/><br/>The system has two main &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; to it: an interactive Operations Phase where formation HQs are randomly activated one by one by chit pulls, and take nearby combat units under command to move and fight; and a near-diceless combat resolution system (a d10 is used to check if a particular unit takes casualties, but whether a check is required arises only after comparing attack and defense missions chosen by the players). Brief rules for solitaire play are included.<br/><br/>Released in folio format by Tiny Battles Publishing.<br/><br/>",

Then we now have the solution for you: Doppelkopf 2.0 - the classic game rethought.<br/><br/>Doppelkopf 2.0 - the classic game rethought are innovative Doppelkopf playing cards that enable beginners and infrequent players to grasp the logic and mechanics of the game more easily. The playing cards contain supplementary auxiliary information: the trump strengths and order, color coding and order of the missing cards, the value of the cards when counting them, and hints about the possibility of winning special victory points. And the nice thing: You can still play Doppelkopf according to the normal Doppelkopf rules. Our game is tested by the German Doppelkopf Association e.V. (DDV). You can add additional rules to the game, such as the &quot;pig&quot;, by using the included additional cards.<br/><br/>For the pictures of the playing cards we have come up with something very special: As a graphical basis for the playing cards, we were able to get reproduction prints of two card decks from the 1930s from the German Playing Card Museum in Leinfelden: German Doppelkopf Card Game VASS Altenburg 1931 and a matching Dondorf's standard ladies' deck from the 1930s. We have taken the pictures from the historical playing cards, graphically enhanced them and put them together to a new beautiful set of playing cards.<br/><br/>",

This king found the man who could support him against this formidable adversary; a man with an illustrious name, at the head of a powerful nation with a legendary army.<br/>Everything plays out in Po Valley, from Turin to Verona by way of Milan, with no less than an imperial invasion to push back.

The planet is exploited and the world economy is about to collapse. Desperately Spaceships be sent out to explore the neighboring planets. A crystalline substance, shining like gold, with incredible energy content is discovered on Mars. It gets named Rich Yield Crystal Energy, or in short: RYCE.<br/><br/>RYCE could satisfy the insatiable hunger for energy of Earth if&hellip; yes if it is possible to collect the material on Mars, and bring it back to Earth. Every space traveling nation is called to participate and thus to secure a part of the energy source. But the difficulties are considerable. The extraction system must be developed and transported to Mars.<br/><br/>Hostile life conditions and water scarcity in this EMPIRE OF SAND do one last thing, but the challenge is accepted.<br/><br/>But then the shock: Mars is inhabited. The Martians live in underground cities and were not detected by the sensors.The Martians turn out to be cooperative and strongly point to the dangers of the planet. The mighty CRAWLERS, which move through the sandy deserts of the planet and cause dangerous sandstorms. And a mysterious faction, that calls itself THE BROTHERHOOD and that has no sense of humor when competing with their resources.<br/><br/>A difficult task, which can only be overcome with the support of all factions...if it were not for the rivalry among the nations!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDescriptionRyce: Empire of Sand is a area control and resource-management strategy game with a thematic background on a variable game board with interactive mechanisms, low downtime, low luck elements and a variable and calculable game-time. Conflicts in the game are solved by majorities instead of fights and war.<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of one of six space traveling nations of Earth (USA, Europe, Russia, China, Japan, India). The Players land on Mars with their bases, recruit astronauts, and send astronauts out to collect resources, install mines, build tunnels, and taking over control of mines from other players. Collected resources are spent in more astronauts, new mines, new technologies (to upgrade the collection of resources, the amount of astronauts, the movement-range etc.),or in influence to the three mighty factions on Mars (The EARTH, The MARTIANS, and the BROTHERHOOD). From the factions the players get control of special units and also get influence cards, that they can play in their turn to get different benefits.

Players travel to creepy locations and hunt for creatures of the night to assist them in defeating their opponents.

At locations, monsters hide within Hunt Decks that also hold a variety of action cards that keep the game moving.  Players secretly make decisions about what they find while exploring, using the knowledge they've gained to track their monsters and prevent opponents from locating their monsters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player opens a 20-card booster pack, selects two cards from it, and then passes the pack to the player sitting next to them. They then pick two more cards from the pack they've been handed, and so on, going around the table until all cards are picked. This is repeated with a second booster pack, and again with a third, until everyone has picked a total of 60 cards. Players then choose a commander (or a commander/background pair, if the commander has the Choose a Background ability) from among the cards they drafted, add any number of basic lands, and build a 60-card deck matching the color identity of their commander(s). Then everyone shuffles up their decks and battles in a free-for-all! (A larger pod of drafters splits into two groups first.)<br/><br/>The set is sold in draft boosters (individually or in displays of 24), set boosters (individually or in displays of 18), collector boosters (individually or in displays of 12), and bundles, as well as three-pack prerelease kits, which were made available a week in advance of the set's full release. In addition, four 100-card tie-in Commander decks were released alongside the main set.<br/><br/>",

This game features two historic scenarios as the introduction to the wider system: Firefight at the Rice Paddy Angle (Vietnam, Mekong region 1967), and Firefight at Combat Outpost Keating (Afghanistan in the Nuristan Province, 2009). Both firefights involved about a platoon of US infantry against an entrenched or numerically superior enemy force. The US and Viet Cong game pieces represent specific, individual (and historic) men of their respective units, whereas Taliban game pieces usually represent several men each. Though the game is meant for two players (one US and one enemy) per scenario, the system allows for multiple players to participate in the same game, allowing each player to control some specific game pieces while another player controls the other pieces on the same side.<br/><br/>Components: Two 22&quot; x 17&quot; maps on one sheet &amp; 280 counters<br/><br/>Modern War #31 Sep-Oct. 2017<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Better Me is a new approach to relationships and personal development. It challenges people to take action to improve themselves and their life, and strengthens relationships by helping people understand each other in a deeper and more meaningful way.<br/><br/>The game brings up interesting topics that don't normally come up in daily conversation, allowing players to quickly learn about themselves and their fellow players. And all in an encouraging and fun atmosphere, with no pressure or judgment permitted. When was the last time you told a group of people about a past accomplishment that you're proud of, or had a game challenge you to write a thank you letter to a loved one?<br/><br/>Better Me also harnesses the power of accountability. Any player committing to an action must find an accountability partner to help make sure they follow they follow through on their commitment. Both players write down the action to be taken, and the target completion date on their game sheet. This accountability strategy is key to insuring that players take action and grow.<br/><br/>Players move around the game board and draw cards which prompt all sorts of positive action and discussion. Players race to fulfill each of their five life areas, heart, mind, body, people and tangibles.  The game is won by the first player to &quot;fulfill&quot; (3 points) each of the five categories; heart, mind, body, people, and tangibles.  Alternatively, the game may be played to a time limit, and if no player has fulfilled all categories by the end of the time limit, the player with the most total points is the winner.<br/><br/>In addition to being played by groups of friends and family, Better Me is also popular with counselors, schools/universities, youth mentoring programs, recovery programs, hospitals, etc.<br/><br/>It's a new and engaging way to improve yourself and your relationships with friends, family, and coworkers, all while having fun!<br/><br/>",

The Gallic tribes led by Vercingetorix were defeated by the army of Gaius Julius Caesar near Dijon and retreat to the city of Alesia, convinced to find in this fortress a safe position and the time necessary to regroup the troops and recover morale.<br/><br/>Julius Caesar, sensing the intentions of the enemy, also takes advantage of the particular isolated position of the city, planning one of the most ingenious sieges in history. He built two rings of fortifications, one external and one internal, to defend himself at the same time from attacks from the city and from the tribes who came to the aid of the besieged. The walls were fortified with towers, ditches and traps and sanctioned the victory of the Romans over the Gauls.<br/><br/>In The Walls of Alesia each of the two players takes the role of a Roman Legatus, commissioned by Caesar to supervise the construction of one of the two walls. Each one will have to take care of creating the most effective fortifications, hiring the necessary workers and deciding for each stretch whether to obtain immediate advantages from the palisades or to erect towers that will guarantee future advantages.<br/><br/>There will be a high competition in this constructors' challenge, but during the match there will also be two coordinated assaults by the Gauls, in which the Legates will have to cooperate to limit the damage. At the end of the second assault, it will be verified who has obtained the most prestige in the eyes of Julius Caesar.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players can push their luck or engage their memory and hope to avoid going bust. Or they can play it safe and hope their opponent cannot outdo their  achievement. If a player succeeds they collect the revealed cards into a score pile. One of the cards is re-hidden and another can be used for it's special power.

(Cubes can be used to trigger effects or saved for victory points.)<br/><br/>Players earn points from yellow cubes, markers on cards, and groupings of their markers.

Players take up the roles of island chieftains in the Trobriand Islands in the Southwestern Pacific in the 1890s; chieftains are competing to become the new Paramount Chief of the islands.  Over the span of several harvest seasons they gather followers and land, harvest yams which serve as the currency of the islands, host dramatic feasts, organize trading expeditions and use magic and deception to undermine each other.  The game ends when the cards run out and the winner is determined by a counting of &quot;prestige points,&quot; which are acquired through having worker or yam plot cards (worth 1 point each), winning feast cards from other players (3 points each) or kula cards which represent the legendary pieces of jewelry acquired on trade expeditions (worth 5 points each).<br/><br/>Yams! is based on the ethnographic works of legendary anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowksi working in modern-day Papua New Guinea in the 1910s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eternal War is an operational-strategic level two-player simulation of the 1st Chechnya War (1994-1996) wherein the Russian Federation under Boris Yeltsin attempted to directly and forcibly put an end to the Chechen independence movement. The Russian player must deal with low morale at the front and at home to win the war to keep Chechnya within the Russian Federation. The Chechen player is outgunned and outnumbered, but can wage an effective guerrilla campaign to bog down the entire Russian effort and thereby achieve independence. There is a total of nine game turns covering two years of conflict, from December 1994 to December 1996. The game map encompasses Chechnya and surrounding territories (Georgia, Ingushetia, Dagestan). Included on the counter sheet are Bonus counters for Modern War #1 (Red Dragon/Green Crescent), Modern War #18 (Green Beret), Modern War #21 (Kandahar) and errata counters for Modern War #17 (Dien Bien Phu).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To brace themselves for the end of the world, they need to build shelters.<br/><br/>Llamaged&oacute;n is a slightly strategic and light card game that combines mechanics such as hand management, take that and set collection. On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck. If they draw a Shelter card, then they have to play it immediately by placing it down. Shelters can also be built by combining resources. Beside playing shelters or building them, a player can use one action card which might involve attacking or stealing shelters, swapping one card for another, skipping the next player's turn, protecting your shelter, drawing two cards from the deck or even canceling the action of another player.<br/><br/>Eventually, a player will draw the Llamaged&oacute;n card from the deck (which was randomly shuffled into the lower half of the deck) and this means everyone gets another two turns. After that, whoever has the most shelters is the winner.<br/><br/>The game consists of 60 cards plus 5 reference cards and it's in both Spanish and English.<br/><br/>If you like llamas, meteors and sheeps, then Llamaged&oacute;n might be a good fit for you.<br/><br/>",

All players can play together to find it, including the player who put the cards on the board in the first place.<br/><br/>Each player rolls 3 d12. The roll indicates which cards are available for auction. Players can put on a card a token face back (values of those tokens are from 1 to 9).<br/><br/>When 3 tokens are put on a card, the value of the token is shown. The player with the highest value can look at the card.<br/><br/>In a second part of the game some cards are shown to all the players. Winning auctions allows the player to look for a clue card.<br/><br/>When a player thinks they have discovered the word he/she writes it on a paper. At the end of the game, the word is revealed.

You and your opponent have been sent to the planet Arual where oil and water are abundant. Arual is inhabited by a superstitious race. The Arualians have agreed to allow you and your opponent to drill a maximum of 61 wells either for oil or water, but only at a strictly controlled rate. The Arualians are somewhat primitive and you have discovered that they revere a series of sacred symbols. When you place your Driller Domes in a pattern that resembles one of these symbols, the Arualians will allow you to drill wells at a faster rate. Your goal is to place more Driller Domes than your opponent and return home with the title of &quot;Deep Space DrillerAce&quot;.<br/><br/>Deep Space DrillerAce is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. <br/>Players take turns placing glass Driller Domes on a hex board in an attempt to complete patterns that are shown on cards in their hand. When patterns are completed the player is allowed to immediately place more Driller Domes. The winner is the first player to place all 33 of his Driller Domes or the player with the most Domes on the board when it is completely filled.<br/><br/>The game comes with: 1 game board, 66 glass Driller Domes, 40 pattern cards and 1 rules sheet.<br/><br/><br/>",

Support weapon counters represent individual machine guns, mortars and light anti-tank weapons and vehicle counters indicate single tanks and transporters. The scale of this hex-and-counter game is roughly 1 hex = 50 yards<br/><br/>An offshoot of the popular ATS (Advanced Tobruk System), the &quot;TT&quot; refers to &quot;table top&quot;, and strives to provide all the action of any other ATS game while requiring less table space, as well as a lower cost.  All of the included scenarios play out on a single map, and ATS TT will use slightly smaller personnel, vehicle and ordnance counters than previous ATS releases.<br/><br/>The game features a new map, 8 new scenarios and all the counters required to play them out.<br/><br/>",

In Touchstone: Oubliette the game has moved from the sunny stadiums of the Braying Fields to an underground dungeon where the walls are constantly shifting and dancing around the players in an attempt to trap and crush them.<br/><br/>Touchstone: Oubliette is played with a 28 card deck made up of walls, paths, portals, and creatures. It plays in under 20 minutes.<br/><br/>You are the teams coach and take control of the individual players that must attempt to make their way through the Oubliette in order to score points for the team. These attempts are called a Drives. The deck represents the living maze and the opposing team's players that are trying to stop you.<br/><br/>Core strategies:<br/><br/>In order to escape from the Oubliette the player must evade the creatures and shifting walls attempting to block his path, locate a key, and finally find the one door that leads out of the maze. If the player finds and escapes with the Touchstone then he gets extra points. If the player hasn't escaped before the last card is drawn then they are lost in the Oubliette and fail that Drive attempt.<br/><br/>If the Drive isn't going well the players will have to use portals to buy more time. Portals shift not only the players position in the maze but they also propel him backwards or forward in time (either removing cards from or returning cards to his draw deck).<br/><br/>There are also four types of items that can be used to outsmart the creatures or illuminate the dark Oubliette. diamonds, torches, keys, and skulls.<br/><br/>",

Now, World Wide Wargamers, in association with Avalon Hill, offer 10 more scenarios for the Squad Leader series. These varied and exciting scenarios include commando raids, bitter rearguard actions, combat in the snowy wastes of the north, river assaults and much more.

        "description": "Background:<br/><br/>When Charles II of Spain died in November 1700 the both mentally and physically weak king had no heir to the crown. His kingdoms included not only Spain but both parts of the Low Countries, Italy and colonies in the Philipines and the Americas. Now two dynasties claimed the Spanish throne, the French Bourbons and the Austrian Habsburgs. Charles last will proclaimed that Philip, Duke of Anjou (grandson of Louis XIV) was to be offered the whole Spanish empire. However, the German emperor, Leopold I had launched his son the Archduke Charles as pretender to the throne. England preferred the Electoral Prince Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria who was Leopold&rsquo;s grandson. In February 1701 the 17 year old Philip was crowned in Madrid and was reluctantly recognized by England. In the same time French troops secured the Spanish Nederlands and cut of England and the United Provinces from Spanish trade. This resulted in the Treaty of Den Haag 1701 which formed the great alliance between Austria, England and the United Provinces and was later supported by Prussia, Hanover, Denmark, the Holy Roman Empire, Portugal and Savoy. The treaty did actually recognized Philip as the king of Spain but more important, it retained the Spanish trade, gave the Spanish territories in Italy as well as the Spanish Nederlands to Austria and formed a defensive alliance against France. On the other side Bavaria and Cologne supported the French in this upcoming conflict. When Portugal joined the great alliance the focus turned to put Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne.<br/><br/>The war now started slowly in Italy where an Austrian force commanded by Eugene of Savoy invaded the Duchy of Milan, one of the Spanish territories in Italy, which prompted a French intervention. Things are now set up for A Throne Vacant&trade; to begin.<br/><br/>The game:<br/><br/>A Throne Vacant&trade;( # 107-1 ) is easy to learn and is played in a fast phased manner. The units are blocks in regimental and army size for greatest flexibility in taking steps and differentiating the quality and strength of the troops, like in its sister game Pax Baltica. The high quality map is divided in territories which you have to conquer order to control it. This is made by taking each and every town in a territory. Navies will also play an important part in ATV in the sense that you have to keep the sea lines open to the colonies, and of course transport British troops to the continent. As this intriguing conflict covers the whole of western Europe the map covers a large area from the Atlantic coast in the west to Prague in the east, from northern England in the north to Oran in the south. Playable nations are England/Great Britain, France, Spain, Austria and The United Provinces. Other countries represented in the game are Portugal, Savoy, Bavaria, Denmark and The Holy Roman Empire.<br/><br/>So, why don&rsquo;t you enter the roles of some of the great military commanders of history, Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Villars or Vend&ocirc;me. Lead them to great victories and secure the Spanish crown for your pretender to the throne. We are quite sure that this game will bring a Machiavellian smile to your face.<br/><br/>The game, packed in a book case includes a 50 x 70cm-size full color map, 80 high quality wooden blocks, 4 dice, various markers and rules, including different scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Whether it&rsquo;s finding treasure, saving someone, or thwarting the villain, it all boils down to the Story.<br/><br/>Larger Than Life &ndash; Directors Cut can be likened to an action movie where your Hero moves from Scene to Scene trying to succeed in his adventure. What needs to be done? How do you do it? Who&rsquo;s in peril? Who&rsquo;s behind all this? All these things and more are generated for you by the easy to use game mechanics.

Stars, Co-Stars, Love Interests, Femme Fatales, and of course, the villains &ndash; we call them the Big Bads.<br/>    Over 35 Attributes that you can mix and match to make your characters unique. <br/>    A system that allows your characters to increase in skills and abilities when they succeed, but force them into &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; when they fail.<br/>    An easy to use mechanic that will generate and solve Clues, during each Story, based on your characters abilities. Solve the Clues and you make it to the Final Scene.<br/>    Nine different villains to fight, from Mob Bosses to Cavemen, and everything in between. <br/>    Four different Locales to adventure in. From the back alleys of a large Metropolis, to the villages in a Lost World, your Hero can travel from place to place, all generated by the game mechanics.<br/>    Over fifty Professions to create Victims, Suspects, and People of Interest and enrich your Story.<br/>    Mechanics that generate hundreds of possible adventures, with no two ever being alike.<br/>    Playable solo, cooperatively, or head to head.<br/><br/><br/>Cover art is a reused image of the original painting &quot;Blood on My Doorstep&quot; by pulp artist Rafael de Soto.

Each of the survivors has a special ability, such as an affinity with a specific type of weapons (melee or ranged), general combat proficiency, extra health, or move versatile movement.<br/><br/>The survivors fight the zombies as they explore each location.  In combat, the players roll two six-dice and then use their survivor's weapons and items to attempt to beat the zombie's threat level (which is between 7 and 11).  Equipped weapons allow the player to reroll, melee weapons give one reroll and ranged weapons give two rerolls but require matching ammunition.  If the survivor fails to fight of the zombie, they are wounded.  Each survivor can take on a few wounds before they eliminated.  However, survivors can use medical items to remove wounds, and can even discard items in combat to gain more rerolls in a last ditch effort to stay alive.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to recover multiple supply items and to bring these back to the safe house location before the survivors fall to the zombies.  The Road to Ruin comes with four scenarios.  The basic scenario 'Supply Run' mentioned above lays out the game's 25 locations in a 5x5 grid and tasks the survivors with recovering six supply items.  Other scenarios use different layouts to create varied challenges, including one where the survivors must use a radio at a specific location to call for rescue and then reach the airport location to win.  Each of the scenarios also has an easy variation, which usually requires fewer items to be recovered.<br/><br/>",

Each turn has a turn owner that has advantages in the mission and battle phases described below.<br/><br/>Each country card features its national flag, world location and capital, as well as stats like population, life expectancy or GDP.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, three mission cards are distributed and placed in front of each player, which allow them to score points and earn special cards by forming combinations with their country cards in hand. There are two types of missions which score points based on their difficulty: easy (1 point) and hard (3 points). The first player to achieve 10 points wins the game (for the fast game mode - average duration of 30 minutes).<br/><br/>There are 5 types of special cards that players earn by completing missions:<br/>- Steal the turn (become the turn owner)<br/>- Double the turn prize<br/>- Exchange all hand cards between 2 players<br/>- Search for a card in your own pile<br/>- Cancel any of these effects<br/><br/>Each turn consists of 5 phases: Draw, Mission, Special, Battle and Prize.<br/><br/>Draw phase: Each player draws cards from his stack until having 5 country cards in hand.<br/><br/>Mission phase: Starting with the turn owner, each player tries to accomplish missions with their country cards. When a mission is completed, the country cards used to accomplish that mission are placed at the bottom of the players' card pile and the accomplished missions are placed at the bottom of the missions pile. The player can also discard one or more missions. At the end of the phase, players update their scorecard and receive new missions.<br/><br/>Special phase: Each player can play his special cards, one at a time.<br/><br/>Battle phase: The turn owner chooses a card from the hand, puts it upside down on the table and decides between asking a question about the card to an opponent (flag/location/capital, depending on the thrown dice value by the opponent) or choose a statistic that will have to beat all opponents' cards. For the latter, after the turn owner announces the chosen statistic, each opponent picks a card from their own hand and plays it face-down on the table, to win the battle. This adds an element of suspense and bluffing on each turn, forcing players to carefully choose their plays. Note: the number of possible questions depends on each players' difficulty level. For the easiest level, the player only has to answer the cards' continent.<br/><br/>Prize phase: The winner of the Battle phase receives a number of cards from opponents' hands, based on the number of special cards played, the duel type (question or combat), and player count.<br/><br/>CardsLab is a fun, educational, trivia and strategy game for ages 8-80, designed with simple mechanics that can easily bring together three generations of players to the same table. It features difficulty levels tailored to a variety of gamers, and without noticing it, they are learning as they play.<br/><br/>Pedro Gordalina, CardsLab Designer.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/><br/>From the back cover:<br/><br/>For hours you have lead your foes along the high paths above the sea - always one step ahead - always one step from your people.

The fall of Soissons, cheaply surrendered by General Moreau, saw the quarry escape over the Aisne River to link-up with 43,000 reinforcements near Laon, raising his strength to over 100,000.<br/><br/>Fismes is a hypothetical engagement simulating a possible battle at this river Crossing on March 4th 1814.<br/><br/>",

In Pets, you moved in with your family to a countryside house, with a huge and arborized plot, and even a small pound of deep and cristal clear waters.

After you get these animals, you can interact with them in six possible actions: Sunbath, Feed, Take Care, Play, Sleep, and Breed. But that's not enough, because you need to plan your moves carefully and fulfill your secret goals.<br/><br/>Pets has a quick and simple game system, for children age eight and up, and another one more complex and challenging for adults.

Other players can't use these expansions.<br/>- Heart symbols on specific enclosure spaces mark 'parent' animals, and as soon as the second heart symbol is crossed in an enclosure, a baby is born (another cross is added). Lions with expansion may even have two babies.<br/>- For money you can still release animals from the barn OR score them for star symbols. There are star symbols on enclosure spaces as well.

Diese Linien mussten dann auch fortlaufend &uuml;ber alle Quadrate hinweg zusammen passen.<br/><br/>Sechs verschiedene Spiele f&uuml;r 2 Personen hat Michail Antonow sich einfallen lassen. Die Spieldauer bewegt sich immer zwischen 10 und 15 Minuten, die Vielfalt ist trotzdem gro&szlig; - da dank des variablen Spielbretts kein Spiel wie das andere ist.<br/><br/>",

Each scenario typically involves a combination of exploration, puzzle solving, storytelling, and combat in a classic sword and sorcery setting.<br/><br/>Games of Taelmoor begin with players selecting an archetypal class (i.e wizard or rogue), and forming a party by joining the host's game with their smartphone or mobile device. Players then take turns exploring and interacting with the game world. New rooms are laid out tile by tile as they are explored, and each may include unique elements like NPCs to talk to, puzzles to solve, or combat. The story is relayed simultaneously to all players via the app, though players are encouraged to read new passages aloud as they are discovered.<br/><br/>Combat features simplified deck construction elements. Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, and can build a custom combat deck as they level up throughout a scenario. Strategy between players is emphasized as many attacks become more powerful when combined with others. Attacks are played by scanning the physical card and then discarding.<br/><br/>Scenarios typically take 60-90 minutes to complete. Some are broken into multiple parts and are meant to be played across separate sessions.<br/><br/>",

The card will not be worth 10 points unless you bid 30 and 50 in future auctions.<br/><br/>The economy is relatively closed with winning bids going to the auctioneer, and the auctioneer's bids going to the bank; however, if any player bids an amount shown on the card up for auction, that card receives a coin from the bank, covering that number.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players earn points for their completed cards, purple cards with special scoring criteria, star symbols on cards, and a bit for leftover money. Of note, players without at least one star symbol are eliminated. Otherwise, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players may enter into an alliance with any other player by moving one of his/her Horse onto specific spaces next to the Han Emperor seed. When that happens, the third player takes control of the Han Emperor's 3 Chariots and 1 Cannon seeds. Once allianced, the two players cannot capture each other's seeds.<br/><br/>The Han Emperor may also be disposed, by capturing with a Horse. When that happens, the other two players automatically enter into an alliance, and the third player takes control of the Han Emperor's 3 Chariots and 1 Cannon seeds.<br/><br/>The movements of the pieces remain largely the same as Xiangqi except for the following differences:<br/>1) It is no longer possible to block the Horses or Elephants/Ministers.<br/>2) On the first move of the game for each respective player, players cannot move the Cannon out of their own territory.<br/>3) Witin their own territory, Soldiers can only move forward one step at a time.

Dubbed the &ldquo;Easter Offensive&rdquo; by the US press, the Communist attack was the largest since those during Tet in 1968, and like that earlier offensive, the Communists hoped that the offensive would initiate insurrections throughout South Vietnam and the collapse of its government. One of the most violent battles of the Easter Offensive was fought over the town of Kontum. The central highlands town had been subject to many attacks over the years, but this was the most prolonged and unlike the earlier fights which were waged by the NLF, this was a large-scale conventional battle that included tanks and massive numbers of artillery and rocket support. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?<br/><br/>Each copy of Bad News on the Doorstep is composed of the following:<br/><br/>Two 11 by 17 inch map sheets<br/>104 un-mounted, double-sided units<br/>10 pages of rules<br/><br/>Players will need a standard deck of cards with all Ace, 2 and 3 cards removed, one six sided (D6) and one ten sided (D10) set of dice to play the game.

        "description": "From the publishers website and press release:<br/><br/>This is the first entirely new game system from ADB, Inc., in years. It brings infantry combat in the Star Fleet Universe to life in a way that allows ground battles to be fought simultaneously with the space battles portrayed by Star Fleet Battles, Federation Commander, Starmada, or A Call to Arms SF.<br/><br/>Over 500 unit counters portray squads of five Marines, snipers, engineers, commandos, and heavy weapons; or individual tanks and vehicles; or special game markers.<br/><br/>The very simple &ldquo;shoot then move&rdquo; system reflects the savage horror of war at bayonet point. Fast interaction is created by rules for opportunity fire and defensive snapshots, so both players are constantly acting, reacting, planning, and making hard decisions. Do you fire at those Klingon troops attacking your right flank &mdash; or hold the fire of your weapons for the main attack that has yet to appear (and might never)?<br/><br/>The full-color highly artistic map portrays the terrain on a typical planet far, far away, but rules allow you to designate the colored areas as crops, forest, swamps, marshes, or any of a dozen other types of alien landscape. The map even includes an active volcano and a river of lava!<br/><br/>Each counter is a group of five Marines (i.e., a &quot;Boarding Party&quot; from SFB or a &quot;Marine squad&quot; from FC, facilitating interactions) or a single vehicle (tank, ground combat vehicle, shuttle, or whatever). Each hex is 100 meters. While you can stack a lot of units in one hex (more infantry than vehicles, but still a lot), only a few can fire out of that hex in each direction.<br/><br/>The game system is one of player turns. On your turn, each of your units can either shoot or move, not both. Shooting comes first (after which the unit is turned upside down so that you remember not to move it), then movement, then you turn all of your upside down units right side up. When you shoot at an enemy unit, you cross-index the kind of unit that is shooting with the kind of unit being shot at, adjust this for any terrain that provides protection, and roll one die. The enemy unit might be destroyed, stunned (turned upside down so it won't be able to shoot or move on its next turn), or unharmed.<br/><br/>The first game module, SFM: Assault!, includes Marines, other infantry (commando, heavy weapons, engineers, Prime Teams, militia), and vehicles (tanks, trucks, engineer vehicles, command vehicles, and various light-armored troop carriers).<br/><br/>Units will be able to dig in, call for regular artillery or transporter artillery, do assault landings with shuttles or transporters, do close assaults, use opportunity fire to shoot during the enemy turn, and conduct air strikes with fighters or gunboats.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;Wars past. Wars present.<br/><br/>In the 3050's, the discoveries of long-buried Star League records led to a plethora of new cutting-edge BattleMech and vehicle designs by the end of that decade, resurrected from the blue prints of design firms centuries old and thought lost to antiquity. Now, ten years later, these designs have moved from novelty to workhorse, as the Inner Sphere once more finds itself at war!<br/><br/>Fully updated to circa 3070, Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade - launches these designs into the current time frame, including notable MechWarriors/crews, as well as new variants. Additionally, a battle armor section has been included, providing full Classic BattleTech stats, and updating the histories for these twenty venerable designs.&quot;<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This upgrade volume is one of a series of Upgrade titles produced to provide new material for gamers and collectors, rather than replacing the original Technical Readout upon which they're based. The Technical Readout 3058 Upgrade is a companion volume to the Technical Readout: 3058, rather than a replacement. Although the two may seem similar the 3058 Upgrade expands the detail up to 3070, adds personality entries, many new Mechs, new sections on Battle Armour and generally provides new material. Both volumes share a cover, although this volume has the word &quot;Upgrade&quot; marked in the lower-right hand corner of the front cover.<br/><br/>",

However, unlike many companies, which produced new, but expensive, BattleMechs, a new upstart company, Vicore Industries, took a different route. By taking centuries old machines and upgrading both their physical as well as technological capabilities, Vicore almost single handedly started a revolution that provided a cheap means to bring 'new' BattleMechs to the field commanders desperate for more assets.<br/><br/>Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: Project Phoenix provides descriptions, game statistics and illustrations for twenty-nine classic BattleMechs that have been upgraded both in appearance and technology. Also, for the first time in any technical readout, additional illustrations representing all the variants for every design in the book are also included.

It could be a city, the Wakandan desert, the Savage Lands, the blue area of the moon or anything you like. In Marvel they fight anywhere.<br/>It is played on a 36&quot; x 36&quot; board so will fit on most tables without a problem.<br/><br/>In a game you will usually have between 4-7 characters on your team. Each of these characters act individually using their own Power to carry out different attacks and use Special Powers.<br/>Many can help or hinder each others though with boosts and actions like a Fastball Special.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to win set scenarios by completing different tasks and scoring Victory Points. These could be anything from take down / save the highest Level model in the team or rescue and keep a Cosmic Relic.<br/><br/>Each character comes with their own Stat Card which shows everything they can do. Attacks, Defence, Skills, Power, Damage and such.<br/>These are then used in a 2 D8 mechanic during the game. For example, 2D8 plus Attack Stat vs Defence Stat or 2D8 against your own Agility.<br/><br/>Feared and hated by humans because they're different, the X-Men are heroic mutants, individuals born with special powers who've sworn to use their gifts to protect mutants as well as humans.<br/><br/>",

The play of a card dictates the Maneuvering of men in a clock-wise direction, regardless of how the men are grouped or scattered. A player may also Maneuver defensively to minimize the scoring potential of his opponents. It is not necessary that each of a players men complete an equal amount of laps; a player may Maneuver his men in any manner that suits his strategy<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Played on a circular board of 25 numbered spaces. 4 men and a scoring marker of each players color are moved around the board using a custom deck of cards, consisting of Ace(1) through 7 with three runs of hearts, two runs of clubs and spades, and one run of diamonds. Players hold six cards, and draw one each turn &ndash; a card of their choosing, either from their hand or their draw, is played to move the number of spaces equal to the number of the card. Four men can be moved simultaneously with a diamond card, three with a club, two with a heart, and one man with a spade. Scoring is accomplished buy landing all four men on a single space; the color of the space - red, yellow, or &quot;terminal&quot;(home) - determines the scoring. Evicting other players from a space by landing a greater amount of your men on the space, and lapping the 25 space board also score points. The players color score marker sits on the numbered space of the board. The first player to move his score marker a complete round to 25 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fast and Dirty was designed to provide a quick, uncomplicated, yet realistic game system for small unit modern day, near future and sci-fi skirmish combat.<br/><br/>By building upon basic military principles that have not changed much over time, such as troop morale, motivation, and experience, these rules are an attempt to create a system that will serve just as well for fire fights today as those far off into the future.<br/><br/>Each player will field a small force, ranging from a few squads to a reinforced platoon with support elements, including heavy weapons, artillery, even a vehicle or two. Forces can be created in one of three ways: using a simple random force generation system to get you playing quickly, a more advanced system for experienced players, and a detailed points system for the ultimate in flexibility. Though the system is easy to learn and play, this doesn&rsquo;t mean the game is lacking details.<br/><br/>In fact, there are actually three levels of play. First you will learn the Basic Game, which provides all the core rules necessary to head off into battle. Then, as you become familiar with the system, you might want to consider using some of the Advanced Rules, which will add more depth to your gaming experience. Finally, there are a number of Optional Rules which you can incorporate into your games to add even greater detail. The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Fast and Dirty is a generic system, specifically designed to work with a wide array of settings and miniatures. Feel free to devise your own worlds and forces, based upon the miniatures in your collection.<br/><br/>",

The emphasis is on unit morale and cohesion rather than casualty generation.  While this is an ideal that many rule sets acknowledge, these rules actually collapse both missile and close combat into the morale phase.  Movement by units are quite limited, 'arthritic' in the designers' words.  This, too, makes the games move more quickly while remaining faithful to the tactical systems used in large-scale land warfare in Europe during this period.<br/><br/>The rules are designed for figures at the smaller end of the scale range.  Units are brigades of two elements each.  Figures already based for DBx rules need not be rebased.<br/><br/>First version rules (2001) are available online for free.<br/><br/>",

These include Agriculture Level, Population, Ideas, Resources, Military Level, and Victory Points. In addition, each culture is assigned historically flavored starting bonuses for certain statistics.<br/><br/>The statistics are tracked using &quot;stockpiles&quot; of counters. These counters may be expended in order to take Actions during a player's turn. There are 25 actions available, including Trade, Colonize, Shipbuilding, Conquest, Cultural Revolution, Urbanization, Cattle Raid, Population Explosion, and Assimilation. Actions can add to various stockpiles of your own or allow you to &quot;steal&quot; counters from the stockpiles of an opponent.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the largest Victory Point stockpile at the end of the game. The number of turns played is predetermined according to whether the players want a short, medium, or long game.<br/><br/>This free, online rules set describes the components that you need to create in order to play the game. The components consist of a Culture Card Deck (15 cards), Civ Card Deck (36 cards), Event Deck (30 cards), one Action Board, five Player Mats, five sets of Player Counters, five sets of Five Count Counters, Leader Token, Turn Track, Turn Token, and six-sided die.<br/><br/>",

One to four players, each representing an ancient city/civilization thought to have been lost to the world, are now on Rome's doorstep vying for a place in the prestigious arena games.<br/><br/>Players have a very clear objective: Eliminate the opponent's champion. Champions start the game in the arena but are inactive and defenseless. They will not fight until the crowd is behind them. Each player takes turns drawing, playing and moving gladiators from their &quot;hand&quot; and assisting them with tactic chips.<br/><br/>Based on opponent's moves and play style, each person will need to adjust their strategies. Defend your champ, take over and hold the crowd favor areas, assault opponent's champion, cover deployment zones, eliminate tacticians to reduce enemy options, fight beasts to gain crowd favor, the list of tactical possibilities is endless.<br/><br/>Hoplomachus combines combat, tactics, chip (units) management, level progression (though crowd favor system), team play, player vs board, and so much more.<br/><br/>Training Grounds: This is the smaller, faster version of our full, award winning Hoplomachus game. Play, teach, travel, or host tournaments with the Training Grounds if the full game is too much! The Training Grounds features one of each of the basic gladiators and a tactic or equipment.

If he/she was right the player cuts the first border of the postcard (see the image) and keep it as a token of his/her points. Otherwise the player cuts the border and crumple it up as a negative point. the postcard is now more irregular and smaller, therefore is harder to guess right. If a player collect 2 crumpled up tokens is out of the game, the game end when everybody is eliminated or the card cannot be cut anymore (end of the dotted lines.

Help the Monsters ride to work without breaking the Elevator!<br/><br/>In this cooperative math card game for kids, your Elevator is full of Monsters trying to go to work. If the Elevator gets too heavy, it breaks and everyone loses. If the Elevator reaches the 20th floor without breaking, everyone wins!<br/><br/>Monsters in the Elevator won &quot;Best Family Game&quot; at the 2016 Boston Festival of Indie Games and is currently 1 of 5 finalists in the Hasbro &quot;Next Great family Game&quot; contest. It is designed for 2-6 player, ages 7-to-11 (and up), takes 2 minutes to learn and 5-20 minutes to play.<br/><br/>There are two decks: The DRAW and the FLOORS. The Draw deck contains MONSTERS with weight numbers on their bodies. Each Floor of the Elevator is a new round of the game, where players check the new Floor card and the Monster cards in the Elevator to see if any of those Monsters exit (get discarded). Then the players each enter a Monster card from their hand into the Elevator at the same time, and finally they add up the weights of the Monsters in the Elevator. If the sum is above the Elevator Capacity (50 x the number of players), the Elevator crashes and everyone loses. Otherwise, everyone gets a new card and play continues to the next Floor!<br/><br/>There are also ACTIONS in the Draw deck you can choose to play instead of a Monster, including cards that Change the Floor up or down, cards that make one Monster exit to Get Exercise or take a Phone Call, or cards that completely clear the Elevator with Giant Bees or a Fire Alarm. Families can decide how much they want to keep their hand secret and how much they want to share for easier cooperation.<br/><br/>Finally, in the ADVANCED MODE the Floors are shuffled and played face-down, and without knowing what Floor might show up next the likelihood of crashing goes up and the game gets much more intense with every round.<br/><br/>",

Get ready to roll out the red carpet because two legendary teams (that&rsquo;s you guys) will be going head-to-head across two very different rounds.<br/><br/>In Round 1 a player from each team races to name as many celebs as they can, based on a given category, against the clock. The winner from this round takes an advantage into Round 2: Triple Charades Jeopardy.<br/><br/>In this final round, players must get their team to guess the celebs in three different ways: by acting, using one word and describing. First team to collect a celeb from all 8 categories wins! The game plays just like the Blockbuster and MTV game.<br/><br/>",

The rules, the map, the combat counters and the revolutionary use of dice have all been created with these goals in mind. The game also features no stacking of regiments, an innovative loss recording system and only minimal use of markers and tables. Two challenges are proposed: the French player, who begins the game in a position of numerical inferiority, must attempt to achieve the same feat as the army of General Bonaparte, to resist until the arrival of reinforcements, and then use these troops to seize victory. The Austrian player must try to do better than General Melas, who was overconfident of victory at 15:00, only to let it slip from his grasp..<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They love Doctor Lucky so much, they want him to stay with them forever!<br/><br/>With the Doctor Lucky's Mansion That Is Haunted expansion board, the players are ghosts, so they can move through ceilings, walls, and floors! Any two rooms are connected as long as they share an edge, not just a corner. Players can see from their current room into all the connected rooms, but no farther. What's more, the board contains three secret portals that connect two rooms, represented by duplicate objects (the raven, globe, and portrait); you can move through these portals, but you can't see through them.<br/><br/>This game board can be folded in half to create different play spaces with at most 4-5 players in the game, or the entirety of it can be used for games with up to eight. Whenever the number of players is close to the upper limit of the board, you should probably play with the Cat; if the board seems too roomy, you should add the Dog instead.<br/><br/>",

Multiple players may choose the same D12.<br/><br/>● Once per round, players may use the Black D6 to modify the result of their chosen D12.

(blank fields and the number 0 are okay)<br/>○ Number 0 can be written anywhere in the respective color.<br/>(E.g.: The dice is rolled and there&rsquo;s &ldquo;5&rdquo; with the red die and &ldquo;5&rdquo; with the black die, players can write &ldquo;0&rdquo; anywhere in either red row.).<br/>○ No duplicate numbers are allowed in any row or column. <br/>Number 0 is an exception to this rule.<br/>○ You may only write the values inside the icons (Hearts and Xmas Icons).<br/><br/>● If the players can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t enter a number, they mark (X) the leftmost Gift Box on their scoresheet. These are considered as penalties.<br/><br/>When any player has all the Gift Boxes marked or has filled four rows on their scoresheet, the game ends at the end of that round. Players then tally their points:<br/>○ Each Fully Complete Row: <br/>Points equal to the number in the rightmost heart. <br/>○ Each Incomplete Row: One point per entered number.<br/>○ Xmas Icons: Sum of the numbers in all three matching icons. <br/>(E.g.: A player has &ldquo;18&rdquo; in one of the trees, &ldquo;2&rdquo; in another trees, but he doesn&rsquo;t have a number in the third tree, he scores &ldquo;0&rdquo;.)<br/>(E.g.: A player has &ldquo;4&rdquo; in one of the hats, &ldquo;10&rdquo; in other hats and &ldquo;6&rdquo; in the third one, he scores &ldquo;20&rdquo;.)<br/>○ Gingerbread Man Bonus: If you managed to write the number &ldquo;10&rdquo; five times, you get +10 points.<br/>○ Each Gift Box: Sum of the marked points from left to right (max -30)<br/><br/>Whoever has the highest score wins. In case of tie, the player who has the least number of marked Gift Boxes wins the game.

Each game turn represents a snapshot of the action as the machines move across the aerial battlefield and fire upon their opponent.<br/><br/>This full-colour, 80-page soft back rulebook contains rules for playing aerial combat games with 1/72 scale model aircraft, and can also be used with 1/144 to 1/32 scale models. Scenarios are provided for such missions as Dogfights, Balloon Bursting and Bombing, as well as rules for playing both narrative campaigns or 'top gun'-style leagues. Also included is a technical gallery and aircraft background information.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Siege of Port Arthur, just before midnight on February 8, 1904, the Russian fleet based at Port Arthur, on the southern tip of the Kwantung Peninsula, was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats, elements of Admiral Togo's fleet. The attack having been made prior to a declaration of war, the Russians were taken by surprise. Thirty - seven years later, Pearl Harbor became the focal point of the same type of treachery.<br/><br/>General Nogi, Commander of the Japanese Third Army, was sent reeling back with 15,000 casualties after his first headlong assault on the newly constructed, although archaically designed fortresses...a tragic surprise for the man who had easily taken the town from the Chinese in 1894. Five long months of trench fighting finally delivered the costly prize.<br/><br/>The capture of Port Arthur was of urgent need for the fulfillment of the Japanese &quot;grand plan&quot;. First, it would deny an ice - free port to the Russian fleet.    Second, it would keep lines of communication free between Japan and Manchuria. Third, a quick victory without excessive losses would give the Third Army to Marshal Oyama in the field to crush the Russian Army before it could build up to an overwhelming strength. All this had to be done before Japan ran out of soldiers, and, more important, money!<br/><br/>The Siege of Port Arthur was chosen as the topic of this game for two main reasons. First, it expressed a desire to see a game equipped with an in - depth prepared defense system in which one side is totally defensive and the other totally offensive.    Second, the Russo-Japanese War was a sneak preview of things to come.<br/><br/>The American Civil War and the Crimean War have been billed as the dawn of modern warfare, but the Russo-Japanese War took this one step farther and showed the world the devastation accompanying such warfare. The use of heavy artillery, hand grenade, electrified fence, barbed wire, trenches and, a new twist, gas, was on display for the military leaders of Europe to observe, evaluate, and use nine years later in Flanders and along the Marne. The German observation team at Port Arthur recognized the benefit of heavy artillery and encouraged its development much to the dissatisfaction of the French Army in 1915.<br/><br/>Game comes in a zip-lock bag.  Features killing zones for hand-to-hand combat, Russian naval gunfire and Japanese siege guns, counter-battery fire.  The blue dots on the map are the objective hexes and features Fort Cha Kua Tzu.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: undefined<br/>Hex: approximately .25 miles / 402 meters<br/>Units: Company to Battalion<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 17 x 22&quot; three color map<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (255 1/2&quot; counters - 60 of which are blank)<br/>One 12-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-3 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion does NOT simply add extra materials to play with more people, but it adds 3 new game mechanics, required to play with 5-6 friends, but they can also be used in standard games with less players on the table!!<br/><br/>All these new mechanics have been studied as separate modules, so you will be free to choose which one you will want to add in each of your games.<br/><br/>The first module involves interactive cards, they allow you to carry out special actions, such as reopen an already filled Showcase to replace its content or expand it (for example a strategy could be to put a Precious in a Showcase to immediately earn &pound; 5 and then replace it with a Wonder of higher value), or it will simply guarantee you the option of adding missing books to a collection already placed in a Display Cabinet.<br/><br/>Other cards serve to embellish your Showcase, providing more Fame points, some other let you hinder your opponents by sabotaging their Display Cabinets.<br/><br/>The second module involves ships for foreign exhibitions! These ships are randomly drawn at the beginning of the game. Each ship board guarantee 3 additional Showcases for each player, with a special score calculated on the number of spaces filled regardless of the content. But each board assigns an additional bonus to a single space based on a specific content, so you will need to decide carefully how to use your ship!.<br/><br/>The last module involves freight wagons! These wagons have 3 Showcases each, they are placed between the players. Each player can interact with the wagon to his right and left, by filling them with Wonders as he sees fit.<br/><br/>Each wagon is shared between the two adjacent players and, at the end of the game, it will give Fame points to both, so you will need to decide carefully if it's the case to use those spaces and which one to use!<br/><br/>Last but not least, the expansion contains 6 meeples, to provide enough agents for each player. As we all love beautiful meeples, we decided to add 2 new characters to have more variety, we will include these new characters also within the core game box! Extra coin and banknotes token will be included as well.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is basically basketball but focused heavily on pure showmanship and individual skill display.<br/><br/>In Out Style, you win the game by scoring 2 Baskets. Alas, this is Streetball, not basketball. On the street, style is just as important as scoring, if not more. You can actually win without getting a Basket in, simply by achieving 42 Style points first - after which you would have won the heart of the audience which then proceeds to jeer your opponents off the court and you win in style.<br/><br/>Players will take turns taking on the Offensive and Defensive roles. The Offense player plays one card at a time, getting closer to the net with each successful play. The Defense player decides if he wishes to play a Defense card to steal the ball, and if so, which one from his hand. Even if Defense fails to snatch the ball, there is accumulating defensive pressure building up each time as the Offense player goes deeper into the arc until eventually the Offense gets overwhelmed by Defence. This is where the Offense can decide to pass the ball, which resets all cumulative defensive pressure back to zero. Then again, passing should not be something you do often since it gives the Defensive player Style points for pressuring you into passing!<br/><br/>When you get close enough, you play a Shoot card and hope your opponent does not block it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But this year&hellip;YOU ARE IN CHARGE of creating it! Of course, when you took the job, no one warned you about the upcoming monsoon season&hellip;<br/><br/>You will need to purchase and place various haunted hayride attractions on Hank&rsquo;s property. Then you will draw the path for the tractor to pull guests around in the hopes of delightfully scaring them. Unfortunately, while you are planning your tractor route, the yearly monsoon hits, and you will need to contend with ever-growing flooded areas of the farm. Not only that, but you have to contend with Marcie&rsquo;s Teenage Troublemakers on the night of the hayride, who love to egg the guests as they ride by.<br/><br/>Haunted Hayride is a roll-and-write where all you need is a few dice and pencil. In stage one, you are placing your attractions on the map. In stage two, you are drawing a path that you will take your guests on to visit those attractions while your property slowly floods.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Plan Red, the strategy for war with Britain, included sub-plans for conflict with British Dominions. War with Australia, code-named Plan Scarlet, would be a purely naval affair.<br/><br/>U.S. Navy Plan Scarlet is a 64-page book supplement to the Great War at Sea series, focusing on the battles that could have taken place in the Central Pacific.<br/><br/>There are 25 scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that could have taken place under various nations' war plans: Australian raiders threatening American supply lines, Japanese moves against Australian-held ports, a Japanese forward strategy, and much more. And of course the thorough background articles you've come to expect from our supplements.<br/><br/>This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Pacific Crossroads, Jutland, Cruiser Warfare, Black Waters  and Sea of Troubles or U.S. Navy Plan Red to play most of the scenarios, and U.S. Navy Plan Gold and 1898 or Remember the Maine to enjoy them all.<br/><br/>",

To get there, you follow the cards. Each turn you&rsquo;ll play a Board Action (the mandatory action of the card your token sits on), a Hand Action (one or more available options from the cards in your hand), and a Draw Action (replenish your hand from the draw pile).<br/><br/>Some cards are straightforward; they tell you exactly what to do. But most cards have options. Do you use the card to help yourself? Or burn your opponents? Wait &ndash; is there a way to do both? Of such is SetBack strategy born.<br/><br/>SetBack combines the portability of a card game with the playability of a board game to give it a fast-paced style where strategy shifts on the fly and the whole game can turn on the play of each card. Using the same cards to build the board AND your hand simplifies mastery of basic game mechanics while also resulting in millions of possible board configurations and unlimited replayability.<br/><br/>",

Each card has an effect or placement restriction that will help you gain cards from other players, speed up construction, add to your neighbor's towers, peek at the deck, allow you to build any card, etc. In team mode, the effects are useful for exchanging cards between team members.<br/><br/>The only building restriction is that cards cannot go over 21 and you cannot build tower cards that match your neighbors' topmost card on their nearest towers to you. Nobody in your city wants to be a copycat.<br/><br/>Completed towers gain you points based on the number of kites on the card, with lower-value cards scoring more points. Completed towers and other actions may award you a bonus worth points at the end of the game. Cards in your hand and unfinished towers do not score.<br/><br/>Race to build the perfect city until the deck runs out, and enjoy building towers from around the world on top of other towers from around the world.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1646 BC, the island of Thera (present day Santorini) was the site of a volcanic eruption one hundred times more powerful than Pompeii. This eruption coincided with the decline of the Minoan civilization and the rise of the Mycenaean civilization. Due to Thera's strategic location, the Mycanaean wanax (king) has decided that it is time to rebuild Thera and has tasked you, one of his koreters (governors) with this responsibility. The koreter who best rebuilds Thera to its prior glory will be victorious.<br/><br/>In the role-selection and resource-management game Thera, each player has a map of the island where they will engage in trade, clear ash, generate resources, move those resources to building sites across the island, and construct economic and luxury buildings. On a player's turn, they select one of five roles from the rondel. Every player can benefit from this role, and the one who chose it gets benefits that scale with the amount of favor on the role. Favor accumulates on roles over the course of the game and is redistributed every time a role is chosen. Here's an overview of the five roles:<br/><br/><br/>    The Priestess prays for rain, bringing the life-giving resource to the island.<br/>    The Worker consumes that water and produces resources.<br/>    The Planner moves those resources around Thera so that they can be used for construction or trade.<br/>    The Builder uses those resources to construct buildings on undeveloped sites across the island.<br/>    The Trader buys and sells resources at the port.<br/><br/><br/>Players earn points by constructing buildings. You must get the needed resources to the desired building site, then acquire the building plans (which are available to all from a common building tableau). Should you build another quarry (a resource-generating building), or are you worried one of your competitors will take that temple (a luxury building) that aligns with your strategy? Time is of the essence in Thera, so efficient planning and resource management are important in winning the day.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player begins with the same amount of money to invest in companies from 8 different economic sectors - utilities, insurance, banks, automobiles, manufacturing, oil, airlines, and electronics. Players take turns buying companies one at a time until no one can or wishes to buy any more. This is the only opportunity players have to invest their money. After all buying has ended, players take turns rolling dice and moving around a board. Upon landing on a space a player executes the action listed there. These include capital gains and losses, in which the player gains or loses money if he owns a company in the sector listed in the space. The more you paid for a company at the beginning of the game, you more you gain or lose when landing on these spaces. Some spaces result in the player drawing a random event &quot;Broker&quot; card; others pay dividends or direct the player to advance or retreat several spaces. The game ends when all players have made a single circuit of the board and land on the final space with an exact roll of the dice. The player with the most money at that time wins.<br/><br/>",

As in international chess, Senterej is played on an 8x8 (but non-checkered) board, and each player has an army of 16 pieces:  8 Medeq (pawns), 1 Nagus (king), 1 Fers (counselor), 2 Saba (elephants), 2 Ferese (horses), and 2 Der (castles).  Except for the Fers and Saba, all pieces move and capture as in international chess.  The Fers moves one square diagonally; the Saba jumps two squares diagonally.  In addition, pawns do not make initial two-square moves, castling is permitted only on the right side, and promotion is limited to previously captured pieces.  Ethiopian chess has a unique Ta'biyat (mobilization) phase, in which players simultaneously make moves at high speed until the first capture.  After the first capture, the mobilization phase ends, and players begin to move alternately.<br/><br/>",

The outside rows are level one, with levels increasing to the center of the board (6 levels in all)<br/><br/>Players use 5 types of pieces: President, Senator, Temple, Duke and Admiral.  Each type has a different movement characteristic either on level or up/down level.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>Nimmar is an intriguing and challenging game for the strategy minded individual.  The rules are simple and easy to learn, but in order to achieve victory, the complexity of the piece positioning must be mastered.  One must be adept in positioning his/her own pieces, as well as being aware of the positions and possible positioning of your partner's and opponents playing pieces.<br/><br/>",
