Because of this reason, the small map is really big enough for expanding, and even the regular capacity for other game is really a special ability.<br/>Very clever design.<br/>But unfortunately even in Japan this game is neglected, because this game is attached with not the boardgame issue but with the RPG issue.<br/>If you found this in the auction and you love sci-fi boardgames, please take it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "StrataCards is a unique set of playing cards that let you play poker like a game of solitaire or with a group. Each deck contains 52 cards and 2 &quot;jokers&quot;, but instead of typical front and back faces, each side has multiple card faces printed on it. For this Texas Hold'em deck, the fronts show 2 card faces, and the backs show 3 card faces.<br/><br/>The front of each card represents your two hole cards, and their value relative to other starting hands. There are also example flops labeled &quot;Weak&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Great&quot;, and &quot;The Nuts&quot;, and their value relative to other possible flops. Text descriptions include a standard name and a popular nickname for the hole cards, and the common slang for your made hands and draws.<br/><br/>The back of each card represents three cards that would be a great flop for the starting hand on the front. The idea is that without looking at the front of the card, you can deduce a range of hole cards that might be on the front just by looking at the flop cards on the back. Turn and River cards are displayed by placing one card under another so that only one new card face is showing.<br/><br/>This connection between the cards on the front and back lets you play and learn the game by yourself, or practice your hand reading skills in a game with others. Key points of the system are: starting hands and their values before and after the flop, learning the lingo that the professionals use to describe their hands, and good practice spotting bad beats, missed draws, pure bluffs, and the stone cold nuts.<br/><br/>Game variations you can play with this deck include: Texas Holdem, Greek Holdem, Heads-Up Holdem Solitaire, Multi-Way Holdem Solitaire, Holdem Flash Cards, and Blind Man's Bluff.<br/><br/>",

But navies were just as important to victory (if not more so); and it was on the seas that the conflict truly became a World War. From the North Sea to the Mediterranean, from the Black Sea to the South Pacific, battles raged across the globe.<br/><br/>So, go ahead: swap your energy shields for armor plating and the blackness of space for the wine-dark sea, and see if you have what it takes to rule the waves!<br/><br/>In addition to data cards for one hundred ship classes from eight different navies of the early twentieth century, Dreadnoughts adds brand-new options to the Starmada X game, including flotillas, wet-navy style movement, and dual-mode fighter flights, which can be used individually or collectively to enrich any setting. Also included are six historical scenarios, allowing players to re-fight various naval actions of the Great War.<br/><br/>Dreadnoughts is not a stand-alone product; ownership of the Starmada X Admiralty Edition Core Rulebook is required.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Starmada X<br/>    Starmada: The Admiralty Edition<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player is given 10 plastic score-markers for tallying. A player sets the steel ball at one end of the rail and releases it. Timing a swing of the pendulum, the other player attempts to knock the ball off the rail and into one of the scoring areas marked 100, 200, 500. If the player misses, the other player attempts to catch the pendulum and, if successful, can take a shot at scoring as well.<br/><br/>Play continues until someone scores, in which case the scoring player sets the ball in action again, or until the ball stops rolling, in which case the original &ldquo;roller&rdquo; sets the ball on its path again.<br/><br/>The game is over when either player has placed all 10 markers and the scores are tallied.<br/><br/>Impact was released in 1971.

Ovella! is Finnish language storytelling boardgame for 3-6 players, One game takes about 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>Like in most traditional roleplaying games each session starts with creation of character concept. Zombeja! Ovella! utilizes &quot;charactersticks&quot;, short wooden sticks with different qualities like personality types and generalizations printed on them to create instant stereotypes suited for genre.<br/><br/>Game combines competitive and co-operative play elements in storytelling to produce a structured roleplaying exercise that simulates thematic elements of survival horror movies.<br/><br/>Players have to create conflict of interest to eliminate other players and to advance their own position on the board. Co-operation of others is required to survive but some need to be sacrificed.<br/><br/>Originally a free mini-game with issue #8 of Finnish language roleplaying games magazine Roolipelaaja the game was released later packaged in VHS tape case to make it look indie zombie flick.<br/><br/>Zombeja! Ovella! is predecessor to English language game  Zombie Cinema which essentially streamlined version of it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simulation game created to demonstrate some key principles of supply chain management. It was made in the early 1960's by some professors at the MIT Sloan School of Management.<br/><br/>The game is played by 4 to 8 people, who must cooperate despite limited information transfer.  Early versions (including the one pictured) used pieces on a board, later refined to paper spreadsheets and then computerized ones.  The target is to minimize total costs across the whole team, from factory to distributor to wholesaler to retailer.  (With more than 4 players, either multiple players can be assigned to each station or the game can shift to competition between multiple teams.)  Each day beer moves forward through the chain, paper order slips move backward, and shortages impose costs.  The order slips are the only data each stage has to work with -- no table talk!  End customer demand is simulated by a deck of cards, which can be stacked or randomized by the moderator to emulate different market conditions.<br/><br/>The game runs for a specific number of day/rounds, initially 36 at MIT (but the moderator told the players it would be 50 to prevent horizon effects).  Invariably the limited information causes &quot;bullwhip effects&quot; that ripple down the chain, which is the main lesson the game teaches.<br/><br/>",

The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex.

At 2145, after days of intermittent shelling, the preparatory barrage ceased and the officers' shrill whistles rose from the din. British troops filtered down into Hana Ravine just before bounding up the slope to &quot;06&quot;.<br/><br/>Schneiders at Juvincourt<br/>As part of the Nivelle Offensive, Commandant Louis Bossut led five &quot;Special Artillery&quot; groups of 16 Schneider tanks each into German lines near Berry-Au-Bac at 0600. Groupment Bossut crossed the first German trench line with infantry against light resistance. But nagging artillery fires and mechanical failures began to nibble away at his force. Four kilometers later, Bossut swung northward to cross the second German trench line with his 60 remaining tanks and the 151st Infantry Regiment. After crossing around 0900, Bossut split his force sending two groups north toward Juvincourt, two more west toward Mauchamp and one south toward the Aisne.<br/><br/>The Lost Battalion<br/>On 2 October 1918, elements of the U.S. 77th &quot;Liberty&quot; Division from New York attacked north into the Argonne Forest. Major Whittlesey's force of two battalions from the 308th Infantry and two platoons of the 306th Machine Gun outpaced neighboring American units by penetrating a full kilometer into German lines. At dusk, Whittlesey's men dug in along the north slope of a valley between a road at the top and a stream at the bottom. Company K of the 307th joined the following morning. Seeing that this force had outpaced its flank protection, the Germans slowly encircled the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot;, in a pocket about 500 meters east of Moulin de Charlevaux. At 3 PM on October 3, the Germans launched their first attack.<br/><br/>Go to Hell!<br/>After 5 days of siege, the Lost Battalion was out of bandages, drinking from the Charlevaux Brook, and coughing on the stench of the rotting corpses that surrounded them. the Germans sent an American POW back to his comrades with a letter offering to accept an American surrender. According to legend, Major Whittlesey spat back, &quot;Go to Hell!&quot;<br/><br/>Kaiserschlacht<br/>The Kaiser's Battle began at 0435 with an unprecedented artillery bombardment of gas, smoke and high explosive rounds. About 9,955 tubes of all sizes rained over 1,100,000 shells across 40 miles of frontage. At 0940 the firing stopped; Stosstruppen immediately sprang from their shell holes as German regulars emerged from trenches close behind. Near Grugies not far from St. Quentin, Germany's 238th division slammed into Britain's 36th Ulster amid dense fog and lingering smoke. The recently arrived Ulster men had just taken over French positions and had yet to fully implement the new defense in depth doctrine.<br/><br/>War of Machines<br/>During the Second Battle of Cambrai, British troops of Byng's third Army broke through the Hindenburg Line to &quot;the green fields beyond.&quot; Leading the way, tanks of the 12th Battalion helped XVII Corps capture Niergnies. Just east of the town, Captain Roe's tank, L16, paused at Mont Neuve Farm. there he spotted four MIVs coming his way from the east. C Company - he thought.<br/><br/>Combined Arms<br/>After Ludendorff's Operation Georgette bogged down in the north, he made a thrust for Amiens. At dawn on April 24th, thirteen German tanks lumbered forward over a gloomy moonscape with infantry close behind. After plowing through Britain's 173rd Brigade, they covered 4,000 yards to reach the Cachy Switch Line, a stitch work arrangement of incomplete trenches between Villers Bretonneux and Cachy. At about that time, Captain Brown led three Mark IVs to the Cachy Switch Line with orders to hold at all costs.<br/><br/>(source: user's description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A drifter in Zone's wastelands for many years, the Preacher has finally settled near the Karlsruhe ruins, twenty years after the '68 war, with the promise of the Revelation to the conqueror in a number of trials set for those willing to take part.<br/><br/>People of all ages and backgrounds started pouring in, even from beyond the great Wall, driven by the irresistible urge to have their dreams made true. The pilgrimage, a trial in itself, killed many at the hands of the Scourges or the Infekted, but those who made it are now called the Circle Of the Eighty-Eight, and the Preacher - their shepherd.<br/><br/>The first trial, an unnatural selection process, will comprise of a series of auto races in which the Circle members will drive heavily armed vehicles to the death. With every type of car declared eligible, many in the Eighty-Eight started smuggling in their vehicles from across the Wall while others started tinkering with the Zone&rsquo;s own war refuse.<br/><br/>Thus begins Autokross-88.<br/><br/>So the last shall be first, and the first last for many be called, but few chosen. The Preacher<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Players will choose and control one of the 88ers throughout the Preacher's series of trials. During each crucible, Circle members will have to pick a vehicle and customize it with different offensive/defensive weapons and equipment in an attempt to gain the edge over their rivals. Death racing will take place in the Zone's hexagonal map tile built wastes through hostile weather, Infekted hordes and unscrupulous comrades.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An expanded version of Uber-Six, this version changes a few core rules, and adds a large number of abilities to enemies to make the game a bit more of an interesting challenge.<br/><br/>A pencil-and-paper dice-based solo roleplaying adventure.  Players build a character and face hordes of enemies in an attempt to level up or die.  The ultimate grindfest.<br/><br/>Players create a character of one of four classes (Warrior, Mage, Ninja, or Druid) each with a special ability, and adventure off into the wilderness to slay countless foes.  In between each fight, the character rolls on the monster tables to determine which foe they will face in the upcoming round.  If they so choose, they may spy by paying one gold before the roll--spying allows the player to decide whether or not to face the enemy.  After the enemy is determined, the game continues to battle.  During battle, initiative is determined each round by a roll of the dice modified by attributes, and whichever side has the initiative is allowed to make an action--either attacking, running, or using magic if possible.  Combat is worked out in this way until one side or the other is reduced to 0 health, at which point if the character survives they gather gold and experience, and lives to fight another monster.  If the character is dead, the game is over.<br/><br/>The goal of this game is simply to kill time in a fun way.  Surviving characters can last for several sessions, and allow for a feeling of progression.<br/><br/>SuperUber-Six builds upon the gameplay of Uber-Six by adding several additional status effects and generally streamlining the turn process.<br/><br/>",

A breach between dimensions has opened at the edge of the galaxy, and the Anti-Bodies, a race of horrible interdimensional space monsters, are spilling out and threatening to consume everything in their path if left unchecked. That's where you come in! You and a couple friends can take control of one of fifteen giant robots from all across the Milky Way, equip an arsenal of futuristic weaponry, and mow down the horde. And although everyone is working towards the same goal, killing some enemies will bring you more recognition from others when it's time for the Senator to hand out the medals...<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of rounds of play, called waves, in which a random number of enemy cards are dealt out of a deck to each player. Then, players take turns making attack rolls using up to three different colored dice, which correspond to enemy types (for example, red dice can only deal damage to red enemies, etc.). After all attacks have been made by players, any surviving enemies counterattack, then remain in play during the next wave.<br/><br/>The primary goal is to work with your teammates to deplete the 100 card enemy deck entirely, but in addition to that each enemy a player kills is worth anywhere from one to six points. So, while players are competing against each other for points, they are also required to work together to prevent a total party loss.<br/><br/>",

Could you set the goals needed to end the war and use the Imperial Japanese Navy in greater effect, which was the strongest in the world at that point, in order to achieve different results? An &quot;if&quot; scenario that history could not forgive, but may be investigated through a simulation game.<br/><br/>[Pacific War] is a strategic level simulation game of the naval operations in the Pacific from 1941 to the first half of 1944. Players become commanders of the Japanese Imperial Navy and the Allied navy, which is centered around the US navy, and have to plan a strategy and execute it in order to win the war.<br/><br/>Even though the rules are simple and cover only 4 pages, a unique gaming system is adopted.

Many lives that were cut short by violence or tragedy resume here fighting each other in a nightly battle to gain the strength to move on while fending off the attacks of rival factions. Asphodel is a strategic skirmish game set in the afterlands.<br/><br/>Factions of ghosts fight over locations to gain enough resolve to move on. These locations exist as shadows of places in the world of the living. In the afterlands locations may be adjacent to other places that are actually many miles apart in the living world. Set up -----Each player begins by either choosing or randomly drawing one of the available factions:<br/><br/>The Drowned, whose lives were cut short by tragedy at sea, or perhaps at the bottom of a well.<br/><br/>The Burned, victims of fires, radiation, and explosions. Their connection to the fire has lasted into the next world.<br/><br/>The Gremlins, tinkering souls who lost their lives to the machines they still love.<br/><br/>The Mystics whose pursuit of knowledge and power has become even greater on the shadowy side of the shroud.<br/><br/>And the Poltergeists whose violent brutal ends leave them raging, and lashing out across the asphodel meadows and possibly beyond.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their Ghosts, who are represented by dice. Ghosts will be banished, and summoned back to Asphodel. Ghosts may find the resolve to transcend this purgatory, scoring points for the player or they may find themselves stuck in Asphodel, wandering the twilight city forever.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After a long journey crossing never-ending wild seas, the colonies reached a wonderful and prosperous island&hellip; The rush of power began quickly after&hellip; And, the battle for conquering the island to prove who was the master of this mysterious island&hellip; Colonies started to expand their own territories by acquiring more lands&hellip; And, to flourish by harvesting resources... However, the resources were limited &hellip; And, industrialization was inevitably ahead&hellip; So, at a glance, the faces of tiny villages have been changed to modern cities&hellip; Colonies rapidly developed new cities, built massive factories, used airplanes to collect the resources, and scratched the sky with their high-rise business centers... The danger of foreigners was always around&hellip; Hence, the incomers funded the costly militaries to protect their people&hellip; War was not always an option&hellip; Thus, they established diplomacy and started trading with their neighbors&hellip; Famine lead to demand for more lands&hellip; So, the settlers were convinced to invade new lands and raise their own flags on them&hellip; And now this is the question: whose flags will remain waving on the horizon?<br/><br/>Raising the Flags is a strategic board game where every player is a leader of a colony. The winner of the game is the one who creates the most prosperous territory. The game occurs on an island containing various lands and cities. Each player begins the adventure by selecting a capital city and raising the main flag on it. Players should expand the territory with the construction of new buildings such as farms, houses, factories, airports and business centers, and by harvesting crude resources including, food, wood, stone and oil. The players also experience negotiation and trading with neighbors, tricking and attacking them&hellip;<br/>The game board is an island which contains four different tiles, including sea, resources, lands and cities. Each player starts the game by selecting a city as the own capital city and raises the main flag in that capital city. Then, it is time to expand the territory, construct the buildings, generate and trade resources with other players based on some pre-determined rules. The players expand their territory and raise the land flags on them. Then, they start to construct new building on the own territories. Simultaneous with construction of every new building, the player must select a building flag and raise it on the top of that constructed building. Selection of a flag is according to the player&rsquo;s own decision, which can be aimed by the logic of probability. When a player rolls two dices, the summation of both dices will make a number. If this number is matched with any flag number on top of any player&rsquo;s building, the owner player will receive the income of that particular building. Therefore, the territory of each player is expanded according to the optimal construction of the buildings and efficient way of raising the flags. During a gameplay, management of resources/money, planning to expand lands and cities, effective negotiation with neighbors, wise decision to attack other players, defending territory, and of course having a bit of  luck will make a player closer to the final victory.<br/><br/>",

One of the major finds can be story cards, that move the story (and the game) along. This will also trigger some of the cards (including enemies) in the action pile! You can perform different actions by moving your adventurers to different places - once you have discovered them! The story cards will (eventually) tell you how you can win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(When asked about it, years after it ended, George Washington said that the American Victory was &quot;little short of a standing miracle.&quot;<br/><br/>Almost a Miracle! uses our successful Tarleton's Quarter! as a game engine starting point to bring the Northern &quot;half&quot; of the American Revolution into play. Will the British be able to impose &quot;the King's Peace&quot; on the northern colonies or will the revolution survive to birth a new nation?<br/><br/>The map and victory conditions for Almost a Miracle! show players why battles took place in key areas but also lets players explore those seemingly odd tertiary campaigns, like Halifax, Fort Pitt, and Quebec.<br/><br/>Designer David Jones forces both sides to deal with their own challenges. The British consistently failed to &quot;live off the land&quot; and had to buy or ship food to sustain their armies, while the Continentals struggled with purchasing power and transportation.<br/><br/>The game handles battles in both large and small scale, as both were critical to the War's outcome, with a system that models 18th Century combat and how it differed from later times, where morale, readiness, leadership, and mere chance all could be &quot;the&quot; critical factor at one time or another, and disease and desertion could be an army's biggest killer.<br/><br/>Special rules cover the short enlistments of the Continentals, the uncertainty of French support and entry, prisoner exchanges, and the variable support of Loyalists and Native Americans. Both sides faced challenges they did not expect, and both sides contributed nearly as much to their own failures as they achieved in victory. The game will provide insights into how narrowly the Americans succeeded and how close the British came to their own victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;decription from the publisher<br/><br/>Designed by David Jones, after Mike Joslyn.<br/>Graphics by Mark Mahaffey, after Craig Grando.<br/>Developed by Lembit Tohver.<br/><br/>This game was published in issue no.51 of &quot;Against the Odds&quot; magazine.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Born half-Roman, but all business, this battle saw &ldquo;the last great Roman general&rdquo;, Aetius, at his finest!  And &ldquo;finest&rdquo; would mean both political maneuvering with shifting alliances as well as tactical finesse.<br/><br/>The build-up to the Battle of Ch&acirc;lons (also called the &ldquo;Battle of the Cataulnian Plains&rdquo;) is incredibly complex, and no one is certain which parts are actually true. Certainly much of the &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; of the Late Roman Empire were fierce peoples&mdash;Vandals, Goths, Alans, etc&mdash;who were fleeing from the even-fiercer Huns.  But Hunnish leaders like Attila, were far more than merely brutal, playing alliances, taking advantage of the deaths of neighboring leaders, and playing both Eastern and Western Romans as clients and victims.  The Roman leader, Aetius, had Hunnish warriors fighting FOR him in earlier battles, and spent time with both the Huns and Goths as a honored hostage (learning much about both peoples while there.)  In fact, his father was a Roman general of &ldquo;Scythian&rdquo; origin, one of the original groups of powerful mounted nomads, so you could say he was closer to his allies and adversaries than most Roman commanders of the day, which is one reason he was one of the most influential men in the Western empire for over 20 years.<br/><br/>Attila had spent time &ldquo;visiting&rdquo; various parts of both East and West, but taken home more loot from the East and decided there must be riper pickings in the West. Adding much of Gaul to his empire and plundering the rest looks to have been his aim, but his movements suggest as much opportunism as strategy.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;two&rdquo; armies involved at Ch&acirc;lons were a varied hodge-podge of peoples, with the &ldquo;Hun&rdquo; side including various Goths, Alans, Burgundians, Rugians, Franks, Thuringians, and many more. The &ldquo;Allied&rdquo; side was primarily Visigoth and &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; (which would be a broad mix of peoples in the same uniforms) but also included various Celtic and German tribes, Romano-Britons and their own allies of Franks, Alans, and Burgundians.<br/><br/>Now, you can apply those multi-faceted armies against each other in a way that really shows off their diversity. The Battle of Ch&acirc;lons game uses full-sized cards for each unit (rather like our Battle of Arbela game by the same designer). Each card has all the information you need for movement, activation, combat, and morale. Players set up their best available deployments to execute their strategies and win the game (if the gods of fortune smile!). Your leaders allow activations and assist in combat. Some troops may make choices other than what the commanders might have wished (and that can work out well or otherwise). It&rsquo;s all part of presenting this chaotic game in a timely and playable fashion.<br/><br/>A full battle will last 60 to 120 minutes. And then you can swap sides and try it again! Ch&acirc;lons comes with full-sized, coated playing cards, a sheet of information counters, playing field diagram, dice, and all the rules you need.<br/><br/>Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series. That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A two-player chess variant that is played on the CirSquare 96 (a unique circular board merged with a square board). The object of the game is the same as for traditional chess--checkmate the opponent's King.<br/><br/>The board (24&quot;x24&quot;, double-sided, quad-fold, custom designed) has 96 spaces and divided into 2 castles of 24 spaces each and a battlefield of 4 rows with 12 spaces each. Numerous initial board setups are possible. Up to 4 additional or new power pieces can be used. The game comes with 2 new optional pieces--Archer and Catapult--which compliment the Knight, Bishop, and Rook.<br/><br/>All the traditional chess pieces move as they do in traditional chess. See the game rules for how the Archer and Catapult move. Castling works like it does in traditional chess only if the standard chess setup for the power pieces is used.<br/><br/>The board has 4 triangular spaces. When a Queen or Bishop moves into a triangle across a corner, it can exit across either of the other 2 corners. When a Queen or Rook moves into a triangle across a side, it can exit across either of the other 2 sides. Thus, the pieces gain an extra path (a 5th path) of coverage when they are aligned with a triangular space, which is often a great advantage, especially in the middle and end games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publiser<br/><br/>This entry is 'level 2' of the games contained in Castle Strife Games.

At the start of the game, each player choses three cards that they will have access to each turn; at the start of each turn they also draw four random ones so that they have a hand of seven. Accordingly, what an army can do will be strongly influenced by the initial plan as indicated by the chosen cards: if you chose a &quot;attack on left&quot; card, you'll always be able to do so, if not any such ambitions are at the mercy of card draw.<br/><br/>Combat resolution is more traditional: a unit in combat rolls one die per stand it consists of, needing a certain number to hit depending depending on weapons. Hits cause disorder unless negated by resolve saves, and a unit that takes more disorder than it has stands routs off the battlefield.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tom Russell's first published game was Blood in the Alma. That humble little magazine insert game, published in 2012, introduced concepts that over time gave birth to Hollandspiele's Blood in the Fog and, eventually, the Shot &amp; Shell Battle Series. So it is perhaps fitting that seven years and nearly forty published designs later, Mr. Russell would turn his attention back to the topic that started it all, redesigned from the ground-up through the lens of the Shot &amp; Shell system. The result is The Heights of Alma.<br/><br/>The heights overlooking the Alma River provided a natural defensive advantage for the Russians, who proceeded to utterly squander it with slapdash entrenchments and a left flank that was completely exposed. It didn't help that the commander of that left wing was several sheets to the wind. At least he was on the field; on the opposing side, British commander Lord Raglan snuck behind enemy lines for a better view of the battle without telling his subordinates, leaving his army without any orders. Frontal charges against the Russian heavy guns were as costly as they were pointless. Eventually, a group of men disobeyed orders, choosing to stand and fire instead - discovering, to their delight, that their new Mini&eacute; rifles outranged the enemy artillery! They would have known that from the beginning if anyone had bothered to listen to their French allies - the only side to acquit themselves competently.<br/><br/>The historical scenario recreates this glorious mess of a battle. Three additional scenarios explore increasing levels of coordination and competence on either side. This game has more special rules than the previous Shot &amp; Shell title (Seven Pines; or, Fair Oaks), resulting in a more complex and nuanced experience, but not so many rules that it bogs the thing down - a given scenario will still be resolved within a couple of hours.<br/><br/>",

She has struck a deal with the Devil to exterminate them from the face of the Earth; allowing his legions of demons to possess the corpses of the deceased and raise them as zombies with full access to all of their memories and experience.<br/><br/>In this cooperative combat card game based on the comic series, players take command of the demonic zombie hordes of Hell. They collaboratively confer together, then take turns attacking the faction cards in play, intent on eventually eliminating humankind's last remaining strongholds. Meanwhile, the factions offer an ongoing resistance as they strive to establish their game ending survival conditions. Combat is quick, based on stats comparison, yet remains diverse from the wide range of abilities. Game flow is fast paced, yet decisions still have depth, including some deck building undertones. Pick up the game and gather your friends. Do you have what it takes to achieve Gaia's ambition?<br/><br/>",

Players will need to balance bidding with acquiring resources to bid with as all bids are lost, regardless of who wins, at the end of each round. In addition, players can play special action cards that alter the bid or in other ways help them. Multiple play options and combinations of special action cards allow each game to be unique. Game play lasts between 25 and 30 rounds depending on the version of the game played.<br/><br/>Each round, you must choose between bidding on the present creature or gathering more resources, at the expense of forfeiting a bidding opportunity. This decision may give your competitors the chance to acquire valuable creatures. Adding to the excitement, special actions can be obtained with your additional resources, enhancing the strategic depth of the game.<br/><br/>To add a layer of strategy, collecting sets of Xenofera from the same planet makes your collection even more valuable. With careful planning, clever bidding, and strategic use of special actions, you might secure the galaxy's most coveted Xenofera collection.<br/>  When all cretures are acquired, the game ends and the player with the most valuable collection wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player receives a character card. The poem tells about the characters' death, and the goal of the game is to manipulate the poem and escape death 4 times.<br/><br/>Each character card shows four combinations of verse card symbols, one combinatino on each side. Whenever each of these appears in the poem, all turned to the red card side, the player has escaped once, and then they turn their character card by 90 degrees to achieve the next sequence.<br/><br/>On a turn, can do three actions: they may move one of the last two poem cards to the first position in the poem, or flip the first card of the poem to the other side (which results in certain other cards to be flipped as well), or escape death by having the three necessary cards flipped to the red side.<br/><br/>The first player to escape death four times is the winner - everybody else dies.<br/><br/>The game is based on the novel O R&eacute;quiem do P&aacute;ssaro da Morte by Andrio Santos.

        "description": "Merchant of Venus provides a nice, solid base upon which to build variants. In addition to providing a simple movement system for combining speed, navigation and carrying capacity, it provides a balanced economic model with which to play. These two aspects combine to be very handy when you're modelling such expensive pastimes as war, politics or civilization. During the development of Merchant of Venus many alternative rules were tried and discarded. The variant here presents some of the best of these alternate rules, and the counters to implement them.<br/> These rules add quite a bit of versimilitude and fun to the game, but they also add some complexity, unbalance the play a bit, distract the players from the commercial aspects, and/or increase the playing time. That's why they weren't included in the original game. Generally, each variant rule can be used by itself, or it can be freely combined with the other rules.<br/><br/>The variant rules are:<br/>- Fast Set-up: Shortens setup time by mixing in the bonus markers with the goods markers and placing them only on culture discovery, makes bonus markers appear more early.<br/>- The Lost &quot;?&quot; Box: Make the asteroid in the Multi-Generations Ship a &quot;?&quot; box.<br/><br/>     Variable Nova Balls: Change the firepower of Nova Balls according to blast attack rolls of the players.<br/>     Own Species Bonus: Allow multiple items to be traded in a city matching the players species.<br/>     Customized Spaceships: Ships work differently depending on the player species.<br/>     Haggling: Adds a bartering system depending on presence, availability and luck to trading of items.<br/>     Extra Forts: Additional fort markers for the merchants.<br/>     Agents, Bases &amp; 2nd Ships: Rules for the new agent, base and 2nd ship counters<br/>     Mercenaries: Rules for the new mercenary markers.<br/><br/><br/>",

The Italians withdrew from the war the day before the invasion, but the Allies landed in an area defended by the German troops that quickly started a number of counterattacks. The battle of Monte Cassino (17 January-18 May 1944) was a costly series of the four assaults by the Allies against the Winter Line. The capture of Monte Cassino resulted in 55,000 Allied casualties, with German losses estimated at around 20,000. In the battle of Ancona (16 June-18 July) Polish II Corps captured an important Italian port of Ancona.

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOVERVIEWThe lunar Mare, plural Maria, are large, flat and dark basaltic plains of lower elevation on the Earth's Moon formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. The term Mare, which in Latin means &quot;sea&quot; was erroneously applied to such features by telescopic observers of the 17th century who mistook them for actual seas. In actuality, Maria are huge basins containing lava flows marked by craters, ridges, faults, straight and meandering valleys called rilles and are devoid of water. Maria are the largest topographic, dark and relatively young features on the Moon. Together with the bright, heavily cratered and very old lunar Highlands (Latin: Terrae), they form the landscape of the Moon. Maria are less reflective than the Terrae and can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Back in the days, the Apollo program, led by NASA, brought back many samples of lunar rock and soil material. It proved that among other minerals and elements, Maria are to be rich in Iron, Titanium, Magnesium and Silicon. Even three new minerals were discovered on the Moon and named Armalcolite, Tranquillityite and Pyroxferroite. Since then, besides being a research object, the Moon becomes increasingly, a point of interest to many of Earth's public and private companies, which perceive it as their next source for acquiring and extracting resources in the future ...<br/><br/>... in Luna Mare: Mineralis &amp; Dominatio game, players compete in collecting elements discovered on the surface of the Moon with aim to discover additional, valuable, new resources and minerals. In addition to gathering resources they also fight for control over Maria to establish a rewarding Moon dominance.<br/><br/>Gameplay introduces and smoothly combines 2 core mechanics of pick up &amp; deliver and area control in a single game. Together with light combat, score rivalry, units and cards management or team play, it provides a deep, tactical experience.<br/><br/>2 to 3 players may compete with each other in multiplayer games. Also, 4 players may play the game by being divided into 2 teams of 2 players. Playing cooperatively team members compete with the opposite team.<br/><br/>The game is based on a strong, realistic theme. Included map represents quite real boundaries of the lunar Maria seen from the Earth, as well as the Apollo landing positions. Also elements and minerals with their names, amount and composition are based on real discoveries, research and available publications.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTWO GAMES IN ONELuna Mare: Mineralis &amp; Dominatio is a single board game that consists of 2 separate gameplay modes and experiences - Mineralis and Dominatio.<br/><br/>Although sharing the same goal concept, each gameplay mode offers different mechanics ratios and ways of playing the game, forcing players to adapt their skills and tactics. Mineralis focuses more on a pick up &amp; deliver mechanics with a support of an area control. While Dominatio strongly prefers an area control with a complementary assistance of a pick up &amp; deliver.<br/><br/>Besides using the same, basic gameplay mechanics and components, both modes also introduce their own, unique features. Mineralis has its element delivery and new resource discoveries. Dominatio, on the other hand, provides a constant fight for domination over the most valuable regions and elements.<br/><br/>Each mode comes with a dedicated map, rulebook and a few additional, individual components. They may be easily treated as a standalone, full-featured games.<br/><br/>Choose the way of playing and dominate the resources and surface of the Moon!<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCheck the forum thread for game presentation and all official resources/files/links<br/>[OFFICIAL] - Game presentation + PnP files + Links + WIP Thread + Digital versions<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t2021 Two Player Print and Play Game Design Contest - achievements<br/> <br/>     BEST GAME: 1st place!<br/>     Best gamer's game: 1st place!<br/>     Best game to play remotely: 1st place!<br/>     Best mechanics: 1st place!<br/>     Best rule book: 5th place!<br/>     Best art/graphic design: 1st place!<br/>     Best use of theme: 1st place!<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is not beyond the ingenuity of Hitler&rsquo;s military schemers to carry bombing planes in sections across the Atlantic by submarine and slip them through the slim cordons of the naval patrols in to the Hudson Bay area. There, on some lonely island, safe from the eyes of all except an occasional Indian, those planes could be assembled and made ready for an attack on the Soo ship canal. &mdash;&mdash; Lieutenant Colonel Harold A. Furlong, February 1942.<br/><br/>Hitting Home is an introductory level game about Axis raids on the Soo Locks during WWII. The Soo Locks were a crucial choke point for the shipment of all of the iron ore used by US and Canadian steel mills. Air raids by German and Japanese aircraft were planned by all sides.<br/><br/>Although never carried out, strikes against this crucial Home Front installation could have had a profound impact on the war&rsquo;s outcome. Hitting Home allows players to explore the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; of German or Japanese attacks against the Soo Locks.<br/><br/>The 1942 scenario portrays a German attack using disguised merchant ships to transport Heinkel (He) 115 and 114 floatplane bombers to Hudson Bay. There the aircraft would have been unloaded, armed and taken off to attack the Soo Locks about 600 miles to the south and west. Since the range of the He-114 aircraft would be insufficient for the planes to make a return trip back to the transports, it is assumed the planes would have landed in a lake on the return leg and been picked up by the larger He-115 or other floatplanes designated for search and rescue.<br/><br/>The 1945 scenario portrays an attack launched from two Japanese I-400 attack submarines. These massive submarines carried three Aichi M6A bombers in hangers. The bombers were launched from a catapult that ran along the top of the ship&rsquo;s bow. It is assumed 4 of these bombers would be used in the attack (based on the presumption that it would be very remarkable for all 3 of a submarine&rsquo;s aircraft to be operational at the same time).<br/><br/>&mdash;based on description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In fact, if his parents hadn&rsquo;t been wealthy enough for a cinder-stone house, they likely would&rsquo;ve all perished within the year. While it seemed Pluck was on the fast-track to a University scholarship, he never exhibited much desire to learn more magic than it took to create a small open flame. He greatly preferred watching things burn, and experimented at length, noting particularly the flammability of certain mixtures and chemicals.

        "description": "In the early 1900s, an old house forgotten for 20 years has been discovered by a group of supernatural investigators. Following rumors of the haunting, they come to the house and begin to explore. As the daylight fades they make for the exit, but they are locked in! What&rsquo;s more, an evil spirit has possessed one of them, but no one knows who. Desperately, they scramble to uncover the secret of the house before time runs out, wary all the while that they can trust no one. Welcome to Possessed, a fast-paced game of exploration, supernatural forces, and treachery. Can you survive the night?<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards from the house deck, representing the rooms they are searching. Clue cards will be claimed as points at the end of the game, and you may trade these with other players to make sets worth additional points. However, should you draw too many Ghosts or Despair in one round, you risk losing those points. You must decide whether to hide from the Ghosts and drop out of the round, or push your luck and risk losing it all.<br/><br/>At some point in the game, the Possessed will reveal who they are. From now on they will attempt to thwart the investigators using the cards they have accumulated throughout the game. Can the investigators collect enough clues before three rounds are up? Or will they be overwhelmed by the Possessed and the terrors of the haunted mansion?<br/><br/>",

To control complexity and present an overall force commander&rsquo;s view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled turn length. The Allied player is normally on the offensive, trying to clear the Germans from the Narvik area, but the German player has opportunities for counterattacks. The game starts in mid-April, after the Germans seized control of Narvik and just as the Allies have made their initial landings to begin their counteroffensive. Narvik models a battle fought in Arctic conditions with extremes of weather and long daylight hours. There was a chaotic command system on the Allied side and an overextended force on the German.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map represents 1.5 miles or 2.4km. Each game turn represents one week. Units of maneuver are platoons to battalions representing from 50 to 1000 men. Air units represent a variable number of sorties.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player embarks on an ambitious journey to establish and grow their own city, vying for influence and supremacy in a world where strategy and cunning are key. The game intricately blends elements of moderate complexity strategy with engaging mechanics of deck building and tableau building.<br/><br/>In CastleUp, every card action is a strategic choice, revealing layers of depth as players carefully construct their city. The game features innovative mechanics, such as cards that turn when damaged, maintaining full visibility to all players and adding a layer of tactical foresight. Resource management plays a crucial role, as players must judiciously allocate their assets to outmaneuver their rivals.<br/><br/>Designed for competitive players, CastleUp eschews the randomness of dice, focusing instead on skillful planning and execution. As the game progresses through multiple rounds, players take consecutive turns, each action building upon the last towards an intricate web of potential victory. The game concludes when the drawing deck is depleted, with the player amassing the most victory points declared the winner. This title not only challenges the strategic acumen of its players but also invites them to immerse themselves in a richly crafted medieval experience.<br/><br/>",

It is 1943, the location, a secret underground Nazi base somewhere under the Owl Mountains. Your heroes are the survivors of a allied strike team, fighting to complete their crucial mission. Rendezvous with, and extract the spy, the eccentric genius and the resistance cell who have aided them.  Then, on the way out, blow everything all to hell. The stakes &ndash; a cure for the zombie plague and a chance to finally tip this war in the favour of the free world.  Your heroes must work together to find the best path, each scenario giving them options on which way to go next.<br/><br/>Escape from Projekt Riese is a choose your own adventure style game. A player's choices determine the fate of their heroes, for better or worse. The game plays out over a series of linked scenarios, a campaign with several different outcomes. Results and events in each Campaign scenario affect the start of the next, creating an ongoing and evolving story.<br/><br/>THE MISSION<br/>Escape from Projekt Riese takes you to Festungsandlage Nr 8, a hidden underground complex where twisted Nazi science seeks to unlock and weaponize the secrets of the zombie plague. In these labyrinthine chambers beneath a Templar fortress, the products of Ahnenerbe experimentation and the newly risen dead, hungering for fresh bodies to add to their ranks, stalk the halls. You are in charge of whether your heroes survive or perish.<br/><br/>Your choices and tactical skills will be tested along with the ingenuity of your heroes. The survival of each of your unique combat specialists depends upon your ability to conserve resources and exploit the zombies' weaknesses. You will need to choose your tactics wisely; sometimes stealth is more important than firepower.<br/><br/>You may fail the first attempt at escape but with experience and proven tactics, you will advance towards the victory the free world needs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The pirate's map is a single sheet print and play game, for 1 to 4 players (although you can play more without problems) with many dice rolls, ideal for those players who enjoy games where you have to draw. A quick game for any number of players (30min) where you can have fun snatching the best treasures from your rivals using simple drawings.<br/><br/>Players will take the role of ambitious pirates who explore the seas with the aim of obtaining the greatest loot. To do this, the pirates will draw a map where they will record their misdeeds and discoveries.<br/><br/>The pirate's map is a roll and write game with simultaneous turns. The active player will roll 3 dice. All players will use 2 of them to determine a location on their map, and the remaining die indicates the symbol to draw. Two of the dice are white, ALL players will be able to virtually modify their values by spending rum. The black die can be used ONLY by the active player, both with the visible value and its opposite, giving him more possibilities.<br/><br/>On the game sheet there are areas with which you can interact using the symbols that you draw on your map; these will give you different rewards to increase or make your treasure more valuable.<br/><br/>The game lasts an undetermined number of turns, until one player fills their treasure chest, one player gets 3 skulls (they have gone 3 turns without drawing on their map), or no one draws anything on a turn. The player with the most valuable treasure will be the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Earn your salary and don't get irritated when someones messes with your cleaning schedule.<br/><br/>You play in a clockwise order and try to clean the love hotel level by level, earning cards for every room you clean - even multiple per level. Missed a spot? Play a turnaround card, yell &quot;HANTAI!&quot; and clean up behind you.<br/><br/>But be aware that any opponent might slap your hand or yell &quot;AKAN!&quot; when you play a card, voiding anything you just played. If you are lucky, another player counters it with an &quot;AKAN-WA!&quot;, nulling the effect of the Akan. These are stress cards.<br/><br/>Cancellation cards are useless - unless you have two of them, which turns them into a wild card. The latter concept allows you to use any two same cards of any type as a wild card.  It can take the value of any cleaning order or act as turnaround, stress or even P.O.R.N. cards.<br/><br/>P.O.R.N.? Politicians, Oyabun, Rabbis, Numismaticians. These cards you can play any time in your turn, making it a special round where no one may replenish cards from the draw pile.<br/><br/>Once the pile is empty and as soon as no one can or want to play any cards anymore, the game ends.

Ichien-San knows the score mate, she's gonna blow it all out and build the biggest mega Love Hotel chain in Osaka.<br/><br/>For that, she needs you lot, the best managers out there, no problem! You can expect top dosh, mega bonuses and fab perks, at least that's the idea. 'cause you lot are the legit movers and shakers in this game! You're the crew that cleans, hustles and busts a gut in the shadows, keepin' the joints up and runnin. You're out of sight yet every room's got your unique stamp.

        "description": " Everyone at the studio is buzzing about the latest film. This murder mystery has just one problem: the director&rsquo;s cut reveals the culprit too early! Rearrange the scenes to build up the suspense and turn a mixed-up mystery into a sleeper hit.<br/><br/>Expand your Moving Pictures experience, or play this entirely on its own as a standalone entry. Moving Pictures is a quick little game for two with two phases in the game. In the first, you take turns playing cards without communication face-down into a pile with the goal of having them in order. Then comes the editing phase, where you resolve abilities and can make deleted scenes. If you have any scenes still out of order, you lose. Otherwise you move on to the second act, repeating the process and then the 3rd act if you continue to do well. If you ever wanted to produce a movie, here&rsquo;s your chance to do so on a budget! Add in a detective flair to your experience as you delight over the elegant artwork, and trigger fun abilities as you go along trying to piece together the film.<br/><br/><br/>The cameras are rolling on our newest blockbuster: Moving Pictures: Marked for Mystery! This cooperative game for 2 players was designed by Chris Klimowski and is sure to be a big hit.<br/><br/>In  Moving Pictures: Marked for Mystery players take turns placing numbered scene cards from their hand into the shared Timeline row in hopes of getting all 6 cards in order. The catch? They can't speak or signal to each other, so they'll have to watch each other's play closely for clues. Each card also has an effect listed which can impact placement, swap cards around, or even allow players a rare opportunity to share information.<br/><br/>Getting it right once is a feat in itself but a full game of Moving Pictures: Marked for Mystery is played over 3 Acts. The Timeline grows with each Act, making each round harder than the one before. Thankfully you also have access to 2 Deleted Scenes: if the round would end with scenes out of order, you can spend a Deleted Scene to hide one card. These Deleted Scenes don&rsquo;t refresh, meaning that you only get 2 mistakes before the credits roll.<br/><br/>COMBINING GAMES<br/>Marked for Mystery can be  combined with another Moving Pictures game. If combining, choose one scene card each numbered 1-16 to play with, and any two Deleted Scene cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You start each round by drafting your tiles from the sets available in the common pool, then you place your routes in front of you, trying to make as many connections as possible; be careful not to lock yourself in with choices that are too constraining. Each round, you can also place cars, trains, or travelers to populate the tiny little landscape you're creating...as long as you have free space on your tiles. The available actions change from round to round, so you need to prepare in advance!<br/><br/>The more pieces of the same kind each new placement connects to, the more points you earn. You can also score bonus points at game's end for placing tiles in a large rectangle without gaps and for creating sets of three adjacent city tiles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alice in Shroomland is a 1-4 player deck-building card game, with an approximate 30 minute play time.  &quot;Spore Cultivation&quot; is the core game of the Alice in Shroomland game series, which includes 197 playing cards, 8 meeples, and 6 jumbo card dimensions.  Game expansions include, but are not limited to, Spore Fertilization (45 card expansion) and Spore Germination.  Game expansions enhance game play, but are not required to play.<br/><br/>You'll enter a twisted and psychedelic world called Shroomland where you'll attempt to survive an onslaught of approaching enemies in an effort to either save or destroy Shroomland. When you begin the game you'll be given a set of 12 starting cards, called a &quot;tripper&rsquo;s kit&quot;. You'll draw and play the top 6 cards from your Tripper's Kit each turn.  These cards are used as in-game currency and are used to obtain additional cards to slowly strengthen your tripper&rsquo;s kit.<br/><br/>Encroaching enemies will traverse Shroomland and its many dimensions looking for you. Your job is to defeat these enemies before they get to your stronghold in The Ominous Dark Forest.  The game is a race against the clock; enemies that fight you in the Ominous Dark Forest will add &quot;ouch cards&quot; to your tripper&rsquo;s kit, thus weakening it. You will be temporarily defeated and labeled as &quot;unfortunately sober&quot; when you draw and play 3 of these ouch cards in the same turn.  Teammates are able to revive defeated players with a Meaning of Life Card.  The game ends when all players are unfortunately sober.<br/><br/>Alice in Shroomland: Spore Cultivation, has 2 game modes, cooperative and competitive. For either game mode your mission is simple&hellip; destroy the enemy leader. But beware! You can also win in competitive mode by wiping out the competition and being the last player remaining; sabotage at its finest!<br/><br/>Players who feel like preserving peace will defend Shroomland and play as the Sativaz. Those looking to destroy Shroomland will play as the Indicaz. Playing as the Sativaz is an easier leveled game experience while playing as the Indicaz is meant for more avid gamers looking for a challenge. Take a trip on the wild side in Alice in Shroomland: Spore Cultivation!<br/><br/>",

The abyss is changing. You will always be exposed to the threat of unknown beings in the castle. Explore the interior of the old castle while rejecting &quot;they&quot;.<br/><br/>Since the inside of the castle changes with each play, different developments will come every time. Co-operative play with two people is also possible.<br/><br/>During your exploration, you may find the souls of those who once lived in the castle. Such a soul is already a light in front of the wind, but if you give it power, it will bloom beautiful flowers. On the contrary, if you take power, it will soon die.<br/><br/>You cannot survive in the castle without strong power. Let's create a new technique from Reason and Instinct. There is some danger in learning the art of Instinct. The ending changes depending on whether you follow Reason or Instinct.<br/><br/>If you have been exploring the castle for a long time, you will be oppressed by karma. Karma is a dangerous being that undermines vitality and soul. Be careful, but be quick to explore. The deeper you go into the castle, the more memories of the past will come back ...<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Straight Road is a car racing game set in a post-apocalyptic future. Inspired by the countless movies of that genre, you race down a long (it almost seems endless) straight, ever-changing highway, trying to kill off all your competitors, run over the most valuable pedestrians, reach the gas station first or a variety of other goals, depending on the scenario you pick. Sometimes you will be on your own, sometimes you will be part of a gang.<br/><br/>There are many cars, drivers, passengers and equipment available that can be combined freely to build the wheeled killing machine of your dreams. However, the scenario only grants you a certain amount of credit to do so, each car only has a limited load capacity and, of course, the better the gear and the driver, the more expensive.<br/><br/>Game play is simple and fast. Each turn you change your speed, drive and take an action. You attack your opponents with your mounted guns, molotovs, rockets and more, lay mines or leave oil puddles for the guys behind you to slip in, ram other cars and wracks out of your way. Your ability to do stuff changes, depending on how fast you are going and what you are trying to do. However, only in very few cases you will need to calculate anything, most of that is taken care of by the layout of the game material; You just check your current value and roll a six-sided die. While you will want to stay on the road, circumstances often will force you to drive on the shoulder, where going gets rougher and steering more interesting&hellip;<br/><br/>Most of the game is free to print and play, you will, however, need small models to represent your cars; Micromachines work well, or any other model of roughly that size. If you deem Thunder Road too simplistic and Car Wars too fiddly, this might be a game for you.<br/><br/>",

Once you are familiar with the game, you'll be able to easily complete a game in 40 minutes or less.<br/><br/>The goal in designing GridIron Wars was to create a game that played rapidly, was easy to learn, statistically accurate and most importantly, fun. I think that I&rsquo;ve succeeded on all counts.<br/><br/>The design of GridIron Wars is what I&rsquo;ve come to term as Back to the Basics sports gaming. With the advent of the computer and the Internet, today&rsquo;s game designer has a wealth of data at his fingertips. Today&rsquo;s sports games are highly sophisticated and most are highly accurate as well. While a great many are outstanding designs, sometimes I feel like the &quot;fun factor&quot; has disappeared as the games have become more advanced.<br/><br/>In GridIron Wars, every skill position player is rated to perform as they did in real life. You'll be able to compile full statistics for every offensive player. On defense, you'll be able to track individual player stats for interceptions and sacks for most seasons where the data is available.<br/><br/>Defense plays a huge part in GridIron Wars, you'll &quot;see&quot; teams with great run defenses stuff the opposition with regularity. You'll experience the effects of team's with a great pass defense, or a lock down secondary.<br/><br/>The game ships with a complete solitaire system that will select offensive and defensive play calling, as well as individual ball carriers and receivers. Or if you choose, you can handle all of the play calling yourself.<br/><br/>",

Among other things, the game presumes a breakdown in Russian Chinese relations leading to open belligerency. Units represent operational task forces of corps or reinforced size; special forces; airpower; and cyberwar. Additionally, paramilitary forces play a significant role in the game rules. The objective of each player is to seize critical resource, industrial and communications centers, thereby gaining control of the Far East. Each hex on the map represents 100 kilometers from side to side. Each turn of play represents anything from three days of intense combat to a couple weeks of refitting. Ground units represent mostly corps sized task forces. Special forces units are regiments, brigades or groupings of cadres.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map on one sheet &amp; 176 counters<br/><br/><br/>Modern War, Issue #50<br/><br/>",

Created through an unholy combination of selective breeding, dark sorcery and warpstone-enhanced surgery, these monstrous brutes stand twice the height of their team-mates. Their crushing fists, razor-sharp fangs and single-minded devotion to slaughtering anything that isn't wearing their team's colours make them a real asset on the pitch. Coaches should be warned that training a rat ogre to pick up a ball is unlikely to go well, and indeed, getting one to do anything other than rip opposing players to shreds is always going to be a challenge. But then, that's what the rest of the team's for, right?<br/><br/>Field the Rat Ogre as a Big Guy for any Skaven team with this resin kit. Bursting out of his armour, muscular frame covered in raised welts and gashes, this is a miniature that truly means business; from his eager claws to the sharp blades tied haphazardly to his tail. His rules are available in Blood Bowl Death Zone Season One.<br/><br/>The 9-component resin kit includes 2 32mm round bases, one featuring a hole to slot a ball into, indicating possession of the ball in your games of Blood Bowl.&quot;<br/><br/>",

At it&rsquo;s core, Gulp is a take that tile game.<br/><br/>Gulp will come with 49 tiles featuring level 3 fish like shark all the way to the bottom of the kelp and coral chain. The board is modular as each set up is done by placing the tiles in a 7&times;7 grid and taking turns collecting fish. Each tile can eat a tile below their tier level, and any empty spaces left leave fish unable to move. Each fish can move horizontally or vertically.  Whichever fish is on the top of a stack is the winner of the pile at the end of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They reveal the cards simultaneously, then consult the play table to determine the line of the first attempted tackle. The player on offense can roll the dice to try to gain extra yards, with the &quot;Progression Line&quot; on the side of the field affecting the outcome of the roll. The more impetus the player has, the better the probabilities of breaking the tackle.<br/><br/>Conservative plays gain fewer yards but guarantee good ball control; aggressive plays like long bombs may lead, of course, to both faster touchdowns and a greater risk of fumbles and interceptions. The riskier the play, the greater the chance of a tunrover.<br/><br/>When playing COACH with four, players compete on teams of two, with one player serving as offensive coach and the other as defensive coach.

        "description": "gadZOOks! is a whimsical card game about managing a zoo and breeding adorable baby animals. Players must wisely use their limited resources to bid on new animals and outmaneuver their opponents. Each animal you add to your zoo increases the number of visitors your zoo attracts, and ultimately the most popular zoo wins.<br/><br/>Play is round based. Each round, players draw cards which might include money to bid on auctions or tricks to use against their opponents. New animals and powerful effects are then revealed and placed up for auction. Players get a chance to place blind bids on auctions that interest them and use their tricks to tip odds in their favor. Once everyone has played, the bids are revealed. It is important to bid wisely because losing bids are lost.<br/><br/>Acquiring pairs of animals allows them to mate, produce babies and increase your visitor count for FREE. However, savvy zookeepers always have extra cash on hand to protect their investments from the dangerous cards that come up for auction.<br/><br/>gadZooks! is fast and easy to learn which makes a great game for kids or non-gamers. However, there is enough nuance and strategy to keep more discerning gamers interested.<br/><br/>",

The game has several scenarios. Two scenarios cover a US invasion of Iran in the aftermath of the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-81. A third scenario covers an Oil War situation, where the US leads a NATO effort to seize Persian Gulf oilfields in response to an oil embargo.<br/><br/>The game system models ground, air and amphibious operations. For the Allies, the central game system is Air Transport Points (ATP). These represent strategic airlift capability. The assumption is that the scenarios cover the opening stage of an intervention, before the US can mobilize full-scale sealift. Therefore, airlift will become the primary means for moving units into the theater and provide logistic support.<br/><br/>The opposing Opposition Forces (OPFOR) have a better logistical situation since they can rely on local supply. But many of their military units are erratic in performance. This is modeled by untried units and other game functions.<br/> Each hex on the map represents 60 kilometers from side to side. Each turn of play represents anything from three days of intense combat to ten days of refitting. Ground units represent regiments, brigades, divisions and groups of irregulars. Special operations forces (SOF) represents unconventional warfare activities. Aircraft units represent anything from one to four squadrons, depending on the quality of air force and operational tempo.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It allegedly glows in the dark.<br/><br/>To use the Astral Acolyte in the game, all players must agree.<br/><br/>How to Place the Astral Acolyte:<br/>At the end of the first Doom Phase, the First Player takes and places the Astral Acolyte in any Area that has no other Units. (If no such Area exists, do not place the Astral Acolyte this game.)<br/><br/>How to use the Astral Acolyte:<br/>The Astral Acolyte cannot be Captured, Eliminated, or targeted in Battle. It does not receive Pains or Kills, and is functionally immortal. It cannot be targeted by any Spellbooks or abilities, even beneficial ones from its own Controller.<br/><br/>If the Astral Acolyte is in an Area containing a Gate, it must always be placed on top of the Gate, automatically replacing any other Unit on that Gate. While a player Controls the Astral Acolyte, he or she gains the benefit of any Gate the Astral Acolyte Controls: earns Power and Doom from the Astral Acolyte and its Controlled Gate, can Move it in a normal Move Action, and can Summon Monsters, etc., using that Controlled Gate.<br/><br/>How to Control the Astral Acolyte:<br/>The Astral Acolyte is under the Control of the player with the highest-ranking Unit in the Area. Units rank as follows (1 being the highest): <br/>1. Faction Great Old One<br/>2. Independent Great Old One<br/>3. Terror<br/>4. Monster<br/>5. Cultist<br/><br/>If no other Units are in its Area, or if there is a tie between ranked Units in the Area, no player Controls the Astral Acolyte. If the Astral Acolyte is not Controlled, that Gate is NOT considered Abandoned, and therefore gives no Power to any player during Gather Power. When not Controlled, it stays on top of a Gate if one is there, and cannot be removed. It is ignored in Battle, and unaffected by any Spellbooks or abilities as normal.<br/><br/>When an Astral Acolyte Moves, its Controller can change at once. If the Astral Acolyte or other Units in the Area Move, it may switch Control or become Uncontrolled at the end of that Action.<br/><br/>This promo figure was released in Game Trade Magazine issue 213 (November 2017).<br/><br/>An additional transparent Acolyte was included in Game Trade Magazine issue 215 (January 2018).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Have a Cow! is a fast, easy-to-learn game in which players are in a race to be the first dairy farmer with four cows in their herd.<br/><br/>It's competitive and requires strategic card play to get the most out of each hand of cards. The turns include discarding and drawing, playing the cards in your hand and trying to manipulate the strange visitors that will come to your farm. Manipulating the visitors will be the key to getting a victory!<br/><br/>Your goal is to make hay bales that attract cows, to your barnyard. Hay trolls, UFOs and even rustlers night show up to slow you down. But other visitors, like astronauts, neanderthals and knights in armor will try to help. You never know who (or what) is going to show up!<br/><br/>Have a Cow is designed to be enjoyable for gamers of all levels. It's suitable for ages 8+ and plays in about 20 - 25 minutes depending on player count. It's fast, but not so fast that the use of tactical card play cannot earn you the win!<br/><br/>EXPANSION PACKS with Halloween, Winter Wonderland and a variety of themes will keep the game fresh and interesting, too!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are the dashing adventurer Maxx Delver, currently exploring the long-hidden Temple of the Sun. The temple is filled to the brim with trinkets and traps, but you're most interested in the four royal jewels said to lie within.<br/><br/>The temple you&rsquo;re raiding is shaped like a closed loop (i.e., a donut), and the top card represents your physical location within it. On each turn, you &quot;move&quot; through the temple, always forward, by moving cards from the top to the bottom of the deck. You can choose to explore (use a number card in either the top of the deck or second-from-the-top to move as many cards as its value from the top of the deck to the bottom), look around (turn over two top cards IF the top card is currently not revealed), mark a path (place the top card from the deck in a reserve pile, IF it is a number card), or return to a marked path (return a card from the reserve pile to the top of the deck).  Exploring and landing on a treasure makes you LOOT it, both adding to your score and thinning the deck to increase the density of traps (face-up court cards)! If exploration ever results in wandering into a trap, it's game over. You win once you get all four jewels and land on the exit.<br/><br/>Loot the Loop is a solo adventure game playable in-hand with a deck of regular playing cards, inspired by other in-hand games such as Maiden's Quest and Palm Island, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series.<br/><br/>",

We are the forgotten fellowship.&rdquo;<br/>    &ndash;George R.R. Martin, A Storm of Swords<br/><br/>Forgotten Fellowship is the fifth Chapter Pack in the Kingsroad cycle for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game. The Seven Kingdoms are a volatile land, and the Lords and Ladies of its Great Houses are always biding their time, waiting for the moment that their foes stumble ever so slightly; in that moment, they can dash forward and slit their rivals&rsquo; throats. In an instant, the downtrodden can be crushed completely, and the mighty can be brought low.<br/><br/>As a part of the Kingsroad cycle, Forgotten Fellowship marks a return to some of the most memorable characters, locations, and events from A Song of Ice and Fire. It also depicts a Westeros forever changed by the War of the Five Kings. Among the changes you&rsquo;ll find in this scarred land are Brotherhood characters whose abilities function even if you have power on your House card&hellip;so long as you have less power on your House card than your opponent has on his. As we are reminded by the Chapter Pack's sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards), no amount of power is safe until your final victory is secured. This is a Chapter Pack for the downtrodden and the underdogs, and you&rsquo;ll find such noteworthy characters as Harwin, Lady of the Leaves, and Gendry!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle Roads Miniatures is a table top board game set in a post apocalyptic world where civilization is rebuilding itself. A plague whose origin is not widely known wiped out most of the population. Attempts to isolate and purge the cause resulted in wide spread use of major nuclear arsenals and other weapons of mass destruction. Not much was left. Very few people were left. Those that survived found that they had undergone changes.<br/><br/>The technology in the cars is 20 to 40 years past the &quot;weld on a gun, add some steel plate and go get stuck in&quot; that immediately followed the plague and attempted purges. Vehicles are purpose built for their combat role and are far more deadly. Driver protection is at a premium so motorcycles have mostly been relegated to the few remaining fringe gangs. The mortality rate for motorcycle users is so high they are now called &quot;coffins&quot;.<br/><br/>The goal is to survive the game and take out as many opponents' cars as possible. Game play is very fast with each turn lasting 3 to 10 minutes depending on how many cars are on the board. Each player uses a control board for each car that tracks turn speed, two phases of movement, component damage, and driver skill use (offense or defense). For the convention play version of the game these control boards are made of wood. For the mass production version (digital image in gallery), the control boards will be on silk screen impregnated boards (~5mm thick). Players track their car status and maneuvers by placing colored pegs on the control board.<br/><br/>Combat is via opposed dice roles. The attacker gets a pool of dice based on the weapon being shot and the range, speed and direction the target is moving. Driver skill can also add to the attack dice pool. The defender gets defense dice equal to their remaining armor rating and can get additional dice for range, speed and driver skill. Once rolled, any offensive successes over defense score damage. Critical damage is a big part of the game. Any time an attack rolls any successes their is a crit chance. It is extremely unlikely an undamaged car will take a critical hit but a medium to heavily damage car is highly likely to take a critical. The bad news with critical damage is the attacker assigns the damage location. Basically, the attacker hits what his/her driver was aiming for. Critical hits are to be feared and avoided!<br/><br/>Rules can be played at the Quick Play level, standard level or with all optional rules. The largest change between levels is how to handle collisions. Many diagrams are included in the rules to simplify the learning process and reduce the &quot;rules lawyering&quot; that may occur when questions arise.<br/><br/>Each game is played via individual scenario or players can play the long term campaign where they control an entire tribe including all their cars as well as drivers and advanced facilities. As drivers score damage, score critical damage, make kills and win scenarios they gain points that allow them to increase in driver skill or obtain upgrades for their cars. The core version of battle roads miniatures includes basic upgrades for the base cars like a bigger engine, bigger weapons, etc. A later expansion will include full design and upgrades of the cars.<br/><br/>",

This offering, Guderian Crosses the Desna 1941, is focused on the German attack to start the great encirclement of Kiev.<br/><br/>This battle starts on 25 August 1941, just after General Guderian goes to visit Hitler to convince him to allow the German Army to attack Moscow next.  Hitler decides that he wants to try and capture Kiev next.  He is mesmerized by the rich farmland and industry there.  Hitler manages to convince Guderian that Kiev is a better target.   When Guderian gets back he sets his troops in motion.  Their first test is to capture a major highway bridge over the Desna at Novgorod-Seversky.  His advanced elements fail to take the bridge in a coup-de-main on the 25th.  They regroup and make a more deterined effort the next day.  Aided by some inept Red Army bridge guards the Germans succeed and they establish a bridgehead.  On the 27th they must endure some minor counter-attacks.<br/><br/>This is a stand alone game and an excellent introduction to the Armored Knights game system. Three scenarios detail the actions of the 3 days of battle.  The first scenario is small and short.  It's a race to the bridge in the German attempt to capture it in a coup de main.  The second scenario is the full 3 day battle.  The last scenario is the German bridgehead forces trying to hang on and expand the lodgement.<br/><br/>The force structure is small enough for a great solitaire game and introduction to the game system.  System basics are an I-Go U-Go system with units being able to conduct overruns and engage in combat.  Unit strengths vary as a result of what supporting arms you stack with the battalion sized units.  Main combat units are infantry, artillery, and armor battalions.  Supporting arms such as recon, anti-tank, anti-aircraft, military intelligence, and engineers are built as companies.  Players are able to provide Close Air Support to aid the ground pounders and leaders like General Model even play a part in providing your troops with their best chance of success.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 2-4 hours<br/>    Hex: 1.24 miles / 2.0 kilometers<br/>    Units: Company to Battalion<br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Four 11 x 17&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>    One dual-side printed countersheet (216 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 26-page Guderian Crosses the Desna rulebook<br/>    Three scenario setup charts<br/>    Nine Player Aid Cards<br/>    Two 10-sided dice<br/>    One 6-sided die<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>(from publsher's website, box and user's desciption)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shootin' Blanks is an easy to learn (less than 5 minutes) 2-8 player elimination card game that fits right in your pocket. Compete for fun, drinks, money or anything you want!<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with three lives. Use poker chips, pennies, dollars, pieces of paper, beers, etc. Be creative.<br/><br/>Deal three cards to each player (one at a time). Place the rest of the deck in the middle of the table to draw from throughout the game. Turn the top card of the draw pile over to begin the discard pile.<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer can draw the top card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then must discard a card on top of the discard pile. Continue clockwise around the table.<br/><br/>Players try to collect the highest possible hand value in the same color OR in the same number.<br/><br/>Play continues clockwise until a player bangs or the draw pile is exhausted. Players cannot bang on their first turn.<br/><br/>When a player believes their hand is better than at least one other players hand, they bang on the table (or say bang) during their turn instead of drawing and discarding.<br/><br/>All other players get to draw and discard one more time.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, players show and announce their hand value (only adding cards of the same color OR the same number, not both).<br/> The player(s) with the worst hand lose one life. <br/>When a player loses all three lives, they are eliminated from the game. The last person with a life wins.<br/><br/>If a player at any time during the game has three blank cards in their hand, they throw down their cards and yell &quot;I'm Shootin&rsquo; Blanks!&quot; The round ends and all other players lose one life. Blanks are worth 0.<br/><br/>If a High/Low card is ever face up in the discard pile prior to a player banging, the scoring for the round changes from high to low. You still calculate your high hand, but instead the player with the highest hand value loses a life (ties work the same way for low hand rounds). It is possible to switch from High to Low back to High back to Low in a single round. High/Low cards are worth 0 and can never be drawn from the discard pile.<br/><br/>Wild cards can be any color and any number 1 through 8. They cannot be Blanks or High/Low cards.<br/><br/>",

Find the set that&rsquo;s right for you... or mix together characters from different sets to customize your own game!<br/><br/>A Trickster set has 49 cards with seven heroes, each with their own simple effect on play. A hero appears in seven different suits, each a color of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Each hero and suit combination appears once in a set.<br/><br/>The first player of each round may play any card from her hand. The second player in the round is called The Trickster, who may also pay any card from her hand. Any subsequent player that round must play a card that follows the pattern set by the Trickster. (If the first two cards are Yellow, then everyone must play a Yellow card.)<br/><br/>If you cannot follow the pattern, you must collect cards played this round into your personal scoring area. If everyone was able to play one card, then the Trickster collects the cards.<br/><br/>The goal of Trickster is to have the fewest cards by the time any player has emptied her hand. Whoever has the fewest cards is the winner... with one exception! If you have more cards of a suit than any other player, you may ignore those cards when scoring.<br/><br/>",

A coin can represent a force of soldiers or a powerful individual.  Some coins are more powerful than others and all coins have different special abilities.<br/><br/>Each coin is 2 inches in diameter. The front of a coin has the artwork representing the character.  On the outer perimeter are numbers that represent the character's attack and defense values.  The inner ring contains the character's name, rank, and special abilities.<br/><br/>The back of the coin has a tip which allows the coin to spin.  The coin can spin on a game mat, notebook, table, etc.<br/><br/>The spinning of the coin represents the random element of an attack or defense.  After the coin is spinning, a players stops it with their finger and uses the number next to their finger.<br/><br/>There is no game board, no dice, and no markers.  The only thing you need are the coins.  The game is modular which allows players to battle with only a few coins.  They can expand the battles as they collect additional coins.<br/><br/>",

The subject of the game is the famous battle between Napoleon and Wellington which took place in 1815 and caused Napoleon&rsquo;s final defeat and his getting off the stage of history. The game simulates the first part of the battle, until short before the arrival of the prussian reinforcements. The limited amount of counters, the size of the map, the duration of the game and the limited amount of rules make of it a good introductory game for anyone willing to  approach the world of pure board wargaming. Movement and combat take place on a classic hex grid with the use of playing cards (&ldquo;Tactical&rdquo; cards and &ldquo;Command&rdquo; cards). A high number of alternate activations by both players and the way in which cards are used contribute to &ldquo;mitigate&rdquo; the flaws of a classic &ldquo;I go, you go&rdquo; mechanism.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Plan 1919 is a two-player game exploring the most influential campaign that never was: J.F.C. Fuller's revolutionary plan to use new tank technology to penetrate past the frontlines, forgoing the brutal stalemate of &quot;body warfare&quot; to take out German lines of communication via a &quot;shot through the brain&quot;. The 1918 armistice rendered the plan moot, and it was derided by the more traditionalist elements of the British Army. But others were paying attention, and the Second World War saw Fuller's vision realized with terrifying effect by Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>The Allied Player is on the attack, with many tank brigades at his disposal - but will they be enough?  The Germans of this era have few armor units, but can utilize anti-tank units and aircraft to mount a stubborn defense. It's in their interest to prevent and minimize Allied advances while maintaining their tenuous lines of supply and communication.<br/><br/>Units represent corps, divisions, and brigades, moving across hexes that are about seven miles across. The time scale of individual turns is fungible and dependent on tempo, but the entire twenty-turn campaign represents about two months of real-world fighting.<br/><br/>Designer John Gorkowski is no stranger to the Great War, having designed a number of games on the topic at tactical, operational, and strategic scales. When Hollandspiele decided it wanted to publish a game on the subject, Mr. Gorkowski was the first and only designer we had in mind, and his experience with gaming the era results in a plausible, believable, playable version of Fuller's what-if.<br/><br/>",

This task won&acute;t be easy, as you will face several obstacles, from predators and diseases that may decimate the population, to sudden changes in the environment that will force you to adapt. And if that wasn&acute;t enough, other species are also fighting for survival, thus creating a race for becoming the first one to evolve or to reach a population that dominates over the other species.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a Level 1 Species Card, and three cards in their hand. On your turn, you will take a card from the Mutations &amp; Events Deck, and you will play a card from your hand. It could be a mutation that allows you to increase your population, or an event card that affects your creature or your enemies&acute;. After each player has played a card, mutations are checked. If your mutation matches the current Biome, your population increases. If both mutations are active, congrats! Your creature evolves to Level 2. The game ends when any species reaches the critical population, or evolves to lvl3.<br/><br/>",

You don't know how long it will be before power can be restored. Dealing with uncertainty and insecurity, possibly with failures and losses, the situation will make enormous demands on you.<br/><br/>Each round of a game is a complete day, broken into day and night. Different events happen in day and night, with these events becoming more serious and all-encompassing as the days progress. Initially everyone still has enough to eat, but people might be stuck in elevators, and accidents or fires can occur as the population handles open flame to cook.<br/><br/>Over time, food will run out, people will need more care, and the population needs to be informed about what measures the administration is taking. To solve these problems, the players control five teams &mdash; fire brigade, police, rescue service, construction, and administration &mdash; each with three members. Each team has important skills, but they can also crossover to handle other tasks, with the construction team also being able to put out fires, for example.<br/><br/>Teams can be used only for a certain amount of work, after which they need to recover. Players must act under time pressure and a lack of information, having only a few minutes to decide how the teams will act, with anything unaddressed remaining undone &mdash; and unfortunately unresolved tasks deteriorate the mood of the population, possibly leading to riots and chaos. Teams and time are limited, though, so you must set priorities and ration where needed.<br/><br/>The game lasts 4-7 days, and you can determine how well you do based on the damage suffered by the population and area.<br/><br/>",

That often-maddening restriction is at the heart of this persnickety bauble.<br/><br/>Given the same three letters in the same order, players will each conjure up a word. You&rsquo;ll score points for its length, for how many times each of the three letters appears, and the use of difficult letters &ndash; your Qs, your Xs, your Js, and your so-forths. Each round will specify a type of word &ndash; for example, a noun or a verb &ndash; and your score will be doubled if it falls into that category&hellip; but only if no one else at the table thought of the same word! The best score of each round wins one of the three cards. This not only removes it from future rounds but might form a set to score you extra points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>This is a word game for sesquipedalianists, show-offs, and pedants &ndash; where the longer and more unusual the word is, the better it&rsquo;s going to score. It&rsquo;s the sort of game where it&rsquo;s valuable to know that &ldquo;rebutter&rdquo; is not a verb describing what you do when your toast fell on the floor but no one else saw it, but rather a noun for a defendant&rsquo;s pleading in response to a plaintiff&rsquo;s surrejoinder &ndash; and therefore it IS TOO worth double points, Susan, SO THERE.<br/><br/>Five-Dollar Words is the 2023 Hollandays Sale Freebie game &ndash; given out for free with orders during Hollandspiele&rsquo;s big end-of-year sale. That&rsquo;s the only way to get your hands on this tiny wee little baby deck of cards containing a grotesque menagerie of alphabetic monsters and delights.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The third and most terrifying game in the Shuffling Horror board game line, Innsmouth 32 is a cinematic card-and-dice game that plunges players into one of H. P. Lovecraft's weirdest tales. One player controls the cultists and deep ones, all other players are gangsters, students, and scholars trying to make it out of Innsmouth alive.<br/><br/>Key to the Shuffling Horror experience is the movie deck: a sixty-card deck that hold all the characters, twists, turns, and terrors that await in Innsmouth. To start the movie, the deck is shuffled and a number of cards are dealt for the first reel (round) of the movie. Ten cards are dealt for the first reel, representing the first ten minutes of the film; as these cards are played, they confront players with terrible things.<br/><br/>Two new features have been added to the Shuffling Horror system to bring Innsmouth 32 its terrifying Lovecraftian vibe: Mythos and Insanity. Mythos are obtained by characters via items or investigation and grant the power to banish monsters. Characters may also gain Insanity during encounters with powerful creatures (such as the shoggoth). The more Insanity a character gains, the more unstable they become.<br/><br/>The game is playable with 3-13 players; if eliminated, players return to the game as cultists and deep ones (now playing on the Director's team against all other survivors).<br/><br/>Terror mounts with each successive reel! Who will be standing when the film fades to black...<br/><br/>",

After spending every waking hour of your formative years learning to play, it's time to cut the apron strings and strike out. Question is: do you have the Chops to become a superstar? Hire musicians, build bands, and play gigs for cashola and, even more importantly, BUZZ. But be careful, Rock can be dangerous.<br/><br/>Players use game cash to buy musician cards. Bands are built using musician cards. Each band has a collective Chops Rank which allows them to play gigs with differing requirements for cash and, more importantly, BUZZ. Bands may be upgraded with special instruments, with specific musician combinations and other factors.<br/><br/>Players foil other bands by playing Rivalry cards that can have hilarious effects such as musician demonic possession, alien abduction, botched pyrotechnics, broken instruments and many more.<br/><br/>Whoever ends the game with the most BUZZ wins.<br/><br/>-- description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WYSIWYG (pronounced WIZ-ee-wig) is an acronym used in many computer applications that stands for &quot;What you see is what you get&quot;. Since in this two player card game, the players get to see what cards they are playing for before they play to a trick, it's an appropriate title. WYSIWYG borrows some elements from a couple of old games called German Whist and Honeymoon Bridge, while adding in some new ideas of its own.<br/><br/>WYSIWYG is a trick taking card game for two players. After each player is dealt 13 cards, a hand proceeds in four separate phases. First, each player evaluates their hand and announces the total. Then, a bidding session takes place to establish the hand's trump suit and objective. Next, the players play to tricks, with the winner of each trick replacing their card with their choice of one of two exposed cards and the loser receiving the other card. Each trick is worth one mark. This continues until the deck is depleted. Finally, the players play out the remainder of their cards to tricks, each of which is worth two marks. If the player who set the trump suit has earned marks at least equal to a goal based upon the two hand evaluations and his bid, he wins the hand. Play continues until one of the players scores 50 points.<br/><br/>(description by Larry Levy)<br/><br/>",

While the rise to glory for mankind has just begun, the old species will continue to ignore them, while they split up the galaxy among themselves.<br/><br/>While fierce battles raged in the depth of space, trade and smuggling prospered, spies tried to gather secret knowledge and sinister laboratories sought always for new ways to annihilate rivals or solve the riddle to gain immortality. ... in all that Chaos of the crimson night... you Earthlings might be able, to save and preserve a part of the Universe.<br/><br/>Inis Vare, Mortal, in Intervention!<br/><br/>Intervention is a 4X turn-based strategy game set in space. There are four phases to run through per player and turn.<br/><br/>In phase one the player rolls the die and moves. Depending on where the token ends up, it can have unexpected impact on the player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>In phase two resources are gained form planets, colonies, conquered worlds, alliances, technologies and strategic resource-fields, that are occupied by his ships.<br/><br/>In phase three the player can take various actions. For example, building ships, move, conquer, colonize, research, trade or sign alliances.<br/><br/>In phase four you check if you have fulfilled one of the three victory conditions and tell it the person to your left.<br/><br/>The game ends, if one player has fulfilled one of the victory conditions at the end of a turn.<br/><br/>You may have to trade, cooperate, advance through research, or conquer your opponents to win this game. You also share the stars with non-playable factions, neutral star bases, and many other planets, asteroids and greater Neutrons.<br/><br/>What does make Intervention so special and worth to be played?<br/><br/>The designer has created an own unique universum for the game, the so called &ldquo;Interversum&rdquo;, with its own unique history. The Interversum is populated by 14 different species already, but it is planned to extend this pool further in the future. A player can even create its own unique species by using our civilization builder, which then can find its own place in the Interversum.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there is a lot of additional gaming material of high quality included. Every civilization comes with 30 spaceship tokens, each with six individual drawn spaceships. The species cards (faction cards), where the players income and victory points are marked, are coated with an iron lamination, that lets the magnets adhere on them.<br/><br/>At last there is to mention, that the board is made out of modular square cards, of which are more in the box than needed for a single match. That means every match is unique and not repeatable.<br/><br/>",

All pieces move as in standard chess. The normal array is on board A; board B starts empty.<br/><br/>In turn, each player makes a single move on either board following these three rules:<br/><br/>1. A move must be legal on the board where it is played.<br/>2. A piece can only move or capture if the corresponding destination square on the other board is vacant.<br/>3. After moving, the piece is transfered to the corresponding square on the other board.<br/><br/>(Thus a square and its corresponding square on the other board are never both occupied.)<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game, she&rsquo;s placed atop a column without flame.  When a fighter is injured, (loss of at least 1 life), Amaryllis will land on him to protect him. Her cardboard figure is taken from the top of the column and placed directly on the fighter. The player puts the corresponding token of +1 defense in front of him. The character immediately receives a +1 defense bonus as long as Amaryllis is on him (to maximum Defense of 6)  When another fighter is hurt, she flies and lands on it (which thus moves the +1 defense token).<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>If a fighter with the fairy is wounded a second time in a row (no other fighter is wounded in themeantime), Amaryllis increases its protection. The affected player flips the chip over to the +2 defense side (always to a maximum Defense of 6). This is Amaryllis&rsquo; maximum protection, if the protected character is injured again, the token remains on the +2 side.<br/><br/>Important: There is no protection available during a final duel. Amaryllis returns to a column when there are only two fighters.<br/><br/>",

The game can be played virtually anywhere, including non-flat surfaces.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players take turns drawing and choosing part boards with which to equip their potatoes, resulting in asymmetric character setup. Parts include treads, legs, shields, power supplies, guns, cannons, and other weapons with various abilities.<br/><br/>After choosing their parts, players then insert the corresponding miniature pieces into physical potatoes, and place them on the table as specified according to the number of players. Players set up their control boards, assign each part board strategically to the control board, and set all parts and potatoes to maximum power and zero damage.<br/><br/>During a game, players take turns using the power their potatoes produce to perform various actions with their parts. For example, a potato could use power to use their treads and move or ram another player. Alternatively, they could fire off one of their weapons, and attempt to damage another player.<br/><br/>Each part is different, has different power requirements, ranges, abilities, accuracy, and damage that it can give or take. Some parts require dice rolling to determine the hit location and damage amount. Players can continue using their parts for various actions, until their power reaches zero. At that point, their turn is over. Their power will reset on the subsequent turn.<br/><br/>When a part reaches maximum damage, the attacking player who caused that damage, removes the part from the potato, and keeps it as a victory point. The defending player removes the part board from their control board. That section of the control board is now unprotected, meaning that future damage to that location can now directly hurt the potato/control board.<br/><br/>When any one person reaches maximum damage on their player board, the game ends immediately. The winner is the person who destroyed the most parts and has the most victory points.<br/><br/>",

Are your friends mutated by an alien entity? Can you contact mission control before it&rsquo;s too late?

After each game ends players may be eligible to open up legacy style expansion packs depending on the outcome of each game.<br/><br/>Each player draws cards from a central pile and takes turns playing and passing cards. Choose wisely because you will only be able to play one action and one battery card per turn. You may pass cards face down to other players to either help them or hurt their progress. If you are a human you may want to pass parts of the satellite array to another human. If you are an alien you can pass mutation cards to other players to get them on your side.<br/><br/>Games usually last between ten to twenty minutes.

It does so with uniform material and a simple unified behaviour. This unique characteristic wasn't intended and not wholly foreseen, but it emerged during play.<br/><br/>Players alternately move pieces. A piece can be a single man or a mono-colored stack and moves as far as it is high in a straight line in one of the six main directions. Pieces may merge or split and they capture opponent's pieces by replacement, regardless of size, removing the opponent's piece.<br/><br/>The actions of both players inherently lead to a division of the board in a number of territories, separated by a contiguous Wall. Play takes place down in the territories as well as up on the Wall. The fight on the Wall is existential: it's all about eliminating the opponent. But whoever dominates it has the means to claim territories of take them from the opponent afterwards.<br/><br/>Moving is not compulsory and the game ends when both players pass on successive turns. The winner is then the player with the most territory, counted as cells of the board. Draws are possible but not frequent.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Using the game scales in Les Grognards 2nd Edition, small actions from a few companies up to multiple Corps  are possible.  The three game scales allow experimentation with games of different scopes and scales  with existing troops and mounting systems.  All three scales use the same basing system; there is no need for rebasing.<br/><br/>Les Grognards 2nd Edition also includes Horizon Movement rules for the Battalion and Grand Tactical scale games.  Horizon Movement eliminates virtually all measuring for movement.  Horizon movement allows units to move based on the tabletop terrain and enemy unit's positions.  Rather than measuring moves in small increments, moves are  made based on limiting terrain or tactical situations.  The result is a game that features dynamic, flowing movement rather than the same moves broken down into small increments as in standard measured movement games.<br/><br/>Les Grognards 2nd edition features completely new material, incorporating 5 sets of rules (Company scale, Battalion scale, Grand Tactical scale, Horizon Movement Battalion scale, Horizon Movement Grand Tactical scale) and 37 different army lists.  The new lists allow the  unique characteristics of a wide variety of  armies to be represented on the tabletop.

        "description": "This is a climbing game with many variations and therefore known by many names (Struggling Upstream, Pits, San Jia Xi, Huojian, Kuoppa). It's related to other climbing games like Dai Hin Min, Tien Len, Big Two and President.<br/><br/>The game is played with a 54-card pack including two jokers. Each player starts with a hand of cards and the object is to be the first to get rid of all your cards by playing combinations.<br/><br/>The game consists of playing combinations of cards: single cards, sets, single sequences and multiple sequences. When a player plays a combination, only a combination of the same type, length and higher rank can beat it - to beat a single sequence you must play a single sequence of the same length with higher ranking cards. Jokers are wild cards and can be used in any combinations. The Twos play a special role in this game and can be seen as semi-wild cards.<br/><br/>The player who gets rid of his cards first gets two points, the second player gets one point. You also get an extra advantage when finishing first or second, because the last and second to last player will have to give their best card away to them in the next hand.<br/><br/>Zheng Shangyou has a sizable luck element and the winner of a round has an advantage in the next round, but there is room for skillful play as the players learn how to best manage the cards they are dealt. The game plays best with five or six, but can be played by four or more. With 4 or 6 players, the game is usually played with two teams facing off against each other in partnerships.<br/><br/>",

The entire Ghost Bear population had relocated to the Inner Sphere; the St. Ives Compact was under siege; Katrina Steiner-Davion was sitting on the throne of New Avalon. Even with the overwhelming threat of the Clan invasion defeated, the Inner Sphere is still poised precariously between peace and war. Who will light the spark that will set BattleMechs marching and worlds aflame once more?<br/><br/>Drawing on information from five scenario packs, seven sourcebooks and more than a dozen novels, Shattered Sphere represents the ultimate guide to the people and places of BattleTech, as seen through the eyes of the characters who live there. Offering a brief, comprehensive history of the universe and an in-depth look at events from the Truce of Tukayyid through early 3062, this update is a must for any BattleTech fan. Shattered Sphere also includes detailed maps showing the current state of the Inner Sphere and the Clans.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Although Shattered Sphere was released at something of an odd time as it fell halfway through the release schedule of the BattleTech Field Manual series. It provides a general update on the major changes and events affecting the various Houses, Clans and major Periphery powers from the 3050s through to around 3061; the detailed state and border maps are very useful for BattleTech and BattleForce 2 campaigns, and this sourcebook is one of the few to touch on two of the up and coming Periphery powers, the Marian Hegemony and the Circinus Federation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Starmada: Fleet Ops is a &quot;fleet-scale&quot; game using the same database as Starmada: Admiralty Edition science-fiction starship combat game. S:FO is very similar to S:AE in many respects, but Starmada: Fleet Ops' flow is intended to be faster-moving and more abstracted.<br/><br/>Game scale is &quot;grand tactical&quot;, each ship is a single counter on the map, and its statistics (damage level, weapons, and so on) are tracked individually, although not in as much detail as Starmada: Admiralty Edition. (Any ship you can build using Admiralty Edition's ship design rules can be represented in Starmada: Fleet Ops, making the two games highly compatible).Construction rules are included, and also guidelines on converting Admiralty Edition ships to Fleet Ops statistics. An entire fleet of ships can be represented on a single standard sheet of paper.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous. Each player takes turns giving orders to his units by placing a marker on top of one ship to indicate the orders it has been given. Once all ships have orders, initiative is determined. The player losing initiative moves all his ships first (giving the non-moving player an advantage), but then fires first in the subsequent fire phase (gaining an advantage).<br/><br/>Movement and firing are both simplified and sped up from Admiralty Edition, reducing the amount of record keeping and the number of die rolls. Mechanics new to the Starmada system are introduced, including morale and command ships.<br/><br/>The product is available as either a download in Adobe .pdf format, or as a print-on-demand saddle-stitched book (44 pages). Additional material, including printable colour counters and map sheets, is available for free download from Majestic 12 Games' website for purchasers of either format.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Spanish-language card game that is a variant of Crazy Eights, based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt four cards (or seven cards if there are only two players) with the remaining deck placed with the top card face-up beside it (if a five is revealed then it should be shuffled back into the deck and the next top card revealed instead). Players take turns placing one of their cards face-up on the revealed deck, matching either the number or colour of the previous card (e.g.: 3 matches 3 and red matches red). Fives are wild and the player placing it decides its colour and number. If a player has no cards that will match the current card or wild cards then he must draw another from the unrevealed deck until a legal play can be made, but if there are no remaining cards then he passes instead. The player to discard all his cards is the winner.<br/><br/>The deck's red suite is The Last Illusion episode, the green suite is The Traitor episode, the yellow suite is Day Of The Dungeon Master episode and the blue suite is The Treasure Of Tardos episode.<br/><br/>There are 32 playing cards plus a card explaining the rules.<br/><br/>The box's artwork is based on the box's artwork from Quest for the Dungeonmaster.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

The state railway operates with discarded trains and fixed stations on the map. Sugar plantations are represented by small companies and special tiles that produce sugar cubes, which can be picked up by the large companies with special railroad cars and add to their income by ferrying them off at a port. Although the state railway controls most of the station tokens, you can pay it off and use them for your own company.<br/><br/>As usual in 18xx games, the wealthiest player at game end is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stellar Drift: Pull &amp; Write is a roll-and-write game about repairing your broken spaceship for 1 to 5 players. Each player is the captain of their own heavily damaged ship, drifting in orbit around an unstable white dwarf star. The captains must quickly conduct emergency repairs to their ships using whatever materials they can find, before the star decides to go nova and wipe them all out.<br/><br/>Stellar Drift is played over seven rounds. At the beginning of each round, the players draw random colored cubes out of a shared central bag. These cubes represent the resources the players have that round. Each player may then spend those cubes to move around their ship, conducting repairs as they go. Each player has their own separate game sheet with a spaceship-shaped grid on it, and squares in this grid are marked off as the players move through them. Play is simultaneous, players are all pulling cubes from the bag and marking off their sheets at the same time. Each ship grid square costs some cubes of specific color(s), and gives the player rewards in the form of movement on their 'ship status' tracks, which gives various benefits such as more resources, special abilities, and victory points.<br/><br/>At the end of the seven rounds, players tally up the victory points they scored for successfully restoring the various ship systems. Most points wins! A game of Stellar Drift typically takes between 30 to 45 minutes, regardless of the number of players. Stellar Drift is intended for players ages 14 and up.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publiser<br/><br/>",

People are aided by the Bobot&mdash;electric transformer boxes, where the energy of the Universe lives. They are confronted by the space aliens of the unknown race, Trashmen, who are trying to stop human technological advancements and Energy growth in the Universe. Their dangerous plan will take effect during the super strong solar storm, so the team will have to work within a very limited time frame, before the storm starts.

Players can choose among 8 different scenarios that affect the game duration and the set of resources needed to fix the error. Players can also select the difficulty of the scenario, which will influence the starting setup and the number of hours, needed to complete the game. Heroes will have to move around the game board entering different locations, to address situations with the aid of tests and to use their skills in turn. Different dice in the game represents skills. For example, when you test the character Vlad&rsquo;s Force skill, you use an eight-sided die, and if you are playing for the Bobot, you throw a twelve-sided die.

        "description": "Based in the popular TV program, Pechino Express is a game in which the players have to travel all over the world to reach their destinations as quickly as possible: to do it they need to use the means of transport, collect food on the map, use bonuses at your disposal and answer to some questions about the visited places.<br/><br/>During his turn, the player can take 2 means of transport (choosing between the face up cards or drawing them from the deck) or traveling to a nearby destination. To travel, you must play a number of cards equal to the number of small circles present along the link. Based on the played cards, the player will advance his disk on the timeline path. It takes less time to play cards with the same number or the same color. On each destination there is a food that is taken by the first player to reach it, so the players must also be quick in anticipating the opponents' moves. When a player reaches a goal destination, he has the right to take one extra food and, if he correctly answers a question, he earns a bonus card that he can play in subsequent rounds.<br/><br/>When a player has visited all his destinations, the game ends: the players receive bonuses and malus in terms of time based on the reached destinations and the taken foods. Foods have different values depending on the type: rice will give a fixed time saving, the sandwich in a growing way, the fruit based on who has more, while the fish will give a penalty to those who have less.<br/>The player who has spent less time wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Throughout the game, players take turns to &lsquo;kick down the door&rsquo; in order to challenge various creatures to battle. Should a player successfully subdue a monster then they gain a level and a collection of loot - which could contain weapons, equipment and spells.<br/><br/>As players gain more levels and loot, they will have to face stronger and stronger monsters - until even their opponents are working directly against them by casting a wide variety of meddling spells. Eventually, players must defeat one last monster in order to reach level 10 and win the game, but they&rsquo;ll inevitably have to face the slings and arrows of their fellow competitors as well.<br/><br/>Munchkin is back in a whole new addition! Munchkins &amp; Mazes is the most elf-referential Munchkin game yet, with cards inspired by the most popular roleplaying game ever, the latest live streaming crazes, the gaming hobby in general, and even by Munchkin itself!

        "description": "Nocturne is a puzzly spatial bidding and set collection game of sly mystics set in a whimsical moonlit forest illustrated by Beth Sobel!<br/><br/>In Nocturne, you play as a fox mystic casting magic spells to collect an assortment of enchanted items. You compete against rival mystics, each of you deciding when to cast the most powerful spells to move through the forest most cunningly to secure the best collection. Each turn you decide which items are most valuable to you and when to hold the other mystics back.<br/><br/>Through two rounds (twilight and moonlight), players compete to collect the strongest sets of magical items like firebird feathers, creature skulls, glowing mushrooms, mysterious eggs, and rare herbs. These items have value when collected in specific sets, but can also be combined to fulfill recipes needed for concoctions, scoring you even more prestige!<br/><br/>Each round you begin with a set of numbered tokens that represent your spell strengths. These tokens are used to cast spells and bid on a grid of items (and special actions) on the forest floor. Once you cast a spell, your rival mystics will have an opportunity to cast a more powerful spell onto an adjacent item, hoping to compel it towards them and prevent you from collecting what you need! As the forest is explored, different conditions of magical control will restrict pathways, leading to strategic situations in which players can &quot;corner cast&quot; and secure multiple items with less powerful spells. If your spell casting comes up short, you can always make an offering to the forest sprites, magical mice that have their own cache of treasures they may share with you, giving you further options to expand your collection.<br/><br/>The set-up of the forest grid and twilight and moonlight goals, along with concoction cards and special player abilities in each game, provide great variability so that no two games of Nocturne will play out the same. Different spatial goals and situations will necessitate different strategies and tactics to outwit your opponents in this highly interactive and unique spatial bidding game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is suitable for ship models of all scales from 1:2400 to 1:1200 to 1:900. The game is primarily designed for the Revolutionary &amp; Napoleonic Wars, but with some modifications can be used for earlier eras.<br/><br/>Fire As She Bears! is of easy to moderate complexity. Most of the game's rules are fairly intuitive after you have completed a scenario or two. The emphasis is on fleet actions. Players act as squadron or fleet commanders rather than individual ship captains. Fire As She Bears! allows you to experience the chaos of naval combat without written orders or cumbersome paperwork.<br/><br/>The 2nd Edition rule set is published in PDF and JPG format. There are over 30 pages of rules, numerous tables and sailing charts, 25 pages of full color examples of play, three sample scenarios, over 80 pages of ship record sheets, and an Excel&reg; spreadsheet for creating other ship record sheets. Included are the standard rules, as well as, optional rules for Forts, Night Actions, Fog, Fireships, (etc.) and special rules applying only to Frigates and Sloops.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Rules Folder:<br/><br/>&quot;In 1814 and 1815, Napoleon took on the might of Europe in what proved to be his final campaigns.  The conclusion of each resulted in an abdication -- once he returned, once he did not.<br/><br/>In 1814, Napoleon had the advantage of interior lines, centralized command, and the motivation of fighting for his home soil.  His opponents had none of these -- but they did have overwhelming strength instead.<br/><br/>In 1815, Napoleon had the advantage of surprise and concentration.  His opponents were rapidly joining together.  A quick, decisive strike on each separated army by Napoleon could have spelled victory for the French, instead of defeat at Waterloo.<br/><br/>In NAPOLEON'S LAST CAMPAIGNS you are faced with the intriguing possibilities for tactical and strategic maneuvers presented by both of these classic campaigns and the fate of victory or defeat lies in your hands and mind.&quot;<br/><br/>Description of Game Components:<br/><br/>Two color map, 16&quot; x 14&quot;, depicting North-eastern France from Paris on the west edge of the map to Brussels in the North and Mainz in the East.  Movement is area based (no hexes) and counters represent Corp. sized units.  No other indication of scale is mentioned in the rules.  Games lenth is either 24 turns for the 1814 scenario or 25 turns for the 1815 scenario.<br/><br/>In addition to unit designation and nationality, each unit has two numbers on the face of the counter.  The first number (on the left) represents the &quot;Combat Power&quot; of the unit in the 1814 scenario with the number on the left representing the &quot;Combat Power&quot; of the unit in the 1815 scenario.<br/><br/>Sequence of play is IGO-UGO.<br/><br/>Units may move one area per turn. Rivers and mountains do not hinder movement.  Forest areas take two turns to enter.    French units (ONLY) with supply points may attempt to Force March and move two areas in a turn.  A failed attempt to Force March means the unit does not move at all.  French infantry Force March on a roll (six-sided die) of 1-4.  French Cavalry Force Marches on a roll of 1-5.  Each unit attempting to Force March roll individually.  The Napoleon unit and the French Guards unit may always Force March (no die roll required) if supply is available.<br/><br/>Combat is a two step affair.  In the first step, each player selects a type of attack or defense and cross reference the combination to find the die-roll modification.  The difference between commander ratings also modify the die roll result.  Then the die is rolled on an odds based Combat Results Table and result number is modified by the die-roll modification number determined in the first step.  Combat losses are taken as a percentage of the of the losing forces combat strength.  Combat results can also result in the retreat (one area) of the attacker or defender.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1919, the governments of the victorious Allied powers met in Paris to discuss the post-war order of things. But while they were talking, history continued to move. As the rest of Russia descended into civil war, forces of the Red Army moved westward to exploit the power vacuum left by the retreating German armies. They were met by units of the new Polish Army, who pushed them back steadily into what is now Belarus. After the Polish overextended their forces in an offensive to take Kiev in early 1920, the greatly reinforced Red Army went over to the attack.<br/><br/>General Mikhail Tukhachevsky&rsquo;s Order of the Day for July 2, 1920 read in part &quot;To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March on Vilno, Minsk, Warsaw!&rdquo; As the new nation of Poland fought for its life and the front lines surged back and forth, both sides grew increasingly desperate. The war climaxed in the Battle of Warsaw in mid-August, as the Poles finally broke the Red Army and flung it back into Russia in disorder &ndash; to this day they refer to it as &ldquo;the Miracle on the Vistula&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Red Horde 1920 is an operational-level game on the action during this fateful summer. The Red Army smashes forward in the name of the Revolution, with masses of rifle divisions and the savage 1st Cavalry Army, commanded by Semyon Budyonny and filled with fierce Cossacks. The Poles resist with units of the Polish Legion, veterans of the fighting in France, and their national army. Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Hungarians and even a unit of Red Polish renegades swirl in and out of the chaos too.<br/><br/>Designer Brian Train has substantially revised and streamlined his original 2008 design of the same name, incorporating a newly-researched and more accurate order of battle with revised counter values, updated rules and a drastically revised map with a different scale.<br/><br/>Saddle up, comrades! Glory waits down the road!<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>176 counters, showing Polish, Soviet and foreign volunteer forces at brigade to division scale. <br/>1 22x17-inch map of eastern Poland and western Byelorussia, ground scale 20 miles per hex. <br/>1 Full-color Rulebook, typeset for easy squinting. <br/>2 Player Aid Cards to stare at while the other guy hogs the rulebook. <br/>An anachronistic Ziploc bag to keep the counters in one cat-proof location.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll also need to provide two six-sided dice for the Cause.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tala is a well-balanced native american warrior aided by the animal spirits in nature. She has a very unique ability on her character card which allows her to increase the utility in each of her attacks. The core of Tala's playstyle comes from her ability to be able to add secondary effects from her fighter cards to any cards she plays. This provides her with two significant advantages: first, adding more secondary effects obviously can make cards stronger in new unpredictable ways, second, she can change an action&rsquo;s effect after revealing them, allowing her to react appropriately to an unexpected turn of events. All of her fighter actions will be sure to find a use one way or another. Her mode Totemic Strength and her block, both compliment her playstyle, by allowing her to dig for fighter cards in her deck and return those that she has discarded. Due to the decisions that are presented when determining to discard cards for their effect or holding on to them to be used as an action, Tala is somewhat harder to master than the other fighters.<br/><br/>Victoria is a british-born aristocrat adopted into a clan of assassins, and currently Severina&rsquo;s most trusted advisor. With three soft style techniques to choose from, Victoria is speed and grace incarnate. The ability on her character card compliments the strong combo heavy nature of the soft style. Her psychic energy shurikens and kunai, along with the use of chi techniques, gives her just the right amount of ranged control. Moreover, her Kawarimi Block and Flickering Image actions give her the Traverse effect allowing her to instantly escape move or vanish, in a true ninja fashion. Her origins can be shown in Noblesse Oblige, which can double as a second copy of the Initiative Card, and Spiffing Kick is a brutally painful attack that will deplete your opponent's hand. Her truly special attack is Touch of Death, a very close limited but deadly attack.<br/><br/>The Tala vs Victoria Fighter Pack also comes with two sets of actions. The Pain technique from the Soft style is composed of a subtle array of options around the Trash effect, denying your opponent that perfect hand. The Internal technique from the Chi style brings more denial and versatility, along with high and low blasts, to any chi fighter&rsquo;s deck.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Conviction is a political satire card game where players deliver sweet judicial justice to Trump, his cronies, and other political characters. The game allows you and your friends to take matters into your own hands as prosecutors putting a wide variety of public figures on trial &ndash; from Ivanka and Jared to Betsy DeVos and Paul Ryan &ndash; in front of Lady Justice.<br/><br/>Over the course of four years (rounds), prosecutors take turns rolling the dice to put a Public Figure on trial. Rolling anything but doubles will convict the Public Figure and add them to that prosecutor's conviction pile. But if you do roll doubles, the Public Figure is acquitted and placed under the protection of Lady Justice. Each Public Figure has a point value &ndash; the more notorious they are, the more points they&rsquo;re worth. Trump and his inner circle, family, and comrades are the most valuable convictions; if you somehow convict a Public Figure not associated with Trump (e.g. Elizabeth Warren or the Muslim American), it&rsquo;ll cost you points. Whoever has the most points at the end wins the game and saves America!<br/><br/>Motion cards add an element of chance and strategy to the game, allowing prosecutors to manipulate the order of the trials or affect the proceedings in other specific ways. The names and illustrations for each Motion offer a tongue-in-cheek take on moments ripped from the headlines, referencing everything from &ldquo;alternative facts&rdquo; to Trump&rsquo;s promise to &ldquo;drain the swamp.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/>    * Guillotine - Conviction&rsquo;s theme is based on the United States political environment. Similar general card mechanics, though many new specific card effects have been invented. Conviction also introduced dice for randomness in trials to mirror reality. Game art is educational and humorous.<br/>    * Family Business - Both Conviction and Family Business are fast-paced card games, combining a shared play-area of character targets with an additional deck where players can manipulate proceedings as they jostle for advantages. However, Family Business is an elimination game instead of being points-based and Conviction does not contain any &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo;-style mechanics. Of course, both games feature a cast who&rsquo;d be better off in prison.<br/><br/>",

This electricity is distributed by great networks of transmission. It's a big business that moves billions every year.<br/><br/>El&eacute;trica invites you and your friends to take on the role of energy entrepreneurs. During the game, you need to increase the size of the map and construct lines to supply energy to cities. With each new line, you can complete contracts and receive victory points.<br/><br/>In more detail, following a set-up phase in which you each place a tile next to the starting spring river tile, on a turn you either (1) reveal and place a new tile or (2) build. The tile-laying works as you might expect, with tiles needing to be adjacent with the elements on each side matching. After placing a tile, you can place a marker on it to reserve it.<br/><br/>The game includes five types of constructions &mdash; hydroelectric, electrical substation, transmission tower, utility pole, and city &mdash; and to build one of them, you use workers on a tile and choose an available construction, following certain limitations on building. A hydroelectric construction must be placed on a tile with water, for example, while a city can't be built next to a transmission tower and three constructions can't be neighbors to one another on a triangle of tiles. When you build a functioning network, you can complete a contract and score points. Two constructions of the same type earns you 2 points, for example, while more complex combinations earn you more.<br/><br/>Once the final tile is revealed and placed, the game ends and whoever has the most points becomes an energy magnate!<br/><br/>",

Eventually, each advisor will feature a brand-new effect, allowing players access to the advisor&rsquo;s new reward while removing its existing reward for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>For example, the General originally focuses on battle, recruiting 2 soldiers and secretly looking at the top card of the enemy deck. The new reward tile replaces that effect with the reward to gain 2 gold or 2 wood or 2 stone.

Find an enemy craft&rsquo;s weaknesses to maximize the effectiveness of your attacks. Warcosm&rsquo;s game mechanics encourage such tactics without overwhelming you with endless rules. This permits each player to control six, ten, or even a few dozen ships for scalable battles. Once you get the hang of the rules with the included battle scenarios, use the ship construction rules to build your own fleets. Decide how to arm your ships, the degree and types of hull protection, the power of drive systems, and whether or not to equip them with a number of other subsystems. The fate of the galaxy is in your hands.

One day, however, the Emperor senses an ancient Evil bubbling up from beneath a long-forgotten ruin far to the north. The Evil begins to advance toward the Palace, its insatiable appetite for destruction drawing it to the center of the Emperor&rsquo;s power. As it approaches, it blights the land with Curses, sapping the Emperor&rsquo;s resources.<br/><br/>In this asymmetric cooperative card game for two players, one player is the Dragon, who collects resources from a hex map of the empire, while the second player is the Emperor, who uses the gathered resources to power spells and create Magic Items to combat the advancing enemy.

As you travel, you encounter incidents from the past, present, and future, all of which will be repeated over and over again. You have to know them all in order to solve them. Will you be able to solve the mysteries of this world?<br/><br/>In more detail, The Journey of My Future Self is a game of medium to short-term planning in which you have to constantly think about the best way to move your pawns, taking into account the numbers 1 to 6 that are randomly given and the numbers that are yet to be seen.<br/><br/>The small number of cards used in the game (30) makes it difficult to recover from mistakes, and a single mistake can make the game impossible to complete. For this reason, we encourage thought experiments (trial play). This is all part of the solitaire nature of the game, which is designed to be played slowly and deliberately, without disturbing other players, no matter how long you think. We want you to forget everything else and immerse yourself in the game!<br/><br/>You can manipulate the difficulty of the game to some extent by using any combination of &quot;items&quot; that change the basic rules. If you want to enjoy the atmosphere of the game, you can use more items to reduce the difficulty. If you are aiming for a solid high score, you can choose to barter the risks and benefits. This freedom of use makes the game replayable and flexible, allowing the player to adjust the difficulty according to their preferences.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Show your nerves of steel and ram your opponents with all you've got!<br/><br/>Crash'em is a demolition derby party game in which players need to crash into each other with their toy cars in order to score points.<br/><br/>Each round players receive new race cards, which they get to look at only once the race sounds start. They need to plan ahead a sequence of three actions within fifteen seconds, after which the cars are moved and possible crashes are resolved. As soon as someone's car is totalled, the game ends and the player who did the most damage wins.<br/><br/>The board also contains power-up fields, driving over such a field grants you a power-up card. Most of these cards are weapons, which makes it easier for you to damage your opponents. If you have damaged someone, you give that player one of your damage tokens. These tokens each show a car part that got broken during the crash, once you receive such a token the action that relates to that car part doesn't work anymore for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Up to 4 people can play, one controlling each German army group (North, Center, and South), and one playing Russia. Russia gets 5 factories to place in the cities of their choosing at the beginning of the game. Each produces a specific unit type (2 infantry, 1 armor, 1 fighter, 1 bomber). Germany can't see anything in Russian cities. Russia keeps its units and factories hidden from view on a city card. When Russian troops move out of cities, they are moved from the city card to the main board.<br/><br/>Railroads connect many of the Russian cities, which they can use to non-combat troops from city to city hidden from German view. Germany may try to cut the rails to limit Russian movement. Germany may scout Russian cities with a bomber to try and find out what is there, however, you can't scout and attack on the same army group's turn. Therefore, one army group must scout, and the next in the turn sequence can attack.<br/><br/>The German players must work closely together in this game. German troops may be transferred from one army group to another, and are then controlled by that new groups player. Because of the hidden units, it is a game of high tension on both sides. Most of the time Germany isn't really sure what Russia has in a city it is about to attack. And, most of the time, Russia has nowhere near enough troops to defend everything they need to defend. There is a lot of cat and mouse, educated guessing, and downright devious strategy (&quot;Hum, he would expect me to do this, so I'll do that. But he might be counting on me taking the less obvious choice...&quot;<br/><br/>The goal is for Germany to take Moscow, but to do this, they almost always need to take out the Russian factories which are producing units closer to the front. To make matters worse, Russia can dismantle, and move each of their factories once to another city. So, just when you think you have it all figured out... We're usually nervous wrecks by the end of a game...and usually ready to start another one right away!<br/><br/>",

But beware! Every Hero is out only for themselves and will try to swindle the winnings away from you and the rest of your group. Build your lootstash and take what is yours and theirs before they do. Are you ambitious enough to be the Lewt Ninja!<br/><br/>The game Lewt Ninja includes<br/><br/>1 Monster Deck &ndash; The monster deck consists of 40 unique monsters and Boss monsters, players draw monster cards during the beginning of their turn. Each monster card will direct players to draw loot cards or additional monster cards. Some monster cards will have special rules that will effect players and prevent different player actions from being used during the round<br/><br/>1 Loot Deck &ndash; The loot deck consists of 58 treasure, weapons, and armor cards. Players will find their heroes armor sets and legendary weapons along with other many treasures needed to collect in order to win the game.<br/><br/>1 Player Deck &ndash; The Player deck consists of 81 action cards; inside players will find Roll cards used to bid on the loot dropped by monsters. Roll cards have numeric values that simulate dice rolls, the player with the highest roll wins the treasure being rolled on. Along with the roll cards players will also find System and Player Action cards, these cards are used by players to stop players from rolling on treasure or steal treasure away from other players.<br/><br/>10 Player Mats &ndash; The player mats included with Lewt Ninja are 10 different heroes that players will assume the role of during game.  Players can play as either a Mystic, Wizard, Holy Monk, Ranger, or Shield Knight. There are 2 versions of each hero that allow players to play as same class during gameplay.  Each of the classes have special abilities that can be unlocked by obtaining their heroes magic armor. These abilities can be used by a player when they begin the round<br/><br/>To play Lewt Ninja have each player pick one of the hero class characters. Once everyone has picked a hero remove any armor set cards from the loot deck for any hero classes not in the game. Shuffle the 3 decks and place them in the center of the play area; deal out seven player action cards to all players and choose the player turn order.<br/><br/>Lewt Ninja has 3 phases of game play. <br/>At the beginning of the round players will draw one monster from the Monster Deck, this is called Pulling a monster. After pulling the monster the player read aloud the cards rule to everyone; players will then either draw a Loot Card or additional monster card.<br/><br/>The second phase of the round called Looting; the player who started the round will draw the number of Loot cards indicated on the card. Players will then play their Roll cards for the treasure dropped by the monster. If more than one loot card has been drawn players will roll only on one item at a time. Roll cards are placed face down and only revealed once everyone has played a card. The player with the highest roll card wins the treasure.<br/><br/>Phase three, the Ninja phase is final phase of the round. During this phase players can play any of the System or Player Action cards to steal away treasure or protect treasure they have won during the round. Some System and Player Action cards can be played at any time allowing player to block other players from rolling during the looting phase or other actions like visit the traveling merchant to buy treasure by selling back won treasure to the loot deck.<br/><br/>Once the round has been completed all players will draw a new card from the player deck and move to the next player in the turn order.<br/><br/>To win the game players must collect all 8 pieces of their armor, winning all a pieces is an automatic win the game. Should a hero lose any pieces of the armor to another player they still have a chance to win. Players will then need to steel away armor from other players and collect all of the loot cards they can. Once the final loot card has been one the player who has the most loot is the winner.<br/><br/>Lewt Ninja also has two other game modes<br/><br/>Legendary Mode: <br/>In this mode of the game Players will not only need to win their 8 armor piece set but will need to also win their classes legendary weapon.<br/><br/>Vote to Kick <br/>Remove all of the all non-set loot from the Loot Deck. The object of Vote to Kick is to eliminate players from the game by stealing their Armor Set pieces. A Player is eliminated from the game when another player owns 3 pieces of the other player's class armor.<br/><br/>",

You get one of these new cards every time you perform a Build action, whether it's a city or monument. They give powerful bonuses when played, especially if you combine several of the same type. However, your civilization will now have to deal with Decline, which appears as a new token on the Influence track.<br/>Glory cars cost Decline points to play, and you Decline score will be subtracted from your influence score at the end of each age. You'll have to be careful about how many Glory cars you use to avoid losing to many points...<br/><br/>The Corruption expansion adds Domination tiles to the game which replace the cards from the core box. Each tile appeals an effect to the Knowledge Domain it is assigned to. These are drawn randomly at the start of the game but, at the end of each Age, players will be able to reassign them, which those possessing the highest Corruption score going first. Their effect can be good or bad, affecting the cost or efficiency of certain actions or only coming into play at the end of an Age. Domination tiles affect all players for the following Age, so you can choose to play them to aid you in your efforts of to hinder your opponents.<br/><br/>Rise and Fall opens up a wealth of new strategic possibilities. Glory and Decline gives you the opportunity to play powerful cards that will bolster your nation if you can pay the price, and corruption gives the end of age phase an exciting new twist with increased player interaction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Xeno is an abstract game of the &quot;Laskers&quot; (stacking pieces) family which is played on the surface of a sphere.  The game &quot;board&quot; is a plastic sphere with Velcro squares attached to it, and the pieces are also Velcro, so they stick to the squares and each other.<br/><br/>The game was apparently at times known as Obol, The Game of O, or O*, and was manufactured as early as 1988 though the last version was made in 1991. The standard game is on a 24-square sphere.  A 12-square sphere was also available, the rulebook advertises a 30-square sphere, and there are indications that at one point they had a 36-square sphere, though there is no confirmation any of the larger sizes were ever available for sale.  Also, a sphere with many more squares (120?) exists only in prototype form.<br/><br/>The rulebook includes rules for other games, including a checkers variant and a (credited) version of Sid Sackson's Focus for the spherical board.<br/><br/><br/>        I can confirm that at least 5 copies of a 30-ball were sold at one game convention in Los Angeles (I got one of them). I can also confirm seeing a much, MUCH larger ball -- several feet in diameter -- with lots of spaces and a 4 (5?) person game in progress (same convention). ~~~~<br/><br/><br/><br/>        I can also confirm having purchased one of those 30-balls. Sadly, it was lost in a move, and I want to replace it. ~~~~<br/><br/><br/>",

You win or lose votes depending on whether you are successful or not.<br/><br/>Players roll one or two dice to advance their marker on the board and must take different actions depending on the type of square on which they land. If they land on an Issue square, they have a full turn to form an opinion before having to convince their friends to support their view. If they land on a Scandal square, they must talk their way out of that scandal immediately. After a discussion, players vote on the Issue or Scandal. There are five possible outcomes: unanimous support, unanimous oppose, majority support, majority oppose and split decision. The player dealing with the Issue or Scandal must roll three colored dice. He will score or lose points on one or all dice according to the outcome of the vote.<br/><br/>To win the game, players move around the outer portion of the board, known as the House, to gain votes in Green, Red and Blue categories. When a minimum number of votes for each is won (8 Green, 6 Red and 2 Blue), a player may advance into the Inner Circle, known as the Ministry. Once a player is in the Ministry, they continue to accumulate votes until they have enough to become a Candidate (16 Green, 12 Red and 4 Blue) but the games becomes more difficult. When there are two Candidates, only one can win. The winner is the player who can Scamboozle a majority of other players to vote for them as the new Prime Minister.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/>What is Scamboozling?<br/>It is an opportunity for you to be as outrageous or ridiculous in your opinions as you dare. A chance to promise or say anything that will convince your friends to vote to support your opinion.<br/><br/>This is the game that Canadians have been waiting for. You have experienced politicians doing it to you. Now here's your chance to Scamboozle your friends to elect you as the new Prime Minister!<br/><br/>",

Each player is randomly assigned one of twenty 'itineraries', listing the six cities of the world they must visit in any order before returning to New York - the first player to reach New York after touching all cities on his/her itinerary wins.<br/><br/>Travel is handled by a roll of a die which determines which of five travel decks (Walk, Car, Train, Ship, Plane) the player must draw from and execute - most cards dictate a number of kilometers that the player may move (subject to terrain - ships travel by sea, trains/cars/walk by land).  The player drives a pushpin into the map at his/her destination and wraps a like-coloured thread around it - so as the game progresses, a crisscrossing network of coloured pushpins and thread show the paths that each player has traveled.<br/><br/>",

The Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment had captured several strategic positions on the crest of Hill 700, including seven pillboxes, and had moved light and heavy machine guns into the American trenches and pillboxes. Now the Japanese were in position to put fire on the American supply routes beyond the hill. The Japanese would have to be thrown off the hill &mdash; the only question was how. <br/>On the morning of March 9, the Buckeyes launched several scattered counterattacks with no results. At noon, the 145th Infantry made its first major effort, sending elements of two battalions up the hills with tank support. However, the tanks could not operate on the hill and the Buckeyes could only seize a few pillboxes. Air and artillery bombardment, including point blank fire,could not dislodge the Japanese. At 1700 on March 10, the two battalions attacked again, making some progress, but on March 11 the Japanese counterattacked, taking another pillbox at heavy expense. The 145th&rsquo;s commander, Colonel Whitcomb, was relieved for &ldquo;extreme battle fatigue&rdquo;. <br/> New Georgia Island, July 18, 1943.<br/>The American assault on New Georgia was spearheaded by the 43rd ID, with the Buckeyes of the 37th ID in reserve. The 43rd ID, as untried as the 37th, ran into difficulties in its drive towards Munda Airfield and began to fall apart. The 37th ID was committed in mid-July. However, in addition to stopping the American advance, Japanese General Noburo Sasaki sent infiltrating units to cut the Munda Trail, which served as the tenuous U.S. supply line from the far away beachhead. One group of Japanese hit the rear-echelon defenders of a supply and ammo dump at Parachute Drop, defended by the newly arrived Ammunition and Anti-Tank Platoons of the 1st Battalion, 145th Infantry.<br/> Mark Pitcavage's Buckeyes!:<br/>The 37th (Buckeye) Infantry Division on New Georgia and Bougainville in 1943-44<br/>The Pacific Theater at its Best<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Expands Warhammer Ancient Battles<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/>In the West, Rome may have fallen, but in the East, Byzantium ensured the Roman values and spirit endured for another 1000 years.<br/><br/>This 128-page sourcebook contains an historical overview of the period and covers events from 527 to 1204 A.D. During this period we see the rise of importance of the cavalryman on the field of battle and this book reflects that development as Byzantium repeatedly struggled and triumphed.<br/><br/>Featured within this book are detailed army lists including:<br/><br/><br/>     Early Byzantines 527-660 AD - including the armies of Justinian and Heraclius. <br/>     Germanic Kingdoms 442-800 AD - including the armies of the Ostrogoths and Lombards. <br/>     Sassanid Persians 226-649 AD - including armies for the early and later Sassanid period. <br/>     Steppe Nomads 558-1200 AD - including the armies of the Magyars and Penchenegs. <br/>     Thematic Byzantines 660- 1042 AD - including the armies of the Isaurian and Macedonian dynasties. <br/>     Bulgars and Slavs 643- 1018 AD - including the armies of the early and later Bulgars. <br/>     Early Caliphates 632- 1073 AD - including the armies of the Arab Conquest and Abbasids. <br/>     The Rus 750-1250 AD - including the armies of the Early Pagan and Great Rus. <br/>     Later Byzantines1042-1185 AD - including the armies of the Komnenian dynasty. <br/><br/><br/>Using these 9 lists and appendixes you can create over 35 different variations of armies from the Byzantine period. Also included are some Orders of Battle for some famous encounters from the period including:<br/><br/><br/>     The Battle of Dara 530 AD. <br/>     The Battle of Yarmuk 636 AD. <br/>     The Battle of Dorostolon 971 AD. <br/>    The Battle of Manizkert 1071 AD. <br/><br/><br/>The book also contains a 16-page full-color section portraying the armies of the time and a wealth of illustrations and color maps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>HP Lovecraft wrote about the reanimation of corpses when my Flapper Grandmother was doing the Charleston with the boy in the band (Grand Dad). In this intermediate level game you take Lovecraft&rsquo;s start and make your own story. First you find clues that reveal what is going on. Once the plot is outed you make a choice. Am I good or evil? Good guys try to stop plots, evil ones help them succeed. You never know whose side anyone is on till the end game.<br/><br/>If you like Horror Board Games you&rsquo;ll love this game!<br/><br/>July 2009<br/><br/>Dead Man on Campus is an Engle Matrix Game that allows you to do real time story telling in a boardgame. Each player champions one of the characters at Miskatonic University in 1923. The game host reads an opening hook about how bodies have gone missing from the graveyard. At this point the players take over telling the tale. Each turn a player buys the right to make the next action in the game. They make up a short scene and pick another player to be their referee. The ref sets the &quot;to happen&quot; roll and the player rolls. It either happens and is written down by the players or doesn't. If players like they can buy the right to make a counter-argument to the first players action. A dice rolling contest settles what happens. As you see the rules are very simple but they allow a completely unique game every time.<br/><br/>Players quickly learn how to play - it only takes a turn or two and then never need to look at the rules again. It does take creativity though. If you don't like making stuff up then this is not the game for you but if you do like quick paced back and forth creation then you'll love it.<br/><br/>The boxed board game comes with a hard back board that is color and varnished but I must say that these are hand crafted by the game maker so this is more an art product than a slick made in China game. The game uses wooden counters with stickers but as you wish they can be replaced by metal figures. Cthulhu figures work great!<br/><br/>",

The rules aim to reproduce the challenges presented by tactical combat throughout the 1939-45 war, while also permitting the use of the vast array of vehicles and equipment that supported the infantryman throughout the conflict.The basic game tactical unit is therefore the infantry section or squad supported by armoured fighting vehicles, artillery and ground attack aircraft.The rules are written for use with 15mm or 20mm figures, though should work perfectly well for smaller scales.<br/><br/>",

In addition, using the Warchest Point System, player groups may choose what direction the campaign takes.<br/><br/>The Chaos Campaign rules are designed to allow players to customize campaigns from the Jihad Series of Scenario books and a new set of campaign books designed specifically for the Chaos Campaign system.<br/><br/>The books in this series are:<br/><br/>     Jihad Turning Points: Luthien fleshes out the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks.

The game dates to the 15th century and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the discovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant, if not board game, ever. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves. It was never a popular game; indeed, a single production of half a dozen game sets in the early 17th century was a notable event.<br/><br/>Like other large-board variants, but unlike standard Shogi, the game is played without drops, and uses a promotion-by-capture rule.<br/><br/>Tai Shogi is a gargantuan of a game both in terms of strategy and playing time. A serious game of Tai will require several long sessions to complete and may need over 1000 -moves per player. The game is simply too big to be played strategically, and therefore the game typically proceeds as a series of local skirmishes as both players try to develop their pieces and improve their position. Flat out rapid play will typically take at least three days (takes an hour or so to setup!).<br/><br/>While most of the 101 different pieces in Tai Shogi are also found in other variants, one unique feature of Tai is the presence right from the beginning of the game of the all powerful Emperors.<br/><br/>Tai Shogi is played on a board of 25 x 25 squares and each player has 177 pieces (including 25 pawns) ! A unique feature of Tai Shogi is the presence right from the start of the game of the all powerful Emperors. The Emperor has the greatest power of any piece in any of the Shogi variants as it may move in one turn to almost any square on the board, jumping over any number of pieces of either side in the process.<br/><br/>While you might think that the power of the Emperors would have a great impact on the course of the game, their powers tend to offset each other. It should be noted that any otherwise unprotected piece is always protected by its own Emperor.<br/><br/>",

But now rumors of safe zones are spreading through the land. They say the military has taken back large areas and local radio broadcasts are urging survivors to head to these safe havens.<br/><br/>But not everyone wants to go.<br/><br/>Groups of survivors have their own &quot;safe&quot; areas under their control. They are self-sufficient and doing okay. Not great, but okay. And they like their new found freedom and look forward to finding like-minded recruits. They're making the best of a bad situation.<br/><br/>But they're not alone. Gangs of lawless people have their own areas under control. These gangs patrol the highways looking for loot, prey, and in some cases new recruits. They like things just the way they are.<br/><br/>In Haven you have three options:<br/><br/><br/>    MILITARY - We allow you to command military units by introducing you to better weapons, new equipment, and a list of missions for you to play. It's time to kill some Zombies and pacify the area.<br/>    SURVIVOR - We provide you with Nowhere Nevada, a self-sufficient community that you can explore, trade, and perhaps recruit from it. <br/>    GANGER - We give you a ready made gang, place to live, and opportunities to grow your power.<br/><br/><br/>It's all up to you.<br/><br/>All Things Zombie: Haven is a supplement.

        "description": "Cuboid is a game of skill for two players, to be played with a set of NestorTiles.  The colours of the tiles are significant, but the numbers are ignored.<br/><br/>Each player builds a creature (the Oid) by assembling 6 differently coloured tiles to make a cube.<br/><br/>The remaining 48 tiles are shuffled, and put together randomly to make a 7x7 board, with one gap in the centre.<br/><br/>Starting with the second player, each player puts their opponent's Oid on the board, in an orientation of their choice.<br/><br/>The game begins.  In each turn, players perform the following actions, in order, for each Oid they have on the board:<br/><br/>Eating: if the colour on top of the Oid matches the colour of their tile, the Oid eats that tile.<br/> Movement: the Oid moves in any orthogonal direction, by (a) sliding over any number of adjacent empty spaces, then (b) rolling onto the first tile it encounters. Oids cannot move onto or past other Oids.<br/><br/>Breeding: if the player's Oids have eaten six tiles, they breed.  Assemble a new Oid, and have the opponent place it on the board next to an adjacent Oid.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more moves are possible.  The player with the most tiles, either as parts or in Oids, is the winner.<br/><br/>Cuboid is an entry in the 1st Nestortiles competition, here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/580556/1st-nestortiles-game-design-contest-by-nestorgames\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/580556/1st-nestortiles-g...</a><br/><br/>Source: author<br/><br/>",

Now emerging from the ruins of a short-lived alliance and a bloody civil war, a bold new identity has taken hold of the people united under the mighty fist of House Steiner.<br/><br/>Kicking off a new series, Handbook: House Steiner brings the essential history, politics and culture of one of the Inner Sphere's most powerful nations to life for a new generation of Classic BattleTech players. More than a mere sourcebook, Handbook: House Steiner provides rules for both Classic BattleTech and Classic BattleTech RPG campaigns, including new personal equipment, creatures, life paths, and more - all tailored for players and campaigns based on the Lyran state!<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>The first of the new Handbook series produced by FanPro, this book is both an update to the earlier House Steiner: The Lyran Commonwealth and a companion volume to the Field Manual: Lyran Alliance. Where the Field Manual concentrates on the Lyran military, Handbook: House Steiner gives much more detail about the social structure of the Lyran Alliance, together with additional paths and options for BattleTech roleplaying game characters who hail from the Alliance/Commonwealth. The Handbook also includes some new rules and terrain types for BattleTech, as well as a sprinkling of new units.<br/><br/>",

The larger grid accommodates 8 pieces each, numbered 1 through 8, for the two-player game and comes with 4 octahedral dice that let you roll up to the number 8.<br/><br/>On the other side of the board there is a 3-player version accommodating a simultaneous 3 player game with the original 6 pieces.<br/><br/>MANOOVER PLUS FOR THREE PLAYERS:<br/><br/>To play the three-player game, use the side of the Manoover Plus board that has three goals. The players are known as &ldquo;Red,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Green,&rdquo; and each has six pieces of his color.<br/><br/>To start a game, each player throws one die, and the one throwing the highest number goes first. If two or more players tie with the same high number, then those who tie throw again. After the first player takes his turn, the turn proceeds clockwise around the board.<br/><br/>The three-player game is generally the same as the game for two players. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of a control phase where one player rolls the dice that corresponds to the numbers on each of their pieces. For each number rolled they are allowed to move the piece in the direction it is facing or turn the piece one to the right or left. If a piece has been pushed/moved off the board or has already been scored the player gets one chance to re-roll that die. This is then followed by an automatic phase where all of the player's pieces move once in the direction it is facing regardless of consequence. Each player tries to get pieces (of any color) to enter his hexagonal goal near the center of the board.<br/><br/>MANOOVER PLUS FOR TWO PLAYERS:<br/><br/>This is the game Kate Jones created on the suggestion of a customer who liked the standard version but wanted something more complex. Each player has eight pieces instead of six, and the players throw four 8-sided dice to determine which four pieces to move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Information supplied by kind permission of Matthew Turner of Warwick University:<br/><br/>Spoof is a game of chance (but not without strategy) often played in a pub to establish who buys the next round. It has the quirky character that it is a game without a winner, just a loser. Basically it is a guessing game involving coins. Each player draws some number of coins between zero and three from their pocket and holds them concealed within a clenched hand. If more than three are held this is deemed to count as three. The denomination of the coin is irrelevant, its just the number that counts. The idea is then to take turns to guess the combined total number contained in all the players' hands. Its that easy ! One player starts by making a guess ('call' or 'shout') and then the guesses proceed clockwise until all have guessed a number that hasn't previously been taken. This is a single round of the game. All players then reveal their coins, a total is calculated (and checked!) and someone may be 'out' if they chose the exact number (there are no prizes for nearly). If this happens the not-loser will then sit out the remaining rounds of this particular game and the others will play more rounds in the same way until only two players are left. The player who loses this last round buys the drinks. If nobody guessed the correct number in any given round then the round is played again. Every time a round is played the first person to call rotates clockwise to the next available player.<br/><br/>",

The game employs the popular card-driven mechanics of such well-known games as Twilight Struggle and 1960: The Making of the President. Representing the Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the players pursue strategies to ratify or defeat the Constitution.  The Federalists win if nine states ratifiy the Constitution.  The Anti-Federalists win if five states refuse to ratify.<br/><br/>The game places a premium on hand management and strategic planning by providing players with the tools to build powerful hands of cards over consecutive turns.  After players become familiar with the deck of cards, playing time should be around 2 hours.<br/><br/>",

With this game, you should be able to re-create a match of soccer complete with all the decisions that the coach would make.  You decide who to dress and who to scratch.  You decide who to start and who to save as a substitute.  You name the starting keeper.  There are also plenty of &lsquo;in game&rsquo; decisions to make.  Do I take a shot from the scoring zone, or try to penetrate for a better scoring chance.  If the game is tied late in the second half, do I play conservative, or do I play aggressive and go for the win?  My star midfielder just collapsed due to heat exhaustion.  How do I replace his offense?  How do I replace his defense?  Once you have a solid understanding of the cards, charts, and gameplay, you should be able to play a full regulation match in about thirty minutes.<br/>     <br/>The game is played using three ten sided dice and player cards that represent their abilities on the pitch.  Some players can actually 'dig deep' in certain game situations to tilt the scales in their favor.  It's all here as you attempt to bring glory to your squad.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dang It Dice are a simple variation on standard six sided dice - the only difference is that two of their sides have their pips in a different colour.  There are three types of Dang It - the first has the numbers 1 &amp; 6 coloured differently, the second has the 2 &amp; 5 and the third has 3 &amp; 4 in a different colour.<br/><br/>With them you can play the game 'Dang'. 'Dang' is a push your luck game played over 10 rounds. At the start of each round, a card is drawn at random, showing a value of between 9 &amp; 22. On a player's turn, they roll 4 dice, trying to maximise the sum of the white pips before the sum of the black pips exceeds the number on the card. Dice with white pips can be rerolled but those with black must be kept. After each throw, the player chooses to either continue rolling or bank their total, so ending their turn. But if the sum of the black pips exceeds the number on the card, they have bust and score nothing for this round. It's a game that can be taught in minutes and takes no more than 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>But what Dang It Dice also allow you to do is play existing games with them, so creating an interesting slant on the original. For example we've played Yahtzee with them, changing the rules so that dice with black faces count for 2 of that number. Similarly you could play Snakes and Ladders with a single Dang It, moving backwards if the black face falls uppermost. We've also found that they encourage players to invent their own games with them. Thus Dang It Dice are more than just the 15 dice - they are [to coin a well used cliche] a toolkit for your imagination.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Some cute little people have invaded the land, and when they get together in groups of four they trigger strange symptoms in humans. Apparently, this game is so much fun that you may lose control of your faculties, causing others to chant &quot;Zig! Zag!&quot;<br/><br/>ZigZag is a partnership game (with variants for two and three players) that is played with a deck of 93 cards. Of those cards, 64 show the aforementioned cute little people, and each one of these cards has three characteristics: a person representing one of the four elements, a landscape, and an accessory (sunglasses, a suitcase, etc.)<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get sets of four cards with a single characteristic (Zig) or two characteristics (Zag) in common. To finish a round, it is necessary to complete a zig, a zag, a double zig, or a zig and a zag. Each combination is allowed only once, and the first partnership to complete all four wins. When a player has completed a set, he must give a pre-arranged signal to his partner, who must then announce what type of set has been completed out loud. If a signal is mistaken, both partners must discard their cards, draw new hands, and play on.<br/><br/>Everyone plays at the same time, exchanging cards with those cards in the center of the table. Beware as the opposing team will do all they can to prevent you from achieving your goal, including using some of the 17 special cards that do things like stop you from collecting a set with a certain characteristic or force an exchange of hands.<br/><br/>In the two- to three-player variant of ZigZag, each player receives one of twelve constraint cards, which limits the types of sets they can collect.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players can also activate their characters in play to find muffins or attack characters, using dice to determine the outcome of each action.<br/><br/>Each card represents a character, which has two values: Life and Power. The Life value represents how much damage the character can take before dying, and also how many dies the characters uses when finding muffins or attacking other characters.<br/>The Power value determines how difficult it is to find a muffin or to cause damage to a target. Furthermore, each character has an unique ability that affects the game in many different ways.<br/><br/>",

        "description": " As Tears Go By: Operation Starlite is an introductory level game on the battles of US Marines and the NLF in I Corps of Vietnam in August of 1965.<br/><br/>The Battles of Operation Starlite were the first large-scale fights waged by the Marine Corps in Vietnam. A spy informed the South Vietnamese I Corps commander that an attack on the US Marine Base at Chu Lai by the NLF&rsquo;s (National Liberation Front) 1st Regiment was imminent. The Marine&rsquo;s commander, Lt. General Lewis W. Walt convinced his superiors that the best defense was a pre-emptive attack. He also decided against informing or working with his South Vietnamese counterpart, as past intelligence leaks led to the elusive Viet Cong disappearing in the face of the American&rsquo;s probes and attacks.<br/><br/>Operation Starlite depended upon the coordination of amphibious landed troops of the Marine&rsquo;s 3/3 Battalion while those of the 1/7 marched from the north to serve as the &ldquo;anvil&rdquo;. The &ldquo;hammer blows&rdquo; would be delivered by artillery, air and naval support strikes, as well as the 2/4 battalion that would be airlifted into battle. It was hoped that surrounding the VC with multiple threats would trap and force them to do battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In our game Island of Death, we studied Axis plans to invade the British-held island of Malta in 1942 by a combined airborne and amphibious attack. In the expansion book Fortress Malta we went into even more depth on those plans, and also looked at a number of alternatives including a daring 1940 plan for an Italian invasion and a German airborne attack in 1941.<br/><br/>Had any of those plans succeeded, the Axis powers had prepared for the occupation as well. The Italian XVI Corps, consisting of the 26th &ldquo;Assieta&rdquo; and 54th &ldquo;Napoli&rdquo; infantry divisions, would remain on the island as its garrison, together with some units of the Royal Italian Navy (chiefly coast-defense artillery). That would provide an occupation force roughly the same size as the wartime British garrison, as Italian infantry divisions were smaller than their British counterparts.<br/><br/>The Allies appear to have had no well-developed plans to re-take the island in the event of its fall. Britain held Malta and had no intention of surrendering it, nor did the Maltese. But we can make an informed guess as to what formations would have been available for a counter-invasion of Malta, and that&rsquo;s the basis of Island of Death: Return to Malta.<br/><br/>Return to Malta has 180 new playing pieces representing the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, the Polish Parachute Brigade, the U.S. Marine Corps&rsquo; 2nd Provisional Brigade and two small brigades of Royal Marines. Their task is simple: take Malta back from the Italians.<br/><br/>Return to Malta is not a complete game: Ownership of Island of Death and Fortress Malta (and only those two items) is necessary to play all of the four scenarios included.<br/><br/><br/>Note: This product is a digital download.

        "description": "Commit the Garde! is intended to simulate battles of the Napoleonic wars on the grandest of scales.  Entire epic battles are represented; no longer must the players extrapolate the results of the entire battle of Waterloo based upon their game's recreation of the fight for the garden gate at Hougoumont. Players represent the highest level leaders in any given battle, and as such make the decisions that will shape the entire battle. Gone are the minutiae which their historical counterparts left to their subordinates, your focus is on your army's brigades, not on the battalions and squadrons.<br/><br/>Decisions made by lower level officers are abstracted into the mechanics of the game, players should understand that there is someone at the lower level who should be taking care of those details (spacing of battalions and squadrons, deployment of skirmishers, sighting of artillery sections, availability of spare ammunition, etc).  Like it or not the real commanders had to trust subordinates to do their duty well. Often these abstract subordinates will make mistakes (represented by bad dice rolls), whether or not your subordinate's failure is catastrophic to your plan will depend on the allowances you have made for that possibility. This of course is a good reason to have plenty of reserves available.<br/><br/>And speaking of reserves, the most unique aspect of Commit the Garde! is the use of off-table reserves.  No longer can your opponent see the deployment of your entire army. The location of your reserves is not determined until you commit them to the battle, at which time you place them where you want them (with limitations based upon distance from your Army HQ and proximity of enemy forces). The skill of your army commander and staff determine how effectively you can commit your reserves.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex-grid map; the reason for this is to remove the ambiguities of &quot;free movement&quot; common to most miniature rules.  With hexes there is no doubt about a unit's location, it's facing, and what the range is to any other unit on the battlefield.  The intent with this approach is to make this a game/simulation of decisions, not of inches.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns laying higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on a stack then they must pick up the stack. If a player lays a set or run of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game. Players count up the scores of all of the cards they have captured minus all of the cards they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>Ghost Hunter: Monsters is a standalone game but it is also one of a series of compatible Ghost Hunter decks.

This hampered British strategic mobility and eventually led to the surrender at Yorktown (compared to the easy evacuation of Boston), as well as the threat of losing more Caribbean colonies making the war too costly for the British.<br/><br/>",

But look out! - poachers and illegal loggers are common visitors eager to hunt your animals and cut down your trees. Try to achieve a balance in your ecosystem where predators need to eat prey, prey need trees, and fish need rivers to survive. Forestation's realistic illustrations and amazing game-play will make you want to create the best forest possible to save wildlife from extinction! Forestation is intended for nature-lovers looking for a strategic challenge.<br/><br/>Forestation is based on your workers taking actions to build a forest. You may raise funds, purchase land, buy seeds, plant trees, and choose from a host of other options to help build your forest.In the mean time, animals migrate into your forest and breed, and predators eat prey. The game ends after 4 game-years and at this time each player will have created a forest full of animals in front of them. Each forest is scored according to size and diversity to see who wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Keep your varieties balanced to have the coolest house on the flock! In the game, players alternate taking turns, starting with whoever most recently flew. On your turn:<br/><br/><br/>    Choose one card that is next to the pawn. Take that card into your area, called your birdhouse. Move the pawn into the space left behind by that card.<br/>    If you divide the flock, place the group with fewer cards on the discard pile. If they are of equal quantity, you decide which group to discard.<br/>    If the pawn is next to only one card, take that card as well. Continue until the pawn is next to at least two cards. <br/><br/><br/>The game ends when no more cards remain to be claimed. At the end of the game, each player may discard one card from their birdhouse to the discard pile. Check which type of bird appears most frequently in your birdhouse. Resolve the scoring effect of each card that is part of that majority. If two or more types are tied for majority, resolve the scoring effect of each of those cards, so try to keep the types balanced so that you can score as many of your cards as possible.<br/><br/>By combining two Plume decks, you can have up to four players compete in the same game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eldril Sidewinder has played Blood Bowl as long as most can remember, partly due to the incredibly long life span of his race, but mainly thanks to his sheer skill on the pitch. The secret of his success (and longevity) lies in his belonging to a singular class within Wood Elf and Sea Elf society &ndash; the Wardancers. These warriors combine athleticism and deadly skill, and are capable of dashing through a melee, weaving and leaping about their opponents while transfixing them with their grace such that foes are unable to react or even to think clearly. So beguiling are the movements of a skilled Wardancer that some claim it to be some manner of boon from the dark gods, a misconception that Sidewinder is ever keen to refute.<br/><br/>Should you be looking high and low for a Star Player for your Dark Elf, Wood Elf, High Elf or Elven Union Blood Bowl team &ndash; you can stop looking because here, in the lithe shape of Eldril Sidewinder, is one! Bemohawked and lightly armoured &ndash; clad in a leather harness and shoulder protector, gauntlets, pants and running shoes (with some pretty hefty studs in the soles, no doubt ready to splinter the shins of all who stand before him), Edril is a prime example of the sort of cheekbones and jawline you only get from Elves. His rules are available in Blood Bowl Death Zone Season One.<br/><br/>This resin kit is supplied with a 32mm Blood Bowl base.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Players take the role of the healer in a pickup group of ... just the worst party of randoms. Players can pick from three healer classes with unique skills to keep their allies alive against tough boss battles.<br/><br/>Turns have two phases: the boss phase and the healer phase. In the boss phase, players draw an action card from the boss's card deck. These cards can be attacks, summoned minions, or events of your party doing something stupid. These will cause your party to lose health.<br/><br/>During the healer phase, you respond with the healing spell cards in your hand. From your standard Heal over Time spells and direct healing spells, to shields and resurrection spells, each of the three healer classes has plenty of tools to help restore your allies. Once spells are played, they go on a cooldown where you cannot use them for some time. An important facet of the strategy is thinking ahead to have the right spell ready at the right time.<br/><br/>Keep your allies from dying (to the boss or to their own stupidity) and victory will be yours!<br/><br/>Good luck. Have fun.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Are you clever enough to overcome the luck of the dice?<br/><br/>Designed as part of the 2018 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players gather kitties from the clowder; then trade, steal, and get even more kitties. Watch out for Crazy Kitty Clashes!<br/><br/>Before starting, spread all of the kitty cards in the center of the table and each player will take 3 kitties. These are placed face down in front of the player. Shuffle the action cards and place then in a pile near the kitty cards.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they will draw one action card. If it is green, play right away and do what it says (have a kitty clash, look at another player's kitties, etc). If it is blue, the player will hold on to the card until they are involved in a kitty clash. Blue cards help in kitty clashes to give an extra die, end the clash, roll again if you don't win, etc.<br/><br/>When a player draws the pink Sleepy Time card, the round ends and all players count up the number of points on all their kitties. The player with the most points wins. Rules suggest playing 5 rounds.<br/><br/>",

For all player counts the setup is identical. There is a four by four grid of tiles with the divers on the four center spots and the sharks on the outside. For the basic game only the four sharks in the corners are hungry (hungry side face up). In turn order players place cards to either move the divers, the sharks or the shark cage. The cards come in four color variants - on each side of the grid only cards of the same color can be played. In the beginning you can place any color on any side. Later on, if a color is already present at one side, cards of the same color must be played on that side. If the third card is placed on a side, the sharks on that side attack. Unless a player is protected by a shark cage or by playing a harpoon as a reaction, the shark succeeds. If this is the first successful attack, the diver tile is flipped. If it is already flipped, this player loses and all the other players - and the sharks - win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The tiles are all 2x3 but their contents vary wildly, and placement rules just require that every block be supported. The ultimate shape of your castle is up to you!<br/><br/>There are four main ways to earn points: you can have the highest or second highest roof in each of three colors, you can build a bridge that spans two tiles, you can place a castle resident at their preferred height, and you can add a new shape of windows to your castle. These goals interact in interesting ways - for example, to get roof points you want a very high castle, but most residents prefer relatively low levels of the castle.<br/><br/>Normally you place one tile each round, but if you place a colored toy block next to another colored toy block you get to place one extra tile on your turn. This can be used to take tiles from the shared stock in quick succession or to make a surprise play.<br/><br/>Once someone has played their 15th tile, play continues until everyone has had the same number of turns before entering final scoring. The game is flexible and can be played as a casual game with children and families, but the scoring and high degree of freedom leave plenty of room for serious play. What kind of castle will you make?<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Avoid bankruptcy, hopelessness, or over-pollution by playing real world solutions in the face of familiar climate events.<br/><br/>Green House is a turn-based cooperative card game where each player starts by drawing and revealing a climate event card (like hurricanes, disease outbreaks, wildfires, etc.) Then playing a climate solution (called an action card) from their hand. Both event cards and action cards affect a communal pool of resources including greenhouse gas tokens, money tokens, and hope tokens.<br/><br/>Players lose together if they collect too many greenhouse gas tokens, of if they run out of money, hope, or event cards. They win together if they eliminate all the greenhouse gas tokens in the game. Some action cards have a momentum icon, indicating that players can chain them together to increase positive game effects.<br/><br/>There are 4 different variants including zero and single player versions for solo play, and a semi-cooperative role-playing version where players can play as different roles (family, corporation, government, non-profit) with different starting money allocations, action card draw piles, and special abilities that modify game play. In the semi-cooperative role-play version, players can run out of money independently, eliminating them from the game while others play on. This version invites negotiation and the strategic use of variable player powers.<br/><br/>description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/><br/>This booklet represents on character in the Lost Worlds series of fantasy combat games.  Each character in this series can interact with every other; each has strengths and weaknesses which you will discover as you and your friends collect them.<br/><br/>(From the booklet:  Lost Worlds: Man in Chainmail with Sword and Shield)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;1942: Battle for the Mediterranean&quot; is a two-player wargame simulation of the naval operations in the Mediterranean in January-October 1942. The objective in the game is to sink the largest possible number of enemy warships and enemy shipping, and to keep supplied their respective ground forces and bases in North Africa (for the Axis) and Malta (for the Allies).<br/><br/>Combat units represent individual capital ships (battleships, battlecruisers, heavy cruisers, light cruisers, fleet carriers, light carriers), destroyer or smaller escort divisions of 2-3 ships, individual submarines, groups of merchant ships and escorts vessels, and aircraft squadrons of 20-25 planes.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents 1 month of naval operations. The campaign game covers 10 game turns, from January to October 1942. There are also shorter 1-turn scenarios simulating the major convoy battles of the 1942 campaign: Second Sirte, Harpoon/Vigorous (Battaglia di Mezzo Giugno), or Pedestal (Battaglia di Mezzo Agosto).<br/><br/>",

The first player places a disc of her colour on any empty space of that sub-board.<br/><br/>From now on, starting with the second player, players alternate turns placing a disc of their colour on an empty space of the board in a sub-board that corresponds with the position of the disc just placed by their opponent within the sub-board it&rsquo;s been placed.<br/><br/>If this is not possible, then the player can place the disc on any sub-board (this happens once per game at most).<br/><br/>Note: One of the cells of each sub-board maps to the sub-board it&rsquo;s in. These are called &lsquo;autocells&rsquo; and are marked with a dot for clarity.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/><br/>If, at the end of your turn, both sides of your colour are connected by a continuous chain of discs of your colour you immediately win the game (just like in HEX).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Cards not in Melds or Lay-offs are called Deadwood and might add points to your opponent&rsquo;s score.<br/><br/>There are 4 different Melds available: Sets, Runs, Stashes, and Queen&rsquo;s Diamonds (the latter two are new). <br/><br/>     SET: At least 3 cards of the same rank (i.e., 5, 5, 5).<br/>     RUN: At least 3 consecutive cards in the same suit (i.e., 6, 7, 8, all clubs).<br/>     STASH: At least 4 cards of the same gem color (i.e., 4 Emeralds). <br/>     QUEEN&rsquo;S DIAMONDS:  Any Queen + one designated Diamond card that is determined by the initial roll number on the dice.  Both dice are rolled to find one number (i.e., 3 and 4 = 7, indicating 7 of Diamonds is the card). An &ldquo;11&rdquo; or &ldquo;12&rdquo; indicates JACK of DIAMONDS. <br/><br/><br/>Also, &quot;Gem Parts&quot; is a bonus players can earn by having all 8 gems at the end of a hand.<br/><br/>A new minimum score rule keeps the game moving along nicely.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Maneuver, morale, intelligence, enemy reaction and divisional assets play a significant part in the battle management. Combat resolution is interactive and fluid, maximizing unpredictability.<br/><br/>The game includes a set of rules, one scenario booklet, one A2 map, three air operations charts, ten corps asset charts, and three, two sided, counter sheets.

Take the reins of the national football squad, use a recruiting loophole to pick some of the best players from around the globe, and lead Antarctica to World Cup glory in this challenging card-drafting, dice-chucking game for one!<br/><br/>In Pocket World Cup, you will play the role of team manager leading Antarctica through three years of World Cup qualifying.

If you earn enough momentum after three years, you will qualify for the World Cup: a 24-team single-elimination knockout tournament.<br/><br/>For a greater challenge, you can play in Dynasty Mode: a campaign of four complete cycles of qualifying games and World Cups in which you earn victory points based on how far you advance each cycle.

        "description": "&ldquo;Time is now against Iran.&rdquo; &ndash;Chairman and de facto commander-in-chief, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani&rsquo;s comment following Operation Praying Mantis.<br/><br/>Following the destruction of Iran Air Flight 655 by the US, fully loaded with pilgrims on their way to Mecca for the Haj, the Iranian military vowed revenge against the &ldquo;Great Satan&rdquo;. With Grand Ayatollah Khomeni gravely ill, there was no one in charge within the Iranian government or military who could or would thwart this dangerous escalation of force. On April 14 the FFG (guided missile frigate) USS Samuel Roberts struck a mine at the edge of the international maritime channel near the Gulf of Bahrain while escorting a fleet of oil tankers. While no one aboard the stricken vessel was killed or seriously injured, the mine blew a gaping twenty-foot wide hole in the ship. Only the quick and skilled action by its crew kept USS Samuel Roberts from sinking. It was quickly determined by investigators that the Iranians had deployed the mines, and National Security Advisor, General Colin Powell advised President Reagan that a massive demonstration of force was required to demonstrate once and for all that Iranian armed interference with the flow of ship traffic in the Persian Gulf would not be tolerated.<br/><br/>Operation Praying Mantis was the largest US fleet action since the Second World War. While the US had a preponderance of force, any error or serious loss could possibly embolden the Iranians, especially the hard liners who resisted any end to the war with Iraq or compromise with the US-led coalition that opposed them. Operation Praying Mantis is a solitaire play game with the active player taking on the role of the commander of the US naval force charged with implementing the operation. The game&rsquo;s rules govern the Iranian response. Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>Each copy of Operation Praying Mantis is composed of the following:<br/><br/>One 11 by 17 inch map<br/>112 single-sided, unmounted counters<br/>One player's aid sheet<br/>6 pages of rules<br/><br/>Players will also need a six-sided die and one standard deck of playing cards to play the game. A custom card set that replaces the standard deck of playing cards, has rules reminders on pertinent cards, and features graphics by Bruce Yearian is available from High Flying Dice Games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Sopalavras is a game based on the famous alphabet soup: the more you move the noodles, the bigger the word you will form.<br/><br/>Six letter tiles are opened at the start of the round. Players try to use the revealed letters to mentally form words with at least three letters. The letters of the words already formed on the table can be used to create new words with the letter tiles of the round. When a player forms a word, he must say aloud the NUMBER of letters that word has. From there all players can keep trying to form words for as long as 1 minute. During this time, whenever a player is able to mentally form a word with an equal or greater number of letters than previously spoken, he must say that number aloud. The player who assembled the highest word wins 1 point or 2 points if he uses all 6 letter pieces in the round. The game ends when a player scores 5 points, winning the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great Turkish War: the Balkans, 1683-1699 is a low- to intermediate-complexity, two-player, strategic-level wargame simulating the fight for the Balkans and the Eastern reaches of the Holy Roman Empire in the late 17th century. In 1683, the Ottomans launched their last major offensive on Vienna. The siege failed thanks to the timely arrival of reinforcements from Poland and the Empire. During the next decades the Holy Roman Empire, Russia, Poland, and Venice engaged the still-powerful Ottomans in the Balkans and in the Aegean. Better leadership and military advances allowed the Austrians to inflict several decisive defeats on the Ottomans and conquer most of Ottoman Hungary. For the first time in centuries, the Turks were in strategic retreat in Europe.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents 1 year. Each hex on the map is approximately 60 km (36 miles) from side to side. Each combat unit represents 3,000 to 6,000 combatants depending on unit type.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Published November 2023 in S&amp;T magazine #344 (Jan-Feb 2024)<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to provide two six-sided die to play.<br/><br/>",

An oversized marble called Queen may only be used from the sixth move onwards. If it is part of a winning position, it will earn an additional marble. If the opponent succeeds in a winning position adjacent to it, he has won immediately. As soon as you have no more marbles in your supply, you can move your marbles anywhere you like, but the queen marble is allowed only to move to an adjacent square.

Create a team of explorers, travel to unique and dangerous locations and try to grab the rarest treasures you will ever see in your lifetime.<br/><br/>Be aware, treasure hunting is not for the fainthearted. You will need to gather a lot of strength, courage and inventiveness in your team, while strategically keeping an eye on your opponent.<br/><br/>The Huntsman Society is a storytelling, deckbuilding cardgame, where you will need to form a group of explorers, add equipment (stuff) and find the right vehicle(s) to travel to a location where a secret treasure lays hidden. You and your opponent can play event cards on your teams to make their lives easier or harder. In a turn you can send explorers on their adventures, let them overcome negative events, help them by playing positive events or restocking them with needed means. All by playing different cards from your hand. You will then throw a D8 to see if your team is the first to find the treasure at a location. At the end of your turn you can restock your hand with up to 10 playing cards. Every treasure found represent a certain amount of points, whoever collects the needed amount of points (you can decide on that at the beginning of the game with your opponent, making the playing time variable to your liking) wins the game and becomes the greatest Huntsman of all time!!!<br/><br/>The game features 164 unique storytelling artcards that can be combined in many different ways, making for extensive storytelling and new adventures being made every time you play.<br/>The game is best played out loud, making the adventures come to live.<br/><br/>The cards are filled with little quirky jokes and pop-cult references.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Additionally, by directing your telescopes to gaze into distant star systems, you may detect traces of alien signals or undiscovered exoplanets, and collect promising data to examine and study back home.<br/><br/>Back on Earth, you can invest in upgrading your equipment so you can analyze incoming data more efficiently, boost your telescope signal capacity, or increase your supply of resources&mdash;all to expand the scope of your search that could lead to a discovery of extraterrestrial life forms.<br/><br/>You will also make use of over 200 cards to aid your efforts or focus your research in a particular direction for additional bonuses and rewards. Each card has unique effects and illustrations and depicts real-life technologies, projects, and discoveries (like the ISS, Large Hadron Collider, Perseverance rover, Voyager probe, and many more).<br/><br/>Finding traces of extraterrestrial life is only a matter of time&mdash;utilize the resources you have at your disposal strategically and you may well end up being the one to make the biggest scientific contribution towards advancing our understanding of alien life within our galaxy.<br/><br/>SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence pays homage to space and planetary exploration, astronomy, the ongoing search for signs of life in the vastness of space, and efforts to understand the nature of life in the universe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hindenburg&rsquo;s War: Decision in the Trenches, 1918 (HW) is a strategic-level, two-player wargame of low complexity that covers the fighting on World War I&rsquo;s western front during that final year of the war, from the start of the first German offensive on 21 March through Armistice Day on 11 November. The game&rsquo;s sub-systems are crafted to present a supreme-commander&rsquo;s-eye-view of the war: it is therefore almost fully strategic in its perspective, with only the most pastel of operational undertones added to enhance historical tone and texture.<br/> Each hex on the map represents 9.31 miles (15 km) when measured from side to opposite side. Each full turn of play, other than the first and last, represents half-a-month. Every combat unit in the game represents one division of infantry or one brigade of tanks.<br/><br/>Components: Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 456 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crazyhouse is a chess variant very similar to bughouse chess, but with only two players. It effectively incorporates a rule in shogi (Japanese chess), in which a player can introduce a captured piece back to the board as his own.<br/><br/>* A captured piece reverses color (useful to have 2 sets on hand for this variant) and goes to the capturing player's 'reserve', or 'pocket'. At any time, instead of making a move with a piece on a board, a player can 'drop' a piece, in his reserve, onto an empty square on the board.<br/>    * Promoted but captured pawns are dropped as pawns.<br/>    * Pawns must not be dropped on the 1st or 8th ranks.<br/>    * Drops which cause immediate checkmate are allowed. Unlike in shogi, this includes pawn drops.<br/>    * A check that would cause checkmate, in regular chess, can be answered if the defender can make a legal drop which blocks the check.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rikken is a cardgame popular in Noord-Brabant (The Netherlands) and parts of Belgium. The 4 player cardgame is related to Whist and Bridge. In addition to the general rules, each region has its own set of minor rules. The games dates +/- 1950.<br/><br/>The game is played with 52 cards (a deck without jokers). Each round starts with the player left to the dealer making the first bid. There are many different bids possible, due to the different rules per region. However, the most commen bids are (in order):<br/><br/>- Pass: the player does not make a bid<br/>- Rik: score 8 (with a mate)<br/>- Piek: score exactly one (alone)<br/>- Miser&eacute;: score 0 (alone)<br/>- 9 or 10 alone: score 9 or 10 (alone)<br/><br/>After the bidding ends (players can over-bid eachother), the winning player announces the following:<br/><br/>- requested ace: the player who won the bid requests an ace. This must be an ace that he does not have himself. The player who does have this ace will be his mate for the current round. If the bid is a &quot;rik&quot;, then the 2 players together have to score 8 and the other 2 players try to prevent this. If the player plays alone (for example &quot;piek&quot; bid), he does not request an ace and just plays alone versus the 3 others.<br/>- choose the trump (&quot;troef&quot;): the player who won the bid also choses one colors to be the trump. The trump cards are worth the most for this round (similair to &quot;Hearts&quot;).<br/><br/>The round starts with the player left to the dealer playing his first card. The next player has to play a card of the same color. If that is not possible he can play any other card. The player with the highest card in a matching color scores. However, a &quot;troef&quot; card tops all other colors. Meaning players can &quot;steal&quot; a turn by playing a &quot;troef&quot; card. The round ends when all cards are played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A MATTER OF FAXE ARCHAEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, IT'S THE PITS <br/>Arthur E. Faxe, the eccentric entrepreneur and amateur archaeologist, sails this month for ancient Mesopotamia in search of human fossils and in the hope of proving the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. Faxe has chosen a region of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley known since ancient times as Vages for the site of his expedition. This area is distinguished by an immense and prominent boulder that can be seen for miles and is known locally as the Rock of Vages. A small cleft, or opening, at the base of the rock is the site of an unusual collection of fossils. The cleft, discovered in 1854 by French archaeologist, Henri Formie, is described in scientific literature as Rock of Vages, Cleft Formie. By arrangement with the local government, Faxe and his entourage will establish an extensive camp in an abandoned military fort near the archaeological site and overlooking the Tigris River.<br/><br/>Faxe advises, &quot;We are endeavoring to locate evidence in fossil form of the existence of an ancient human or near-human ancestor. I have spared no expense to see that my staff and guests are provided with the most modern of equipment necessary for their research and the essentials necessary for their comfort.&quot;<br/><br/>Purveyors of goods to the expedition advise that no less than fifty cases of fine wines and champagnes will accompany Faxe along with appropriate linen, silver and china, tables, chairs, canopies and tents, as well as a quantity of armaments for hunting and defense against bands of brigands which are known to roam the area. A domestic staff of thirty will be on hand, as well as an archaeological research team of seven.<br/><br/>The expedition, by arrangement with the Turkish government, will occupy an old fortress situated near the site of the dig. The fort, unused by the present government but once a key military post, is called Fort Ap Aachih.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/>Terra Sunder, Major General E. B. Sawtedd, Lester A. Fayre, Lady Melissa N.

Earn your pointe shoes and tutu; collect gems, treasures and the tiara.<br/><br/>In On Pointe players use dance moves as shown on the deck of cards to move through the game from the first dance studio through rehearsal and eventually to the stage.  Players stop at certain intervals in the game to collect gems, which are worth 3 points and treasures, which are worth 2 points.<br/><br/>Each player has a score card where they accumulate the items for later end-of-game scoring.  Points are also awarded for landing on the Pas de Deux squares, the Prima Ballerina square where one player will get the tiara and the final stage square for the bouquet and bow.<br/><br/>In addition to the cards, each player has five 'Position Tokens' each of which can only be used once and then is turned over after executing the given 'power-up' move or action.<br/><br/>The player who is positioned last, in relation to the front edge of the stage gets first selection of movement cards shown on the table and play proceeds clock-wise from there.  The result of this turn designation is that players tend to travel though the game board fairly closely together.<br/><br/>Since the winner is determined by a calculation of points, arriving first at the end of the stage does not guarantee a win.<br/><br/>On Pointe is a dancer's journey in a board game.<br/><br/>",

Maybe Las Vegas will have fewer zombies since it's in the middle of a desert...<br/><br/>In Zombies!!! 15: Another One Bites the Dust, players venture out into the desert, hoping the zombies cannot or will not follow them there. This turns out to be a big mistake. Now players must contend with both zombies and dehydration while they search for the jewel of the desert.<br/><br/>",

By the time the combat was over 10 hours later, 400 Zulu lay dead and they had not been able to break the spirit of the defenders.  This battle restored the honour of the British army and earned the defenders eleven Victoria Crosses, Britain's greatest award for military valour.  This number for a single battle has not been surpassed to this day.<br/><br/>The game concentrates exclusively on the defense of the hospital (western portion).  It has few counters, a single page map which represents the western approach and the hospital, and two pages of rules.  It has three scenarios which all deal with protecting the wounded (they are represented by counters).<br/><br/>Components must be mounted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shako II is a fast-play miniature wargaming rule set designed to play large Napoleonic battles with units representing infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. The ability to play corps sized battles and larger actions with battalions as opposed to brigades was made possible due to an innovative morale and combat system that simplifies the mechanics of play while accounting for tactical nuances. It is not an exaggeration to say that Shako II can be played often without reference to the rule book or even the Quick Reference Sheet.<br/><br/>In addition to clarifying the few points of ambiguity in the original rules, the central design concept focused on battle planning and command and control is being refined to speed play and to more accurately reflect the limits of control Napoleonic generals had over their men and the course of battle. In Shako II, careful planning, scrupulous deployment of units and attention to timing will be as important as how one moves individual units within the restrictive chaos of fighting. Bad planning and poor deployments will be punished by those players who have the Napoleonic flare for battle. En avant!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The World Undone (TWU) is a new operational, division level WW 1 system inspired by the brilliant late John Young&rsquo;s The Marne. What results is an extremely simple, nuanced, and quick playing, immersive simulation of the first big German victories of WW1. Play is broken down into a simple Move-Combat-Move-Combat phase for each side, with units participating in the first combat phase unable to move or fight during the second. The game covers August 13 to September 13th covering both the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. Separate CRTs are used for German and Russian forces to reflect differences in quality and doctrine. This is an extremely low complexity game that I hope will be able to draw new players into wargaming, and remind old players why they started gaming in the first place. The World Undone will be a 3 part series covering East Prussia, Galicia and the Western Front (maybe Serbia/Austria too).<br/><br/>Victory is determined through a simple Clausewitz-inspired Victory Point ratio system determined by control of towns, important objectives, and casualties.  Scenarios cover Tannenberg, Masurian Lakes, and a &lsquo;Campaign game covering both operations. Variants allow for additional replacements to change the balance of things. The Russian player can win automatically by taking Konigsberg, while the German player can win automatically by eliminating a percentage of Russian SP.  Players can combine the Galicia, East Prussia and Serbia Games together to simulate the entire Eastern Front in 1914.<br/><br/>SCALE: 1 day turns, 2-3000 men per SP, 7.2 Kilometer hexes (4.5 miles)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a limited edition re-creation of the fantasy based game &quot;Dragon Quest Dungeon&quot; circa 1990.<br/><br/>There are three ways to play the game, each with increasingly more depth in the rules.<br/><br/>The basic game has each player secretly set up his own dungeon with a stand-up cut-out castle between the two players to shield the other from viewing his opponent's dungeon. Each player has 24 square shaped walls that can be placed throughout the dungeon to block the other player from reaching the Dragon Lord.  At the beginning of the game, the players share the starting location and the location of the DragonLord in their respective dungeons.<br/><br/>The game play mechanics are very similar to &quot;Battleship&quot; in that the dungeon is laid out in a grid (rows and columns) and each player takes turns shouting out a location in the grid which will reveal a clear path or a wall.  The winner is the first player to successfully navigate to the DragonLord of their opponent's dungeon.<br/><br/>The advanced rules include monster pieces; treasure chests, combat, and cards with text on them that make the game play more immersive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Coalitions is based on the series of conflicts known as the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Players, representing major European powers, compete against each other to shape the future of the Continent. The innovative and elegant game system allows a historical recreation of the conflicts, but better yet, can also create plausible alternative histories. The Alliances may take different forms, the campaigns may be fought along different lines of approach, but what the players witness is still a believable version of history.<br/><br/>Coalitions brings the whole continent of the Napoleonic Wars into a fast, playable system.  Multiplayers&mdash;with NO downtime. Each turn, EVERY player is doing something&hellip; but doing something &lsquo;different.&rsquo;  This sets up an unexpected cycle like nothing you&rsquo;ve ever played before.  Cool wooden pieces, or a &ldquo;Deluxe&rdquo; version with some of the most beautiful miniatures you&rsquo;ve ever seen. Kickstarter backers get exclusive sculpts, an extra player expansion, plus an extra game covering a slightly different period!<br/><br/>Throughout the period, Britain formed coalitions with almost any nation that would stand against France. Whenever a coalition was defeated, Britain sought to form a new one with states that would carry on the fight. Nations also had other motives to fight wars, often seeking to expand their own borders at the cost of their neighbors. Britain itself fought the French in Portugal and Spain and, with almost total control of the sea, sent military expeditions wherever there was a chance of harassing the French. Can the Emperor of Austria protect the German Reich and Northern Italy from the Revolutionary Armies? Will the Prussian King and Russian Tsarina join as allies or not? Will the Ottoman Empire be able to protect Egypt, the Balkans and Caucasus from the aggressive neighbors?<br/><br/>When you play Coalitions, you decide the destiny of Europe; your decisions will make history. Will you guide France to greatness? Will you galvanize and unite Europe to bring an end to the infant republic and restore the Ancien R&eacute;gime? Or maybe there is a Metternich in you, able to deceive others and bluff your way to victory with a cunning smile?<br/><br/>Each player controls one of six asymmetric factions: France, England, Austria, Prussia, Russia or Turkey. They then try to form an alliance, insisting that it will be beneficial to all, although only one player can actually win. Throughout the game, players try to capture and consolidate key positions, which will earn victory points during the relevant phase.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

One tile is placed on the board at the start of the game, and each player has a hand of three tiles.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player lays one tile, either on the bottom level touching at least one tile already in place or on the second (or higher) level as long as at least three squares are supported by tiles underneath and certain color restrictions are met. The player can then place or move his pawn onto this tile; a player can neither cover an opponent's pawn nor score for expanding the region where an opponent's pawn is located. After playing a tile, the player scores points equal to the size of the regions created or expanded (two squares minimum), with the area being multiplied by the height of the tile.<br/><br/>Once all tiles have been played, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Awards:<br/><br/>Winner of the NESTORGAMES continuous abstract game design contest<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Batalla a les illes Formigues (Battle in the Formigues Islands) is a small and simple postcard game published as a freebie by SNAFU Design. It&rsquo;s a 2-player game recreating three Middle-Ages naval battles that took place during the Crusade against the Crown of Aragon in 1285: 1st battle of Formigues Islands, 2nd battle of Formigues Islands, and Battle of Roses<br/><br/>One player controls the Catalan fleet, the other one, the Franco-Genovese fleet. Players alternate activations of one of their own squadrons (1 squadron = 1 counter), organized in one or more flotillas. In each activation a squadron can do just one action: move, veer or fight. When a flotilla has lost more than half its original strength it must begin a retreat movement and the game ends when a player has not any units on the map; then, VPs are tallied.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the not-too-distant future, the game of Texas Hold&rsquo;em poker has evolved. This enhanced format of the game, named after the secret location of the largest annual tournament, is known as Western Tropic. Each year, the world&rsquo;s most elite players gather on a tropical island somewhere in the Pacific. The eccentric billionaire who organizes this tournament has quite a fondness for the &ldquo;Old West&rdquo; and has gone to great lengths to transform the center of the island into an authentic western town, and he encourages participants to dress accordingly...<br/><br/>As one of the players invited to compete in Western Tropic, your goal is to be the first player to reach 60 points and claim victory, fortune, and fame.<br/><br/>Western Tropic uses a 5x5 grid that acts as a communal, but ever-changing set of cards that players use to create the best possible poker hand. Much like Texas Hold'em, each player has hole cards that are unique to them. But, the game uses an extra (third) hole card each round that can be traded in, to grant various actions such as moving your character around the grid, or changing the grid, altogether.<br/><br/>Each suit gives you different abilities, and those can be used in unique ways to either improve your hand or obstruct others. There are also 8 jokers that can provide additional chaos.<br/><br/>Western Tropic takes the language of poker, and combines it with popular game mechanisms like deck-building and area control.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maillot Jaune (Yellow Jersey) is a hard to find hand-made cycling simulation by the Swiss Patrick Inauen that developed with support from his brother Adrian. Its main purpose is to recreate the Tour de France in its entirety over 14 stage sessions, with each player in charge of a team of 8 riders with individual abilities.<br/><br/>But what you get, in essence, is a highly flexible modular stage construction kit that allows you to create a wide range of possible races for 6 teams of 8 riders each, using 136 plain-colored terrain tiles in 5 colors. And although its scope is for an entire Tour, it is equally feasible to play only a single stage, recreate other tours and existing one-day classics, or embark on a completely made-up race. Saying that, a lot of the dynamics only come into play when team managers aren't only trying to snatch the stage victory from their competitors, but need to keep an eye on the overall rankings for each individual rider as well, as the end goal is to carry the Yellow Jersey to Paris. More so, and just like in the real Tour, the Sprint and Mountain Tricots are also up for grabs, so during each race it is important to get your key riders in point-scoring positions at the right time.<br/><br/>This dice-driven racing simulation includes rules for terrain handling, breakaways, tempo raising, slipstreaming, pack-splitting, sprints, fatigue, doping-use, overtaking, falls, team-cooperation and other events, but squeezes all this in a simple system that does not bogs down in details or oodles of bookkeeping.<br/><br/>By stripping the inner workings of a cycling race down to core mechanics that are based around only 4 different types of terrain tile (flat, uphill, downhill, and - to settle communal arrivals - sprints), the game instead concentrates on the different abilities of each rider to use certain types of terrain to his advantage. These abilities, again, are stripped down to their core. Team sheets show 8 unique riders, each with 4 to 8 special action points in specific terrain colours, that get covered when used. Remarkably, this is enough creates a race dynamic that is genuinely similar to the real deal. Servants will be used to get the specialists in position, or bridge gaps to escaped groups or soloists. The stronger riders will use their abilities to snatch points on their favourite type of terrain, and the team champions will be protected by their team members for most of the race, but ultimately need to rely on their superior movement bonuses to battle it out amongst each other. Often, the mountain stages are key arenas that shape the face of the remaining Tour, when riders no longer can rely on group efforts, and have to face the long uphill climb on individual strength alone. Each stage, team leaders will need to balance the need for interteam co-operation against their individual team's chances to gain an advantage. Sounds familiar?<br/><br/>During the race, the starting pack will slowly split up in individual packs, smaller groups (2-7 riders) and soloists, all standing on their own terrain tiles in small stacks of numbered plastic pieces in the 6 team colors (for larger packs replacement markers are used). In a standard turn, the top cyclist on each tile-stack will throw the D20, and move 1 forwards on an odd roll, and 2 tiles on an even, taking the entire underlying stack along through slipstreaming. That cyclist will then have spent his energy and move to the bottom of the stack, handing over the front position to the next one in line. From the head of the race down, each tile with riders will be dealt with in turn, and that process repeats itself until all riders have completed the stage, or are disqualified for arriving too late, with a bigger time-gap to the leader than allowed.<br/><br/>Each standard (group) move can be modified by one special move if managers so desire, and if they have the rider(s) that can pull it off on that type of terrain. This special move can either be a breakaway attempt, a general raising of the tempo, a deliberately go-slow decision by the speed-setting rider, or a tactical manoeuvre that can cause a pack to split. Each time a rider uses a speciality point, it is marked off from his entry on the team sheet. When the last ability point has been covered up, that rider is too tired to pull off any further special moves. A rider that has spent all his bonus points will start the next stage fatigued, whereas a rider that has spared himself will enter the next stage with a bonus point, just like the new holder of the Yellow Jersey. When the race leader changes terrain type, a random event is triggered that can befall any rider in the race.<br/><br/>When more than 1 rider arrives at a sprint banner, the top of a mountain, or the finish line, a sprint is triggered to settle the differences. Riders who can draw on team support, or are natural sprinters can use this to start the sprint in advantageous positions.<br/><br/>This is a great game for fans of the cycling genre, but might be a tad repetitive for others, especially when a lot of team managers join the race and when the starting pack splits up in many different groups. It then takes quite a few die rolls before the 50 to 90 tile route has been conquered by all. As a sport simulation, it works best when a full field of riders is present, and when an entire tour is played out over multiple sessions. If you play individual stages only, the race dynamics are far less colourful since the team managers only need to focus on getting one rider through the finish line, rather than juggle positions, general fitness, and overall rankings of their entire team of riders.<br/><br/>Included with the set are the assembly instructions for the 14 stages, and team sheets for each team manager, detailing the individual abilities of 8 unique (real-life) riders from the 1995 tour. It isn't clear if the brothers intended to supply updated packs for subsequent tours and races, but enthusiasts have.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     1995 Maillot Jaune Inauen Spiele - handmade limited edition - out of print<br/>     1996 Le Tour Inauen Spiele - handmade re-issue - out of print<br/><br/><br/>Maillot Jaune was Patrick's debut game, and was launched at the Schweizer Spielmesse in 1995, where it sold all of 13 stickered white cardboard boxes.

Turning up the card and revealing the unit that will act this turn is a contemporary action of the players. With each unit card revealed is turned up an action card that describes what the unit will actually do during the turn. There are 8 different actions possible that vary from easy things like shooting or moving to more elaborated or special actions like the ones esecuted by squad leaders and heroes.<br/><br/>Every unit has a fixed &quot;score&quot; that is used to accomplish everything and it's based on the experience level of the unit itself. It is necessary to roll and beat that score to successfully accomplish the task, so the more experienced a unit is, the lower the score will be. An array of situational modifiers are provided. Tests are made usually with a d10, but morale and other special tests can requiere using 2d6.<br/><br/>Rules are included too for campaign gaming, artillery, air support and personalization of special characters and heroes on the game table.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sorrow of Salilth is a microgame for one or two players lasting about 20 minutes. When playing a 2 player game, one player assumes the role of the Council of Wardens, trying to defend the city of Salilth from the servants of the Grayking and close four barrier gates within the city. If the four gates are closed or all of the Servant units are defeated, Salilth is saved and the Warden Player wins.<br/><br/>The other player controls the forces of the Grayking trying to overwhelm Salilth and reach the Citadel of the Wardens where they attempt to place 10 Siege Corruption tokens within the Citadel, If they are successful, or can defeat all of the Warden Units, Salilth is lost and the Grayking Player wins.<br/><br/>When playing the solitaire variant, the player assumes the Council of Wardens role.<br/><br/>Needed: one 2-page hex map, 1 rule sheet, 1 unit counter sheet and 1 sheet of nomograph tables.<br/><br/>Setup: The Warden Player places all of their units inside the Citadel, stacked by type.<br/>The player should also take the 4 Barrier Gate tokens, placing them within reach. They then place the marker on the Sparkblades icon on the Spell Rondel.<br/><br/>The Grayking Player divides their units into 6 stacks each with 6 unit counters. These stacks may be configured as desired by the player. They then place one stack on each of the 6 numbered zones outside the city. The player should also take the 10 Siege Corruption Tokens, placing them within reach.<br/><br/>Play: Each round of the game has 4 phases: Movement, Combat, Damage, Siege. Then a new round begins. The Grayking Player always goes first each phase, followed by the Warden Player.<br/><br/>Win: If all 4 gates are closed or all of Servant units are defeated, Salilth is saved and the Warden Player wins. If 10 Siege Corruption tokens are placed in the Citadel or all Warden Units are defeated, the Grayking Player wins.<br/><br/>Solitaire Variant: At game start, randomly sort the Grayking units into the 6 stacks of 6 units each, and place each stack randomly on each of the 6 numbered starting zones. During the Movement Phase, the player will move the Grayking units based on the rules as outlined above. Movement will always occur towards the Citadel and units will always form a larger group if there is a path choice. When splitting 4 or more units, always move units in order of the largest Spirit Strength first. During the Siege Phase, one Siege Corruption Token is added each round as long as any Servant unit occupies the Citadel.<br/><br/>This game uses nomographs instead of look-up tables and was designed to use a minimum number of components.<br/><br/>Sorrow of Salilth is a prequel to the Print and Play game - Shadows Upon Lassadar. A further game - Revenge of the Raven Consort - will complete the game trilogy.<br/><br/>Winner of the 2011 BGG Microgame contest<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Orbots is an easy-to-learn and quick-playing game in which you maneuver your orbital robots (orbots) around a tiny asteroid to collect power crystals in different combinations to generate the most power (points) by the end of the game.<br/><br/>Orbots features just a few simple rules for movement, combined with a few simple rules for scoring. Each turn consists of moving your orbot up, down, left or right to reach a power crystal to add to your collection, or to reach a tunnel to move to another part of the board. There are four different types (colors) of crystals and each resonates at a different frequency (values of 0-5 or 0-8, depending on the number of players). Combining crystals of the same type, but different frequencies is what generates power and scores points. The greater the difference between two crystals, the more power is generated. There are also special crystals that increase the power generated by a pair of crystals, or that changes how crystals combine, boosting power if you can get to them in time.<br/><br/>Orbots also includes optional goals beyond simply generating the most power, for a more strategic and challenging layer of gameplay, as well as added replayability.<br/><br/>The combination of simple rules, intuitive strategy and quick gameplay makes Orbots a great gateway game for newer or younger players, as well as a compelling and satisfying filler game for more experienced gamers.<br/><br/>Orbots is currently in late-stage development and is scheduled to launch on Kickstarter in the fall of 2017.<br/><br/>",

The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia. It is the last block to have three expansion sets.<br/><br/>The plane of Tarkir was once dominated by dragons, but in a massive war over a thousand years ago, humans succeeded at wiping them out. Today Tarkir is a battle-torn realm where five clans feud for supremacy. As presented in Khans of Tarkir, the five clans focus on &quot;wedges&quot;, or sets of three colors that are rooted in two colors and one &quot;enemy&quot; color across from it. Each wedge is the colors of a clan of warriors that venerate a certain quality of the dragon, and an anatomical feature that represents it. The clans also make use of the &quot;Morph&quot; mechanic, returning from the Onslaught block, which allows creatures to be cast face-down as 2/2 creatures and turned right-side up for additional cost, and occasionally additional benefit; this magic is described as being an invention of the extinct dragons, now adapted to human needs. The clans, and their khans, are as follows:<br/><br/>The Abzan Houses (White, Black, Green) see endurance as the most important quality of the dragon, and use the scale to show that. Their mechanic is &quot;Outlast,&quot; which allows them to permanently strengthen themselves by tapping. The clan is led by Anafenza, called &quot;The Foremost,&quot; known for leading from the front.<br/>The Jeskai Way (Blue, Red, White) prefer the cunning nature of the dragon, and represent themselves with the eye. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Narset, the Enlightened Master who speaks of other worlds than Tarkir alone. Their mechanic is &quot;Prowess,&quot; which gives creatures temporary bonuses every time the player casts a non-creature spell.<br/>The Sultai Brood (Black, Green, Blue) make themselves ruthless like the dragon, and see the fang as its most ruthless part. Their mechanic is &quot;Delve,&quot; which allows the player to lessen the mana costs of spells by exiling cards from the graveyard. They are led by Sidisi, Brood Tyrant, a powerful naga necromancer who considers herself queen of the clan.<br/>The Mardu Horde (Red, White, Black) views speed as the greatest aspect, and use the wings to represent that. Their mechanic is &quot;Raid,&quot; which provides bonuses if the player attacked this turn. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Zurgo Helmsmasher, a savage orc who has a vendetta against Sarkhan Vol.<br/>The Temur Frontier (Green, Blue, Red) believe in the dragon's savagery, and use the claw as their symbol. Their mechanic is &quot;Ferocious,&quot; which provides bonuses if the player controls at least one creature with 4 power or greater. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Surrak Dragonclaw, a mighty man renowned for punching a bear.<br/><br/>",

You can explore different landscapes to discover what's on the back of a tile. Pickaxes and swords make some explorations easier, so perhaps you want to get them. Try to uncover the treasure you need to win.<br/><br/>Ideally you can avoid monsters such as Zombies, Creepers, and Endermen because at the end of each turn, you must reveal a monster card, and if this monster is already in play, your group will be overrun and more monsters will appear. Face the horde bravely because as soon as the monster cards are used up, you lose the game. Do you best to fill your chests with treasure before that happens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Disarm The Base is a quick, co-operative game based on direct action. Players need to find and disarm war planes on a base, both avoiding the guards and disarming all the planes before the deck runs out.<br/><br/>Play takes place on a game board representing the base. Tiles representing different war planes are placed face down in hangars on the board. Each turn, players take up to four actions, which include moving around the base, playing cards from their hand, or giving or taking cards. Players then draw cards from a deck, resolving red cards immediately and taking other cards into their hands. Red cards do unfavorable things such as closing gates, placing guards in hangars, and turning on lights; cards in hand allow actions such as unlocking hangars, opening gates, turning off lights, and (of course) disarming planes. At the end of your turn, a guard on the perimeter of the board moves one space.<br/><br/>Players win if they disarm all the planes and at least one player escapes the base. To do that, players need to move around the board, use a code card or a crowbar card to open a hangar, enter the hangar, use a code card or a bolt cutter card to disarm the plane, leave the hangar, find the rest of the planes, and finally get out of the base back to where the banners were left! Players don't know which hangars contain planes, and every plane differs. If the deck runs out of cards, the supply runs out of guards, or more than one player is discovered by a guard, the players lose.<br/><br/>",

The Host rolls the die and selects a card from the matching category. Everyone then has 60 seconds to write or draw their answer! Everyone else in the group answers based on what they think the Host will like best. The Host collects and reveals everyone's answers, then chooses their favorite!<br/><br/>Or, everyone submits answers, including the Host. The group uses the voting cards (that's the cards with the numbers) to pick their favorite answer. The pressure is then on for the Host to prove they're the funniest!<br/><br/>If you win the round, you keep the prompt card. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Halloween the land has been blighted by an unnatural curse. Crops have rotted in the fields, feral beasts stalk the villages and children wake with night terrors.The ever vigilant members of the Infernal Club have discovered the source of the corruption. Witches!!!As one of the club&rsquo;s supernatural enforcers it is the players' duty to conduct a witch hunt and capture as many of the coven as they dare.<br/><br/>Ghost Hunter: Witches  is a card game for 2 or more players (up to 6 with one deck or 12 with two decks). Players must lay down higher and higher Witch cards until one can lay a set of three capturing all the cards on the table at that time. A player who cannot keep up with the witches being laid will be forced to pick up the stack and add it to their hand. Every captured card is worth points at the end of the game. Many cards have special rules that effect the order of play, who may capture or other game dynamics. Some cards are marked as 'innocent' meaning that if they are captured, which is often unavoidable, they are worth minus points at the end of the game. When the first player has gotten rid of all of their cards the game ends, then the player who has the most positive points wins overall with the others being ranked behind them based on their scores.<br/><br/>The deck can be integrated with all the other Ghost Hunter decks like the blues Spirits deck or the red Vampires deck.<br/><br/>So assemble your trusted associates, light your torches and prepare for the wickedness of Ghost Hunter: Witches.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MasterSweets is an easy to learn, fast to play, family-friendly card game with great repeatability.<br/>MasterSweets has four different game variants: competitive, player elimination, cooperative and solo.<br/><br/>In the main competitive variant of the &quot;MasterSweets&quot; you will take up the role of one of the 16 fancier confectioners(each with different special ability), competing to present the best confectionery delights. <br/>&quot;MasterSweets&quot; Gameplay<br/>Beginning with the starting player, players take turns in clockwise order. On his turn the player has to take one of the following actions:<br/><br/>1 &ndash; Take a card from the market into his hand. <br/>2 &ndash; Take the top card of the drawing deck.<br/>3 &ndash; Alter a recipe from the cookbook by exchanging one of the ingredient cards in his hand with a card from the cookbook.<br/>4 &ndash; Play a special card from his hand. <br/>5 &ndash; Perform the special skill of his role.<br/>6 - Complete a recipe. Give all the ingredients compiling a recipe to complete it.<br/><br/>Each recipe gives a certain number of points which equals the sum of the points of ingredient cards that compiles the recipe. At the end of the game the player who has collected the most victory points, wins.<br/><br/>In the elimination game &ldquo;Clash of Sweets&rdquo; each player will create their own unique cookbook and will try to steal their opponents&lsquo; recipes. This way, he reveals other players&lsquo; culinary secrets and their unique cookbooks decreases. After the last recipe from a player&rsquo;s cookbook is stolen, the player must leave the game. The last surviving player with recipes that have not been revealed is the winner.<br/><br/>In &ldquo;Clash of Sweets&rdquo; the active player allowed actions are:<br/>1 &ndash; Take a card from the market.<br/>2 &ndash; Take the top card of the drawing deck.<br/>3 &ndash; Play a special card.<br/>4 &ndash; Exchange an ingredient card from his hand with a card from another player&rsquo;s cookbook. <br/>5 &ndash; Improve a card in his cookbook. This way a recipe form the cookbook becomes more difficult for stealing. <br/>6 &ndash; Steal an opponent&rsquo;s recipe.<br/><br/>In the cooperative variant - &ldquo;Sweets workshop&rdquo; a royalty has noticed our masters of the sweets. She wants them to make incredible sweets for her birthday. Now the players must combine their efforts and team up in order to exactly fulfill all the royal&rsquo;s requirements.<br/>In &ldquo;Sweets workshop&rdquo; each player will hold the cards in his hand facing the rest of the players. The other players will give him clues about his cards.<br/><br/>In &ldquo;Sweets workshop&rdquo; the active player allowed actions are:<br/>1 &ndash; Point a card from the cookbook and then discard a card from his hand. If the discarded card is of the same type as the one that has been pointed at, turn the cookbook card face down.<br/>2 &ndash; Discard a card from his hand and exchange the position of 2 cards from the cookbook. <br/>3 &ndash; Discard 2 cards from his hand in order to discard a card from the cookbook. Replace the discarded cookbook card with a new card from the drawing deck.<br/>4 &ndash; Discard a card from his hand in order to give a clue to another player, what cards he holds in his hand. The active player must indicate &ndash; by pointing &ndash; which cards he is offering a clue about. Two types of clues are allowed:<br/>A) A clue about one, and only one value. For example: &ldquo;You have &lsquo;5&rsquo; point cards, here and here and &hellip;&rdquo;. <br/>B) Point a recipe in the cookbook. Afterwards, the active player should point out all cards from one team-mate hand that are of the same type as at least one card from the selected row or column. For example: &ldquo;Here and here and here &hellip; you have the same cards like in this recipe&rdquo;.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, if all the cards in the cookbook are face down, then the queen is happy and all players win together. Otherwise the game is lost.<br/><br/>To be a true master of the sweets, you need a lot of workouts. The best workout is when you are confronted with your own best achievements.<br/>The solo variant &ldquo;Lonely in the kitchen&rdquo; is the same like &ldquo;MasterSweets&rdquo; for two players. The goal in the &ldquo;Lonely in the kitchen&rdquo; is the player to collect more victory points than George &ldquo;The cake&rdquo; (his fictional opponent) at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a fantasy based game with strong gameplay ties to Battleship.<br/><br/>Each player secretly sets up his own dungeon; there's a stand-up cut-out castle to use as a shield between the players. You place the square-shaped walls all over the place in your dungeon, along with stairwells to the smaller 2nd level of the dungeon. You also place your monsters and various treasures for the other player to discover, fake treasures (mimics) and your boss monster. You cannot place the weapons in such a way that they're impossible to get to (either cut off by walls or the boss monster). Your then tell the other player which space the entrance to the dungeon is.<br/><br/>Each player in turn calls out the space he wishes to move to. You must call out each space one at a time. If there is a wall there, the player's turn ends. If the space is clear, they may continue on. If there is a monster, it must be fought. If the player is victorious, he gains a reward card for defeating it and may continue on; otherwise his turn ends. If there is a treasure chest, the player may examine it. If it's a treasure, he may keep it and move on. If its a mimic (a monster that looks like a treasure chest), then he must fight it as if it was a monster.<br/><br/>Play alternates between players until one player gets all 3 necessary treasures and then fights and kills the boss monster; that player is the winner.<br/><br/>There is minimal text on the components; as long as one player knows the rules and what the cards do, it is easy to show the other player (the cards with JPN text on them have distinctive pictures to make it easy to remember once told what it does)..<br/><br/>",

Generally, Blue units are more reliable and have a higher combat effectiveness but cost more and take longer to repair. When a unit does break down the player can then use any of his support units to try to repair them.<br/><br/>Each turn a card is flipped to represent the political action for that turn. A crisis requires a minimum force level of a certain type (land, sea or air) to avoid a prestige penalty. A Showdown occurs just once and ends the game - the player with the highest amount of ready force wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is thus a trade off between keeping sufficient force level to win the Crises and sufficient force mix to win the final Showdown.<br/><br/>",

At 9 o&rsquo;clock the American Squadron took refuge behind the foreign shipping, on the east side of the bay. Our fleet, considering the enemy&rsquo;s superiority, naturally suffered severe loss&hellip;. There was considerable loss of life.&rdquo; &ndash;Spanish Admiral Montojo&rsquo;s telegraph to Madrid during the battle.<br/><br/>A Brilliant Combat is the &ldquo;sister&rdquo; title of Death Before Dishonor: The Battle of Santiago that was the 2013 CSW Gold Level Donation reward. Like its counterpart the game uses a very simple and fun to play design that models the history well without a lot of record-keeping, and is also very solitaire play friendly. The game features the historical battle, several what-ifs, as well as scenarios that posit the Spanish Reserve Fleet sailing to take back the Philippines, or the German Asiatic Squadron challenging Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s for control of the archipelago.<br/><br/>Each copy of A Brilliant Combat has one 11 by 17 inch map, one sheet of 77 single-sided, un-mounted counters, one players&rsquo; aide sheet and a 4 page rule book. Graphics are by Bruce Yearian. A Brilliant Combat sells for $11.95 plus shipping. Mounted counters can be had for an additional $5.00.<br/><br/>",

It is unusual and elegant beyond words, it is very easy to learn but very hard to excel at.<br/><br/>Its unbelievably concise rules, while being simple enough for a child to learn, generate a strategy as complex as the best known &quot;western&quot; games.<br/><br/>The core of the game's mechanics is the notion of dice-perfection:<br/>A die is perfect when the number of pips on the face of the die equals the number of dice neighboring it, regardless of those dice ownership and pips.<br/><br/>The drama of the game is that this perfection status (and therefore the goal) is very fragile.<br/>The conflict of the game is that manipulating their own dice only players affect the status of the opponent's dice as well.<br/>The trickery of the game is that the goal is impossible to achieve using only your own dice.<br/><br/>",

While the USSR is distracted by all of this, Poland decides to settle the score with Hungary after years of escalating tensions along the border. With three scenarios and 88 counters gorgeously illustrated by wunderkind Christian Sperling (Neuschwabenland), it's a cold-war-goes-hot tactical combat game by the undisputed master of the genre.<br/><br/>",

A head card, a body card, and a feet card. The cards work together to build robots in fun combinations. As the players build the robots, they can end up with names like &quot;A funky‐right ol'‐pulverizer&quot; or &quot;Mr Electric the‐crushing‐bubble bot&quot;. Players also have the option of attaching 1 add‐on card to the robot.

Once the players have a round or two under their belt the game is fun and everyone enjoys building the robots.<br/><br/>There are a few other features to the game like the &quot;Bargain Center&quot; which allows players to grab a &quot;Crumpled&quot; head, or an &quot;As seen on tv&quot; body part to finish out their robot in a pinch. Using the bargain center parts might seem like a disadvantage but be careful. That player might be holding the &quot;Dick Jone's Rust Remover&quot; card which allows them to polish it up and make it shiny and new.<br/><br/>",

There are three historical scenarios pitting Japanese infantry and cavalry, fighting alongside the Brits, against the Germans. There is also a hypothetical scenario that places the Germans on the offensive.<br/><br/>Designed by John Gorkowski, In the Trenches enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>",

In this card game you must compete to capture the angelic and the diabolical a like.<br/><br/>The cards feature gothic art of angels and daemons from holy lore as voted for by the backers. This theme is replicated in the special rules which sees each Angel matched with an opposing Demon.  You as a Ghost Hunter must choose which to specialize in capturing, for the best bonuses in your final score.<br/><br/>Ghost Hunter: Angels &amp; Demons is a card game for 2 &ndash; 6 players that should last between 10-30 minutes. Players take it in turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on the stack then they have to pick it up. If a player manages to lay a group of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Plenty of the cards come with special rules that you can manipulate to turn the game your way. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.<br/><br/>It is a standalone game but can be combined with the other Ghost Hunter decks for variation.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nova Solis... The legendary home of the Ancients...<br/><br/>A tiny pocket reality containing untold treasures untouched since the Ancients&rsquo; departure from our universe.<br/><br/>When a functioning gate was first discovered it became a race for the great races of the galaxy to be the first to mount an expedition and claim the riches of Nova Solis. In our greed we did not stop to consider why the Ancients abandoned Nova Solis until we encountered the Entity...<br/><br/>Its attacks came from out of nowhere and decimated our defenses... Great fleets of ships made from shadow pouring out of enormous tears in the fabric of space.<br/><br/>Its power is growing and the black hole is becoming more active... Even worse, many of the stars near the Nova Solis gate are becoming unstable... We have to get out of here but we can&rsquo;t let this thing enter into our universe... Our only hope is to recover the ancient knowledge and to seal it inside!<br/><br/><br/>Nova Solis is a 4X (eXpand, eXplore, eXploit, eXterminate) space and resource management game for 1 to 6 players. The game is a hybrid blend of thematic gameplay with Euro mechanics and may be played in the following modes:<br/><br/>Survival - Where the players must work together to flee the entity or be destroyed.<br/><br/><br/>     Standard - The player who gains the most victory points is the overall winner.<br/>     Co-Op - Players work together as a group and no player combat is allowed.<br/>     Solo - A single player controlling 2-6 races against the entity.<br/><br/><br/>Exploration - Where the players compete against each another to claim the most victory points<br/><br/>Players choose 1 of 6 asymmetrical empires to lead their expedition each with their own unique technology focuses and secret objectives. During the game the players will scan and explore stars placing them onto the modular board to obtain empire bonuses and strategic resources. These in turn are used to power the various technologies.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the players will be attacked by the AI controlled Entity which grows stronger as the game proceeds. Left unchecked it will eventually consume the players in a supernova explosion. To defeat the Entity, the players must obtain enough victory points and ancient artifacts while combating its forces.  Combat makes use of a highly strategic dice face-building mechanic allowing players to customize their forces over time.<br/><br/>Because in survival games each player accumulates their own set of victory points while contributing to the overall total required to defeat the Entity, Nova Solis gives each player a reason to play independently of the group-think that plagues other games with cooperative mechanics. Of course the players can still play cooperatively if desired or settle into exploration mode for a more standard 4X romp.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/><br/>     Finalist at UKGE 2018 Wyvern's lair competition<br/>     Finalist Board Game Design Lab - Design Challenge!<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.<br/><br/>Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.<br/><br/>All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.<br/><br/>The second volume is District Commander Binh Dinh, set in the jungles of Vietnam circa 1969. This is a period of transition that sees Government forces shifting their focus from pitched battles to providing population security and pacification. Mr. Train gives each player very different tools - here, we have rules for Agent Orange, the Phoenix Program, and the Ho Chi Minh Trail, among others - with which to pursue a sometimes shifting set of operational goals in a highly-customizable sandbox.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/><br/>Skeleton with Scimitar and Shield<br/><br/>",

Remember that they should be connected with each other by at least one of the three keywords.<br/>Investigators and enemies have high attributes; while vehicles move other cards; items, spells and artefacts are weaker but can perform special actions; and outer gods bring huge changes in the world (board), but require an opened gate.<br/>Cards (in a well-assembled deck) will resonate with each other causing mayhem on the board and creating un-obvious traps.<br/><br/>Players alternately play one card at a time, trying to turn the opponent's cards to their side (light or dark). We do this with the attributes on the sides of the cards and their special abilities.<br/>You cannot hide cards in your hands, you must play either from the top of the pile or from the two available slots in the stash. So the cards are open to both players and we can try to anticipate his movements. But so is he! Whoever gets more followers at the end wins.<br/><br/>",

This is accomplished by maintaining the basic dynamics and structure of the of the game, while increasing the number of strategic moves.<br/><br/>By expanding the size of the battlefield and increasing the number of pieces, a chess player's mind is forced to accept a greater strategic load. This subconsciously builds one's 'chess muscles'.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Be the last to place a gem to claim the power and dominate your enemies.<br/><br/>Lucent was designed with the aesthetic in mind. As gem cards are played out, they create a rich tapestry. There are four themes available:<br/><br/>Classic - Featuring elemental gems on a light background, Night - featuring elemental gems on a dark background, Cosmic - featuring celestial bodies among the stars and Bestiary - featuring mythical beasts on stylized parchment.<br/><br/>The game is quick and easy to learn. Divide the deck evenly among all players, then build a pyramid by placing cards that match one of the two cards beneath them.

Anno Domini: Reisen und Verkehr contains historical events related to voyages of famous people, transport, traffic motorization, etc. Like all Anno Domini sets, this game can be played as a standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>In Anno Domini: Reisen und Verkehr, each player receives nine cards (or fewer, if you want the game to be shorter) and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/><br/>If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement &ndash; receives three cards.

        "description": "Prolific designer Brian Train (The Scheldt Campaign) has created a number of games on unusual, under-gamed topics, often utilizing unique and innovative mechanisms. Hollandspiele is proud to be bringing two of Mr. Train's most interesting designs to your table in a single box.<br/><br/>Ukrainian Crisis simulates the Russian intervention in the Ukraine beginning in 2014. Diplomacy, propaganda, and international prestige play just as big a part in the proceedings as military force, if not more-so: it's entirely possible for the situation never to result in armed conflict at all. Each of these various elements feeds into and off of the others, resulting in a complex and decision-rich strategic situation. Event cards provide opportunities to turn things to your advantage, or to collapse in folly. The game is driven by the allotment of Resource Points chits. These chits are divided into three categories that each provide a random range of Resource Points: Minimum (1-4), Medium (2-5), and Maximum (2-12, trending toward 7). Each player has a finite number of each type of chit. This not only means that the commitment of chits among different activities within a given turn is important, but that as the game progresses, the choices you made on previous turns limits the range of options available for the end-game. While the decisions are rich and nuanced, the game system is relatively straightforward, making it a great introduction into &quot;pol-mil&quot; gaming.<br/><br/>The Little War is a smaller game about a smaller conflict: the week-long 1939 border war between Hungary and Slovakia. This is more of a straight-forward military engagement, but that doesn't mean it's any less interesting, clever, or innovative. The Little War is driven by an ordinary deck of playing cards (which you'll have to provide yourself). On each turn, six cards are drawn from the deck. One player gets the Hearts (movement) and Diamonds (combat), the other the Spades (movement) and Clubs (combat).

        "description": "Nubia is a solitaire game where you rule a Black African civilization of three Christian kingdoms in the Nile Valley: Nobadia, Makuria, and Alodia. Your culture is an heir to the glories of Ancient Egypt and the legendary Kingdom of Kush, but long gone are the days when you were conquering and ruling Egypt. In the game, it is A.D. 1172 and Nubia is under siege! For 400 years, you will battle to defend civilization against the fierce pagans of the Funj, and a jihad of marauding land-hungry Arabs. Deploy your famous archers, build fortified monasteries, send the Crown Prince into battle, and marry off your daughters in a desperate effort to stem the tide.<br/><br/>This fast-play, fun, and educational solitaire game uses a system created by Darin Leviloff. &ldquo;Mek&rdquo; markers on five converging paths represent hostile Arab and pagan armies that surround your kingdoms. The paths all meet in Soba, your fabulously wealthy capital at the juncture of the Blue and White Nile rivers, where the danger of a &ldquo;Collapse&rdquo; exists if any of those armies makes it that far. In addition, three tracks representing medieval Nubian society (Nobility, Kingship, and the Army) greatly impact the overall situation. A card draw determines which paths and tracks move against you this turn, while the cards teach you about the history of ancient and medieval Nubia. The number of &ldquo;Efforts&rdquo; which you can use to move them back in your favor (if the Effort die roll succeeds) depends on the personal talents of your current Uru (king) and his chief advisor, the Metropolitan Bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church.<br/><br/>Managing Efforts is key to the game, and you never have as many as you want. You can obtain more by selling off land and using your bishops for political gain instead of their natural religious calling: a short term strategy that can cost you victory points in the end. Each risky gambit is aimed at averting a system-wide social collapse, which can end the game suddenly. Your success (or failure) in holding off the five hostile armies helps determine how many noble families are still on your side when a Collapse approaches, so the better you play the game, the less chance the Collapse gets off the ground.<br/><br/>As the game draws to a close, the Portuguese are searching Africa for the fabled Christian &ldquo;Kingdom of Prester John.&rdquo; Those legends may refer to you! Can you hold medieval Nubia together long enough to make contact with them and win the game?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a set of nine scenarios for Advanced Squad Leader.  The scenarios all include German units from the 7th SS Gebirgs Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;.  This division consisted of mountain troops made up of ethnic Germans from Croatia, Serbia, Hungary and Romania.  In six of the scenarios the Germans are pitted against the Yugoslavia national army or Yugoslav partisans.   One scenario has elements of the &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; division fighting the Italians, while the final two has Bulgarians as the opponents.<br/><br/>These scenarios tend to be a mix of medium and large numbers of troops.

        "description": "Moku Tower&rsquo;s gaming concept originates from our previous product &ndash; Woodas. The theme of Moku Tower is to integrate wood art into tabletop game. It is an unconventional idea that transforms wood art into an artistic, interactive and strategic tabletop game that can be played with a group of friends and/or family members. Moku Tower combines the concept of &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;stacking&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot; into one single game. It allows you to casually mess round, laugh and interact closely with your cool friends.<br/><br/>Moku Tower is not only a great party game, it is also an amazing home decoration that can impress your friends. When you are not playing, you can simply display Moku Tower as an art piece. Each game contains 10 different pieces of wooden rocks (includes both big and small) and are made of 8 different types of natural wood material (ash, pine, sapele, maple, walnut, birch, camphor and rosewood). Each of them has different grain, color, weight, texture and even aroma. Also, each piece of wood is exquisitely handcrafted by our wood master. Hence, each of them has its own unique cutting and angle, making Moku Tower one of your most exquisite and unique home decoration.<br/><br/>In respect of the gameplay, in order to win in Moku Tower, you need to be good at timing, stacking and strategy. Within the time limit from the hourglass, players need to stack the wooden rocks to gain points based on the requirements that they draw from the cards. Throughout the stacking process, your opponents can attack you using their &quot;Function cards&quot;. Make good use of the Function cards! It can be the turning point for the whole story. The player who first reaches the accumulative target point wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "5 Card Nancy has never been published, so all existing sets have been constructed by hand.<br/> The game is essentially an exercise in collaborative storytelling, played with a deck of cards. Each card in the deck features a single, unique panel taken from Ernie Bushmiller's classic newspaper comic-strip &quot;Nancy.&quot; The strip is still in syndication today (and currently drawn by Olivia Jaimes), but McCloud insists that only panels from Bushmiller's peak years on the strip -- 1946 and later -- are suitable for use in a 5 Card Nancy deck.<br/> Game play is very simple: an initial card is selected randomly from the draw pile and placed face up on the table. This card will serve as the first panel in the collaborative comic strip that will emerge as a result of gameplay. On her turn, a player will then select a single card from her hand, and place that card face up and to the right of the emerging comic strip. A judge or judges (usually the other players) then vote on the appropriateness of that particular panel to the unfolding narrative. If majority opinion favors the proposed panel, it becomes a part of the strip, otherwise it returns to the hand of the player who proposed it.<br/><br/>5 Card Nancy is a card game invented by cartoonist Scott McCloud, author of &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; and &quot;Reinventing Comics,&quot; and creator of the &quot;Zot!&quot; series of comic books (among others).

        "description": "A simple fast play rules set for the Napoleonic era based upon the very popular De Bellis Antiquitatis (DBA). In its most basic format, about a dozen units on each side contest across a 2 foot by 2 foot. While bells &amp; whistles are held to a minimum enough Napoleonic chrome exists to give this game a interesting flavor of the time --- Vistula Lancers, British rifles, Spanish guerrillas are differentiated as is the very slow Austrian army. Includes very usable army lists. KISR is following this up with sets for the American Civil War (DBACW) &amp; WWII (Rommel's Battles). Similar to DBA in requiring only low costs in number of figures and space required, and rules that are quickly assimilated.<br/><br/>",

In the beginning, this can be done in any position where a disk doesn't touch any other disk. When the board becomes too full, the disks must be placed on the edge of the board, then pushed in with a wooden bar. In this way, all other disks that are hanging over the edge of that particular edge of the board, are pushed back in as well. Disks that fall over an edge are returned to the player of the respective color. Neutral disks are handed to any player (black disks) or to the player whose turn it is (red disks). The first player to place all his/her disks on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>A small number of copies of Schiebung were published as a &quot;Test-Edition&quot; by Edition Perlhuhn in 2009.<br/><br/>",

You must earn Prestige Points to keep up and have the option of extra missions. You must show your weaponry skills and knowledge in order to beat the defenses.<br/><br/>To win the game you have to win as many missions as possible. Every mission has a value in Prestige points, the more points you get, more chance to beat your own record or to beat your opponent score and then win the game but be careful if you run out of credits (life points) you are dead and game will be over.<br/><br/>You can play alone (Solo Game) or against a friend (Multi Game). The game dynamics are similar, differing mostly in the use of SPECIAL cards (strategy) and auctions to get the missions. There is a mix of luck and strategy in this fast-paced easy to learn game. Advanced mode is very intense where Characters make the difference with their action bonuses. The game is set to last 4 rounds, but getting to the final one might not be easy. Each mission has a cost you have to pay, reducing the CREDITS on your Score card. But no need to worry, because once you accomplish the mission, you will get some of that cost back.<br/><br/>The game is based on four main types of cards: MISSIONS, WEAPONS, LOCATIONS and ESPECIAL cards. We also need DEFENCE to combined with MISSIONS giving us different possibilities,  but not always the same options.<br/><br/>",

The playing pieces represent the regiments and special battalions taking part, plus the multitude of fire support available to them.<br/><br/>The series uses the Fire &amp; Movement system rules, with exclusive rules for each folio. The folios can be combined to display the entire American or British Commonwealth sectors, or into a single giant game on the entire campaign.<br/><br/>The British landing on Sword Beach, combined with the airborne landings was designed to guard the eastern flank of the bridgehead and ensure the capture of the crucial road junction of Caen. The initial landing is made from both air and sea, but will run into the heart of the German Panzer reserve. Caen was the cork in the Allied bottle and the Germans made every effort to halt progress on this front. In the campaign game, the Allies can &mdash; as they did historically &mdash; use threats on Caen to keep German forces away from the rest of the front and ease the progress elsewhere.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>17&quot;x22&quot; terrain map<br/>100 die-cut counters<br/>one Eight page system rule booklet<br/>one exclusive scenario rule<br/>10x13 ziplock<br/>5x3 ziplock<br/><br/>Players: 1-3<br/>Ages: 14+<br/>Hex Scale: 2.5 miles<br/>Play Time: 1-2 hours<br/>Complexity: Low-Med<br/>Solitaire Ability: Medium<br/><br/>",

For almost a year, General Eisenhower balanced Allied resources and clashing subordinates as he slowly drove back Field Marshal Karl von Rundstedt&rsquo;s forces, who struggled with Hitler to command his theater forces. In late January 1945 the Rhine was breached and the end of the Third Reich drew nearer.<br/><br/>D-Day and Beyond is a tense, two-player operational board game covering the European theater from the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts to the dense German forests, the Siegfried line, and the Rhine River.  The Allied player faces the tough decision about where and when to land troops, what scarce air and naval resources to employ on offense or defense, and struggles to keep a coherent supply line to his forward troops.  The German player has to throw the landing(s) off the beach, if able, and failing that, fight a retrograde war that requires balancing holding key terrain, slowing the Allied advance, and preserving units.  Additional rules showcase the Resistance, rail movement, airborne operations, carpet bombing, the release of German reserves, and the infamous Wacht Am Rhein offensive known as Autumn Mist.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Snowpeople is the first print-at-home game published by Twin City Games. You are digging through a field of snow as you uncover and collect objects to decorate your snowman. Throughout the game, you use dice to choose paths to dig through the snow to uncover objects, as well as collect snow for the different body parts of your snowfolk's body. Whoever has excavated the largest and diverse set of objects to decorate their snowperson by the end of the game will be declared Best in Snow!<br/><br/>1. Every round one player rolls two dice, and each player records these results on the game sheet. All players use these results to dig around objects on their own player sheet.<br/><br/>2. Players use one result to choose a polyomino to draw within the grid. Players use the second result to choose a dig type for the polyomino and mark spaces in the grid.<br/><br/>3. After a player completely surrounds an object they count the number of squares that object occupies and marks that number in the matching row of that objects type. Players are encouraged to collect sets of objects using each type.<br/><br/>4. That player then marks an X in each row that matches the dig types used to surround the object scored. If there was only one dig type used to surround the shape, then a player marks three X's in that row.<br/><br/>5. Throughout the game players will earn Snowflakes that can be used for bonuses, and Stars that will earn them additional points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>6. At the end of the game players count the number of points earned from their objects collected, stars earned, as well as any unused bonus snowflakes.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Every character has a distinct development tree you can use to advance. Build and execute your unique combo, such as teleporting into any space on the map, gathering lament, gaining extra dice, and firing up a devastating attack on the boss. Sometimes a special electricity die will help you power up your armor, while at other times, you will forge magical bullets to be fired at the right moment.<br/><br/>Who and where are you fighting? Each game you choose from multiple arenas, bosses, elites, and possible adventures. Every game is different and exciting. Instead of following a scripted campaign, dive right into a boss battle for an intense 2-3 hour gameplay session. Every boss offers a unique gameplay challenge, and bringing them down will be tactically demanding. You must work together and take full advantage of the arena and its resources to achieve your goal.<br/><br/>During combat, strategically use dice allocation to move around the board, fire up different combos, and gather lament to grow in strength. Build your character in roguelike fashion and try to claim the ultimate prize. Collect too much lament, however, and you may turn into one of the beasts you were sent to hunt, with your fellow hunters unable to help you in time!<br/><br/>",

Players then decide if they want to sell and/or buy goods there. Also, every action takes time, and how you spend it is very important. Will you spend more time to reach a bigger planet so that the chances of getting cheap cargo will be bigger? or will you travel to smaller planets, hoping to increase the number of trades even though they may be a bit less profitable? Will you try to sell and buy on the same planet to save traveling time, but risk getting a worse deal on one of the transactions? or will you just do one thing, maximizing profit but wasting more time flying through space? Last, will you risk losing your cargo by selling it where it's illegal?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ancient Warfare (AW) is a set of miniature rules for wargaming tactical level combat for the period 1500 BC to 450 AD.<br/><br/>1 inch equals 25 yards (for 15mm figures). Each turn equals 5 to 10 minutes. The figure to man ratio is 1:30. For a typical 3 to 4 hour Romans versus Gauls game this will simulate a full legion plus auxiliaries or two under strength legions plus their allies of 6-8,000 men against 8-10,000 Gauls. This equates to 300 to 400 Roman figures (about 100&ndash;130 elements/stands) and 400 to 500 Gauls (about 130-160 elements/stands).<br/><br/>The rules are published in Letter format (8.5 inches x 11 inches) and consist of:<br/><br/>the main rules,<br/>optional rules section,<br/>ship-to-ship combat rules,<br/>advice on playing AW solo,<br/>advise campaigns,<br/>design concepts,<br/><br/>85 army lists for the period starting with the &quot;high&quot; chariot-era armies such as Canaanite, Mycenaeans, Hittites and Egyptians and ending with the Huns and Late Imperial Romans.<br/><br/>The rules also come with a quick reference sheet and a pre-printed green order marker sheet. There is no book keeping required, markers and element positioning being used to visually indicate unit status.<br/><br/>An army consists of 2 to 5 Divisions each commanded by a general. Each Division is made up of 2 to 6 units; each unit consists of 2 to 8 elements/stands.<br/><br/>Generals are allowed a certain number of order markers per turn which can be used to initiate tactical moves. Units outside a 12 inch command range need two markers to place an order. An element of randomness is introduced at deployment where the quality of the generals are determined by a set of die rolls with better generals being able to issue more orders. Orders available are Charge, Move, Maneuver (i.e. change face or formation), Defend, Retire, and Recover (from disorder or resupply with missiles). Units without orders may not move but can shoot. An order once issued must be executed, even if it puts the unit in a disadvantageous position. Orders apply for one turn.<br/><br/>Movement is either strategic movement (outside 12 inch /30 cm of enemy) or tactical movement (within 12 inches of known enemy). Troops carrying out strategic movement do not need to expend order markers, the assumption being that they are less nervous and more controllable while they are at some distance from the enemy. Some special formations are allowed:<br/><br/>Locked Shields, which confers an advantage in melee at the expense of speed of movement,<br/><br/>Square, which confers morale and close combat bonus but limited movement,<br/><br/>Testudo is similar to square but only available to Romans, who can move faster than a square,<br/><br/>Wedge allows a close combat advantage, and<br/><br/>Echeloned Line, which allows trained infantry to form a refused line while moving as a line.<br/><br/>Morale and cohesion are closely interrelated in AW. As morale deteriorates so does unit cohesion. Cohesion (and hence morale) is reduced through several causes including terrain, combat, interpenetration or failed morale tests. Units test morale by rolling a D10 die, the result being modified by a series of factors. The test isn&rsquo;t a simple pass/fail test. If a unit fails a test the outcome will depend on how badly the test is failed. A failure by 1 less that the required pass score may result in the unit halting disordered, a failure by 2 results in the unit retiring, and so on. Obviously, the higher the morale grade, the more chance a unit will pass its test.<br/><br/>Units can recover from a deteriorated state. A Recover order marker can be issued to the unit during the Order issue phase. Therefore over time a routed unit can be recovered. Given a limited number of orders available to a player each turn, the player will have to decide whether to charge, maneuver, or recovering units during each turn.<br/><br/>Shooting is calculated by whole elements/stands. An element/stand will hit its target if a D10 die achieves a high enough score. The score necessary to hit depends on the range to target, modified by several shooting factors including the target&rsquo;s armor protection.<br/><br/>Close combat is calculated on a unit-by-unit basis. Weapons, enemy armor, morale, number of ranks fighting, number of elements fighting, combat modifiers plus a random die all contribute to melee calculation. Units that suffer greater losses are pushed back 1 inch and are disordered with the winner usually following up. Units will break through morale failure or, indirectly, through accumulated pushbacks.<br/><br/>Losses in combat or shooting will result in figures being marked as lost. When the figures lost equals the number of figures on an element, the element is removed (there are no individual figures removed in AW, figures are removed in whole-element increments only). Therefore two hits will remove a skirmisher element, three hits will remove a loose order element, four a close order element. A unit&rsquo;s morale starts to suffer once it loses elements and each whole element loss through shooting or combats triggers a fresh morale test.<br/><br/>A game ends when a player concedes or his army collapses. Collapse becomes possible when an army loses one third of its units; all remaining units being required to take a morale test. This test is retaken in subsequent turns if a further unit is lost.<br/><br/>",

And then eventually several of the remnant groups head back to the stars, begin reclaiming old colonies, and attempt to form the Second Empire.  <br/>2-4 players attempt to reform the empire through aggressive exploration and expansion -- confronting each other when encountered.<br/><br/>According to Sid Sackson's &quot;A Gamut of Games&quot;: Using a stock of raw materials, each player constructs his own space navy. The ships are sent into space, to do battle and to search for raw materials and the lost technologies of the First Empire.<br/><br/>This game has been supplanted by more sophisticated 4x games such as Throneworld, Twilight Imperium, Space Empires, and Eclipse, but if you are a student of the genre or just looking for a nostalgic old-school experience, you owe it to yourself to give this title a whirl.<br/><br/>",

These tiles provide instructions on how to further advance, reveal the items that can be found in the new room, and detail the the puzzle(s), if any, that must be solved in order to win the game.<br/><br/>In the current version, a player sheet is used to track the player's physical and mental states (which affect the player's ability to search the ship and perform various actions), as well as the player's oxygen level and inventory.  Another optional version is in development that will use chart tiles and tokens to track these things.<br/><br/>As the player explores the ship, he or she will find data cards that gradually reveal the terrible fate of the Heresy and its passengers and crew.  They also provide victory points that are key to obtaining the specific ending a player desires.  Without sufficient victory points, players will lose when they end the game, so it's important to find as many data cards as possible.<br/><br/>This game was developed as part of the  Solitaire Print-and-Play Contest at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/644090/solitaire-print-and-play-contest/page/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/644090/solitaire-print-and-p...</a>.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to have scored 10 points before anyone else, or be the player with most points when there is just one suspect left. Points are scored by pre-setting certain cards from hand. These cards will, when the murder happens, score points if the conditions on the cards are fulfilled &ndash; conditions including people dead, people still alive, and other set cards.<br/><br/>During the game, players use cards in hand to construct a common deck of suspects from which one cards is drawn every round. This deck also decided who is actually killed when the murder happens. So, in fact, the &quot;detectives&quot; are also influencing who will be killed. All to fit the theories they have laid forth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mindburners: Into the Void is a strategic cyber-occult card drafting and arrangement game for 1-2 players. Loaded up with experimental gear and thrust into the swirling chaos beyond against your will, you must equip and optimize your limited void-tech and outperform your adversary.<br/><br/>In Mindburners: Into the Void, players are disposable test clones owned by Null Corporation, purveyors of the dark waste's finest void-tech. In the company's annual culling rites, a pair of clones are given the opportunity to earn their freedom by testing Null Corporation's most dangerous experimental technology.<br/><br/>Through two alternating rounds of drafting, each player will select their choice of five untested void-tech items, then simultaneously reveal and arrange them in a personal tableau to maximize their score based on position, bonus card scoring abilities, and special triggered abilities.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points by the end of the scoring phase survives (wins) and is granted their freedom. The other perishes in the cold writhing darkness of the horrific unknown...and is also granted their freedom.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When a player runs out of his own fences, he can only move the pawn.<br/><br/>Placed fences can not be removed. The only limit to placing them is that you can never totally close the enemy pawn: you have to leave a way, no matter how long, to reach its goal.<br/><br/>The game was been licensed to Gigamic for an international edition under the title of Quoridor.

        "description": "In the second half of the twentieth century, faced with the incontrovertible truth that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, the tobacco industry embarked on a campaign of deliberate disinformation while knowingly selling a deadly and highly addictive product. Deeply entrenched in American culture, and with deeper pockets, they leveraged their lobbyists and marketing to avoid regulation and dodge responsibility for a hundred million deaths. A disparate collection of scientists, grassroots activists, politicians, lawyers, and public health officials faced an uphill battle to change the culture, place limits on tobacco advertising, and combat a health crisis of unprecedented scope.<br/><br/>This game from designer Amabel Holland (Nicaea, Endurance) models the asymmetry of this conflict by giving each side a different game. The Company, representing the industry, plays an economic deckbuilder, setting themselves up for big turns, chains of actions, and big profits. The Movement that opposes them is playing a political tableau builder &ndash; slowly coming together and organizing to advocate for legislation and regulation. These two halves, each with its own mechanisms and components, intersect the most fully in the disinformation war. Illustrating Brandolini&rsquo;s Law &ndash; &ldquo;the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it&rdquo; &ndash; the Company player easily muddies the water, while the Movement must work hard to clear it away.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Rules are only four pages long.<br/><br/>You are a member of the King's Court and have been snared into spying for both the King and the Unknown Usurper. The King desires the identity of the Usurper, as well as their loyal supporters- or you're dead. The Usurper wants to know who is loyal to the King and who can be turned- or you're dead. Not only must you survive this delicate balancing act, but at the end of the conflict you must be on the conqueror&rsquo;s side- or you're dead. How did you get entangled in this deadly game? However, the risks do have their rewards: if you are successful you will become the Kingdom's Royal Spymaster, plus you get to live, so it&rsquo;s a game worth playing.<br/><br/>Royal Espionage is a storytelling game where you determine, more or less, how the story unfolds. Immersing yourself in the story and how it plays is part of the purpose and fun of this game. Which court members support the King? Which defect? Where do you end up?

How could I plug the gap?<br/><br/>--Colonel Hans von Luck, 21st Panzer Division on July 18th when Operation Goodwood began.<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Historians have described the British attack near Caen and the Canadian assault against Verrieres Ridge as disasters.  Indeed, following these operations the Germans were able to transfer to the western sector of Normandy much of their surviving armor to deal with the American offensive. Nonetheless, recently discovered material and some oral histories have shown the Allied offensives came close to success.

        "description": "There was a time when Gorgasali, a king of the kings, unified ten kingdoms under the single rule of power. Peculiarly, out of nowhere, King Gorgasali started releasing his inferiors from his castle. Over the course of a couple of months he released all of them from their duty, ordering them to never return. For a long time King Gorgasali was nowhere to be seen, therefore people started to believe that he abandoned his throne. As the time went by, tensions between the kingdoms increased and with the absence of a single ruler, dynasties regained their old influences and the world begun to change. Kingdoms fell into a complete chaos, they started to fight for individual gains through immoral acts of violence. Anarchy spread through the veins of ten kingdoms and the world as it was known before - ended. No place was safe in Elbrus and civilization was on the verge of extinction. Few of the distinguished members of all kingdoms created a council of elders to find a solution and bring back the long forgotten peaceful times. The decision was made to find a sole ruler with undeniable virtue to replace the king of the kings and restore the balance. The battle royal was announced and ten kingdoms sent their best warriors, who would fight on the neutral battlefield to become the lone survivor and earn the crown of the King Gorgasali.<br/><br/>Gorgasali Battle Royale is RPG Battle Royale board game, where you play as a chosen warrior of your kingdom. You start game in random places and collect cards from the chests to fill your inventory. With the better cards you have greater chances to eliminate your opponents. As the game advances you have less place to move without being hurt. The game is full of strategic decisions and variety of possible actions. To win the game you must be the only survivor on the map.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each size of piece is a different &quot;specie&quot; and has different properties of movement. The largest pieces, &quot;Queens&quot;, move like knights in Chess and may only capture the medium pieces, &quot;Drones&quot;. Drones move similarly to Rooks, but with a range of motion limited to 2 squares. Drones may capture only the smallest pieces, &quot;Pawns&quot;. Lastly, Pawns move similarly to Bishops in Chess, with a limited range of motion of 2 squares, and they may only capture the largest pieces, Queens.

        "description": "(This game is currently in prototype phase)<br/><br/>Constructing robots in a fully automated factory is quite a simple job, really. To be honest, it is such a bore that your abilities are hardly even challenged as the head of the robot assembly. Thus you make a bet with the other overseers at the robot assembly line: who can build the best robots the quickest? The loser will buy lunch oil for everyone. There IS the faint chance of someone falling down from the conveyor belts and getting scrapped. Fortunately, those unfortunate robots can be accounted for as collateral damage...<br/><br/>In Robot Factory, players guide their robots in a maze-like factory floor, using conveyor belts that keep moving every turn. Players operate their construction robots by playing programming cards, in an effort to collect parts for the most advanced robots as required by the given assembly instructions. Once a player has enough parts for assembly, they assemble the robots in the assembly lines and are awarded Victory Points. However, the players&rsquo; construction robots may be pushed off the board, and they only have a limited number of &ldquo;lives&rdquo; &ndash; CPU's &ndash; to reboot themselves after falling.<br/><br/>You want to gather all the parts, but so does everyone else. Keep your processor cool and tires on the belt! And Be Aware, this game will knock your Robo Block Off!!<br/><br/>Robot Factory features a pushable grid of tiles that makes the board change every player turn (similar mechanic in Labyrinth). The game packs an hour of fun game-play full of surprises, as players try to push each other off the board and new emerging tiles cause logistical challenges!<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to advance &quot;dragon&quot; pieces onto the opponent's protected area of the board. You control 2 dragons (which move by jumping over and capturing other pieces - as in draughts), 4 lions (can move one space each, or by jumping over other lions or dogs) and 6 dogs (moves 1 or 2 spaces or by jumping other dogs).<br/><br/>Note: This is not the same game as Bushi (1977), which was released as Shing Shang in France. (Confusingly, both this game and Bushi were designed by Henri Sala.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A representative of the 'replay' subgenre. Players run through a game of soccer using a deck of cards and a board, but have no actual control over the events in the basic game (though official variants included in the rule book *do* allow for choices on things like substitutions, making this a game)<br/><br/>From the review by Mike Siggins:<br/><br/>Ellis Simpson has been working on a soccer replay game for almost as long as I've known him. I think, having been privy to certain stages of its development, that the turning point came two years ago and Fastcard Soccer is the outcome. The resulting design emphasizes fast play (an admirable and difficult target), yet manages to retain many of the detailed trappings and flavour so important to the soccer fan. Well, this soccer game fan anyway. Like most replay games it is best enjoyed solitaire, but I have played some two-legged matches recently with a friend and these worked well enough. By way of a caution, please bear in mind throughout this review, as with Final Score, that I know next to nothing about football. What I feel I can comment upon is the atmosphere and game content of the system, and these are both first rate.<br/><br/>The system uses, predictably, a fast action card system that generates almost all of the action. Reference to charts is needed for goal attempts or unusual results (the infamous Z card effects) and the game status levels, essentially the team's overall ratings, are tracked on the pitch display using counters. The rest is a matter of choosing which teams you want to pair off, logging their ratings on the display, and playing the game.<br/><br/>The central structure, to a lazy bugger like me, seems like simplicity itself. Teams are rated for attack, defence and midfield. The latter ratings are compared to see which team wins possession and mounts an attack. A letter is read off, referenced to produce an attack number and then compared to the defence rating; if it is higher, the attack proceeds, if it is lower the attack breaks up, if equal there has been a clearance but the attacker retains possession. The whole setup runs on the highlight system by which, after each complete passage of play, a random number of minutes are marked off on the time display and the game runs through to 90 minutes, or longer if extra time is applicable. This method is now well established and it is an ingenious way of making sure that some ties have a lot of action and chances while other games are much like Arsenal at home to Arsenal. Game length will vary because of the use of highlights, but should take no more than a few minutes per match and it will get quicker as you become familiar with the card turning.<br/><br/>The big selling point for me is that the game features a commentary system that runs straight off the Fastcards themselves. As the attack builds up, you read a comment off the card that may go something like 'A flurry of passes wins a corner; a dipping cross into the box....'. The next card is flipped to reveal, say, 'A header from the back of the six yard box'. The header may go towards the corner of the goal, only to be saved spectacularly or any number of other possibilities. I may be a sucker for atmosphere, but at the speed this all runs (once you are used to the mechanics), it really conjures up the images for me. It is very much like watching the league goals on Match of the Day. Oddly, given one of my criticisms of Final Score, the speedy handling of this seems to negate the problem of not knowing who is on the ball. You can readily work out who has the goal attempt, but it doesn't seem to matter as much who brings the ball upfield.<br/><br/>The slight problem, and the only one in the game really, is that occasionally the commentary pairs don't seem to match up. Although this hasn't yet happened to me in about twenty games, other reviewers have mentioned it and I have seen it happen in the flesh. You might for instance get a header straight at the keeper, only to find him diving to get his fingertips to it. In this instance you can perhaps explain it away by a deflection or perhaps going the wrong way, but it does grate a little even for a man used to rationalising the weirdest German game systems. I can understand why this wasn't picked up (because of the large number of possible outcomes), but it must feel a little odd when it happens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cluesome was an invention of the California NPL (National Puzzlers League) group, but traveling members and conventions have spread it to other parts. It requires a moderately large group of people -- 7 or 8 is barely enough to keep it interesting, 10 is good, and I have seen it played with about 15 players.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to try to give clues for words such that some of the other people will guess the answer, but not more than half. Each player writes 5 words or phrases to be clued on individual note cards, along with his name on each card, and passes them face down to the player on his left. Each player draws one card (without looking) from the ones he is passed, then passes the rest of the cards on. Each player will end up with 5 cards from the 5 players to his right. Each player, in turn, becomes the cluer.<br/><br/>The cluer chooses one of his cards, announces whose card it is, and gives a clue. The clue can be anything at all, as long or short as the cluer wants, even using part of the answer or clues that are wrong (like &quot;the capital of New York&quot; as a clue for New York City). The one limitation is that the cluer can't give a clue that turns the game into a multiple-choice guess among a few choices, such as &quot;a planet&quot; for Saturn or &quot;a capital in New England&quot; for Providence. After the clue is given, each player (other than the cluer and the submitter) has a short time to write down an answer, and then everybody in turn calls out what they have written down.<br/><br/>If nobody gets it right, the cluer has to give another clue. The cluer loses one point for each clue he gives. If anybody guesses it, the cluer tells the correct answer and each of those people score a point. If exactly one person guesses correctly, this is called a &quot;Cluesome&quot; and the cluer gets 3 bonus points. If fewer than half the people guess correctly, then the cluer is done and the next player becomes cluer. If too many people guess correctly, the cluer has failed and must pick another word to clue, and thus lose more points for giving more clues.<br/><br/>",

A successful name means moving a space.  Players are limited in time to call out a successful name by a unique timer.  The timer works by releasing a ball at the top of a ramp leading to a circular funnel type pit.  It takes approximately 10 seconds for the ball to settle into the center pit.  Players start with 4 dice and work down to 2 dice near the end of the board.  A category die is also included when the players have advanced far enough on the board.

There are cards in five colours, but players are only allowed to choose cards of three colours, so the influence on the cards played in the game by the other player might be limited. Also, several icons and numbers, plus some descriptive texts showing different values, powers and abilities of the cards.<br/><br/>The rounds are &quot;days&quot;, in which in a strict order powers, friends, monsters and so on are placed onto the board. This has two personal zones - one for each player - and a neutral zone, in which the monsters are placed and attacked/captured in the main phase of each round. Aim of the game is to capture monsters with the total value of &quot;10&quot; through activating the power cards, but the other player can protect monsters with his/her cards, losing these powers for capturing doing so.<br/><br/>After the &quot;attack / capture&quot; phase, there is a &quot;night phase&quot;, in which several monsters` activities are executed. Some more twists are interlaced in the system of the cards, influencing each other and offering some tactical decisions.<br/><br/>In the starter set there are two decks with 30 cards each - the total of available cards is 111.<br/><br/>Packed in a nice &quot;Bombo&quot; monster figure as storage for cards, player mats and rulebook.<br/><br/>",

It is a strange game, but it is very nice, and regardless the apparent simplicity of some pieces and rules, it is a very complex and deep game. The object of the game is to move TWO pieces, called TRAVELERS, to the last rank,&quot; according to information found on <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.chessvariants.org</a>.<br/><br/>The pieces include:<br/><br/><br/>     Travelers (T): Can move in the eight directions, up-to three positions. A Traveler can't capture pieces, neither being captured. A Traveler can't  move into Check, but if in Check, it is not obligatory that you move your Traveler. When a Traveler reaches the last rank, it can't move, neither being displaced. You win the game if your two Travelers reach the last rank.<br/>     Displacer (D): Can move as Queens. If a Displacer lands on a square orthogonally adjacent to an enemy piece, you can DISPLACE the enemy piece (except a Block) and send it to ANY EMPTY square in the vertical line or the horizontal line defined by the Displacer's landing square. A Displacer can't displace a Traveler that has reached the last rank.<br/>     Block (B): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Block can't capture, neither being captured. Block can't be displaced. A Block can't never move to the first or to the last rank.<br/>     Ace (1): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. An Ace can capture a piece at distance 1 in the eight directions, except a Traveler or a Block.<br/>     Deuce (2): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Deuce can capture a piece at distance exactly 2 in the eight directions, regardless there is or not an intermediate piece in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks.<br/>     Trey (3): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Trey can capture a piece at distance exactly 3 in the eight directions, regardless there are or not intermediate pieces in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks. <br/><br/><br/>You start the games with two Travelers, one Displacer, one Block, four Aces, two Deuces and two treys.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the 2nd Lone Canuck scenario pack that covers WW II actions that involved airborne troops and paratroopers.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules are required.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>Rotterdam, Holland, 10 May 1940:The Allied Forces of Britain, France, Belgium, and even neutral Holland had drawn the majority of their forces up to their borders with Germany in preparation for the seemingly enviable attack by the Germans. The attack on Rotterdam was carried out by 700 Fallschirmj&auml;gers and in a most astonishing and daring attack, a dozen Heinkel HS 59 seaplanes ferried 120 men of the 16th Infantry Regiment into the centre of the city, where they landed on the Maas River&ndash; disembarking the men on the quayside at either end of the bridge...<br/>  <br/>Southwest of Carentan, France, 13 June 1944: The Battle for Carentan lasted three days and by June 12, the 101st Airborne Division had encircled the town in a bold pincher movement. However, just as the American paratroopers were entering the town, the German commander, Major Von der Heydte, facing encirclement and short of ammunition, had that morning ordered his forces to withdraw, and set up a new defensive line southwest of Carentan. Von der Heydte and his Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment 6, were now under command of the just arrived 17th SS-Panzergrenadier Division &ldquo;G&ouml;tz von Berlichingen&rdquo;, whose commander was enraged at Von der Heydte&rsquo;s withdrawal; ordered an immediate counter-attack on Carentan... <br/> <br/>East of Le Mesnil France, 7 June 1944: The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion regrouped at the Le Mesnil crossroads during the night of June 6, where it received a resupply of 3-inch mortars, which it lost in the marshes during the previous night&rsquo;s drop, and much-needed ammunition. The next morning, a strong German infantry force from the German 857th Grenadier Regiment, supported by tanks and self-propelled guns moved into position for an attack; however, were driven off by a salvo of PIAT bombs and bayonet counter-attack by B Company. The Germans withdrew 200 yards back up the road, seeking refuge in a small-fortified farmhouse, from where they continue to harass the Canadian&rsquo;s position with machine-gun fire...<br/><br/> <br/>Riethorst, Holland, 18 September 1944: For Operation Market-Garden, the 82nd Airborne Division had the onerous tasks of seizing the bridge over the Maas at Grave, the railroad bridge over the Maas-Waal Canal, the bridge over the Waal at Nijmegen; and thereafter, hold and secure, the dominating feature located southeast of Nijmegen- the Groesbeek Heights. Because of the threat of imminent attack from the Reichwald, the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s Commanding Office, Major Talton &ldquo;Woody&rdquo; Long responded by sending reinforcements to assist in the defence...<br/> <br/>Nijmegen Holland, 19 September 1944: By early afternoon of 19th, the German forces defending the two Nijmegen bridges were formidable- over 2,000 men, four 88mm guns, and numerous light anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns. Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick &ldquo;Boy&rdquo; Browning, commander of the 1st Airborne Corps told the 82nd&rsquo;s General Gavin, &ldquo;The Nijmegen Bridge must be taken today. At the latest, tomorrow.&rdquo; Gavin immediately ordered the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment to move into Nijmegen and capture the highway and the railroad bridges over the lower Waal. The Western Force responsible for the capture of the railroad bridge was comprised of Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment; a troop of tanks from 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, and a platoon of infantry from the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards...<br/><br/><br/>South of Hamminkeln, Germany, 24 March 1945: For Operation Varsity, the British 6th Airborne Division would drop and land on the northern half of the area. Its objectives were the high ground east of Bergen, the town of Hamminkeln, and certain bridges over the Ijssel. The 1st Battalion, The Royal Ulster Rifles of the 6th Airlanding Brigade was tasked to land on LZ &ldquo;U&rdquo; to the south of Hamminkeln and seize the bridge over the Ijssel River on the main road to Brunen. D Company, commanded by Major Tony Dyball, landed on LZ &ldquo;U1&rdquo; which was astride the Ijssel, his own glider touching down in the lead about 150 yards from the bridge, which was the objective. As it landed, it came under fire from a machine-gun 75 yards away &hellip;<br/><br/>",

You control a small group of workers who have been hired to trade your goods in the market on the island of Kos. The three goods available in the market at Kos are: fish, olive oil, and wine. In order to trade, your workers must first set up stalls in the marketplace.  Your workers must then try to maintain control of these stalls while attempting to control stalls placed by the other merchants.  Scoring takes place at the end of each of the 4 rounds. You receive market points for laying stalls in the market, for having the most influence around a stall, for moving your workers, and for influencing different unique stalls. The merchant with the most market points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A rummy-like word card game that was approved by the California Dept. of Education.<br/><br/>The deck has 72 cards 68 cards with a letter and a value (2-9), and 4 jokers which act like wild cards.<br/><br/>The basic game is Dealer's Choice: the dealer chooses how many to deal per player, and announces the winning condition, e.g. &quot;Make one word using all 5 cards&quot;, &quot;Make two words using all 7 cards&quot;, &quot;Make the name of a state&quot;, etc.  In a turn a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, and either goes out by revealing their hand with the winning condition, or discards 1 card.<br/><br/>Usually each hand is a separate game, but one proposed scoring method is to concatenate the values of the first two cards, e.g. the letters D,O,R,S,W are worth 5, 7, 5, 2 &amp; 6, so &quot;SWORD&quot; scores 26, but &quot;WORDS&quot; scores 67.  (Jokers are treated like a 0.)<br/><br/>Other games described include:<br/><br/>Lions &amp; Tigers: Leave out Jokers, and deal 8-12 per player.  Players meld words during their turn, and may add letters to words on the table, rearranging them to make new words, and adding them to their own possessions.  Players may draw the top 3 of the discard pile.  A hand ends when a player empties their hand.  Players score for the length of their words on the table (5 letter word =&gt; 20 points, plus 20 more for letter over 5), and subtract 10 for each letter in hand.<br/><br/>Solitaire: Lay 7 cards face up, make any words you can, replacing the vacated spaces.  Then deal cards in groups of 3, and use the top card to make words with the others and/or fill empty spaces.  Previous words can be expanded and/or combined together.<br/><br/>Group Word-Formation: (suggested for ESL students)  Spread the cards face-up on a table, and ask the students to find letters for words in a particular subject, e.g. body parts, food, etc.<br/><br/>Letter Recognition: (suggested for pre-schoolers)  Spread the cards on a table and have the child pick 3 letters and see if they make a word.  The parent can suggest letters to get, and can show what the word stands for when a word is spelled right.<br/><br/>",

Compatible with any complete game in the series, this Expansion Kit enlivens even the most well-trod battlefields.<br/><br/>Also included is a complete expansion game for Borodino 20 dubbed Gzhatsk 20. This is where the battle of Borodino should have been fought, were it not for bitter rivalry and jealousies among the changing Russian high command.<br/><br/>The Napoleonic 20 Series continues to find new recruits among gamers for its modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. The addition of now-expanded &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns provides the operational pauses and &quot;friction of war&quot; that gives players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!<br/><br/>Complexity: 4.5 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: 5 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex is about 1000 meters, and each turn is roughly 3.5 day hours (or 10 night hours).<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>&gt; One 4-page, color instructions booklet, with Optional rules and Designers Notes<br/>&gt; One 2-page sheet of Exclusive rules.<br/>&gt; 32 color, die-cut 5/8&quot; mounted game pieces<br/>&gt; 28 random event cards<br/>&gt; One 11&quot; x 17&quot; color game map<br/>&gt; Two Tactical Matrix player aids<br/><br/>",

Of course, you don&rsquo;t go to the auctions yourself (people would talk); you send a servant over with instructions to bid so much and not a penny more. And if you lose out to one of your clubmates...well, you&rsquo;re ashamed to admit it but you might be a bit of a sore loser...<br/><br/>At the end of the year, you want to end up with as much of your favourite stuff as possible. Still, it is important to have a balanced collection, too.
