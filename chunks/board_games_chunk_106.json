        "description": "This is a game for ages 5 and up. The box contains a board, 4 wooden pawns, 1 die, 7 castle cards and 27 equipment cards.<br/><br/>The board shows a tract around a robbers castle. The castle has 7 entrances. The castle cards are placed face down on these entrances. The castle cards are showing robbers, vermin or the treasure.<br/><br/>There are 3 kinds of equipment cards : hats, keys and boats. The cards of the same kind have a similar look. The cards are placed next to the board, one stack per kind.<br/><br/>Each player gets a pawn and tries to get the treasure out of the castle.<br/><br/>On your turn you roll the die and move your pawn accordingly. An action takes place when your pawn ends on a special field. <br/>When your pawn lands on a boat field, you get a boat card. Landing on a hat field gives you a hat card and landing on a key field gives you a key card.<br/>When your pawn ends on a sleeping robber, you can roll a second time. A horse helps you move faster, if your pawn lands on a horse field you can move to a field of your choice.<br/>If you land on a fallen tree field, you have to skip one turn and landing on the bridge will cause you to lose all your equipment cards.<br/><br/>If your pawn arrives on an already occupied field, you can take one equipment card of the player whose pawn was already on that field.<br/><br/>Your pawn can go to the castle if he lands on a pier. Therefor you have to hand in one of each of the three kinds of equipment cards. On your next turn your pawn can move on one of the 7 castle cards and turn it face up. If that castle card shows a spider, a ghost or a bat , you can turn the card face down again and move 1 field further. If the castle card shows a robber you have to start all over again.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a player has found the treasure card.<br/><br/>",

Their boxes, boards and pieces were obviously of a smaller size than NAC&acute;s regular games, and also their prices (I seem to recall that I paid about 700 pesetas by then).<br/><br/>Contents were: a 24x38 cms board, 112 counters, a tray for them, a special die, sheets and rules.<br/><br/>The game was conceived for two players, being its duration from about 30 to 120 minutes and its difficulty 5 in the NAC scale (high).<br/><br/>Counters could be organized in groups. The pieces within them were put aside on the grouping sheets, and numbered group counters were moved on the board. This was the first time I saw this method in a NAC game. They were really getting better and more &quot;serious&quot; comparing to the first ones they published...<br/><br/>",

The planets are connected with thick planet routes, the space stations with thinner space station routes, and the meteorites with dotted meteorite routes. Movement is done with movement tickets, which are won by throwing a die.<br/><br/>Each planet is the home planet of a player's space ship, thus up to 6 people can play a game.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to visit all 6 space station of the own colour and return to the home planet first. This can be rather difficult, because 18 &quot;magnetic fields&quot; block the same number of routes. Besides moving his space ship during his turn, a player takes any magnetic field and places it on a new route.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Scenario cards contain the first part of a sentence, like this: &quot;Sorry, I can't hear any more stories about your children...&quot; Players then have to submit the funniest/rudest/most offensive excuse to get out of that situation. That might be something like this: &quot;Sorry, I can't hear any more stories about your children... I trusted a fart and now I'm at DEFCON brown.&quot; The player that's deemed to have submitted the best card gets to keep the scenario card as a way of keeping score. The winner is the first player to get to 10 scenario cards.<br/><br/>So, whether you&rsquo;re after something new for a games night or looking for the perfect drinking game at your next house party, this one is sure to induce fits of semi-nervous laughter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Enigma of Leonardo: Quintis Fontis is a specialized version of &quot;The Enigma of Leonardo&quot; designed for hardcore players, for those, that considered the core version too simple. Designed for those players, that enjoy strategic planning and quick thinking.<br/><br/>QF is played using the same cards as the core set &ndash; each card has two symbols on it, there are 12 different symbols altogether. Most of the cards are identical to the ones in the core set, while others have different symbol combinations on them. The set also includes a few special text cards (action cards).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is the same as in The Enigma of Leonardo, to collect Secret Keys, by making sequences of identical symbols but this time the game is played on one big field. The field itself is made during game play, the only restriction being its size &ndash; 5x5 cards. The first card is placed in the middle of the playing field, players then take turns at playing cards, increasing the field. In the end, the first card that was played might not even be in the middle anymore, it could be on the edge.<br/><br/>Players can not only play cards on empty spaces, they can play cards on top of each other and can even replace cards from their hands with the ones on the playing field. The only condition is that the cards being replaced must share a common symbol. This playing mechanic allows for more complex combos, by careful planning, one can gradually replace all the cards on the field with symbols that the player needs.<br/><br/>Just like in The Enigma of Leonardo, in QF players receive Secret Keys when they successfully make a row of cards with the same symbol. But now you can get symbols not only for 3 cards in a row, but for four and even five identical symbols. Qunitis fontis actually means &ndash; &ldquo;the fifth symbol&rdquo;, when translated from Latin. Rows can be made horizontally, diagonally and vertically just like in the core game but now you can receive the same key more than once by first making a row of three symbols and then adding cards with the fourth and fifth symbol.<br/><br/>But it sounds much easier than it actually is. The game now uses a special counter-marker called &ldquo;veto&rdquo;. After playing a card, the player may choose to move the marker on any card (even the one he just played) on the playing field. The next player cannot play any cards that share a symbol with the marked card. It&rsquo;s up to the players to decide should they move the marker each turn or keep it in one place blocking a certain symbol combination for the entire game.<br/><br/>Another new addition to QF are the action cards. There aren&rsquo;t much compared to another expansion of the game The Enigma of Leonardo &ndash; Novem &ndash; but they can alter the flow of the game. With these cards you can steal symbols from your opponents and prevent them from gaining new ones.<br/><br/>The player who successfully collects seven Keys is the winner. If the deck is used up and no one has collected seven Keys, the one to collect the most is the winner. In case of a tie a key gradation has been provided.<br/><br/>QF is basically a harder version of The Enigma of Leonardo: the rules are different but the cards used are practically identical. Meaning you can try playing The Enigma of Leonardo using QF or vice versa. It will be a slightly different game, but it&rsquo;s still possible.<br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    The Enigma of Leonardo<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player then takes it in turn to roll the number dice and move their train along the allotted spaces, they must then give an answer from the category they land on using the last letter from the previous players answer as the starting letter of their answer...and so on.<br/><br/>For example<br/>The game is in full flow and it's your turn, the player to your right has left you on an 'E' by saying Bruce leE (they were on the actor/actress square). You roll the dice, you move four spaces and land on the music square. You only have 60 seconds to say the name of a group or singer whose name begins with an 'E'.<br/><br/>Who do you say...the sands of time are slipping away...if you don't say a name soon you will lose one of your passengers, there's only a few seconds left...what about Elvis presleY. It gets you out of trouble and leaves the next player on a 'Y', they could now be the one in trouble with you taking one of their passengers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;After centuries of squabbling and fighting mankind finally came to terms with itself in the 26th Century. A United Earth Government was formed, putting all the resources of the Earth into the Colonization of the Solar System. Mars became colonized, using vast agricultural schemes to promote a more healthy atmosphere; the steamy jungles of Venus were controlled and made habitable. In the 27th Century the Solar Federation was formed. Man now looked to the stars to expand further. The Federation's nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, some four and a quarter light years away, was explored and found to contain three habitable planets - Titan, Poseidon and Vidor. These were soon colonized by eager migrants from the Solar Federation's teeming<br/>millions. The Galactic Federation was formed.<br/>It is now the year 2975, and once again war threatens Mankind. The Galactic Federation is split and the Solar Federation finds itself fighting against the Proxima Centauri Alliance. Both sides have agreed not to violate the planets but to settle the conflict on a much larger battlefield - deep space. Both sides have similar space navies and also, because both developed from the same culture, similar weapons and defense systems. The only difference lies in the tactical capabilities of the spaceship commanders. You now have the chance to command a fleet of spaceships to see who rules the two star systems.&quot;<br/><br/>One of several titles released by Tabletop Games which were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a map) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming.

It is played on an n&times;n board with n-1 cars for each player&mdash;two cars each on a 3&times;3 board is enough for an interesting game, but larger sizes are also possible.<br/><br/>The board is initially set up with n-1 blue cars along the left edge and n-1 red cars along the bottom edge, the bottom left square remaining empty. Turns alternate: player 1 (&quot;Left&quot;)'s turn is to move any one of the blue cars one space forwards (right) or sideways (up or down). Player 2 (&quot;Right&quot;)'s turn is to move any one of the red cars one space forwards (up) or sideways (left or right).<br/><br/>Cars may not move onto occupied spaces. They may leave the board, but only by a forward move. A car which leaves the board is out of the game.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who first has no legal move on their turn because all their cars are either off the board or blocked in by their opponent.<br/><br/>[From Wikipedia: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgem</a>]<br/><br/>",

The game is the same as the original Aku Ankka trivia game with added stuff.<br/><br/>A trivia game developed in cooperation with the Finnish Donald Duck magazine. The questions have a heavy emphasis on stories by Carl Barks and Don Rosa.<br/><br/>The board is divided into six decades (1950's through 2000's), representing six decades of the Finnish Donald Duck magazine. At the center of the board is the &quot;Time Machine&quot; through which players must travel from one decade to the next.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to travel to all six decades and earn a Donald Duck magazine from every decade by answering correctly to a trivia question about that decade's stories. The first player to return to the Time Machine with all six magazines wins the game. Along the way there are spaces that, for example, give you an Action Card that can assist in the game, let you continue on after answering a trivia question correctly, give you a new dice throw, or make you lose all your Action Cards.<br/><br/>",

As cities crumble and fall to the onslaught, a few civilizations bravely gather resources to send the remnants of humanity out into space in a last ditch attempt to keep the species alive. Your people have gathered into two great cities awaiting word on how you will ship them to another world, their new home. It is time to Abandon Earth.<br/><br/>Introducing the first of the Bagged Game Originals (&quot;BGO&quot;) series, Abandon Earth by designer Tom Decker is a multiplayer game in which you aim to get your people to a new world that they can call home. Manage your actions wisely by searching for survivors, researching new technology, training and sending off marines to fight back, and launching rockets containing the last remaining survivors of Planet Earth. Score more Victory Points before everyone else and declare yourself (and your people) victorious!<br/><br/>Each turn you are limited to one action per remaining city that you control. You will be able to choose between developing your infrastructure, researching technology, spending resources, or counter-attacking the aliens. Developing your infrastructure will allow you to search for refugees, train marines, or work on building a new, powerful underground city. Researching technology may allow you to send your colony ships further into space to better planets. After choosing your actions, you will be able to launch one of your ships, should you choose, into space and to a new world. Finally, your turn  ends with an alien attack. As the neutral cities fall around you, your cities become increasingly attractive targets for the aliens. <br/> Will you be able to escape earth before your last cities fall? Can you deliver your remaining citizens safely and peacefully to a new world? Get ready to blast off and Abandon Earth!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 2 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>",

But technology for safe navigation and forecasting the weather is also far off. So the ships often wander into big storms or meet rapacious pirates.Your crew grows <br/>tired and cannot work well. Will you cross the sea safely?<br/><br/>Each player takes at first ten Crew chips. These are powerful sailors and each player decides what number will work today by placing Crew chips in their fists, and then opening them at the same time. Then an Event card is drawn, and the effect is applied to all players.<br/><br/>This means, if many sailors are working, meeting pirates does not tire them. But for the same number of crew, intense heat will exhaust them. Some of the exhausted sailors are discarded, indicated by the number on the Event card. The game continues in this way.<br/><br/>Let's wish you Bon Voyage!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Don Martin's Kartenspiel is an excellently funny card game with an own special deck which contains 82 cards: 64 colored cards in 8 different texts and in 4 different colors plus 18 black &amp; white action cards. The complete box includes also a couple of spare cards, some measurement cards that can be used to measure the size of your ear, and a c-cassette containing sound effects from the cards.<br/><br/>A single round of this game begins by dealing each player a certain amount of cards (10 - 16) depending on the number of players - more cards with less players. On each round every player has two goals: to get rid of all his/her cards, and to collect sets of 3+ colored cards with a same text.<br/><br/>During each round The first player who manages to empty his/her hand wins the round but isn't necessarily the player who receives the most points. That's because the most points are awarded from the collected sets. The winner, however, receives bonus points according to the cards still left in the hands of other players and other players get a lot of penalty from those cards. There is also a 100 point bonus awarded for a player who wins the round with only a single set on the board.<br/><br/>The game is played over multiple rounds which all are scored. The winner is the player who first reaches 500 points. Because the amount of points gained from a round can vary from -150 to +450 the games can last forever or only for less than an hour.<br/><br/>The fun part of the game is that when a player plays a card he/she must say what's printed in the card, like: &quot;Splappa dap!&quot;, &quot;Arra Argh Yargh&quot;, or &quot;Fippaditty Fappaditty Fappa daMap!&quot; It comes naturally after a few games, believe me.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 21st Century's Explosive New Card Game! Move over Poker, there's a new card game in town! The2101Game! It's an exciting new card game that combines skill and luck with a unique twist to provide the ultimate card gaming experience. The2101Game is a very easy game to learn, and it can be played with as many as 11 players. The pot grows with rapid speed, giving every player an opportunity to win BIG! So if you're feeling lucky get your family, friends, and fellow gamers together and start playing The2101Game. The2101Game caters to people of all different gaming backgrounds. From the avid gamers to non-gamers alike, they all agree that The2101Game is one of the simplest yet most complex games that they have ever played. People who are typically and instantly drawn to this game are people who play poker, spades, rummy, Phase 10, and Uno although just having a general knowledge of cards is all you need to play The2101Game.<br/><br/>The2101Game is played with two decks of cards minus a 2 of diamonds, a 10 of clubs, and an Ace of spades.<br/><br/>To start play everyone is dealt 3 sets of cards which are 3 pocket cards (these cards go in your hand and are for your eyes only!), 3 face up cards, and 3 face down cards (which go over above the face up cards). The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all 9 of your cards by first playing all of your pocket cards, then all of your face up cards, then finally all of your face down cards. All you have to do is match or beat the card on the pile and if you can't, you pick up the entire pile and must play them all before you play any new cards unless you have  &quot;2101 cards&quot;, also referred to as wild cards. There are 3 &quot;2101 cards&quot; which are the 2, 10, and Ace. The 10 is the highest of the 3 cards. When played, the 10 clears the pile and also gives the player another turn. The Ace is the second highest &quot;2101 card&quot;. It has no special powers but is just considered high. The lowest &quot;2101 card&quot; is the 2. When played the 2, also referred to as the &quot;any card&quot;, starts the pile back low. It can be played on any card and any card can be played on top of it. You can only play your face up cards once you have no pocket cards left and you can only play your face down cards when you have no face up or pocket cards. Pocket cards must be played one at a time unless you have multiples. Multiple cards of the same value can be played together but is not mandatory and suits do not matter. Face Up cards must be played the same way but if you can not beat the card on the pile with one of your face up cards you must pocket that card that you were unable to play along with the entire pile. Face down cards are also played one at a time but once you touch a face down card that is the card you must use. If you can not beat the card on the pile with the chosen face down card you must pocket that card along with the entire pile.<br/><br/>The betting element is what makes the game more interesting. There are 4 betting stages. First the table bet (this is a predetermined amount to get cards (similar to an ante). Second bet is the pocket bet. This bet is made after the cards are dealt but before any cards are played and is initiated by the person with the highest set of face up cards. The &quot;2101 cards&quot; are what is typically looked for when determining who has the highest set of face up cards.  The third bet is the face up bet. The face up bet is initiated by the first player to get to their face up cards without having any pocket cards. The fourth bet is the face down bet. The face down bet is initiated by the first person to get to their face down cards without having any face up or pocket cards. When a bet is initiated, starting to the left of the initiator, players must match the bet to continue in the round. Players also have the option to raise when their turn comes around. If a player does not want to make the bet they must fold their hand and forfeit any already wagered chips.<br/><br/><br/>    Note - once a player puts their bet on the table it can no longer be removed even if the player changes their mind and decides to fold. Betting in turn can significantly reduce the chances of this happening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Note - When 4 cards of the same value are played on to the pile it constitutes a clear as a 10 would and also gives the player who played the fourth consecutive card another turn.<br/><br/><br/>",

Eventually, the defender will either have prevented the attacker from stealing the treasure, or the attacker will make off with the treasure, winning the game.

As the hordes multiplied, conflict became commonplace, splintering the population into rival citadels. Eventually, war, greed, and the depletion of resources pushed Fantos to the brink of destruction, and in response to the planet's cry for help, Zodraz, the Cosmic Warden, intervened, sentencing the planet to a great cull to be survived by only a single worthy citadel.<br/><br/>Fate of Fantos: The Iridium Wars is a tableau-building card game with competitive and co-operative elements for 3-6 players, each assuming the role of a unique citadel of Fantos. Each are responsible for hiring acolytes to manage their affairs, with the ultimate goal of obtaining the most Iridium, and therefore the most favorable position when Zodraz finally arrives.<br/><br/>Citadels must manage their Iridium harvesting strategically, however, as it further contributes to the pollution of Fantos, revealing new trials along the way. Zodraz also unleashes plagues, summons cosmic creatures, and forces dissent between the citadels as the game progresses. Citadels must choose whether to resolve them together as a planet, or watch as rival citadels struggle to survive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Read My Lips, players try to guess words and phrases by observing the lip movements of other players.  The game is played in pairs who take alternating roles: a lipper, who mouths the words and phrases, and a lipreader.<br/><br/>Each team takes turns to flick a spinner and move their lips token by the resultant number.  The color of the lips of the space the token lands on determines the category of the word or phrase for the round.  The spinner also points to the mode of play and the time limit for the round.  One mode has the team's lipper performing for all to guess, another mode makes the play private to the team.  Yet another makes it a free for all.  The lipper cannot make any sound or gesture; otherwise, his team forfeits its turn.<br/><br/>The first team to get two words in each of all 6 categories wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Getting To Know You...Better was created for two people, any age, dating, married or just friends.  It's an ideal gift for Christmas, Valentine's, weddings, bridal showers, anniversaries, birthdays or whenever the players want to share a wonderful time together.<br/><br/>How is it played?  Each player privately selects an activity from a List of Prizes.  As the players move around the board, they answer questions about their life experiences, preferences, wishes and attitudes.  Some cards offer the players an opportunity to guess what their partner would select as his/her choice.<br/><br/>The questions are often humorous, always entertaining and are carefully written so that embarrassing or uncomfortable subjects are avoided.<br/><br/>At a future date, the person who loses the Game arranges for the activity that the winner has chosen.  However, because the players share the activity, both players actually win.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Der Schwarze Prinzor &quot;The Black Prince&quot;<br/><br/>This is an abstract conflict game along the lines of chess, with high production values for its time, in which 2 players aim to capture the central piece of the opponent's army. The rules stress that is based on the first major land battle of the Hundred Years' War, the 1345 Battle of Cr&eacute;cy, but only if you ignore factors as terrain, the tactics of the time, the fact that the French had twice as many troops, the decisive deployment of the longbow by the Welsh and English archers, and that there was only one Black Prince (on the English side). And that it actually took place in 1346, on August 26.<br/><br/>So, stripped of any historical constraints, both Field Commanders now oversee 2 identical armies, consisting of 4 different soldier classes, each with different movement options, but also, like chess, of equal capturing strength. Besides armies on the board, both players always have 3 special cards which are the main engine behind the thrust of the game.<br/><br/>Whether an attack is successful or not doesn't depend on the attacking piece, but if the attack card, that gets played with each attack, can be stopped by a suitable counter card held by the defender. Since players always have a hand-size of three cards, the battles are not decided by clever maneuvering and the interaction of different pawn abilities, but simply by the luck of the draw. Nothing will save you if you have the wrong cards.<br/><br/>Combining a chess-like game with card play was a nice idea, but unfortunately the way it was implemented simply reduced the board game element to a mere sideshow, and put luck firmly at the center of each victory.<br/><br/>Publication history: one of Johann R&uuml;ttinger's earliest games, and when it appeared by Noris Spiele in 1983 it even became his second nomination for Spiel des Jahres in two years, after &quot;Vokabo&quot; made the shortlist in 1982.<br/><br/>",

The board has a circular track with a number of spaces representing Australian &amp; International businesses (of which all contributed to have the game published).

The cost of 'chairs' are controlled by the current economic climate, which can vary. Cash is received from players landing on businesses owned by other players ('rents'), using a multiplier depending on the number of chairs owned. Other spaces on the board control the economic climate, income &amp; sales tax payments, receiving dividends &amp; buying or selling of new chairs. <br/>The game ends after a pre-determined time (90 minutes is suggested in the rules leaflet), at which time the player with the largest net worth wins (consisting of cash on hand plus the  current value of chairs).<br/><br/>",

The board consists of a square perimeter track and three &quot;runways&quot; approaching a corner, through which pieces enter and exit the board.  The object of the game is to be the first to move one's pieces onto the board via a runway, around the course to the centre, around the course again and bear off via the runway.<br/><br/>",

You either have to point out the right and exact location of the number or image that is stated on the track. The tricky thing is that the caps move around the board as a result of some orders. Some orders on the track are simple, and need you to pin point 1 image or number. Other orders force yoy to point out for example, 3 fruits or 3 figures. Every player has 3-7 playcards. everytime they slip out during the game by not pointing out the right items, they loose one playcard (it is flipped to the stop-side). The player who keeps at least one card in play while the others are played out, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

When one fairy has won a gem of each of the five colors, they win!<br/><br/>The basic game uses the classic game of War (players win duels by flipping over the top three cards of their deck and comparing who has the highest cards in a best-of-three fashion) combined with other elements to introduce the players to &quot;gamery&quot; skills (collection, special powers, and randomness).<br/><br/>There are also more advanced ways to play, so the game can grow with or adapt to kids. New concepts include (push-your-luck, hand ranks, informed guessing, discard pile awareness, etc.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is from 1900 and was published by the J. Ottmann Litho Company of New York.<br/><br/>The directions say that Commerce is &quot;the most amusing game on the market&quot;<br/><br/>The game is comprised of a deck of cards with 8 suits<br/> (Pork, Sugar, Cotton, Corn, Coffee, Oats, Flour and Butter) of 6 cards in each suit, making 48 cards in all.<br/><br/>After shuffling the cards, deal each player 6 cards. Each player sorts the cards that they have and then decides which suit they will try to corner.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to obtain all of the cards of one suit by trading with other players.<br/><br/>To play you take from your hand a card or cards of similar suite and holding them up call &quot;Trade 2 or trade 3. All players do that at the same time so there is lots of yelling going on. Sorta like what happens on the New York Stock Exchange. People make trades of cards. So you could trade 2 with someone else then find that the 2 that you receive match a card or two that you already have in your hand and now you might try and trade 3 for 3. When the first player succeeds in getting all of the cards in a suit the player calls &quot;corner&quot; shows the cards to everyone else. First player to get 3  corners wins!<br/><br/>",

Players secretly and simultaneously select three ships from their hand of five, then reveal the chosen three.  Each ship has three combat values, namely aircraft, big guns, and torpedoes.  If there are four or more aircraft carriers, then the battle will be a carrier battle, and all ships use their aircraft.  If, instead, there are five or more battleships, all ships will use their big guns.  Otherwise, the ships will employ their torpedoes.  Once the type of battle is identified, the players total their combat strengths, then compare them.  The player with the higher total sinks one of the opponent's ships.  Generally, the loser selects the ship to sacrifice; however, if the winner has double or more the combat value of the loser, then the winner sinks whichever ship she likes.  Once the decks are exhausted, the round is complete, and the player who has sunk the higher total victory point value of ships wins the round.  Winning two rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The mystical and hysterical game of Trust Me, I'm Psychic might change your thinking!<br/><br/>In this unpredictable game of predictions, one player acts as the Customer, asking a question about their future that the Psychics must answer. All other players act as Psychics, and are dealt a Vision card that tells them if they are a true Psychic or a Fraud. All the players who are true Psychics see the same tarot-inspired image that they can use to craft a fortune for the customer. The Frauds do not see the picture, and will just have to wing it (with some help from the Cursed Words clues on their card)!<br/><br/>The Customer asks a question on any subject about his or her future. Will I win the lottery? Will I find true love this year? Whether you are a Psychic or a Fraud, use your imagination to spin a fantastical fortune for the Customer. Of course, fortune-telling is not as easy as it seems. Psychics and Frauds must avoid speaking the forbidden Cursed Words listed at the bottom of their cards. If your fellow Psychics/Frauds catch you saying a Cursed Word, you'll get a Curse Token.<br/><br/>If you tell a convincing fortune the Customer rewards you with a token and gets to look at your card. If the Customer chose a true Psychic, they can use the image on the card to deduce who the remaining Psychics are. But if the Customer accidentally pays a Fraud, he or she gets a Curse Token.<br/><br/>The game ends after each player has a turn being the Customer. The player with the most money tokens (after subtracting Curse Tokens)wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A simple tactical hex-and-counter game of small-scale boarding actions in space.<br/><br/>The counters represent individual combatants (referred to as &quot;characters&quot; in the rules). There can be up to twenty boarding and twenty defending characters. Each character is individually rated in four categories: Wounds, Offensive Class, Armor, and Weapons. The value for each category will range from 0-2 based on points assigned by the controlling player (four points are allotted to each character).<br/><br/>An optional rule allows for character advancement for every ten (!) missions a character survives (which seems like long odds in a game that is always a battle to the death). Other optional rules include written orders, facing, initiative determination for each unit, and a different allocation of character construction points for multi-player scenarios. Team play is offered as part of the scenario creation rules.<br/><br/>Rulebook Excerpts<br/><br/>You have received orders from Fleet Command to capture a ship and have jumped from your shuttle onto the landing bay of the enemy craft. The orders are repeated over the headset: &quot;Capture the ship intact; no prisoners are to be taken.&quot; You do not know the reason for the order nor do you care. As mission commander, your sole concern is the successful completion of your mission with as few casualties as possible.<br/><br/>From your bunk you hear the klaxon blaring. Startled from sleep, you realize that your ship is under siege and listen for further orders. &quot;They must not leave the ship alive.&quot; There is no time for questions; you only know that you must kill the invaders before they kill you.<br/><br/>Designers' Notes:<br/><br/>After carefully reviewing the board, it should be obvious that SPACE WARRIOR is a game of movement. Be careful not to stray too far from the wall that can provide cover or a hatchway that can provide escape. We strongly recommend the use of the optional rules. These rules enlivened the game during play-testing at the expense of only a few minutes of additional playing time.<br/><br/>",

Hidden amongst the Clover cards are Who Cards, a special Who named Jo-jo, Jungle Animal Cards, and Beezle-Nut Oil Cards. Players flip cards starting at the outside edge and proceeding orthogonally until they collect a Who, or run into an Animal stopper. Cards are then re-flipped face down. Once a player finds three Who cards, he or she must then find the Jo-jo card to win the game. The game is designed for ages 4 and up.<br/><br/>",

Players compete for contracts with computer manufacturers, network developers, and military suppliers. The opportunities for following directions, problem-solving, and social brinkmanship are many. Jim McBurney has detailed each technology on the cards, but no knowledge of computers or technology is necessary for play, any more than you need a degree in hotel management to play Monopoly.<br/><br/>Some players may miss the familiar names like Board Walk or Marvin Gardens, but techies will appreciate being able to buy UNISYS &quot;A&quot; SERIES and XEROX ETHERNET.<br/><br/>",

Oh, Christmas...&quot;<br/><br/>Han Heidema gave out specially designed games as Christmas cards; one for every year from 1990 to 1999. This was card #7 and was sent out in 1996. It features artwork by Peter Mulder.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player will roll a die to determine the number of &quot;Nut Points&quot; (action points) available. These points are spent to cook one's own chestnuts without burning them and then to eat them, as well as to burn the other player's chestnuts. The game ends when all of one's player's chestnuts are burnt or eaten. Each eaten chestnut is one positive point and each burnt chestnut is one negative point. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

A 'figure 8' circuit is included and introduces players to the Wild Canyons terrain. All you need to add are three six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Players can choose to move at fast speed to allow them to make maneuvers or go flat out at Furious speed. This decision dictates the number of dice they roll and the options they have during their move.<br/><br/>Players can pick up Fatigue during the race which can have an adverse effect on their performance at the later stages of the race. However, this can be managed and creates an ongoing 'risk assessment' aspect to the game in addition to choosing when to switch lanes and other situational decisions.<br/><br/>There is an accessory pack available for the game which includes 4 plastic miniature racing cars, 3 dice and 4 Special Ability cards which add an extra dimension to the games.<br/><br/>The Basic Game is also supported by expansion 'Toolkits', the first of which is the Wild Canyons which adds extra 'track sections' allowing players to design and create their own tracks and circuits.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    minizoomerz: Wild Canyons Toolkit<br/><br/><br/>",

The first deck contains lighter questions such as, &quot;If our family inherited a million dollars, I would like for us to _______.&quot; Most of the questions in the first deck are about families in general and not about individual members of the family. The second deck is composed of more specific questions, such as describing your feelings about other family members or explaining how you felt when a family-member hurt your feelings. Other cards allow the player to talk about any subject they choose.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards and answering the questions on them in a few sentences. Most of the rules are considered as guidelines, such as the &quot;hint&quot; to keep your answers fairly short, but the Rule of Silence during another player's answer must be observed.<br/><br/>As with other games in the Ungame series, there is no winner or loser. The object of the game is to spend quality time with your family and learn more about the thought and feelings of those closest to you.<br/><br/>",

The object in Piggy is to collect all four cards the same.  The first player decides on a card they don;t want and pass it to the player on their left.  Play continues, with players deciding on whether to draw a new card from the deck or pass one of their own.  Once a player has collected their set of 4, they stick out their tongue!  As other players notice, they follow suit.  The last person to notice receives a letter token P, I, G, G, or Y.

A secondary goal was to make a dice game that is not completely multiple solitaire. The resulting game is played with 5 dice, hence the name, which is Japanese for '5 dice'.<br/><br/>Every turn a player decides what 'development' he or she wants to roll for. These 'developments' change the nature of the game. Some allow re-rolling a die, others change how the dice-roll result is converted into a score or points. To achieve a certain development, at least a certain score has to be rolled. This required score increases with each development achieved. If a player rolls particularly high he/she can choose to take points rather than achieve the development he/she was rolling for. If there are no more developments available, the player must roll for points. The game ends when one player chooses to take points for the tenth time. The game takes about 10 minutes per player.<br/><br/>",

At the start of game, each player takes turns placing their pieces in their starting zone. North's starting zone is at the top of the board, South's starting zone is at the bottom. North's starting zone is South's victory zone, and similarly, South's starting zone is North's victory zone. Once the placement phase has completed, the player's take turns moving one of their stones. The first player to move all of their pieces to the victory zone such that all piece colors match the color markings of the victory zone, wins.<br/><br/>Umbra has a puzzle like quality to it.<br/><br/>PIECE MOVEMENT:<br/>Once all pieces have been placed, a piece can move in one of the follwing ways:<br/><br/>STEP move - The piece can move to any adjacent position. <br/>JUMP move - The piece can perform a non-capturing jump over an enemy piece as long as the target position advances the piece towards the victory zone. <br/>SWAP move - If your piece is adjacent to an enemy piece and the enemy piece is in your victory zone, the positions of the two pieces are exchanged.<br/>Note: To make the move, drag your piece and drop it over the enemy piece. <br/><br/><br/>",

These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for these.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn.  This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "No matter their race, origin or desires, everyone has the right to be a child. Be it a knight or a magician, when we lie down to sleep the unconscious thoughts seem to transcend all realities. It is up to us, which is the connection between desire and thought, and the best children to all as persons. There are so many dreams created that are not so much that they have nicknamed our house of Factory of Dreams!<br/><br/>Take control of a mystical character such as Fairy, Unicorn, Gnome or Ente and build the dreams that citizens both crave in thoughts. Each character has a special ability that assists in their production and each citizen's card has a different dream to be built. During a match, it is necessary to send out items and emotions cards on the table according to what each citizen card is demanding.<br/><br/>How about joining that magnificent sword, a little courage, and giving the Warrior the glory of that very successful moment for him to kill the fearless Dragon ... in his dreams, of course! Can you be the best mystic in the game and be the employee of the month in the Factory of Dreams? Come and test your gifts, come and dream of us!<br/><br/>GAME SETUP: Each player stands at one end of the table. Your position is important because it determines whether a Desire card is valid for you or not according to the arrows of the cards. All players choose a character. Shuffle the Wishes deck (6 types) and reveal 16 cards in the center of the table placing four cards per row creating a 4x4 square. Shuffle the deck of Dreams and deal 2 cards to each player. The Dream cards are the template from which the player must form the same configuration with the cards arranged on the table.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY: F&aacute;brica dos Sonhos is divided into turns and actions. Each player on his turn performs the following mandatory actions:<br/>World Change - You must remove a Wish Card from the table and place it in your hand, then replace that card with another one from the top of the Desire Deck or another one in your hand ( maximum of three cards in the hand). If you exceed the limit, before you pick up a new card, you must discard one of the cards in your hand.<br/>Intercept - Choose between moving Desires Cards on the table or buying a new Dream card. The movement of Desires is simple. The movement points you have are equal to the number of players +1 . You can swap two orthogonally adjacent cards, or two cards diagonally that are on the corners of the 4x4 diagram. You can still rotate a letter anywhere.

Who helps to find the right building materials? <br/>The children learn how to build a house step by step and to find out what kind of work and materials are needed. The adults support the children by declaring and naming construction work, building materials and vehicles after the six building lots.<br/>When navigating the road network between construction sites, the kids also train their fine motor skills. Then the children let the colorful trucks ride along the streets. With the help of the small trucks, the children now transport the wrongly supplied building material to the right construction sites. <br/>Depending on the development stage of the children, only three and later all construction sites are to be supplied. In assigning and discovering the colorful construction site, the everyday knowledge and logical thinking of the little ones is stimulated playfully. For older children, game variations with first rules are possible and the color cubes are used.<br/><br/>",

Its good location, the large gardens that surrounded it and its proximity to the Wax Museum were the incentives for a good number of people to decide to open their business there.<br/><br/>Its many shops, crossed between generations, filled the area with life and color. Unfortunately, this situation would not last forever. The mysterious disappearances began to happen in the neighborhood, night after night. With them, businesses lost their customers.<br/><br/>The result? The wonderful street turned into a dark and gloomy space. The only one who seemed to dare cross it was an old journalist, moved by his curiosity. He knew that a murderer was on the loose, but how to find him? In these cases, a saleswoman in a clothing store seems as suspicious as a vagabond ...<br/><br/>After an intense investigation, he found the answer. He hurried to call the neighbors to communicate their suspicions, but when they arrived at the newsroom, the situation they found could not be much worse: the journalist had disappeared and, with him, any evidence.<br/><br/>Inside the Strange Case of Morgue Street, we found a brochure entitled 'Rules of the Game'. However, it only narrated the setting and listed the components.<br/><br/>Cefa proposed us to initiate an investigation. A group of young people would enter the mysterious street, ready to find the identity of the murderer.<br/><br/>One of the owners of the inhabitants of the neighborhood would be marked as a murderer. The way and the way to discover it are the rules that you have to invent. From there, the manual left blank lines for its owner to invent game mechanics.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Un divertido juego de imaginaci&oacute;n.<br/><br/>La calle Morgue vivi&oacute; una &eacute;poca de m&aacute;ximo esplendor.

Por desgracia, esta situaci&oacute;n no durar&iacute;a eternamente. Las misteriosas desapariciones comenzaron a sucederse en el barrio, noche tras noche. Con ellas, los negocios perdieron a sus clientes.<br/><br/>&iquest;El resultado? La maravillosa calle acab&oacute; convertida en un espacio sombr&iacute;o y tenebroso.

En estos casos, una dependienta de una tienda de ropa parece tan sospechosa como un vagabundo&hellip;<br/><br/>Tras una intensa investigaci&oacute;n, encontr&oacute; la respuesta. Se apresur&oacute; a llamar a los vecinos para comunicarles sus sospechas, pero cuando &eacute;stos llegaron a la redacci&oacute;n del peri&oacute;dico, la situaci&oacute;n que encontraron no pudo ser mucho peor: el periodista hab&iacute;a desaparecido y, con &eacute;l, cualquier prueba.<br/><br/>En el interior de El Extra&ntilde;o Caso de la Calle Morgue, encontr&aacute;bamos un folleto titulado &lsquo;Reglas del Juego&rsquo;.

Whether you use it as a &ldquo;seventh inning stretch&rdquo; between lesson series or as a &ldquo;sandlot&rdquo; game in a classroom learning center, Bible Baseball is a Christian education MVP. What a great combination: the big league thrill of baseball and the Word of God. Cheer your friends and family on as the knock one out of the park. You&rsquo;ll have a great time and will also learn about the Bible.<br/><br/>The pitcher has hundreds of questions about God&rsquo;s Word and the right answer can get the players on first, second, or third base. They can even get a home run! The colorful newly designed game board and pieces help keep track of who is on which base as well as the score and the number of outs. All that&rsquo;s missing are the hot dogs and peanuts! Bible Baseball is great for family fun, but it also is helpful in the classroom or Sunday School setting.<br/><br/>",

Each player shares responsibility for ensuring that the ship makes it safely back to Earth, but at the same time should try to collect as much information about the solar system to win the game when the ship makes it back to Earth.<br/>The game has two separate game boards. The first board represents the solar system, on which the players' spaceship pawn is moved. If the ship flies off the grid, hits a planet or the sun, the ship is destroyed and all players lose the game. The board also includes Event-markers, which are turned over when the ship flies on them, and have a surprising impact on game play.<br/>The other board represents the inside of the spaceship, where players move their astronaut pawns. Each turn, a player must move from one module of the spaceship to another and carry out an action. The actions that can be carried out in the different modules are:<br/>-Bridge: turn the ship's inclination (to determine which direction the ship moves in)<br/>-Observatory: draw two Data cards (giving points at the end of the game)<br/>-Storage: draw two Equipment cards (useful items to be used during the game to save the ship from destruction or help the player's own game<br/>-Engine room: move the ship pawn forward one step.<br/><br/>The game has three levels of game play with increasing complexity. On level two, Captain's Orders cards are added to the game, which are played whenever a player moves to the Bridge, giving that player an additional action. Also, the scoring system for Data cards becomes based on set collection. On level three, Escape pods are included, which allow a player to win the game even if the ship is destroyed.<br/><br/>This game was custom designed to order, and is intended mainly for a specific target market, i.e. children aged 8-14. It is an educational game at heart, in which the players learn about the solar system, and the importance of working together for a common goal, while having lots of fun. But naturally anybody can play it, and it works specially well as a game that the whole family can enjoy together<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lazer is a cute kitty, and as such, loves to chase moving spots of light. To make the game more exciting for her, show her how to change the color by mixing 2 color frequencies with prisms and creating a third color. The player that can mix colors the best will be the winner here.<br/><br/>Semi-cooperative mode:<br/><br/>To set up the game the 12 tiles have to be placed on the table in a circle. Laser the cat will be placed randomly onto one of them. After this, the remaining 11 tiles each have to be filled with one prism meeple. The cards showing the color mixing rules have to be placed next to the tiles.<br/><br/>Each round starts by drawing two prism cards from the deck, these show the next color mixing tasks. The players have 30 seconds to find the solution, that is which meeples (or the cat)  to move how many tiles to a meeple on another tile in order to make the requested colors. After 30 seconds each player shows a number 2 to 10 simultaneously, this indicates that they can solve the task in that many moves. The player with the bid closest to the starting player&rsquo;s bid will join him/her. Without communicating, they have to solve the task by moving the meeples in turns under the indicated number of movements. If they succeed, they receive points equal to the number of movements. The winner is the player with the most points once the round is complete (everybody was starting player once).<br/><br/>Competitive mode<br/><br/>Setup is the same as in semi-cooperative mode, except you use the backside of the tiles (depicting 3 different types of floor: wood, stone, carpet) and the prism cards (not only the required color is indicated, but also the type of floor where the mixing is to be to performed ). When the first player claims a number of movements in which he/she can solve the problem, the 30 second countdown starts. In these 30 seconds all the players can decrease the bid by claiming a lower number. After the 30 seconds ends, the player bidding the lowest has to solve both prism cards in as many movements as the bid. If he/she manages to complete it, he/she will score points. If somebody fails 3 times, they will receive minus 6 points. The first player to reach 15 points will win the game.<br/><br/>",

To get rid of these, he needs at least two identical bacilli and at least two cube images of the corresponding bacillus, about two green ear cucumbers or three gray-purple cough monsters. Was Fortuna merciful? Then two, three or even more of these Bazillenkarten come to a pile and new ones are drawn. It will be diced again until the timer jumps into the air after 40 seconds.<br/><br/>In turn, once each of the two to four players (from six years) on the train, is scored.

The object of the game is to expose all the other players' scandals before they expose yours.<br/><br/>No dice are involved.  A player may choose to move between one and six spaces clockwise around the board.  The player then follows any special instructions written on the space that he or she lands on (these include collecting a Dirty Tricks Card, collecting a cash handout from the Hush Fund, calling a Press Conference, using the Shredder, hiding in a Safe House, or Passing The Buck).  A non-player character, the Journalist, is moved the same number of spaces clockwise around the board.  If the journalist lands on a space occupied by another player, one of that player's three scandals is placed in the middle of the board and auctioned off to the highest bidder.  The player who wins the scandal card may then try to expose it by first landing on a Press Conference square, and then making an accusation against the player whose scandal it is.  The accuser may choose to blackmail the accused and accept a cash payment in exchange for a temporary reprieve, or the players contest the accusation using Dirty Tricks.  If the accusation is successful, the scandal is removed from the game and the accuser gets $50 Million as a reward.  If unsuccessful, the accused gets a scandal back and receives $10 Million compensation.  Once all a player's scandals are exposed, he or she is out of the game.  If the player who owns the scandal gets to The Shredder before being accused at a Press Conference, he or she takes the unexposed scandal back.  Play continues until only one world leader remains with any unexposed scandals...  He or she is the winner!<br/><br/>",

This is a time when trolls sweep through the area looking to capture gnomes. And they need your help.<br/><br/>This is an adventure meant to be led by an adult and experienced by children.<br/><br/>During the game, one player acts as the storyteller who sets the scene by placing evidence of a gnome civilization as outlined in the storyteller's guide and then leads players on a quest. As a cooperative experience, players must find clues and solve riddles placed during the set up phase by the storyteller (and included in with game). Players win if they can successfully discover all hidden items by solving the problems presented by the storyteller. They will lose if all items cannot be found through cooperation and deduction within a set period of time.<br/><br/>",

If you have the picture card with seven frogs, and roll the symbol for numbers, that means you need to find the number card with the &quot;7&quot; on it.

        "description": "Combo is a game in which Bingo-like cards (on which 5x5 grids are printed) are used and instead of calling out randomly drawn numbers, dice are used.<br/><br/>Each player is given a Combo card and during a player's turn, he or she rolls a red die and 3 white dice.  If the red die's result matches one of those on his or her card, the player then matches and places their white dice to the printed faces in the column below.  A player may also &quot;steal&quot; and use a white die that another player cannot use (because that player's red die column does not have that white die's face).  The next player in turn then picks up and rolls the red die and 3 white dice to do the same.  When a player has filled up an entire row, column or diagonal (the center space is considered already to be filled), he has scored a Combo (the amount of points received depends on whether it is a 4-die or 5-die row, column, or diagonal) and ends a round.  The next round begins with new cards for everyone.<br/><br/>After completing a pre-determined number of rounds, the player with the highest accumulated score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the TV series with the fighting robots, this is a two-stage game. You start with a chassis that also includes a basic weapon.<br/><br/>In the first part of the game, you bid on robot bodies, armor, and upgraded weapons. Each player has a hand of cards that are numbered from 0 to 3, plus a &quot;Battle&quot; card. To get a body, you play a &quot;war&quot;-like card game, blindly drawing one of your cards. The player with the highest card gets to choose from the four bodies available. The loser chooses from what is remaining. Next, the players bid for accessories, the armor and weapons. The loser of the body choice gets to choose the first accessory up for bid. Each robot has a specific set of armor that will fit it. If you lose the bid on it, you are at a severe disadvantage. However, your opponent will have had to use up bid cards and thus will have less for later auctions. You also can prevent your opponent from completing his robot by playing your &quot;Battle&quot; card in an auction. This gives the item up for bid to your opponent, but ends all bidding for accessories and sends you to the next stage of the game.<br/><br/>Once you have a robot and accessories for it, it is time to battle in the arena. You build your robot on a plastic arm that has a wheel control and trigger on the other side. Robots face off on any flat surface. Battles have a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots robots feel, as the goal is to maneuver your robot where it can knock off your opponent's armor and expose a release button. Hit the release button and the opponent's robot pops off and you win the round. the first player to win four rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

This drives their choices in attempting to capture their opponents tiles or minimize the impact of their rival's captures. Chips are used to keep score during the capturing process.<br/><br/>Players play in teams of two, Black vs Red.  During each round, all players place 1 of 4 letter tiles (B-O-N-D) upside down on a matching letter diamond on the board - black team on black letter , red team on red.  Players turn the letter tiles over at the same time.  Players follow the line from the letters place to the game board.  Where the lines intersect, the scoring player picks up any tile of the opposing teams color.  PLay continues till the board has been emptied.  Scores are tallied and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Basically, all you have to do is keep walk around and around, much like the inmates of the mental institution in the movie &quot;Midnight Express&quot;...&quot;<br/><br/>To win the game you should raise enough cash to buy a one way ticket to India or simply kill the rest of the players. The most obvious way to make money in the game is by dealing drugs and making burglaries, but there are also legal and less violent ways... but they are quite few... It is also possible for the players' characters to start doing drugs themselves, which in the game mostly has positive effects (doing speed allows you to roll two dice for movement instead of one, for example). Not surprisingly, the game has received a lot of criticism for glorifying drug abuse. So... avoid the police, getting shot, getting AIDS and becoming a heroin-addict and you might just make it to India!<br/><br/>",

For example: Hold a ball between your knees - jump 3 times. While still holding this ball, balance another ball on your shoulder (you can use your chin to hold it in place). Now, bend over, place your hands on the ground and leap like a frog! Once a challenge has been successfully completed, a point card is earned, and it's the next player's turn to try a hilarious task.<br/><br/>For ages 4 and up.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scribe is a pen and paper game for two players.  The board, a 9x9 super grid of 3x3 mini grids, is simple enough to be drawn by hand.  There are two major components of play: a mapping mechanism and a system of glyphs, or patterns of orthogonally adjacent squares.  The mapping mechanism works as follows.  Your last move points to the mini grid in which your next move must be made.  For example, if your last move was in the upper left corner of a mini grid, then your next move must be made somewhere in the upper left mini grid.  The glyph system works as follows.  There are 19 named glyphs of various sizes from 1 to 9 orthogonally adjacent squares.  Glyphs that you form during play are worth points.  The majority of points scored in a mini grid wins the mini grid.  The winner of the majority of mini grids wins the game.<br/><br/>For the complete rules to Scribe, see <a target='_blank' href=\"http://marksteeregames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://marksteeregames.com/</a><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/><br/><br/>",

The players get a certain amount of rain forest cards in their hands.<br/>A player plays a card and draws a new rain forest card. Aim of the game is to plant 25 trees onto the clearing as fast as possible. If you play a foster card, you can plant a tree and draw a new card. Another possibility to plant a tree is to collect three cards of a type (animal or plant) in a row.<br/>Every time you plant a tree you get a certificate. The third possible card is a question card, which can be asked to any player. If he has a sin card in his hand, the questioner gets a certificate, otherwise the questioner has to give one certificate to the other player. The player can also lie about having a sin card. Then the player can ask for a vote of confidence and the player, who loses must pay two certificates.<br/>Players then replenish their hands and have to fight off the bulldozers. A clearing card is being revealed and the players have to match the values on the card with the values on their disclaimer cards. If they win, the difference is payed out in form of trees and certificates. If they lose, the bulldozers move for every point of difference into the forest.<br/>In the end the players win, if 25 trees are planted. The player with most certificates is the overall winner. If the bulldozers reach the last section of the board all players lose.<br/><br/>",

The main aim is to move your character around the board, trapping &quot;ghosts&quot; along the way until finally trapping the boss character, &quot;Mr Stay Puft&quot;.<br/><br/>Characters start in the middle of the board with players getting three cards each, a &quot;ghostbusting kit&quot; consisting of &quot;trap&quot;, &quot;proton gun&quot; and &quot;proton pack&quot; cards.<br/><br/>Play is controlled in a clockwise manner by a spinner containing player moves, player &amp; ghost moves, player move + take action card, or player move + &quot;spook&quot;. Players can move along board street squares, through &quot;subways&quot; or in to &quot;buildings&quot;, and can also move ghosts in the same way if given the option.<br/><br/>Action cards give either further movement options or the ability to trap a ghost outside a building.<br/><br/>Players can &quot;spook&quot; a separate opponent on landing on a square containing, or spinning, a spook option. This is a basic paper-scissor-stone option and the winner takes one of the loser's &quot;ghostbusting kit&quot; cards. Without all three a player cannon trap a ghost.<br/><br/>Upon moving inside a &quot;building&quot; with a ghost present (or landing on a ghost outside a building if owning the correct action card) you can trap it by using the spinner to select a &quot;powerstream strength&quot; number. If the number is higher than the ghost's &quot;slime value&quot; you trap it, otherwise you move out of building and play continues.<br/><br/>After the last ghost is trapped, players must move towards the middle of the board to trap &quot;Mr Stay Puft&quot; in the same way as regular ghosts.<br/><br/>The winner is the person with the highest total &quot;slime value&quot; calculated from all ghosts they have trapped.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card Hockey League is an ice hockey simulation game played with a standard deck of 52 cards.<br/><br/>The two players take on the roles of team managers. The game is played over 3 rounds (periods). The players should ideally play facing each other and have access to a 6-card inverted pyramid game area.<br/><br/>Each game area consists of 3 rows. The row closest to the player represents the goalkeeper. A single card is placed in this row. The second row holds two cards, representing defenders. The third, and final row, holds three cards, representing the forwards on the team. All cards are placed face up in a portrait orientation except the goalkeeper which is placed face down in a landscape orientation.<br/><br/>The first player, determined in whatever fashion the players desire, shuffles the deck and secretly looks at the top card. He can choose to place this card in any open position in his own play area. Once placed, the card cannot be moved. Once all six spots are filled, the deck is passed to the opponent who fills his own six spots in like manner.<br/><br/>Players take turns advancing on their opponent. Each turn begins with the player flipping over the top card of the deck and comparing it to his opponent's line of forwards. If the card matches or beats another card in value, both cards are discarded and the player is considered having advanced past that hockey player. If multiple cards meet the criteria, the player chooses which route to take.<br/><br/>There is a strategic element when deciding which route to take when advancing on your opponent. With your first card, you compare against the three forwards. Once you have overcome a forward, your options for advancement may be limited. At no point are you allowed to skip another card in order to reach a more favorable card.<br/><br/>Let's say that you use your first card to overtake the center forward with your first card &mdash; you now have clear line of sight to both remaining forwards and the two defenders, but the goal is still blocked. If, on the other hand, you advanced past the left side forward, only the center forward and left defender are &quot;open&quot; to you.<br/><br/>Once the goal is &quot;open&quot;, you are free to attempt to score at any point. You simply announce that you will shoot instead of taking on a hockey player. Your card is compared to the value of the goalkeeper. If your card is <i>higher</i> in value, you have scored a goal. Regardless, both cards are discarded as usual.<br/><br/>Whether a goal is successfully scored or not, it is now your opponents turn. Play also switches if you fail to successfully overtake enough players to clear an open path to your opponent's goal.<br/><br/>Your opponent will begin his turn by first filling any open spots as was done when the game began. He then takes his turn as normal.<br/><br/>Special Rule: When only one card is left in the deck, a player may, on his turn, assuming his team slots are filled, attempt a shot on goal regardless of whether an open path exists or not.<br/><br/>Once the deck is exhausted, the period is considered having ended. All cards are gathered up, play switches to the next player who shuffles and drafts his team as was done at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Once three periods have been played, the player with the most goals is declared the winner. There are no rules for breaking ties.<br/><br/>",

This fast paced card game is easy to learn and is almost impossible to put down!<br/><br/>To play, shuffle all the cards and deal 6 cards to each player. Place the remaining cards face down in a DRAW pile in the centre, than turn over the top card of the DRAW pile. The first player has to match that card either by number or colour i.e. if the card is a red &quot;3&quot; the player must thrown down a red card or any other colour &quot;3&quot;. If a player cannot go they must keep taking the top play until they have a card they can play. Donut cards can be played at any time as long as the background colour matches the existing colour in play and Krusty cards are wild cards and can be played at any time to change the colour of play. The first player to play out all their cards and shout &quot;Don't be a Donut&quot; wins.<br/><br/>A more advanced play for older children involves scoring and several rounds are played. A game is won by the first player to score an agreed number of points (usually 150). This game is great entertainment for children and because it is presented in a small box makes a perfect travel game. Game includes 54 jumbo sized cards.<br/><br/>",

What's cool is always changing, ever shifting, so if you want to be hip you gotta live on the edge, adapting quickly to win the game.<br/><br/>Hipster features are selection of cards, with three different &quot;Cool&quot; card suits -- Culture, Fashion, and Trinkets -- along with instant cards you can play on others, Play When You Want cards, and new rules you can introduce to change the rules of the gam, Damn the Man cards. To win the game, you have to be fast, you have to be quick, and above all, you have to be the coolest, hippest hipster around.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop. You can use stations if you wish.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of cards for the &quot;cities&quot;, each with a value to be earned by visiting that &quot;city&quot;. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn. This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

Set in the same universe as Brook City, Buddy Cop sees players take on the role of heroic cops tasked with bringing down criminal operations in the middle of an intense shootout.<br/><br/>Each round, players are presented with 4 cards, which represent the actions available to a player on their turn. Each card offers 2 options: pay the cost and play the card for its action, or discard the card to gain the resources listed. Players must manage their actions and resources efficiently if they hope to remain in the fight long enough to find the criminal boss and make the arrest.<br/><br/>Buddy Cop offers unparalleled modularity with its different fixed card decks that can be mixed and matched to create custom scenarios. Players first choose a cop to embody, wielding their unique cop deck to make use of their signature skills and abilities. Then, they&rsquo;ll choose an operation deck, detailing not only the locations where criminal activity is taking place, but also what exactly the criminals are up to and how they win. Lastly, they&rsquo;ll select a criminal deck to go up against, containing both the criminal mastermind behind the caper, as well as the minions they&rsquo;ll unleash against our officers.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players start with one chip of each color and the rest are placed in a row of supplies.<br/><br/>At the start of each round the dice are rolled and assigned to the chip supplies - the color on the left gets the highest die, the next color gets the second-highest, etc. Then each player in turn may trade; they can turn in chips to the supplies and take chips, but they must obey two rules: the total value of the chips taken cannot exceed that of those turned in, and at most one chip of each color can be traded.<br/><br/>After each round the start player moves. The winner is the first player to have two chips of each color. If playing solo the object is to reach this goal in as few turns as possible.<br/><br/>The book versions of the game include variants:<br/><br/><br/>     In Sway Swap the dice are not rolled each round; instead they are rolled all together only at the start of the game. On a player's turn they choose a die to roll, after which they re-order the dice and then may trade.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In Sellout the die rolling is handled as in Sway Swap, but it uses dice in colors matching the chips instead of ordering the dice. In this version the game continues until there is only one chip left in the market, at which point the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/><br/>",

One assumption is that it has similarities to Snakes &amp; Ladders.<br/><br/>In a reconstructed set of rules, each player races his team of pieces (hound- and jackal-headed sticks, respectively) on his side of the race track, which includes a couple of ladder/snake shortcuts.

FIGHT!<br/><br/>Sentō: Ultimate Arcade Fighter is a fresh take on the classic arcade fighter! Sentō is the first tabletop game to capture the puzzle fighter experience, and bring it from the digital space to the analog.<br/><br/>Sentō is a fighting game with a vibrant cast of worldly characters. Each character brings their own asymmetric style and abilities to each match. Play as a chef with powers over ice and fire, a trickster magician with manipulative mind games, or a lively DJ dropping powerful beats!<br/><br/>On your turn, activating your attack is as simple as clearing a chain of same colored connected marbles from the dispenser. Your character's unique attack list will tell you what attack they perform based on the number and color of marbles cleared. Use your attacks wisely to hinder your opponent, accelerate your own unique systems, manipulate the board, and deal damage to your opponents' health gauge buttons! Each time you break a button, they must insert 1 of their 5 coins into the arcade cabinet (marble dispenser). When there are no more coins to insert, it's game over!<br/><br/>Each player has 3 buttons. These buttons act as health gauges, one for each color of ability and marble (Red, Yellow, and Blue.) When dealing damage, you decide which button to damage, and once a button is brought down to 0, you break it and disable your opponent's access to those attacks! However, broken buttons allow you to &quot;Short-circuit&quot; through marbles of that color (essentially making them linking marbles), allowing a weakened opponent to more easily activate their hardest hitting attacks in their remaining colors. Your buttons will recover as you &quot;Short-circuit&quot; through same colored marbles, and can be re-activated at the beginning of any turn. But do so too early and they could get broken again quickly, burning another coin!<br/><br/>A player is knocked out once they have no more coins to insert, but be careful. If a button is broken while having other buttons out of commission, you must insert a coin for each broken button! You'll need to carefully balance aggression and caution in this quick-action puzzle-driven fighting game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are aggressive sharks, and a mysterious creature guards the wreck. By he who can answer questions and perform tasks related to ships and oceans, and has a little luck with the dice, will be first to bring his treasure to safety.<br/><br/>It is a roll-and-move game where the players follow a track through the sea, from the ship to the diving bell, from there to the ship wreck, and upwards to the surface.<br/><br/>On many spaces, a question related to the sea will be asked; younger childs can select between three answers on the card, older ones have to find the answer without help. On other spaces, a small pantomime is requested. In both cases, oxygen tanks can be won. These are needed on the shark spaces. Without air, the player has to retreat to the diving bell.<br/><br/>When reaching or passing the wreck, the player gets a piece of the treasure.<br/><br/>On addition to sharks, the area between the ship wreck and the surface is guarded by a plastic Kraken. It is moved by a special die, and if it catches a diver with treasure, the treasure is lost, and the player is send back to the diving bell. When a player reaches the surface with a treasure, he wins the game.<br/><br/>Changes to the precursor (Mauseschlau &amp; B&auml;renstark: Abenteuer unter Wasser) include: Less shark spaces, especially in the last part after the ship wreck; an additional die for the kraken, so the players can move the kraken in addition to their own playing piece; the treasure is easier to get, since the wreck no longer needs to be reached with the exact die roll; a variant is included to make it easier to leave the sea with the treasure. As a result, this revised game plays in half the time, and has less luck of the dice.<br/><br/>",

Be precise with your descriptions and pay attention to the other players&rsquo; descriptions. Otherwise you might lose some feathers!<br/><br/>In Gallina City you try to get rid of your cards as fast as possible in three rounds (with progressively increasing hand size at the beginning of them). Cards are composed of four poultry scenes, with slight variations between the quite similar scenes found in different cards.<br/><br/>For achieving this goal every player describes the scenes in their cards at the same time as other players do. In this pandemonium of people talking about chickens, you try to discover who has in her card exactly the same scene as in one of yours. If you are right, each of you discard your card and are one step closer to victory. If the other players show you that the pictures are not *exactly* the same, both of you get penalized and take another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The round ends when one or more players have exactly two cards left in hand. The rest of the players earn as many negative points as their hand size at that spot. After three rounds the player with less negative points win.<br/><br/>Gallina City includes rules for a team version.<br/><br/>--description from the publisher:<br/><br/>",

Punch Cards are just what they sound like; cards with holes punched in them.<br/><br/>On the front of each of this particular set of cards is art from &quot;James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game&quot; (illustrated by Cheyenne Wright) and on the back are lots of numbers. Riddling the cards themselves are the aforementioned holes. (Just your standard office hole-punched style holes)<br/><br/>You and your opponent each pick a card (based solely on your like of the art work) and then a corner of the card. Place the two corners together so you can see the numbers through the holes.<br/><br/>Now both players call either &quot;High,&quot; &quot;Low,&quot; or &quot;Both.&quot; If one player says &quot;High&quot; and the other player says &quot;Low,&quot; play again. Otherwise, either the highest or the lowest number wins, depending on what was called. If either of you says &quot;Both&quot; the game is always on, but you must win both highest and lowest numbers to claim victory. Read out the highest/lowest numbers you can see through your holes and try to beat your opponent, that's it!<br/><br/>This particular set was released at summer conventions because &quot;James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game&quot; (a re-working of the classic and trademark-infringing &quot;Before I Kill You Mr Bond&quot;) wasn't quite ready yet.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Khitan, each player wants to eliminate the opponent's pieces &ndash; but both players start with the same number of (nearly) identical pieces, so you'll need to play carefully in order not to get knocked down yourself.<br/><br/>To set up, each player takes a set of hexagonal pieces, which are double-sided and have the same six colors on their two faces, and places them in the starting locations on the board. On a turn, you flip one of your pieces to an adjacent space. If a colored edge on that piece is now in line with an identically colored edge on an opponent's piece, remove the opponent's piece from the board. More that one piece can be destroyed with the same move. Zap all the opponent's pieces, and you win!<br/><br/>Khitan includes two variants. In the first, each player has a reserve of three pieces, and the first three times that you eliminate an opponent's piece, you add a new piece to your side of the board. (NB: You can't make captures when placing a piece, only when flipping.) In the second variant, each player has a reserve of six pieces and this reserve is replenished by pieces removed from the board, so you'll need to set up multiple attacks to keep the opponent from playing tit-for-tat and staying alive forever.<br/><br/>",

When you draw a card you can&rsquo;t play, you have to put it in one of five slots in the card blaster. The cards stack up until someone randomly triggers the blast &ndash; when the blaster goes off, the player adds ALL of the blasted cards into their own hand.<br/><br/>Unique to this UNO deck are the Wild Blast cards. When you play a Wild Blast card, the next player has to take cards from the draw pile and put them into the card blaster until he or she triggers it. Will they end up with one extra card in their hand or five? You&rsquo;ll have to play it to find out!<br/><br/>",

Apart from that each player gets 15 apes as henchmen.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is for each player to harvest as many different fruits as possible in four play rounds with his apes. At the beginning of a round everyone receives an ape map and the pertinent ape chips. The fruit markers with dark background are sorted and each player receives the five different fruit sorts. The fruit markers with the bright background are sorted and laid out in piles in the table center. A play round is divided into two phases. In the first phase the players put three apes to different harvest places. These apes are called apes scouts. In the second phase the remaining apes are secretly sent to the places, where already scouts of the own race are. In addition the players take the three different kinds of fruit, at which their apes wait and lay them out next to each other behind reproached hands. At the end, they place their remaining apes against each fruit, if they wish to do so. The next step is remove the hands at the same time and the players put their apes to the appropriate places. Only the player, who has the exclusive majority at a place, can harvest a fruit chip. All other players withdraw their entire apes again. The winner may only take half of the assigned apes to his stack, the others remain at the place. If there is a draw, nobody harvests the fruit. The entire apes move then again to the players back. After four rounds that player wins, who could harvest the most different fruit kinds. Players compare their fruits and the total number decides, who the winner is.<br/><br/>",

If your pawn is taken by another and this happens on the top  half of the board, you don't have to start all over again. In that case you may start again in the middle of the board. There are also secure places on the board. If you are on a blue field with a drawing of Pluto, you're safe from attacks of other players. Barricades can not be placed on the blue fields.

There is a score (from 1 to 3 ) on each card. Each time you successfully associate two cards, you score the total of the cards. First to 50 wins.<br/><br/>Example: &quot;Napoleon&quot; is on the board and you have the &quot;Corsica&quot; card. Since Napoleon was born there you could associate to these two cards.

This is one of the first versions.<br/><br/>The board represents a path of squares alternately white and black. The game includes two sets of cards, vowels and consonants, and 6 special cards representing each side of a dice.<br/>The goal is to complete 3 laps of the course by forming the longest words possible. The first player draws 7 letters by choosing the convenience vowels or consonants.<br/><br/>It has 1 minute 30 to form a word that has spread before him, if a player can form a longer word, it announces and shape. Whoever has the longest word advance his pawn on the course as many spaces as there are letters forming the word. Maps of the word are removed from the game The next player must keep the other letters and return to pick the missing cards to replenish his hand to 7 letters. If nobody finds a word, 7 letters are rejected and the tour resumed.<br/><br/>On the course, when a player lands on a black square, he rolls the dice, takes the letter corresponding to the figure obtained (this letter can be A, E, I, O, U or S) and must reform a word of the same number of letters in the word presentation of the current lap. If it fails, it returns to the box where it came from.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The air in the city is electric as the hottest nightclubs host evenings of intense dance competitions. You're the manager of the best new dancers on the scene, ready to show off your team's sweet-sweet moves. Winning at a nightclub will earn your team prestige for the night, and most prestige wins a point. Win five nights of dancing to be crowned the King of Clubs &mdash; but to earn your points, you have to dance!<br/><br/>King of Clubs is a fast-paced card game of sweet-sweet dance moves for 2 or 4 players. In the basic two-player game, each player has a team of dancers valued 1-5. In each round, four of the nine nightclubs (valued 2-7) are revealed, with nightclubs of the same value being paired for a couple's dance. Each player assigns one dancer to each nightclub (two dancers for a couple's dance), then players reveal the values of the dancers with the highest-valued dancer(s) winning the prestige value of the nightclub; the back-up dancer held in hand breaks ties. Whoever wins the most prestige in the round earns a point, and the first player to win five points wins the game. In the four-player team version, each teammate sends a dancer to each nightclub (without consulting one another about who's being sent where), and the highest low-valued dancer in each nightclub wins the prestige; if the lower-valued dancers are tied, then the higher-valued dancers are compared.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, each player also has a hand of five &quot;move&quot; cards. After revealing dancers in a nightclub, whoever has the lower-valued dancer can play one or more moves on the dancer, as long as he can chain the icons shown on the bottom of the dancer card and the bottom of the move cards. After determining who wins a nightclub, the player draws move cards equal to the &quot;move&quot; number shown on the back-up dancer still in hand, discarding down to five move cards, if needed. In the team version, the symbol on the first move card must be present on both of the team's dancers.<br/><br/>",

What kind of future will the island have?<br/><br/>Who is the Sunflower is a microgame in which two secret teams face off, trying to discover each other's identity. Each player gets an identity card. Some characters need to identify certain other character (e.g. Student wants to find Sunflower), while others need to be identified by certain character (Banana wants to be found by the Student). After some discussion, players that need to find another character can attempt to guess who that character is. If this fulfills any player's victory condition, the round ends, with those players scoring a point each.<br/><br/>",

When a discard pile has some flies in it any player out of turn can play a fly swatter card.  When playing a fly swatter card on one of the discard piles that player then collects all of the cards in that piles.  The more flies you kill the more points you are awarded at the end.  There are other cards that allow you to steal from another player hand or from another players kill pile (the bug zapper, and frog cards).  The spider allows you to kill two flies directly out of your hand. The food cards allows you to name a type of fly and any player that has that type in their hand must give you all of those flies. You can't forget the poop card when played forces the opponents to place a fly directly on it, but also when someone uses a fly swatter card on a pile that has a poop card that player must complete a penalty to continue on the game.<br/><br/>The theme is based off of flies, butterflies, and dragonflies.  The art is goofy but totally fits with the style of play. It is a fun family friendly game that only takes about 15 minutes to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragons: Wettflug zur Dracheninsel (&quot;Dragons: Race to Dragon i=Isle&quot;) is a game based on Dreamworks' How to Train Your Dragon 2. In the game, the dragon riders attempt to reach the Dragon Isle, while the dragon Screaming Death tries to prevent them from doing so.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each game, the board is created by lining up island tiles, starting with Viking Island (start) and ending with Dragon Isle (finish). The islands between start and finish come in four different colors.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each round, one player plays Screaming Death, while the others play a dragon rider. Each dragon rider has a hand with colored island cards. Each turn, each dragon rider selects one of these cards. At the same time, Screaming Death selects one color of islands to attack. Then, everybody reveals their cards. Each dragon rider that has selected the color that is being attacked by Screaming Death cannot move; the others move to the next island of their chosen color.<br/><br/>The round ends when two dragon riders have reached Dragon Isle, or when the dragon riders can no longer move because the deck of island cards has run out. The first dragon rider to reach Dragon Isle gains two coins; the second rider gains one coin. If no dragon rider reaches Dragon Isle, Screaming Death gains three coins. If only one rider reaches Dragon Isle, Screaming Death gains one coin.<br/><br/>The game continues with a new round, until each player has played Screaming Death once. Then, the player who has collected the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Spooky, an earlier version of this game, had the players as ghosts moving through a castle, with each player taking a turn as Merlin to try to stop the ghosts.<br/><br/>",

Stratagame is as much about skillful diplomacy as is it about chess-like strategic know-how. The player who in the end owns most of the continent&rsquo;s resources wins this game of epic adventure.<br/><br/>Stratagame is a strategy game in which 2 to 6 players try to capture the continent&rsquo;s resources. Stratagame is played on a chessboard roughly representing Europe. There are no countries or clearly defined territories in Stratagame. Stratagame has no preset historic framework and no realistic pretensions, therefore Stratagame is not a wargame or a simulation game. Stratagame combines the mechanics of games like chess with modern strategy principles. Compared to other games in its category , Stratagame has been designed to be simple and easily understood. There are no overly complex or difficult rules in Stratagame and the manual has only 6 pages of rules. However, as like chess, the simplicity of the rules does not guarantee an easy mastery of the game. Stratagame is generally played in 2 to 4 hours, depending on the number of players and strategies involved.<br/><br/>Stratagame contains 6 armies of different colors each composed of 52 playing pieces. As like chess, when a playing piece tries to enter a square already occupied by an enemy piece, a combat occurs. Each playing piece has a Strength of 1 to 5. A playing piece&rsquo;s Strength determines the number of dice it rolls during combat. The piece obtaining the highest result on the dice wins the combat. As per other chess-like games, Stratagame can also be played without dice.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>1 chessboard (21&rdquo; x 33&rdquo;)<br/>1 rulebook<br/>6 reference sheets<br/>60 playing cards<br/>24 resource tokens<br/>12 dice<br/><br/>6x 21 infantries<br/>6x 11 bases<br/>6x 3 artilleries<br/>6x 6 mechanized<br/>6x 4 armors<br/>6x 5 fleets<br/>6x 1 heavy armor<br/>6x 1 QG<br/><br/>",

Much ado about nothing.(Welcome to the world of art critics. No talent necessary!)<br/>You, as one of these artists, criticize the works. If your critique is pointed, you win the honor of being the true defender of art.<br/>In this game, the players make clay sculptures with a certain theme, and criticize (rather than review) them. You can earn points when your critique matches the others'. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Every one of the play pieces has got a certain weight that can have decisive influence on the game.<br/><br/>The main strategy is to balance between caution (don&rsquo;t be knocked out by your opponents game piece) and greed (capture as much prey as possible).<br/><br/>Figure it out:<br/><br/>Hungry Higgs is played on a sort of tilt. This means that weight close to the middle of the board will appear to weigh less than weight situated longer away from the middle. If you capture prey on your opponents half of the board it will appear heavier than if you had captured it from your own half of the board.<br/><br/>It is also a good idea to figure out the probability for being knocked home by your opponent.<br/><br/>Steal space:<br/><br/>If you can place your game piece in the middle of the board &ndash; but in safe distance from your opponent &ndash; do it. Thus your opponent will have trouble to make a safe move when it is his turn.<br/><br/>Find out what kind of risk you want to take to find the balance between capturing prey, stealing space or being knocked home.<br/><br/>Tricks:<br/><br/>Keeping up appearances:<br/><br/>Perhaps your opponent is able to knock you home &ndash; but he might be more interested in capturing preys. Don&rsquo;t let him discover that he can knock you home.<br/><br/>",

On the frontier, we are all living on borrowed time!<br/><br/>Each player (Commander) attempts to solidify the reputation of his or her mercenary company. Reputation is measured by completed missions and fame. By playing cards out on the table in a Command Display, Commanders set up shop on planets, enhance their holdings with special operations, recruit and equip mercs, send squads on missions, and bring the battle to the enemy (the other players). Successful completion of missions increases the Commander&rsquo;s Fame and improves a Battlelord&rsquo;s abilities. The Commander with the greatest Reputation over a pre-set amount at the end of any given round is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GFY is an easy-to-learn, fast-paced card game in the spirit of Mario Kart. The rules are simple, but winning is never easy, especially at a table with experienced players. GFY makes a perfect gift for anyone in college or the military.<br/><br/>Each player start with 7 cards and your goal is to be the first to get rid of your cards, that is how the game ends.<br/><br/>On your turn draw 1 card and play 1 card, doing exactly what the card's rules say to do. Typically, this will be to discard more cards, draw more cards, or give or take cards from another player. If you can't do it exactly, you can not play it. If you can't play anything, draw a 2nd card and end your turn.<br/><br/>",

If you&rsquo;re the first to match your letters, slam on the pot&rsquo;s lid to score.<br/><br/>Gameplay summary: Each player gets a card of 5 words with a range of difficulty from 1 to 5.  Players announce the word they will try to spell.  The pot is opened and everyone scoops tiles out of the pot at the same time.  The pot contains letter and blank tiles, plus 2 &quot;fly in the soup&quot; tiles.  If a player gets one of these tiles, they must take all tiles they scooped, plus any matched, and put them back in the pot.  The fly in the soup tile is then out of play.  Letter or blank tiles are either matched to the word or put back into the pot.  The players keep scooping and replacing tiles until one player calls out &quot;Yummy!&quot; when they believe they have spelled the word.  If the word is spelled correctly, they win the card, and all of the other cards are discarded and the tiles put back into the pot.  If not, the round continues.  First player to get four cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The charcoal from the burnt bread helped to reduce the wine's acidity.  This word is now a modern day proposal of good health.<br/><br/>A: Toast.<br/><br/>If you get it right and were the first player with the option to answer you move 2 spaces, otherwise you move 1.  Each question has a category and if your piece is on that category when you get the answer right, you double your move - 4 or 2 spaces. Twenty-six spaces means twenty-six correct answers - or possibly as few as 8 - will win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player uses one of four dice (4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 12-sided) during the game to try to acquire marine life cards from the five ocean zones.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls their die, pays to reroll (if desired), asks for die help from others (paying if their dice are used), then collects all the fish in one ocean zone that correspond to the die total. If the player collects marine life needed to complete a mission card, the player can discard one life card to score those points. They can buy new mission cards for $3, with a maximum of four cards in hand. (If a player acquires marine life they don't want, they can sell it for $3 million; penguins bring in $5 million.)<br/><br/>Every $5 million in hand is worth 1 point, and players race to collect 15 points first. Whoever does so wins!<br/><br/>",

Over the course of five rounds, you'll decide when to keep searching for more treasure and when to snatch any loot you can and run away.<br/><br/>Each player starts with one gold as booty. Each round lasts multiple turns, and at the start of each turn the active player draws a coin from the bag to determine how the current pile of loot would be split should players make a grab for it, e.g., if this fortune coin is gold, a player can take the loot if he's the only one to grab for it. Players then use a coin in their stash to secretly decide whether to grab for loot or stay the course and hope for more treasure in later rounds. After players (potentially) plunder the loot, the active player flips the fortune coin, adding it to the loot if the skull side lands up or placing it aside in the monster pile if the monster appears; when three monsters of the same type have shown up, the round ends and all remaining loot returns to the bag.<br/><br/>If a player holds booty worth 25 or more during the game, he wins immediately. Otherwise the player with the most booty after five rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "According to the Designer/Publisher:<br/><br/>SMUGGLE is a family action adventure board game that allows individual or team play.  The winner is the first player to complete a major, minor, and short treasure route.  Treasure Routes are diamonds, rubies, Inca Gold, Art Treasures, Mexican Silver, and money.  Play is accomplished on a dual-action board game, with movement of Jetliners on the peripheral Treasure Runway, which dictate the movement of Treasure Seekers and Treasure Couriers along the Treasure Routes on the world map in the center of the board. When a Seeker reaches a Destination Foreign City (New York to Johannesburg for Diamonds), a suitcase which is color coded to the Treasure Route (Orange for Major Routes, Gold for Minor Routes, and Grape for Short Routes) is attached to the base of the Seeker, which becomes a Treasure Courier.  The Courier then returns the Treasure (in the suitcase!) to the U.S. City of Embarkation.  When the Courier reaches the Customs 12 Mile Limit it can't move without declaring the treasure or making a smuggle attempt.  SMUGGLE cards are collected to facilitate the smuggle attempts.  Yin Yang Cards bring good fortune or bad fortune along the way. Each game has different dynamics.  Gals can square off against the guys and youngsters like to beat up on the adults!  There is interaction of players all along the Treasure Routes.  All players are in the game until it is over.  The play builds in excitement until the game-winning treasure is smuggled.  Smuggle Masters can team up against Treasure Czars for two teams of three players.  Three teams of two players include Border Jumpers, Port Runners, and Bootleggers.  Or it can be everybody for themselves. Everything is color coded for quick visual reference as to players and pieces.  Quick Start Rules supplement the Rules of Play to allow immediate play to begin.<br/><br/>",

The outer field decides what options a player has in each case. So, you can - according to the outer field - buy or sell stock, save money or withdraw it, buy or sell real estate, buy or sell a life insurance policy, buy or sell a treasury note, or buy or sell precious<br/>metals. Or you may land on a wage or salary space, which always brings profit.<br/><br/>What you buy you can also sell, depending which space you are on. When you are on a stock space, for example, you can only buy or sell shares. When you are on one of the two savings spaces, you can only buy or sell savings cards, etc.<br/><br/>3rd action<br/>You must draw a Banking card and either play it now or keep it in your hand. You can also draw and play a precious metal card to replace the card already lying in the middle of the game board.<br/><br/>Precious metal cards are an optional draw. A Banking card must be drawn along with the precious metal card so the price of the precious metals and shares of stock change again and again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reichzeichen (Smoke Signals) is a set collecting memory game.  There are two types of square cards - &quot;narrow smoke&quot; and &quot;wide smoke&quot;. On the reverse side of the wide smoke cards are various landscapes. The narrow smoke cards contain horizons (end caps, think El Caballero)and clouds. A stream of nine cards is placed rising up from a fire;  the narrow smoke cards are always face down, the wide smoke cards are first shown to everyone and then placed face down.<br/><br/>On your turn, you point to one of the wide smoke cards from spaces 4-9 (not the first three next to the fire) and claim what it is.  If correct, you take it and keep going until you miss.  The smoke raisings (?? don't know what this means!) the smoke raisings????....) with each card taken and new cards are added to the bottom.  Alternatively you can take a narrow card.  If it is a horizon, you take it and your turn ends.  If a cloud, the rain gets closer and this paces the game.  You need horizons to score so you will take this action often.<br/><br/>You score by creating complete landscapes.  Each wide smoke card gets 5 points, narrow smoke cards get 1, and there are bonuses for special collections of landscape cards.  The game uses money simply, making you pay the previous player if you take the card they incorrectly identified. In close games the money at the end can be influential.<br/><br/>",

A factory consists of one output card, and any number of equation cards.

Challenge anyone for up to three resources, and then each bid a secret amount more. Whoever has more wins everything, unless they overbid by more than three in which case the lower bid wins! This allows for player interaction, although not a high degree of such.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This old game from Parker Brothers has mechanics similar to Touring, which is about 25 years older. Lindy, the New Flying Game was a straightforward re-theme of Touring to airplanes delivering airmail. Wings is more of a twist since it has 2 decks of cards--a red deck of Mail Cards, and a blue deck of Delay/Release cards. The Mail cards each depict a city on the players routes. These cities are all numbered and must be played in the correct sequence. For example, #1 Boston must be played before #2 New York, which must be played before #3 Philadelphia and so on until reaching #12 San Francisco. Delay/Release cards either help or hinder the player, or his opponents.<br/><br/>Players are dealt 5 Mail Cards. A player starts his turn by drawing a Mail Card and playing as many cities in sequence as possible. He then draws cards to refill his hand and may play new cards drawn if they continue his city sequence. When he can no longer play red cards he draws 1 card from the blue deck and follows its instructions. These range from High Speed Cards which allow him an extra turn, to Delay Cards which he plays on an opponent; the opponent must play a Release Card before he can add to his city sequence.<br/><br/>The first player to deliver the mail to San Francisco finishes his route and wins.<br/><br/>The plane with registration number N-X-211 pictured on the cards was Charles Lindberg's plane The Spirit of St. Louis. Linderberg did fly for the air mail Service, but not in the The Spirit of St. Louis. The plane was also never marked with &quot;Air Mail&quot; on the tail.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This card game is intended to be played while watching a televised basketball contest. Each player is dealt a hand of seven cards, each with a basketball &quot;event&quot; such as slam dunk, blocked shot, free throw, and rebound.  When a player has a card that matches the event that just occurred on the televised game, they must be the first to play it, thereby scoring the points on the card for that event (the rarer the event the more points). When a player plays all seven of their cards, he gets a seven point bonus, everyone tallies their scores and a new hand is dealt. Play continues until the end of the game and the player with the most points from completed rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DISCOVERY OF INDIA, is a, presumably Indian, educational boardgame based for 2 to 4 players Ages 8 and up.  It is published in English.<br/><br/>Players move their playing pieces around the board which is a pictorial representation of the country of India.  The country is divided into 25 states, each further divided into a number of territories. Pieces are able to move move from territory to any adjacent territory, whether belonging to the same state or not.<br/><br/>As soon as a player visits a state for the first time he/she collects a token card for that state - the ultimate aim of the game being to visit all 25 states.  There is no requirement to go to more than one territory in each state though the geography of the board (and the country for that matter) will require players to pass through a large number of territories in order to visit all 25 states.<br/><br/>Each state has a set of quiz cards associated with it.  When a player moves into a new territory he/she is asked a question pertaining to the state in which the territory is located.  If the question is answered correctly the territory is &quot;conquered&quot; and a marker placed on the board to denote which player &quot;owns&quot; that territory.  Ownership of a territory means that other players that wish to pass through it must successfully answer a quiz card question in order to progress further.  This forces players to plan their routes carefully in order to work their way around territories owned by the other players, or gamble on whether they might know the answer to a question they may be asked.<br/><br/>The player that is the first to visit all 25 states, thereby collecting 25 token cards, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sibling Rivalry is a commissioned game from Richard Garfield for the game design textbook &quot;Rules of Play&quot;, by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.<br/><br/>Players are siblings trying to annoy each other.  The game is played on two boards: the challenge board and the score track.  By advancing a marker on the challenge board, you can score points on the score track.  The first player to reach the end of the score track wins.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a &quot;push your luck&quot; dice mechanism to advance on the challenge board.  A player begins by rolling five dice, setting aside ones.  Other numbers can be used to advance a pawn along one of five columns, representing Looks, Faces, Tickles, Ouchies, and Teases.  After each roll, you can either stop or keep rolling.  If you stop and your pawn is the most advanced pawn in that column, then you remove any pawn it passed.  If it is not the most advanced, then you remove your pawn from the challenge board.  If your pawn has not been removed from the board by your next turn, then you score points for it on the score track.<br/><br/>You can keep rolling dice to advance your pawn farther up the challenge board, but when you accumulate three or more ones, your parents have caught you picking on your sibling.  Your turn ends and you lose points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game simulates a soccer game. It contains a soccer field of 21x23 space, 2 balls and 2 longish dice, the kicker die (labeled 2,4,5,6,8,LP) and the direction die (labeled with 4 directions &amp; FOUL, TACKLE).<br/><br/>On a player's turn, the kicking die is thrown first. If it shows a number, the ball can be moved that many spaces. The direction is decided with the throw of the second die - if not a &quot;Foul&quot; or &quot;Tackle&quot; is thrown.<br/><br/>There are also some other ideas from real soccer present in Pokkit Socca: there are corners, throw ins and penalties.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to kick more goals than your opponent after a limited time, which must be fixed before the start.<br/><br/>",

The game is mainly card based which mostly depict soldiers, siege machines and counter-measures for them. Soldiers can be used by both sides, while siege machines and counter-measures are obviously only useful for the attacker and defender respectively.<br/>Gameplay is supported by a simple plan that shows the castle and the status (ok/destroyed) of its parts. The keep is the innermost part, so the attacker has to destroy several parts (e.g. moat, walls) before he can land the final blow. For each part a special action card and siege machine is needed. There is also a mechanism for starving the defender out.<br/>After a game is won (attacker: starving out the defender or destroying the keep, defender: holding out for four weeks), roles switch.<br/>The game was originally planned to be extensible, but I've never seen one. The main game is subtitled &quot;Basis-Set: Ritter&quot; (base set: knights).<br/><br/>",

The player who causes the tower to collapse loses the game.<br/><br/>In the more advanced version, players may choose which tower segment to rotate and by how much - between 1 and 3 columns - and the player scores 1 point for each column rotation.<br/><br/>In the final version of the game, players chose a tower element for the player on the left to use and all players are involved in constructing the tower before rotation begins.<br/><br/>(Note: The English language rules don't state that you cannot reverse the last move made.  This is compulsory to make the game playable.  For the simplest game, if the same tower segment is chosen, then it must be rotated in the same direction as the last move.  Alternately, you can use a House Rule that states that the towers can only be rotated clockwise.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player has five lives (bananas).<br/><br/>The first player rolls two dice and say a number. The highest number is always the first.  For example: 4 and 5 is 54. The next throws are possible: 31 (lowest), 32, 41, 42, 43, 51, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, doubles 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66 and finally 21 (best throw). Whatever you say, the next player must throw a higher number than you said. You can bluff, and tell a smaller or a higher number. The next player must decide if he believes you or not. If you believe the number, you roll the dice again and gives a higher number. If you say that the player is bluffing, the bluffer must show the dice. If you're right loses the bluffer a banana. If the throw was right, you lose yourself a banana.<br/>When a player said 21, the next player decides if he believes the throw or not. Believing does mean not to look the dice and you lose 1 banana. Are you saying that the thrower is bluffing, then check out the dice. The loser pays 2 bananas.<br/><br/>If during the game you shake the dice and you don&rsquo;t like the throw, you can shake you again. You may not look that throw and you must give it blind to the other player; and you must say a higher number.<br/>The player can also say &quot;more than enough&quot;. If the dice shows a higher number, you can call a low throw. So the next player has the chance to say a higher number without looking at the dice. The poker cup goes quickly around the table, but it could be a bluff.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who&rsquo;s left with one or more bananas.<br/><br/>",

Sumo wrestling is a sport in which the object is to either force your opponent out of a circular ring or to force him to touch the floor with any part of his body except his feet. Action is fast and furious, and typical bouts seldom last more than thirty seconds. A good way to play is for each player to generate several wrestlers and fight a series of bouts at one sitting.<br/><br/>Each player rolls a six-sided die for each of five characteristics- Speed, Agility, Strength, Weight, and Balance- to generate their character. When battling an opponent, certain stats are cross-referenced with any of 8 wrestling moves: Charge, Attack, Step Aside, Slap, Lever, Lift, Push, and Pull, in order to determine a result.<br/><br/>The game was included in issue #64 of Dragon Magazine.<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the cards and deal 6 to each player.Place the remaining cards face down as a &quot;draw&quot; pile, within reach of all players for use throughout the game.<br/><br/>2. Elect a player to start<br/><br/>3. Player 1 starts by placing any one of their cards face up beside the &quot;draw&quot; pile as a &quot;Call card&quot;. Cards placed on top of his in turn become the call card.<br/><br/>4. The game continues in a clockwise direction with each placing one card from their hand onto the call card pile. The card played must be:<br/>(a) a card of any number but the same image as the call card OR<br/>(b) a card of any image but the same number as the call card<br/>OR<br/>(c) a GET OUT! card which can be played as any image<br/><br/>5. If a player cannot play a card onto the call card pile they must take the top card from the draw pile and add it ti their hand. That player's turn ends on drawing a card - they cannot play it on the same turn.<br/><br/>6. GET OUT! cards can be played by any player, on their turn, on to any call card. The player may then declare the image to be represented by their GET OUT! card which dictates the next card to follow. The player may choose an image that will help himself or hinder their opponent. One GET OUT! card can be played on top of another GET OUT! card - to cancel a previous call or to keep it the same.<br/><br/>7. Players do not have to play a card even if they are able to, but they must pick up a card from the draw pile. This might happen when player is playing defensively.<br/><br/>8. If draw pile runs out, the last call card is left face up in the center of play and the rest of the cards are placed face down (without shuffling) and the game proceeds as before.<br/><br/>9. The game ends when one player runs out of cards - who is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Play of GET OUT! may be extended by continuing as follows:<br/><br/>10. When one player runs out of cards, all other players add uo the total value of the cards in their hands. GET OUT! cards count as 20 points.<br/><br/>11. Write the scores down by player on the sheet of paper.<br/><br/>12. The player who wins the round deals for the next game and play continues round by round. The scores are accumulated after each round.<br/><br/>13.

The other deck will supply the [7] zombies &quot;the logo side of the cards&quot; and four sets of A thru 6 for the [4] ammo boxes with 6 shots each.<br/><br/>You could use 4d6 instead of the four sets of A thru 6 for the ammo.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>Two normal decks of cards<br/>&bull;    [1] 52 card deck for basic game play.<br/>&bull;    [1] Joker, which represents you!<br/>&bull;    [1] second 52 CARD deck, from which 31 cards are needed. These cards represent zombies that must be destroyed and ammo for your gun.<br/>&bull;    [4] six-sided dice, representing a supply of ammunition for your gun<br/><br/>Zombie Solitaire can also be played using a specialized PnP version &ldquo;Zombie deck&rdquo;.  <br/>PnP cards<br/>&bull;    [4] Ace: a Safe House<br/>&bull;    [4] King: Grandpa &ndash; the only character willing to sacrifice himself for his family<br/>&bull;    [4] Queen: Grandma<br/>&bull;    [4] Jack: Dad<br/>&bull;    [4] 10: Mom<br/>&bull;    [4] 9: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    [4] 8: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    [4] 7: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    [4] 6: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    [4] 5: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    [4] 4: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    [4] 3: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    [4] 2: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    [1] Joker: You, the armed and dangerous hero<br/>&bull;    [7] Zombies - Cards from the second deck (logo side only)<br/>&bull;    4D6 die: ammo box (6 rounds each)<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Zombie Solitaire is set up like regular &ldquo;Klondike&rdquo; solitaire with 7 stacks, four collection zones for aces, and a draw pile &ndash; all from a single deck of cards.  In addition, 10 cards from a second deck are set, faced down, in a pile to the right of the 7 stacks. The joker is placed below the zombie pile, with the [4] dice off to the side.<br/>&bull;    Draw pile: crowd of survivors from the zombie apocalypse<br/>&bull;    7 stacks: temporary shelters to which some of the survivors have fled and others may follow. Cards that are face-down are temporarily hidden from view; when they are turned over, they can be spotted by the zombies<br/>&bull;    10-card pile (from second deck): zombie horde <br/>&bull;    Collection zones: areas in which safe houses may be established<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>The game is played like regular Klondike solitaire, with the usual options &ndash; moving cards from stack to stack, turning cards over when they become open, pulling the aces out and setting cards on top of them as appropriate &ndash; until the first card is drawn from the deck. That&rsquo;s when the zombies finally arrive &ndash; and all bets are off!<br/><br/>In Zombie Solitaire, only one survivor card &ndash; the top card of the deck &ndash; is drawn each time.<br/>Play the game as normal, but with the following adjustments:<br/>&bull;    You do not have to play a survivor card that you have drawn from the draw pile even if you have an available play. It is always your choice whether or not to play a card.<br/>&bull;    You cannot play a survivor card on top of a zombie card.<br/>&bull;    You cannot move any card (or stack) that is under attack from a zombie and you cannot move any card (or stack) onto a stack that is under attack from a zombie &ndash; until the zombie is destroyed<br/>&bull;    You do not come under attack for drawing an ace from the survivor draw pile (or from one of the stacks) and setting it up as a safe house and you do not come under attack for moving a survivor to a safe house. <br/>&bull;    You can move a king (and its stack) to an empty space on the board without coming under attack as long as there is no zombie on the king's stack. But if you move a king from the draw pile to the board, it will come under attack . <br/>        You do not come under attack when a survivor moves from stack to stack.<br/>        When you draw the last card from the draw deck and flip the deck over, this causes a zombie to attack the oldest survivor at the bottom of a stack.<br/>        <br/>        When a second zombie attacks a stack the lowest card on the stack is eaten but that survivor destroys both of the zombies.<br/><br/>Zombie threat:<br/>Individual zombies are not a threat to the survivors. They are endangered only when two zombies attack at the same time. When a second zombie card is added to a temporary shelter stack, the bottom survivor card is removed from the game (where it will contribute no victory points to the player&rsquo;s total).  The attack will also destroy one of the zombies, whose card is returned to the zombie horde.<br/><br/>Victory:      <br/>The game is over when you no longer have any available moves, no kings to sacrifice and no ammunition.  Count up the number of Safe Houses you established and the number of survivors who made it to a Safe House. You get [1] victory point for each.<br/>A perfect score is 52.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Assemblage of Eternity brings the competitive feel of fighting games to the traditional gaming arena, and much like its digital counterpart AOE is designed for 2-4 players in either 1v1, 2v2, Scramble, or Tag modes.<br/><br/>After selecting their favorite combatant, each player attempts to reduce his opponent's life to zero before going to time. The game is, at its foundation, a strong game of rock/paper/scissors with the advantage of being able to mitigate and reverse engineer your opponent's capabilities. Assemblage of Eternity is built to give players who know everything about the game a huge advantage and, like its counterpart, a slim chance at losing against an opponent who just pushes buttons.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game you'll find yourself learning your character, finding effective set-ups for their Ultras, and learning how to play them better. Some characters are harder to play than others, so the game includes set-ups, bios, and strategies to help new players, as well as suggested match-ups.<br/><br/>",

It is also here where the world-famous scientist, Stevie Falconing, is looking for holes in dough and Beat Oven composed his Grosse Funghi&hellip;<br/><br/>Pizza Wars PL is a hilarious game for both children and adults in which you take over as an owner of one of four pizzerias and you compete with others, trying to pay the credit off, taken to set up your business. With every baked pizza, you are one step closer to achieve your target..!<br/>Will you meet all your customers&rsquo; needs or will you rather meet&hellip; a debt collector..?<br/><br/>In Pizza Wars PL, you run a pizzeria in one of four districts of the city Margherita. These are: <br/><br/>     business district,<br/>     bohemian, <br/>     villa <br/>     district of poverty. <br/><br/><br/>There are 15 unique customers (customer cards) originating from each of them (a total of 60). Each player starts with a different game board and some money.<br/>As an owner of the premises in a given social background you possess a special feature (fixed bonus) helping you to serve guests from your neighbourhood. During the game you can also acquire an extra piece of equipment:<br/><br/>     fridge <br/>     oven<br/>     trolley<br/>     table<br/>     &ldquo;connections&rdquo; <br/><br/><br/>These increases your chance of victory and modify the strategy.<br/><br/>Each customer requires a pizza with particular ingredients that you have to acquire to bake (cards of ingredients). You may buy them from the market place (on display) or draw randomly for free from the deck. After each round the market place changes (ingredients rot).<br/><br/>There are as many turns as players and within your turn there are also two phases: <br/><br/>     you may either collect new ingredients or bake a pizza, <br/>     pay your credit off (move on the board) or acquire a piece of equipment.<br/><br/><br/>You can have a maximum of 2 customers and 6 ingredients (some bonuses can change this rule) on hand.<br/><br/>Having baked a pizza, your customer pays you some money, one&rsquo;s card is discarded and you compulsorily draw a new customer &ndash; you may decide if you want one from your own district or from the common deck. The money you earn has to be spent on new ingredients and on a rate of the credit. The player who pays the credit off as first, wins the game.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of easier rules for younger children.<br/><br/>",

Tobacco has been villainized to the point that there are specialized clinics and monetary rewards from employers for quitting.<br/><br/>But to heavy smokers, cigarettes are a simple pleasure.<br/><br/>The players of this game become heavy smokers trying to smoke as many cigarettes as possible before their lungs turn completely black. Even if you fail to smoke during a round, your lungs may still grow progressively blacker all the same from the secondhand smoke of your peers.<br/><br/>This game is both for those who are proud to call themselves smokers and those who disdain them. Outwit your fellow smokers to puff your way to victory (and an early grave).<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Each player gets an ashtray in which they place smoked cigarettes.<br/><br/>-Draw 3 cards<br/>-Players choose 1-2 cards to place face-down on the table (one card must be a cigarette card)<br/>-Players open the chosen cards at the same time<br/>-The player with the highest number of cigarettes wins (unless special cards are involved)<br/>-The winning player can smoke that round (therefore he collects the cigarettes into his ashtray). However, he also must gather tokens that mark the deterioration of his lungs, based on the number of tokens written on the card(s) he played.<br/>-The losing players cannot smoke (they discard their opened cards) but they may receive the effect of secondhand smoke from the winner's played cards. They gather tokens according to this lung cost.<br/>-Refill hand and continue until someone reaches 10 lung tokens (and therefore dies of blackened lungs).<br/><br/>The ultimate winner (even in death) is the person who smoked the most.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.&quot;<br/><br/>-H.P. Lovecraft<br/><br/>The entirety of mankind hefts no consequence, for our world is merely a borrowed rock. Long before ancient life, as indicated by human evidence, winked into existence, the Great Old Ones walked our landmasses, lived in our oceans, and hung in our skies. But most of them eventually left Earth and fell into a death-like sleep. These horrors of the universe render us no more significant than the insects that we crush under our boots as a matter of living.<br/><br/>Rites of Cthulhu offers a new dimension to traditional card play. Players who like face card games like hearts will love this Lovecraftian twist on standard gaming. Players compete against each other as rival cultists in a series of 6 rites (mini games) to win artifacts. Each artifact adds new interest to the game by introducing a new rule that effects play. After playing all 6 mini-games, the player with the most points from artifact cards wins and becomes the grand cultist.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quantum Quest is a standalone card game that challenges two or more players to put together teams of stalwart adventurers to outlast their opponents in a living dungeon.  Electrifying spells, sinister traps and treacherous monsters stand in the way of survival, but things only grow more difficult when the heroes start acquiring chambers in the dungeon. Escape is futile; survive while you can!<br/><br/>In Quantum Quest, each player takes control of a party of five adventurers, and goes through a dungeon of at least twenty chambers, with more added for every additional player over two. This dungeon crawl is always different, thanks to the assortment of cards.  Almost all of these chambers exist for only one purpose: to put the hurting on the adventurers.<br/><br/>Player's spend mana to control these chambers, which serves two purposes: first, they can no longer harm their owners; second, the owner decides how their enemies take damage when landing on these rooms. It's a fun, spiteful way to come out on top!<br/><br/>Quantum Quest also benefits from an interesting end-game phase. If all your adventurers perish in the dungeon, you're not kicked out of the game. All the rooms you owned before your untimely demise remain yours, and get a boost since they're haunted. You can choose to deal double damage to your surviving foes when they land in these chambers!<br/><br/>",

The Cult of Barnacle Bay was meddling with magic far beyond their understanding and accidentally resurrected the Ghost Pirate Chicken Lord LaCluck and her mutinous crew of Ghost Pirate Monkey Grunts, Ghastly Pig Gunners, Wailing Albatross Banshees, and Rampaging Rhino Cannoneers!<br/><br/>In Wander: LaCluck's Revenge, players will select one of five unique heroes from the Wanderer's Guild and join their friends to fight back against these ghost pirate phantoms to save the poor town of Barnacle Bay. Defeating foes and surviving random encounters earns players experience points and loot. Loot, like weapons and armor, is a persistent upgrade, staying with the heroes as they continue on their adventure. Experience points are used to level up heroes during their current adventure in the campaign. A dual-facing upgrade tree allows players to continually try new combinations of skills each adventure to determine what fits their play style, or current set of foes, best.<br/><br/>Using a modular tiles, players assemble maps as indicated in the choose your own adventure campaign book, then use action points to move or attack with their hero.<br/><br/>All enemies in the game are controlled by a simple line of sight A.I., and automatically hit the players' heroes once they're able to. This means there is no player rolling for success for enemies' attacks. Heroes will, however, be able to roll for defense in an effort to prevent incoming wounds. One set of custom dice determines a hero's success for both defending and attacking. Random encounter cards, which are revealed when players enter an unexplored &quot;darkness&quot; space, also promise that no campaign adventure is ever be the same.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Just don't risk too much for popularity as whoever touches the stinky cheese gets cursed by the cheese and will see his prestige plunge!<br/><br/>In the game, each player represents a character from the first volume of the popular book series, and everyone wants their character to rise to the top. To do this, you need to select one or more cards from a pile. Most cards have positive values and help you climb the ladder of success, but negative cards exist as well. Worst of all is the stinky cheese that adheres to your fingers and drops your popularity. Your only hope is to pass the curse on to another player, who will then stink even worse than you...<br/><br/>",

Each one gets a cardboard &quot;lock&quot; attached randomly, which shows tree colored dots. The player in turn tries to open one of the locks by rolling 3 color dice. If necessary, he may re-roll some or all dice up to two times. In addition, one die shows some sides that act as wild card, or hurt the leader.<br/><br/>If the player matches the colors of a lock, he turns over that door. The back shows a part of the treasure map, along with 1-3 coins, which he collects. Goal is to have most coins at game end, when all doors are opened and the map is complete.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a hand of three cards. The start player places a card face down &mdash; either in front of himself or in front of another player &mdash; and states its color. Each other player must play a card of this color if possible, either in front of himself or in front of another player; if you already have a card in front of you, then you must play it elsewhere.<br/><br/>When a card is placed in front of you (except for the start player placing in front of himself), you can decide to fight by leaving your card in a vertical orientation or flee by turning it horizontal. Once each player has a card, those who fight reveal them, with the high value card winning the fight and leading to the next round. Those with the lowest-valued cards lose the round and gain one point. (Off-suit 2s and 4s reverse the trick to make the low card win, with multiple reverses being possible.)<br/><br/>If the trick had a single loser, that player can charge someone who fled. The fleeing person can take points equal to the number of cards in front of him or reveal his card and fight, with the winner losing one point and the loser gaining one point.<br/><br/>If players still have cards in hand, they play another round. Those who fled in the previous round will now have two cards in front of them, and the values of those cards are summed in a fight. Should a player's cards sum to three, then those who fled must fight in the round. When players have no cards in hand, players pick up cards in front of them, then deal out the discards until everyone has three cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has five points. Whoever has the lowest score at this point wins.<br/><br/>",

They have been invited to see the hyper modern, fully automated Alcatraz Prison, before it is officially opened. As luck would have it, though, something goes wrong, and the characters become inmates of the penitentiary. Now they all want to flee the island.<br/>Each turn a player chooses a character to move on the island, trying to collect Escape Cards they could have use of when performing their Run. While moving they have to look out for Sentinel guards, and Drone attacks. Each rescued character gives the player a point, and the player with the highest score at the end wins.<br/>The game is semi-cooperative, and players can team up to raise their chances of successfully fleeing. While the game goes on, the Prison System is gradually waking up. At the point it is fully activated it becomes impossible to flee. The game ends when this happens, or when no living prisoner remains on the island.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt a hand of cards, which come in five suits numbered 0-9, and each turn they play one card to the table, following suit if possible. If all the cards played are in suit, the player of the highest numbered card wins; if one or more cards are out of suit, however, then the highest one of those cards wins. The trick&rsquo;s winner scores three coins, and the player with the most coins at the end of the game, which lasts several hands, wins.<br/><br/>&quot;What makes the game tricky are the rule cards, two of which are in play at the start of the game &ndash; make that in play face-down, which means you have to remember what the rules are throughout the hand. Sample rules are 'When you play a card that has an Igor on it, you must say &quot;Yes, Master&quot;' and 'When you laugh, you must follow your laugh with a &quot;Meow.&quot;' At the start of each turn, the dealer can add or remove one rule from play, and the player who wins the most tricks in a hand has the same option, so rules are constantly popping in and out of the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Learning about the constellations, or star patterns, is often a first step into amateur sky watching and ultimately the study of astronomy and space science.<br/><br/>In Constellation Station you will encounter interesting information about the stars and constellations while you are enjoying the game.  As you play you will find yourself learning the names of all the leading constellations in the northern sky, some of the brightest stars they contain, and other basic information about them.<br/><br/>The game board has a big sky map surrounded by a hemisphere wheel. The map provides a general picture of where the constellations are in relation to one another. The named spaces of the Hemisphere Wheel &quot;point&quot; to the corresponding constellation on the Sky Map.  The constellation can be found by following a straight line from the name on the wheel to its map location.<br/><br/>The game can be an introduction to sky watching outdoors. After playing the game, turn out the lights to see the stars on the game board glow-in-the-dark.  Practice recognizing the star patterns.  Then go out and see the night sky! You might want to make up your own stories and legends about the star patterns you see.<br/><br/>The game board map by itself won't identify which stars are where in the sky, since that depends on the date, time of the night and latitude on earth.  Good guidebooks and other sky watching aids that take these things into account are described in the suggested reading section. Have fun and keep looking up!<br/><br/>",

The goal of Snob is to be the first player to spend and/or accumulate 10 million dollars (or other arbitrary dollar figure).  Players move around the board and collect &quot;Customer Service&quot; cards that add or detract from their dollar total -- if the amount on the Customer Service cards exceeds the amount on the space where the player has landed, they can gamble and re-roll to see if they can spend more.<br/><br/>In addition to the regular spaces, there are Gold spaces which correspond to luxury items the players can buy in the &quot;auction&quot; (e.g. Oil Wells, Yacht, Furs, etc.) The player who landed on the space reads the description of the item and players make bids and attempt to be closest to the value of the described item without overbidding.  The player who was closest adds the item to their stockpile of goods.  Additionally, there is a &quot;Swiss Bank Account&quot; space that rewards the player whose account number is drawn from the account deck.<br/><br/>Without any background information, Snob appears to be a small-print game or game prototype with high production values.  The components include the game board, two nice plastic card trays with 8 varieties of cards, Snob emblazoned notepads for each player, and glass &quot;jewels&quot; that serve as player pieces.<br/><br/>",

Players are Moles who are digging into the earth to see what delicious snacks they can find.  They take turns in placing food (visible &amp; hidden) at the end of the tunnels.  Then players take turns in placing path tiles in front of their moles or another players mole, forming tunnels layer by layer into the earth.  Once all the tiles are placed, the paths are resolved.  Each mole follows the tunnel paths downwards, turn at each intersection, and if they reach food they pick that up and score points.   But be careful, sometimes you might end up with some poison mushrooms (-1 point).  The mole who gathers the most delicious food (scores the most points) is the winner.<br/><br/>This is the first game designed by dGames, and was released at the Tokyo Game Market in Nov 2012.<br/><br/>",

This card game has a deck of cards in nominal amounts and Sum-It cards of the totals players must build to. When you reach your Sum-It, you call and show your cards. Get it wrong and deduct the penalty score, get it right and earn the points on the cards.

Components include 54 Cards including 27 Offense cards and 27 Defense cards, Football Token, Yard Marker, Instructions, Gameboard.<br/><br/>Each player draws 4 cards into their hand from their respective deck (person who is currently on offense takes 4 cards from the deck labeled offense, defensive player does the same but from the defensive deck)<br/><br/>Each player chooses a card, places faces down and when ready both reveal the cards and then resolve the play. Afterwards, each player draws a card from their respective deck so they will always have 4 cards at the start of a play.<br/><br/>The offensive player has up to 4 cards (or downs) to get a 1st down. Punting is controlled by cards so if the offensive player does not have a punt card, they basically are forced to go for it regardless of field position.

        "description": "Tattletale is a fast-paced microgame about the shifting allegiances of elementary school. Each player secretly represents a different faction and plots or opposes plots to get the most playground glory before the teacher has enough and shuts everything down.<br/><br/>During the game, successful plotting will increase the amount of Homework or Horseplay in the school. In addition to earning points for plotting or stopping a plot, each player's secret role gives them bonus points at the end of the game. They might be any of five roles, including the Teacher's Pet, who earn points for Homework, the Jock, who scores for Horseplay, or someone a little unusual like the BFF, who scores with another player.<br/><br/>Twice a game, the teacher comes in and players literally point fingers at each other to cast blame and reduce glory. The basic turn is structured as an iterative Prisoner's Dilemma with the extra twist that a third player opposes you and can cancel both actions if they guess cleverly.<br/><br/>",

The dealer places the remaining deck face down near the center of the play area to form a draw pile. The discard pile: During the game, a discard pile will form next to the draw pile as players place cards onto it. Player cannot draw cards from the discard pile. The non-dealer player takes the first turn. Player then alternate turns. Keep paper and a pencil handy to keep track of your scores from quarter to quarter<br/><br/>On your turn: Make one offensive play (if you can). Place an offensive card (or combination of cards) from your hand face up in the center of the play area. If your opponent plays a defensive card, you do not score. Then take the top card from the draw pile to replace it. This ends your turn. If your opponent does not play a defensive card, he/she says &quot;Take it&quot; You score the points shown on your card(s). Place the card(s) aside, face up into your scoring pile. Then take the top card from the draw pile to replace it. This ends your turn.  If no card in your hand are playable, discard two cards of your choice. Then take the top card from the draw pile to replace it. This ends your turn.<br/><br/>Offensive plays: On your turn, play one of the following cards, or combination, to try to score points. 2-pointer, 3-pointer and dunk are the cards that can be played.  You may play anyone of these cards to try and score the number of points shown on the card. On the same turn an AND 1 card is played along side any of the three cards to add one point to your score.<br/><br/>Defensive Plays: On your opponent's turn, after your opponent has made an offensive play, you may play a defensive card to block his/her shot. NOTE: the DUNK card is protected against some defensive plays but the JUKEM card is unstoppable.  After blocking your opponent's play, discard both your card and your opponent's card. Your opponent take the top card from the draw pile to replenish his/her hand, then you do the same. This ends your opponent's turn. Defensive cards: BLOCK!, MISS!, 3- Second violation, Brick!, Air Ball! and Technical Foul.<br/><br/>Ending the Quarter: When the draw pile runs out, keep taking turns to play as many of your cards as you can. The quarter ends when neither player can make a play or when a player makes a HALF COURT shot. Tally up your score for the quarter and record it on paper. Your opponent does the same. Shuffle all of the cards thoroughly, then play the next quarter the same way you played the previous quarter. The player who did not deal in the previous quarter deals in the new quarter.<br/><br/>How to win: <br/>When the fourth quarter ends, the game is over and player tally their total points. The player with the highest score wins. <br/>Overtime: In case of a tie, play another quarter to determine the winner. <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Surrender Unto Caesar is the 17th game in the Pocket Battles series of games from LPS, Inc.<br/><br/>Surrender Unto Caesar is a complete mini-game with map and rules (on the back of the postcard) and counters which need to be cut out. Also needed for play is a standard deck of playing cards and 1D6.<br/><br/>The game goes for 4 turns, divided into multiple rounds. Players each draw a card to determine who goes first that round. A turn ends when both Jokers have been drawn from the deck.<br/><br/>The map is divided into Siege Wall Areas (SWA), and each player takes one action (sometimes two actions, occasionally none) in any one SWA. Actions cause combat losses or reduce Roman/Gallic Resistance Levels (RRL/GRL). A player loses once their RL reaches 0. The Gallic player also wins if at the end of any turn Vercingetorix is in a SWA free of Roman infantry units. If the Gallic player hasn't won by the end of turn 4, the Roman player wins.<br/><br/>",

Each mission is a 74-page book which contains the start of a story, a mission briefing (telling the player what cards may be used), and then the rest of the story.  After the mission briefing the player chooses a character card and a specified number of weapon, vehicle, and ability cards which can be used on the mission.  At many points in the story the player will be required to use a weapon, a vehicle, or an ability, to check against a skill level, and in some cases to choose one of several possible courses of action.<br/><br/>The object is to complete all the missions without running out of mission points.  While the player in general cannot lose a confrontation, if he or she does badly mission points will be lost.  When playing on the advanced level every weapon, vehicle, and ability costs missions points for every use.<br/><br/>The basic set includes 1 mission book, 1 mission blueprint (a diagram of locations), and 12 cards in addition to the rulebook, score pad, log book, rules summary sheet, and dice.  Supplemental missions were sold, each consisting of a mission book, mission blueprint, and additional cards.<br/><br/>The missions are:<br/> 1 - Assault on Yavin Four (included in basic set)<br/> 2 - Escape from Thyferra<br/> 3 - Attack on Delrakin<br/> 4 - Destroy the Liquidator<br/> 5 - The Hunt for Han Solo<br/> 6 - The Search for Grubba the Hutt<br/> 7 - Ithorian Invasion<br/> 8 - Togorian Trap<br/> 9 - Revolt of the Battle Droids<br/> 10 - Showdown in Mos Eisley<br/> 11 - Bounty Hunter vs. Battle Droids<br/> 12 - The Vactooine Disaster<br/> 13 - Prisoner of the Nikto Pirates<br/> 14 - The Monsters of Dweem<br/> 15 - Voyage to the Underworld<br/> 16 - Imperial Jailbreak<br/> 17 - Darth Vader's Return<br/> 18 - Rogue Squadron to the Rescue<br/> 19 - Bounty on Bonadan<br/> 20 - Total Destruction<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of the game is to grow the plant with the most leaves. Players each start with an empty flowerpot, then take turns rolling the die to see which color of card they may take. Each face of the die has a colored dot which corresponds to a color of face-down card. The cards will either be a stem (with 0-3 leaves) or a flower, which ends the plant. Once a player's plant is finished, he continues to roll, putting stems he draws in the compost pile (discard pile) and if he draws a flower, he may pick another player's flower to finish. When all flowers are finished, the player with the most leaves on his plant is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this nerve wracking game, collect stocks, build your companies and get ready to look for cheaper property because the rabble is moving in.<br/><br/>The Slums is a 2 to 6 player game (Ages 13 and up) guaranteed to keep you sweating and wondering, &quot;Who's going to move in next door?&quot;<br/><br/>In the Slums, you will build neighborhoods centered around massive Super Stores and collect Super Store stocks. You and your opponents will devaluate the neighborhoods by building slums and destroying property.  When your stock prices fall because of slums in previously trendy neighborhoods, you must decide whether it is time to sell stock or rebuild the neighborhood. You also have the option of just buying the cheap stock and letting someone else rebuild for you. One of the unique features of the game is that you will not know who is the winner until the very last piece is played. After all, a critically placed Slum can make the difference between thousands and millions of dollars.<br/><br/>Game play mainly falls into three parts. The first half hour is pretty much an all out war to build up as many companies as possible and collect stock. In the middle portion of the game, players hold onto their stock waiting for opportunities to build key buildings in order to tip the tide of the game in their favor. The last portion of the game is a fast paced, white knuckled race to either destroying the biggest company on the board or playing the last piece to end the game.<br/><br/>",

One side consists of two curves and is used for making turns. The other side is cross-shaped and is used for going straight - no right-angle turns are allowed at the center of the cross!<br/><br/>Play begins! The opponents choose for either Offensive or Defensive play. The Offense goes first, and puts his playing piece either side up, curved or crossed, on any square on the board. His objective is to construct an unbroken pathway with the crosses and curves from any one side of the playing board to its opposite side. The Defense goes second, with the single objective of diverting the Offense, thus stopping it from completing a path between two opposite sides. The players alternate turns and once a player has placed a piece on the board and removed his hand that play is final. Remember, players are free to place pieces on any square on the board without being required to touch a previously played piece.<br/><br/>The pathways will turn and wind and even cross over themselves as the two players attempt to out-maneuver each other. If one path comes to a dead end, the Offense simply begins another until one is completed and he becomes the winner.<br/><br/>If he fails to do so before all 32 pieces have been played, the Defense wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There's also a selection of pinch hitters, one from each category (except pitcher), and a pinch runner.<br/><br/>The player on defense starts the action by rolling a pair of dice; if the total is between 2 and 5, it's a 'hittable' strike (the lower the number, the easier it is to hit); 6 or 8 (except 4-4) are foul strikes; 7 is an unhittable strike; 8 (4-4 only), 9, and 10 are hittable balls; and 11 and 12 are unhittable balls.  If it's a hittable pitch, the offensive player decides whether to swing; if they do, they roll the pair of dice, and consult a chart to determine the results.  Base runners can attempts steals and (sometimes) advancing an extra base on a hit; the defensive player can call pitch-outs if a runner is on base; and the batter can be made to hit-and-run, sacrifice bunt, or even suicide squeeze.  The usual rules of baseball apply (3 outs to an inning, 9 innings to a game, etc.).<br/><br/>",

Three armored divisions totaling some 850 tanks would assault the SS positions on the Caen plains and advance into the hills of Bourquebus. Monty was desperate for a breakout and with so much excess armor available chose to &quot;have it out with Jerry&quot;. Over 2000 allied bombers would pulverize the areas. Confidence was high. Monty was going to ram it down the Germans throat and hopefully reach Falaise.  British intelligence was fairly inaccurate as to what actually laid in front of the armor and despite pleas, the 78 88mm guns , 1st SS Pz Division that were deployed on the ridge would not be touched by allied bombers. Of course, the SS had numerous PzVI, PzVIB, PzV tanks lying in wait. By the 20th, Goodwood had cost the British over 350 tanks destroyed in exchanged for seven miles. The Caen plains were littered with British Shermans, Firefly and Cromwells. Rommel himself had been responsible for the defenses. The British 11th Armor had almost ceased to exist. The Guards Armor division had been ripped.<br/><br/>Game scale is 3 hour turns, 500 yds. a hex, 11 turns. Over 500 counters and two 11x17&quot; maps which form a 17x22&quot; playing surface. Most of the units are armor. Unique rules cover morale, Typhoons, Improved positions, Tiger battalions, armor strength and penetration values ( you will see why the Tiger was one bad cat!), tunnels, night, tactical combat, Leaders and opportunity fire.<br/><br/>The AFVs in the game are: Brumbar, Pz IV, Pz V,Pz VI,Pz VIB, JagPz, Cromwell, Sherman, Firefly, StG.<br/><br/>",

Strategy Poker is great fun for 4 players, but 3 or 2 can play.  Regular poker rules and etiquette apply and a knowledge of basic poker is required.  As in most card games, 'Lady Luck' is still important but in this game, special emphasis is on skill and strategy.&quot;<br/><br/>Strategy Poker is a poker variant.  The game consists of a deck of regular playing cards, betting chips, betting pot, and a viynl mat with places designated for card placement.<br/><br/>Players ante and then are dealt the &quot;key card&quot; and placed on the mat.  Players will use the key card to build three independent poker hands all extending from the &quot;key card.&quot;  Essentially, players will ultimately be dealt cards and will try to create the best three five card hands from them.  All hands will have the &quot;key card&quot; as part of it.  Throughout the next four rounds player alternately bet and are dealt cards.  The players must choose which card to place with each of their three hands.  The player who is able to create the best five card poker hand wins the pot.  To increase tension and bluffing, some cards are placed on the mat face down so opponents only get a glimpse as to what cards you have.<br/><br/>",

In addition to the 'Pizza of Catan' (a promotional tie-in with a Geman pizza company), they are publishing a game called Pizza Flitzer (Pizza Speeders) by Gordon MacLeod. Paul and Paula are the fastest pizza deliverers around. Their good reputation is influenced by the fact that pizzas occasionally slip out of their hands. Clumsiness? Nope! Paul and Paula can simply only deliver pizzas that they are magnetically attracted to. Pizzas of the wrong pole rebuff Paul and Paula. The two of them need a little help. Someone will surely remember which pizzas the two of them should be delivering. The game includes a round wooden game board that looks like a pizza with an arrow spinner in the middle, nine magnetic pizza pieces and two magnetic figures. The two figures, Paul and Paula, have different poles (positive and negative) to ensure that they are never attracted to the same pizza. The spinner determines which figure a player, on their turn, may hold over a pizza piece. If they choose correctly, the pizza, with a click, fastens itself to the figure. The winner is the player who owns three pizza pieces first.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Origins is a trivia based board game with the theme being the origins of sayings, names, traditions, expressions, people etc..<br/><br/>The playing board is comprised of 25 squares in a 5 x 5 grid.  Each square is further subdivided into 4 quadrants.  The squares are colour coded by colour and number so that a throw of the two dice (one numbered, one coloured) will indicate a particular square.<br/><br/>Taking it in turns players throw the dice and are asked a question determined by the colour of the square.  Questions are in five categories (Blue - Language, Purple - First, Red - People and Places, Yellow - Names, Green - Words).  Each player has a choice of three answers, only one of which is correct.<br/><br/>If a player correctly answers the question one of his or her playing pieces is placed on one of the quadrants within the square relating to that question.  The same player then continues with another roll of the dice and another question, until a question is answered incorrectly at which point play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>The first player to roll the dice and correctly answer questions to achieve at least one scoring piece in 5 squares forming a line either up, across or diagonally is the winner.<br/><br/>Though named the same and on the same subject matter, it is unclear if this is the same game as Origins, as the games appear to have different question and game-board styles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game all about the economics of growing and selling marijuana, British Columbia&rsquo;s largest cash crop! This game was designed in 1997, printed in one edition of 1,000 copies and sold in &ldquo;head&rdquo; shops in Canada, Hawaii and Seattle. Press releases stated that it cost the two men behind the project about $50,000 Canadian to get the game to market. The reviewers' copy, numbered 106/1000 and signed by the designer, was found in a thrift shop for $3.99.<br/><br/>Play is divided into three phases, corresponding to the three growing seasons. The length of the game is derived from the number of Seasonal Cards, which is adjusted according to the number of players in the game. Each player starts with a car, six Plant tokens and $9,000 cash.<br/><br/>Each player-turn a player turns over one Seasonal Card and two &ldquo;Daily Grind&rdquo; cards. He moves (moving costs money, a player can go as far as he wants to spend) to a location and sets up grow-ops.<br/><br/>Indoor operations require periodic rent and the investment of Equipment and Plant tokens. Yields are smaller but come every turn, and are measured in salable ounces or new Plant Tokens to start other operations. Indoor operations are usually less risky unless someone &ldquo;rats you out&rdquo; for a quick $3,000.  Outdoor operations are set up in spring or summer. They do not need rent or equipment but are subject to the depredations of deer, rabbits, wandering hikers or police helicopters. Outdoor operations are harvested once per game, in the autumn, and players have to travel to the location to do the harvesting themselves &ndash; so, depending on where you and the other players are, you may lose some crop.<br/><br/>Between seasons players pay bills and rent, and may buy or sell equipment. At the end of the game (when all the Seasonal Cards have been turned up), players calculate the value of all Equipment and harvested outdoor Plants, and any salable ounces (a handy price table is supplied if you are too zonked to do the multiplying yourself). Players then pay all outstanding bills, loans, and fines. The winner is the one with the most cash on hand.<br/><br/>This would be an unremarkable farming-type game, if not for the illegal nature of the crop. This frames the rather small amount of player interaction (which is mostly limited to ratting out other players for a quick buck, or negotiating commissions for other to sell or harvest dope for you at locations where you aren&rsquo;t), the random disasters that can befall players through the Daily Grind deck, and the pro-legalization rhetoric found throughout the rules. The rest of the game is about investing funds and taking risks &ndash; it might as well be about growing Swiss chard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "[Text by the publisher:] 3 card games about very strange names of animals, such as &quot;blood-striped blenny&quot;, &quot;bobolink&quot;, &quot;spectacled warbler&quot; and &quot;brown egg frog&quot; (these are eqivalents of the names in English - by now the game ist available only with German names).<br/>You try to get rid of your cards. Each card shows six incredible names of animals, each of them belonging to one of these species: mammals, reptiles, fish, birds, butterflies, and impossums. Only the first five species are &quot;regular&quot; species. The impossums are fake animals (impossible animals). Their sole purpose is to provide suggestions for bluffing. Bluffing is important for winning - and for having fun!<br/>One game is about guessing to what species an animal belongs. As the animal names must be read aloud, it is good exercice for kids to read and pronounce.<br/>The other two games are different in depth and demand. There are alphabetical and morphemic rules for putting down cards. For example: <br/>You can put down a card only if <br/>- either it shows the name of an animal of the particular category that fits alphabetically (= starting with the same letter as the reference animal or with its first letter following or coming before that letter), or if<br/>- a part of the name of an animal is identical with a part of the name of the reference animal (example: &quot;blue-and-gold-fusilier&quot;, a fish, thus matches with &quot;blue-crowned motmot&quot;, a bird). If it belongs to the same species, you can put down a further card, if it belongs to another category you just switch the species.<br/>If both is not possible, you can try some bluffing. The cards are played face down.<br/>You must pronounce the name of the animal when putting your card down. Each card put down can be controlled. When your bluffing is detected, you get malus points. When you habe put your cards down &quot;regularly&quot;, however, the one who has controlled gets malus points. Chances are good not to be detected when bluffing: all animal names (more than 1250) are very strange indeed, so its not obvious, when you invent a name on your own or use an impossum. Unless you blush... [end of publisher's text]<br/><br/>",

It was quite popular in schools, the matches took place on classroom desks during breaks between classes.<br/><br/>Each of two players has a team of footballists represented by coins. There's one big coin 'the goalkeeper' and three medium-sized coins 'field players' in each team. To distinguish between teams one of them is 'heads up' the other is 'tails up'. There is also one small coin in use - representing the ball. The goals are usually gaps between two boxes or books each.<br/><br/>The game mechanics is similar to Carrom or PitchCar - players finger-flick their respective team coins to hit the ball and eventually to score points by shooting goals. The rules of fair and foul plays depend on the variant of the game. And the variants are numerous!<br/><br/>",

Players' alternate turns writing a series of five distracting two word clues for all their opponents who are trying to find the common link between the clues and then guess the answer. Guessing begins as soon as the first two word clue is placed in the easel. Play continues until all five easel cards are placed in the easel.

If it is in YOUR hand, go ahead and play it as described above.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Note that the &quot;shot&quot; can be any liquid and does not have to contain alcohol.Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>",

With their simple rules and the excitement of rivalry, memory games appeal to both children and adults, and older players do not necessarily have an advantage over younger ones. Ever since they first appeared in the 1950s, games that involve looking for pairs of identical objects have enjoyed unflagging popularity and thousands of versions have been produced. While ZnajZnak &ndash; Pamięć continues this long tradition, it also introduces a certain element of novelty, because players acquire knowledge automatically while playing.<br/>The game is composed of 48 cards. There are 16 pairs of the symbols of recent Polish history and also 16 cards with the names. Among the cards players have to find a pair of the same symbols and then point one of the 16 cards with the names of symbols. <br/>A historical commentary on each symbol is provided in the enclosed brochure.<br/><br/>",

The game is interactive, funny, and contains a good mixture of strategy and luck. The game mimics the absurd real-world beauty mania: players can never completely reach the beauty ideal, the beauty ideal changes over time, and finally, beauty sells!<br/><br/>In Pretty Ugly the players represent models that want to win as many beauty contests as possible. Each turn a player either takes 3 open cards to add to their hand, or plays an action from the hand to adapt their looks to the random (and maybe not so &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;) beauty ideal. But be careful: other players can be mean and &ldquo;uglify&rdquo; you! After three rounds there is always a beauty contest where the player with the most matching aspects with the beauty ideal wins the most money, and the player with the least matching aspects wins the least money. Then the beauty ideal changes completely and players need to adapt to the new ideal again. After 9 rounds and 3 beauty contests, the player who has won the most money in total wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player also gets a number of partially randomly selected action tiles that can be used to replace numbers later in the game, swap two numbers or allow to create a solution with one duplicate number.<br/><br/>Each turn, a random sum tile is drawn. Players then simultaneously try to create a solution for that sum on the board, using only their own action tiles for any changes to the numbers on the board and placing beginning/end markers for solutions. Numbers already used in previous solution can not be altered in any way. The player who comes up with a legal solution first scores points equal to the length of the solution and the solution is applied to the board. If the sum was odd, all players draw an additional action tile after the turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when the players fail to find a solution for the third time. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the first game in the Magical Legend series of games. The game is set in a mythical Chinese world like that of the Chinese classic &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;. The game world is further fleshed out in other Magical Legend comics and novels.<br/><br/>There are 2 game modes.<br/><br/>Game Mode 1 (Deities vs Demons): <br/>Gameplay-wise this is similar to Bang. There are 3 roles (Deity, Demons, Spirits). The Deity wins if he kills all Demons and non-subjugated Spirits. The Demons win if they kill the Deity. The Spirits win if they kill the Deity and 1 Demon or 1 Spirit who has killed a Demon. The Deity has 3 power up cards which he can offer as a reward to subjugate(ie. ally) a Spirit. Spirits can renege on the alliance/subjugation but will suffer penalties for doing so. The game replaces the suits (Heart, Spades, etc) of Bang with a 5-element system (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) and characters, abilities and card actions vary depending on the elements involved. There is no concept of Distance and no Missed cards. Attacks succeed or are countered based on the elements. Card actions often require Magic points to power them. Otherwise the gameplay is quite similar.<br/><br/>Game Mode 2 (Faction Battles):<br/>This mode can only be played with an even number of players (4-10). Players split into 2 camps and a representative from each camp draw 1 of 5 faction cards to see what faction they are. Factions have specific powers which can be triggered to allow cooperation between members of the faction. There are no hidden roles in this mode and all players of a faction win if the other faction is eliminated. Other aspects of gameplay (ie. drawing, attacking, etc) are similar to game mode 1.<br/><br/>",

These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for these.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn.  This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

Who can clean up the cards the fastest, while also lining up cards that match one another?<br/><br/>In Kuddelmuddel &ndash; German for &quot;hodgepodge&quot; &ndash; players try to put together chains of cards in order to score points. To set up the game, the players scatter the 80 cards in the deck face down on the table and place the bell within reach of all players. Everyone then simultaneously starts looking at face-down cards one by one. You can place the first card you see face up to start a row in front of you. To place another card next to this first one, whether on the left or right, the newly placed card must have at least one image in common with the card already in place.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has seven matching cards in a row, she rings the bell. If she goofed up, she sits out the round until another player creates a row; if she did everything correctly, she scoops up those cards and places them in a pile beside her while all other players reshuffle their cards into those that remain on the table.<br/><br/>The game ends whenever the last card is taken from the center of the table. Whoever has collected the most cards (i.e., rows) wins!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This is a small, promotional edition of Kuddelmuddel containing 32 &quot;cards&quot; to cut out yourself.<br/><br/>",

For red cards, you match the back of the word (rhyme).<br/><br/>Now, start the timer, say and write a word that works and pass the pencil!  Try not get caught with the pencil when the timer goes off!

If you have two of the same card, you can turn one to the dark side (usually worth negative points) and force it on to an opponent. After one person has one of each card on the Light Side you move on to the Event Phase.<br/><br/>In the Event Phase, it's finally the big day of the convention and everyone tries to sell their doujinshi.

Many lines you&rsquo;ll know and others will be new to you. The gameplay is inconceivably fun and easy&hellip;and no movie knowledge is required! Our original game debuted in early-2014 and contains 330 of the most memorable movie lines up to that point, so we turned to popular movies from 2014-2018 for the bulk of this Volume 2 edition&rsquo;s movie lines and relied on some great pre-2014 movie lines to round out the content. Enjoy!<br/><br/>Every player is dealt eight cards featuring a movie line from one of hundreds of popular movies. One player, &lsquo;The Critic&rsquo;, picks the next Awkward Family Photos card and places the card on the table for everyone to see. All other players decide which one of their eight movie lines best captions the photo, by placing their selection facedown in the play area.  &lsquo;The Critic&rsquo; reads each card aloud and picks the movie line that he/she thinks best captions the photo in play. The player with the winning card wins the round! First player to get 10 cards win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The first human FTL ship, the Odyssey, sets out to explore a new sector of the galaxy after finding an operational alien stargate. Players take on the roles of the Odyssey's bridge crew, as they find planets, meet strange new aliens, and eventually try to find the way back home!<br/><br/>Each time a group sits down at the table, they play through one chapter of a story: a co-operative adventure will result in a new chapter being unlocked for the next session. The chapters aren't linear though, your path through the story book will be determined by your choices. Every standalone book tells of one of the Odyssey's adventures through alien space, but they do not require the same set of players each time. No two playthroughs of a given story book will be exactly alike!<br/><br/>While playing, the Mission Control board will track your progress through the Chapter. When the crew wants to do something in the game, they combine the letters of an Action, Mission, and Location to form a code such as B-3-D4, and look up that paragraph in the book. After reading the paragraph's story and game instructions, you'll advance your adventure one step, and have new options to choose from.

Everybody wanted to marry the young, wise, beautiful princess, even though they knew she could be troublesome sometimes. One day the princess said &ldquo;The man who brings me a handful of these flowers will be my husband&rdquo;. The &ldquo;task&rdquo; the princess proposed wasn&rsquo;t easy at all for the flower she named was &ldquo;Gem Flower&rdquo; which can only be raised in dead-cold weather. Now the battle of suitors has begun.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re one of the suitors who gained relative&rsquo;s support to acquire &ldquo;Gem Flower&rdquo;. You are in the coldest county of the nation where you can find &ldquo;Gem Seeds&rdquo;. Whoever gathered enough seeds to obtain 2 Flowers(20 Seeds) is the winner.<br/><br/>Players put one of the cards they have face down to determine &ldquo;Sunity&rdquo;(The higher the number, the more sun you see) each round. There are numbers from 1 to 50. The &ldquo;Sunity&rdquo; will determine which regions will be hit by blizzards. One of the numbers played this round will become current &ldquo;Sunity&rdquo;.<br/>Once all players played their cards, each player guess current &ldquo;Sunity&rdquo; and move one of their player tokens to a region on the game board.<br/><br/>The numbers (10~40) shown on the game board is the required Sunity in order to receive reward from that particular region. The regions with the numbers less than equal to Sunity will be hit by a blizzard.  When everyone moved their player tokens, turn all the played cards face up and determine Sunity.<br/><br/>All the player tokens that were hit by blizzards will be removed from the game board and sent back to their hometowns. Players will receive rewards from each player tokens remained on the game board. The number +1~+4 shows how many seeds you can receive from each region.<br/><br/>Avoid blizzards by figuring out Sunity and become the first one to acquire Gem Flower!<br/><br/>",

A set of smaller cards is turned over one at a time.  On these smaller cards are two animals, sometimes one or both will have a red &quot;X&quot; over it.  To win, players try to get rid of all their cards by matching them to the requirements on the small cards.  So, if a small card shows &quot;turtle not-kitten,&quot; any card a player has with a turtle but no kitten on it can be discarded.<br/><br/>The game is attractive and the play is quick.  It has a minor educational value, teaching pattern recognition and very, very light analysis.  Winning is entirely a random prospect.<br/><br/>The game will play well with very young players.  Optimally, I think Ages3 - 5<br/> is the right age for it, though the game box says Ages 4 and up<br/>.<br/><br/>The game includes 35 big cards, 28 small cards, a tray, and rules.

        "description": "The new and exciting Circle Out! game will challenge both your friends and your family. It will stretch your mind as you look for circles among the triangles.<br/><br/>Circle Out! game is one of the great modern classics. It calls upon parts of your brain that rarely get much exposure. For this reason, little children can often gain an advantage over adults who are just beginning to learn the game. Playing the game is an excellent visual memory exercise. Circle Out is filled with strategy &ndash; and winning is never a simple matter of chance.<br/><br/>Instructions:<br/><br/>To play the game shuffle the deck and lay out 12 - 16 cards on the table. All players must race to find the most circles of the largest size.<br/><br/>Players should not touch the cards until a circle has been found. When you find one, say &quot;Circle!&quot; and then you may take the cards that form your circle.<br/><br/>One predetermined player will lay out additional cards to replace the ones that have been taken. Continue to play until all of the cards are gone. Two decks may be combined to lengthen the game.<br/><br/>What? Circles? All I can see are triangles! Think of each card as a link that belongs to a chain. A circle happens when the ends of your chain come (link) together.<br/><br/>Just remember that same colors link together and that triangles on the top may only link to triangles on the bottom and vice versa. For example, a blue triangle at the bottom right corner of a card will link to any blue triangle at the top left corner of another card.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>Circles of three are worth 1 point, circles of four are worth 2 points, circles of five are worth 3 points, circles of six are worth 4 points and circles of seven cards are worth 5 points.<br/><br/>Or just subtract 2 from the total number of cards in your circle and that is how many points it is worth. For example, a five-card circle is worth 3 points (5 - 2 = 3).<br/><br/>There can be up to seven cards per circle only because there are only seven colors. Each color may only be represented once in each circle by one top triangle and one bottom triangle.<br/><br/>",

The current player uses a die and secretly rotates the die to match the number a present is assigned to (one through four.  Keeping the die hidden, the next player attempts to guess which number the die was turned to (one through four).  If the guess is correct the present corresponding to that number is stolen and added to that person's toy chest.  If an incorrect guess is made, then the current player who selected the number/present receives it and adds it to their toy chest.  The missing tile is replaced, turn order changes and the game continues until there are no tiles left to replace the missing tile.  The presents have various ways points are collected and there are also negative point presents (broken toys) as well as tiles that effect game play.  The elf with the post points after bonuses and negative points are counted is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Set in Portugal in the late 15th century, King Afonso V enters into a trade agreement with Lisbon's great merchant Ferdinand Gomez. Instead of granting subsidies to explore, the agreement entitles Gomez to exclusive trade in the specialty products obtained from the voyages. Players become one of the admirals employed by Ferdinand Gomez, pioneering the wilderness, discovering unknown creatures and natural wonders, building harbors and trading posts, trading, and preaching Christianity. Players want to increase their fame and become the world's best admiral.<br/><br/>Proving that the world is round, a new world map similar to &mdash; but not identical to &mdash; the real world will be created. Initially the game board shows a large map of the world known to Europeans in the 15th century, with all of Europe being depicted along with parts of Asia and Africa. The rest of the board is blank, and players place land tiles as they travel across the seas. In this way, they literally complete a new atlas (rather than trying to mimic the actual globe), and the game will play out differently each session.<br/><br/>As players draw tiles and discover new lands, they also close off potential sea routes. Balancing the need to discover and the need to trade is one of the game's challenges. Building a church and propagating Christianity to a greater extent also increases a player's fame.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wo war's? Mini revisits the Roberto Fraga title of 2009 in which players tried to track down invisible creatures, but instead of listening to an electronic device give clues, one of the players in the game now takes the role of the red dragon and gives clues to a thief's location to everyone else.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the dragon player takes a &quot;clue track&quot; and slides it into a device that only she can see. She then makes animal noises for all of the animals on the game board so that the other players know what sounds she'll make during the game. The dragon player makes a sound corresponding to the first space on the clue track, of which there will be several locations on the game board, then the other players roll a die and start moving toward where they think the thief might be. The dragon player makes another clue, then the players move, and so on. If the players are on the thief's location at the end of the round, they each earn a dragon token; otherwise, the dragon player earns a token.<br/><br/>Have each player be the dragon once, and whoever collects the most tokens by the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

It presents itself as a tool used by Egyptian pharaohs to learn strategy; around 1700 BCE, the Egyptian empire was conquered by the Hyksos and it took them 100 years to drive the invaders out of their lands. One player assumes the role of an Egyptian pharaoh and the other a Hyksos invader.<br/><br/>The game takes place on a board that is nine by four squares; an extra 4-square row extends the playing area at the bottom left of each player's side.  The players set up their pieces in their respective corners and take turns to move their pieces.  Each player has four cities and the remaining pieces are military units with different movements.  The first player to capture all four of their opponent's cities (by moving military units onto them) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From pagat.com:<br/><br/>This children's game is also commonly known as Steal the Old Man's Bundle, Steal the Old Man's Pack or Steal Pile. A very similar game is played by children in Argentina, where it is known as Casita Robada. In Italy it is known as Rubamazzo, and in Quebec it is called Paquet Voleur (literal translation of steal pile in French).<br/><br/>Players and Cards<br/><br/>Stealing Bundles is a fairly simple fishing game, for 2, 3 or 4 players, normally using a standard 52-card pack. To start the game, everyone draws a card and the player drawing the highest card deals first.<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>The dealer shuffles, and then deals the cards out clockwise one at a time: four cards face down to each player and four face up to the centre of the table. The centre cards are laid out separately so that all are visible. The remainder of the pack is kept face down by the dealer and will be used later. The players then pick up their hands of four cards and look at them (but of course are not allowed to look at other players' cards).<br/><br/>The player to the dealer's left starts, the turn to play passes clockwise around the table. At your turn you must play one card from your hand face up to the table. If the card you play matches the rank of any of the face up centre cards, you must take the card you played and any matched cards and place them in a face up pile in front of you, to start your 'bundle'. (Suits are ignored in this game: a King matches a King, an Eight matches an Eight, and so on.) No matter whether you matched a card or not, it is then the next player's turn to play.<br/><br/>Any matched cards that you acquire during the game are always stacked on top of your bundle, with the card you played on top, so that only this top card is visible.<br/><br/>If you play a card that matches the top card of an opponent's bundle, you steal their whole of their bundle and add it to the top of yours, placing the matching card that you played on top.<br/><br/>After everyone has played their four cards, the same dealer takes the remaining undealt cards and deals another four cards face down to each player, one at a time (but no further cards to the layout). Again the players look at their hands, and play continues as before. After all these cards have been played another four cards each are dealt by the same dealer, and this process of dealing and playing continues until all the cards have been dealt and everyone has played their last four cards. At this point, any cards remaining face up in the centre are added to the bundle of the last player who matched a card.<br/><br/>Now the cards in each are counted and whoever has the largest bundle wins.<br/><br/>If you want to play again, the turn to deal now passes to the left. The new dealer shuffles all the cards and another game is played as described above.<br/><br/>Casita Robada and Rubamazzo<br/><br/>The Argentinean game Casita Robata, is essentially the same. The only differences from Stealing Bundles are:<br/><br/>A Spanish suited pack of 40 (or 48) cards is used;<br/>    The game is played counter-clockwise.<br/><br/>The Italian game Rubamazzo is played counter-clockwise with an Italian 40-card pack.<br/><br/>",

But it's not easy because entering the finish line has to be done on an exact count, so managing your cards is important!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A timer is used to determine how much time one has to construct the required shape. Once you complete the required shape you turn the timer on its side. Others then have the remaining time to solve the puzzle or can work as a group to solve and get the points for solving.<br/><br/>Shuffle the 36 task cards and 8 event cards together and placed them in the unsolved tasks area.  Each player takes a set of stones/playing pieces.  Players place their marker on the beginning of the scoring track.  Beginners can play a shorter game by using the 24 joker cards, removing the &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; cards, and starting on the &ldquo;short game&rdquo; scoring track location. The scoring track consists of  8 circles and then the center winning area. Each time you complete a task in the required time you can move your scoring marker one circle closer to the center square and victory.<br/><br/>Event cards give special privileges.

        "description": "El Tablero de Jesus (pronounced 'Heh-soose') is a simple gambling game played on a 7&times;7 board with a pair of standard dice.  Originally presented to the SCA (recreational medievalist) as a historic game from the 15th century, further research has found this to be a hoax.   No evidence shows the game to have existed before 1971. The game briefly fell out of favor in the late 1990's, but was popularized once again by a notorious hosting camp at the Pennsic war in 2006.<br/><br/>Players each roll two dice, with the high roller choosing who goes first.  The first player places a single coin in the center of the board, and both players place coins in the three left-most columns of their back row.  The first player then rolls both dice and moves any two coins up or down a column the exact number rolled.  When a player gets two or more coins in adjacent columns on the same row (other then either home row) he may choose to take those coins and end his turn or continue rolling.  If he takes the coins, then his opponent fills in the now empty columns with new coins on his home row and starts his turn.  At any point if a player rolls 7, 11 or 12 their turn is over and the dice pass to their opponent.  Also if you roll a pair of numbers that can not be moved (roll a 6 and none of the coins are in a home row) your turn is over.  If at the start of your turn there are adjacent coins on the board, you may take them and pass the dice back.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player is out of money (or is no longer willing to lose more).<br/><br/>The game is most often played with alcohol instead of coins (if it ever was played with coins) -- filling shot glasses with beer or wine and moving those about instead. This can shorten the game, since the &quot;currency&quot; being exchanged is consumed as it is won. It can also balance the game, since the better one plays, the drunker he/she gets from drinking his opponent's brew, self-imposing a handicap. In this version of the game, &quot;Tablero&quot; may be declared only when there are 6-7 shot glasses lined up horizontally, or 7 lined up diagonally, and the player who lined them up MUST consume at least half of the shots so claimed. The balance may be assigned to their opponent, themself, or anyone at the table of legal drinking age.<br/><br/>Many SCA-events run Tablero tournaments, in which there is usually a table limit of 2 beers (or 24-oz) set to keep the tournament moving (and the participants capable of competing). In the drinking version of the game, there is the addition of the Queen's number. A lady at the table rolls two dice and this number becomes the Queen's number for that game. Upon rolling the Queen's number, the player who rolled it should take a shot glass from the board, raise a toast to the Queen, and then put the shot glass back on their opponent's fill line (the back row). If the player who rolls the Queen's number fails to make such a toast, his opponent may declare &quot;Treason to the Queen&quot;, take a shot from the board, drink it, and then require his opponent to fill it on HIS fill line. The player who rolled the Queen's number then retains the dice and play continues (unless the Queen's number is a passing number, ie: 7,11, or 12)<br/><br/>Honest Mistakes- If a player makes a mistake, any mistake, in the moving of the shot glasses, in the handling of their stake of beer, etc, their opponent can point out that they made an &quot;honest mistake&quot;, describe the nature of that mistake, and then be rewarded with a shot from the table and control of the dice.  If they FAIL to notice their opponent's &quot;honest mistake&quot;, once the dice are rolled again the mistake becomes part of the on going game, all wrongs are forgiven, and no amount of complaining later on can reverse it NO MATTER WHAT THE MISTAKE WAS. It is prudent to pay close attention to your opponent throughout the game, because &quot;honest mistakes&quot; happen. If you are caught making an honest mistake, you are obliged to acknowledge the truth and suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>In all versions of the game, house rules are as rampant and as varied as can be, as no &quot;definitive&quot; rule set exists for the game. When playing, make sure to agree to a rule set with your opponent beforehand. In ALL versions of the game, leaving the table to go to the bathroom or ANY instances of vomiting are grounds for disqualification. Players should only play as many games as their biology can actually stand<br/><br/>",

JACKPOT! puts you in control of one of five apocalypse hardened contestants and pits you against your friends in a beautifully violent fight to survive.&quot;<br/><br/>A slick combination of survival and inventory management game-play with an exciting mix of continuously changing goals and a huge arsenal of weapons makes for fresh game-play every time.<br/><br/>The game is conducted in rounds based within different, randomised, game show events. These range from killing the most zombies to throwing the least weapons. Some also change certain game-play elements. Players can win money and have choice of who plays first by excelling within these different events and winning places above the other players.<br/><br/>Money can be used to buy revealed weapons and items from the shop stock which is restocked from a deck in the centre of the table. Players take turns to buy weapons and items. After everyone has decided to stop buying they move on to equipping items from their inventory (hand). Weapons add power to a contestant but can also be thrown at individual enemies to deal double damage. Players may also flip their chosen contestants into &quot;BOSS mode&quot; once per game and deal double damage with their contestant and all weapons they control. Items tend to be one use effects such as gaining health, destroying another item/weapon or sending attacking zombies towards another player. Any items and weapons equipped during an event are lost at the end of the round, so players must be tactical when deciding which items/weapons they equip during each event.<br/><br/>Finally, all players are attacked by zombies from the top of a randomised deck which contains normal zombies, effect zombies and boss zombies. On the first event of the game each player is attacked by two zombies. This number is increased by one during each successive event. The game ends when all players but one have been killed.<br/><br/>These features alongside a deep fictional flavour, a tonne of tongue-in-cheek pop culture references and a sharp, colourful, art style combine to create a unique game experience for players to get their teeth into!<br/><br/>",

A-class ships move faster and carry more cargo, but cannot navigate the Suez or Panama Canals. The home port is important, because it counts as a permanent trade contract and many of the game functions can only be carried out there.<br/><br/>During the game, players draw destination cards and cargoes, which can then be bought from the bank. Cargoes can only be sold in one of the destinations - each card has 3 to choose from. Players can also buy trade contracts for the ports, which brings in more profit when selling cargo there and forces other players to pay fees when visiting those ports. At the start of the game there's a basic profit for selling cargo; stock market fluctuations (event cards) may later change this.<br/><br/>Movement at sea is by die rolling. A 1 or a 6 result in drawing an event card, which may be positive or negative and may affect other players also. <br/>Events include icebergs, hurricanes, carrying Royal Mail, competing for the Blue Ribbon prize, accidents, smuggling etc.<br/><br/>A player that loses her ship or goes bankrupt must turn to piracy, at least temporarily. Piracy may be profitable, but also carries a score penalty at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players can also buy insurance to protect against losses, or convert cash into gold bullion which is safer from market fluctuations and other hazards.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as any player decides to end it by calling out &quot;Stand By&quot;. All players now make their way back to their home ports, where all their assets are converted back to cash; winner is the player who has amassed the biggest fortune by any means available in the game.<br/><br/>",

The questions require that the player lists several items, e.g. Name six animals that can strech out their tongue, or name seven Germanic tribes, or name ten words that end in -heit.<br/><br/>On a players turn, he chooses how many points he will attempt to win (and thus the difficulty of the question). He will then roll a die, which determines whether he should answer the blue, yellow or red question on the card. The colour also determines how much time the player gets to answer the question: 60 seconds for a blue question, 45 seconds for a yellow question and 30 seconds for a red question.<br/><br/>A player doesn't need to answer the question alone, though. He can offer other players points for their assistance. If a correct answer is given within the time, the player and his helpers score points.

The guest cards need to be deposited in the correct sequence at the party cards, the first player to discard all cards wins the game. The party cards are laid out, the guest cards are dealt to the players. In his turn a player must place one card and may place more. The first card next to a party card must be a 1 or 6, the following cards must be in sequence, ascending or descending. If a player cannot or does not want to place a card, he must draw a card, if the stack is finished he must place a card if he can.<br/><br/>Premise and Gameplay From Publisher: All the animals must attend the most correct birthday party: in the wood, at the farm, at home or inside the pond. But at the entrance they find a special command, so players must be really skilfull to try to get rid of all their cards, sending all the animals to the correct birthday party. The game mechanism is quite free and players will decide how many cards to play at each turn; they can even not play any card, but instead pick up a new one.<br/><br/>",

Is the right moment there, they bite quickly! But not everything that ends up between their teeth, is really a treat. Those who manage to get the most food at the end, win the game.<br/><br/>The cards show either one, two or three animals or an alarm clock. They come in four colours, which are also found on the board. The players look at the three cards, to that they know where the most points can be found. Then, a spinner is turned. Depending on how much luck you want to introduce in the game, it is spun fast or slow.<br/><br/>When a player believes that the colour of a card he wants to gain is under his mouth, he pushes the head of the crocodile down, stopping the spinner. Now is checked, what the each player, not only the one who stopped the disc, touches with his alligator mouth.<br/><br/>If a crocodile touches a colour from the available cards, that player takes all those cards. If the crocodile touches nothing or a colour that is unavailable, he gains nothing.<br/><br/>Then, the cards are replenished, the crocodiles are placed back in their starting positions, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Original German description:<br/><br/>Im Sumpf lauern die hungrigen Krokodile auf fette Beute. V&ouml;llig reglos beobachten sie ihre Umgebung und warten darauf, dass etwas K&ouml;stliches an ihrer Nase vorbei schwimmt. Ist der richtige Moment gekommen, schnappen sie schnell zu! Doch nicht alles, was mit einem Happs zwischen ihren Z&auml;hnen landet, ist auch wirklich ein Leckerbissen. Wer es schafft, gezielt zuzubei&szlig;en und am Ende die meisten H&auml;ppchen hat, gewinnt das Spiel.<br/><br/>Die Karten zeigen entweder ein, zwei oder drei Tiere oder einen Wecker. Das alles gibt es in den vier Farben, die auch auf dem Spielplan zu finden sind. Die Spieler schauen sich die drei Karten an, damit sie wissen, wo sie den Kreisel am besten stoppen m&uuml;ssen, um Punkte zu bekommen. Dann wird der Kreisel gedreht. Je nachdem, wieviel Zufall man im Spiel haben m&ouml;chte, dreht man den Kreisel schnell oder langsam. Wenn ein Spieler glaubt, dass die Farbe einer Karte, die er haben m&ouml;chte unter seinem Maul ist, dr&uuml;ckt er den Kopf des Krokodils schnell nach unten und stoppt so die Strudelscheibe. Jetzt wird &uuml;berpr&uuml;ft, was die einzelnen Spieler, nicht nur der, der die Scheibe angehalten hat, mit seinem Krokodilmaul ber&uuml;hrt. Ber&uuml;hrt ein Krokodilmaul eine Farbe, von der auch Karten offen ausliegen, so nimmt der Spieler alle davon an sich. Zeigt sein Maul auf eine Farbe, zu der es keine Karte gibt, oder ins Leere, so bekommt er eben in dieser Runde nichts. Die Karten werden dann wieder auf drei offene Karten aufgef&uuml;llt, die Krokodile wieder in die Ausgangsstellung gekippt und die n&auml;chste Runde beginnt.<br/><br/>",

Vatican, the board game, recreates the process of the world&rsquo;s oldest election, a process with roots deep in the lives and careers of those cardinals who would aspire to the Papal office. Vatican, the board game, allows you the player to take the part of a cardinal and follow him through his life and career, through the run up to the election of a new Pope and finally, into the secret conclave of cardinals in the Sistine Chapel where the Pope is chosen. Vatican is a high-fidelity simulation of what it takes to become the leader of the Catholic Church. Vatican throws its players into the exciting ferment of issues, ambition, world politics, spiritual values and luck that make the election of the Pope both a rare and dramatic event. Vatican, the board game, asks you if you are smart enough and savvy enough and spiritual enough and lucky enough to win the votes of your Cardinal colleagues --- getting the answers to those questions is exciting, fun and probably the most enjoyable learning experience you&rsquo;re likely to have this year.<br/><br/>Vatican, the board game, allows you the chance to become Pope.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An unusual trick-taking, point-based bluffing card game.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Getting as many points as possible by collecting egg cards and avoiding cards with fried eggs.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>The 12 egg cards are put into a stack.<br/>The other cards (in four colours, each with values 1-24) are shuffled if the game is played with 8 players. If there are fewer players, specific cards are removed. Each player is dealt 12 cards.<br/><br/>The start player calls a colour. Each player puts a  card in front of him/herself, face down. If you have a card of the called colour, you have to put down a card of that colour. If not, you can choose any of your cards.<br/><br/>When all players have put down a card, each player decides if he/she wants to reveal his/her card, starting with the start player. You can only reveal your card if it is of the colour that was called. But if you have played a card in the called colour, you can choose to pretend you didn't and thus don't reveal your card.<br/><br/>If nobody reveals a card, the caller stays in control. If any cards have been revealed, the player with the highest card takes over control.<br/>The player in control can choose between<br/><br/>     continuing<br/>     ending the round<br/>     doubting a player.<br/><br/><br/>If the player in control continues, the same colour stays active and all players put a second card on top of the previous.<br/>If the player in control ends the round, the biggest liar is determined: the unrevealed cards are revealed and the player who played the highest card in the called colour gets an egg card. Then all played cards are put into a stack next to the player.<br/>If the player in control doubts a player, that player has to reveal his/her played card. If it is of the called colour, the doubted player must take all the played cards. If the player in control incorrectly doubts a player (i.e. they played a card in a different colour), the doubter must take all the played cards. Some cards have fried eggs printed on them, which count as negative points.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last card has been played.<br/>Each egg card is worth 3 points, each fried egg on one of the cards a player has received counts as -1. After five games, all points are added up and the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on when Blackbox originally put it out, this could be considered Chess's answer to collectible card games.  Cards represent typical chess pieces, and the board is defined by the rows of cards originally laid out.  Throughout the game players capture each others' pieces as in normal chess, but can continually add to the board from the cards they hold in their hands.<br/><br/>Additional rules, such as the pawn combo (after moving a pawn, you can make a second move through or into the vacated space), add new elements over classic chess.  Pawn combos together with piece limits and placement restrictions serve to balance the value of the different pieces.  A small number of cards have special powers on them, further changing the rules of the game.<br/><br/>",
