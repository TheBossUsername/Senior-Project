        "description": "(((Work on this title will start again in 2016)))<br/><br/>Loosely based on stock trading, company ownership and economic stability.<br/><br/>Each player will start the game with a small fund and during the first round will vie for low priced stock to gain control of one or more of the companies in the game. The players will then get turns to make decision of how to grow the companies they control while adding to their personal account, company account and making sure the global economy does not go bankrupt.<br/><br/>The player can buy upgrades in a number of different fields to grow the company profits each round. This in turn will move the stock price higher for that company. If you are invested into a company you don't own and you feel the current owner is not doing enough for the company you can try and make the deals needed to buy out controlling stock in the company or you can dump your stock and send the price falling down.<br/><br/>The game will comprise of only about 20% random mechanic. Just as in real life, the best laid plans can cur-come to unexpected events. On the players turn they must roll to see how many actions are allowed for their current turn...however if you need more actions, you may buy them.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most money in the personal account at games end. While you will most likely be a company owner during the course of play, you do not need to be an owner of a company at any point to win...just make the right investments.<br/><br/>Buy Low / Sell High<br/>Invest and Win<br/><br/>The game will incorporate player to player interaction and company to company interaction...a company can also own stock in other companies. It would not be unheard of for one company by game end to have controlling stock holdings over ALL the other companies.<br/><br/>Unique game-board will allow players to write onto it with vis-vis type markers, to track market progress<br/><br/>",

But this region is really special. You'll have plenty of chance to sample the outstanding local beer at more than 270 traditional Franconian private breweries. Nowhere else you'll find such a mass and variety of beer in Germany (or the world).<br/><br/>Landbierparadies is a specialized trade running five traditional Franconian pubs in the cities Nuremberg (host of the world's biggest toy fair) and F&uuml;rth selling only pure Franconian beverages and food.<br/><br/>Development of the card game started at the Essen fair 2009 and playtesting were done at most of their venues to catch the atmosphere. The 2 player card game inevitable themes to floor the typical wooden barrels of beer served at the pubs. Players distributes blond or dark beer cards to the barrels and try to meet the appropriate barrel number to drink it up and collect all the barrel matching (blonde or dark) mugs as a score. The famous &quot;Schnapsrunde&quot; might let you forget which color the barrel has and mix up your plans.<br/><br/>Cards produced by &quot;N&uuml;rnberger Spielkarten Verlag&quot;<br/><br/>",

They make their way north towards Br&eacute;court, their target, trying to pick up as many soldiers as possible.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 16 by 11 grid of hexes, and the object is to make it from the southern border to the northern border of the map, picking up more soldiers on the way, avoiding capture and death at the hands of the 20 german soldiers around the woods.<br/><br/>A simple d6 roll against a base difficulty is made for combat checks, modified by NCOs on either side. In addition, a number of french civilians who oppose the german occupation are scattered around the map and may help the US soldiers.<br/><br/>With the exception of the two soldiers the player starts with, the rest of the chits are placed around the map, blank side up, so that there is no way of knowing whether you encounter a german soldier, an american soldier or a french civilian until you issue the challenge (Thunder). US troops respond correctly (Flash), and are immediately incorporated into the squad.<br/><br/>",

It was decided, however, that developing a game version for each venue would create a much more personal souvenir. The decision proved to be solid, as sales were strong throughout the season and all the games were sold within the span of the promotion. The ability to add personal detail to your game is a key to success!<br/><br/>",

If the answer is correct the player moves their pawn forward to the next available space on the board which has the number of their correct answer. The game is themed such that the players are mice and they may land on special squares:  escape a cat, move forward to n, chased by a cat, move back to n or caught in a mousetrap, miss one turn.<br/>There are two sets of cards, one of addition and one of subtraction, and a double sided board to go with each card set.<br/><br/>",

At first, the players take turns putting one of their cards into each of the four quadrants of the board, afterwards they can put them onto any field. When all cards have been placed, the cards can be moved to adjacent fields. Two adjacent cards can be moved together. When a player manages to form a four card (A5 sized) rectangle, he/she can take one of the opponent's cards out and place it on the rectangle - these cards are now secure (and can be moved together, too).<br/><br/>When a player manages to form a second A5 rectangle, he/she is the winner.

        "description": "Taktikus is a simple two-player abstract strategy game. The game is played with eight wooden marbles for each player (white and black, respectively) on an 8 by 8 square grid of indents. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s marbles. At the beginning each player places his or her marbles in the first row (i.e. the row closest to the respective player).  Each player then on turn moves one marble of choice. A marble may move horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) as far as the player wants but is not allowed to jump over other marbles (of either color). Change of direction during a move is not allowed. Marbles are captured in one of two ways:<br/><br/>     by capturing one or more of the opponents marbles (in an unbroken row or column) between two of one&rsquo;s own marbles.<br/>     by moving a marble into an empty space in-between two of the opponents marbles, which are both captured.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when one player is left with only one marble (unless he/she is able to win the game in the subsequent move by capturing two of the opponent marbles) and the other player is the winner.<br/><br/>The rule sheet that comes with the game has a couple of diagrams illustrating the two types of capture.<br/>The nice, small wooden board is in two hinged halves with storage compartment for the marbles inside when closed.<br/><br/>",

Yesterday, extreme Muslimists built a Giant Mosque, planted like a victory flag, at Ground Zero. That's right, the flattening of the World Trade Center nine years ago was part of a broader Islamofacist terror plot designed to circumvent local planning laws and lower the notoriously expensive NYC ground rent at the same time. Why? So that the entirety of downtown Manhattan can be turned into the world's biggest mosque - a project they refer to as The Giant Mosqtapus. If we don't stop this Megamosque now, it's tentacles will strangle the life out of this, the greatest city, in the greatest country on earth. Only you can stop Mosqopoly!&quot;<br/><br/>",

Furthermore, there are some limited references to sex and drug dealers, so this is not a game for younger kids)<br/><br/>TURN SEQUENCE<br/>Each turn has 9 Phases: <br/>1. Influence Phase<br/>2. Initiative Phase<br/>3. Plotting Phase<br/>4. Recruitment Phase<br/>5. Event Phase<br/>6. Action Phase<br/>7. Capture Phase<br/>8. Recovery Phase<br/>9. End Phase<br/><br/>The game uses two custom card decks.  The Character Deck consists of the various characters, groups and locations from the show.  5 characters are placed face up, and players pay Blook Tokens to recruit them, with bonuses/penalties to to cost of recruitment depending on where the Character is on the Recruitment Track.  Once a Character is recruited, the remaining Characters on the Recruitment Track slide down, and a new Character Card is added to the beginning of the Track.<br/><br/>The Event Deck is drawn from by each turn by each player in the Plotting Phase to give them special actions that they can use later in the Event Phase.  In addition, each controlled Character has one or more special Actions that players may use in the Action Phase to attack, capture, or control Characters from other players.<br/><br/>Bidding is used to control the order of players turns.<br/><br/>",

One or more other players control sheep that try to stay out of the dip and pen.  Play occurs on a grid of 18 by 18 squares.  Hedges, bushes, fences and water hazards impede movement.  The farmer may move vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.  The dogs and sheep move only vertical or horizontal.  The farmer moves the total of the throw of three dice and can divide his movement between himself and the two dogs.  The sheep use one die, and cannot move next to the farmer or dogs or through natural obstacles.   When the farmer or dogs move next to a sheep it forces the sheep to move away.  The farmer also has additional fences that he place to block movement.<br/><br/>Although components are not included, complete rules were published in Games and Puzzles Magazine no. 5.  It is suitable for miniatures play using model railroad accessories on a ruled grid.<br/><br/>",

The Easter Bunny suggests &quot;Perhaps a friendly contest is in order then. Let's see who can bring the most happiness, joy, and excitement to the children this year!&quot;. Santa chugs his latte and says to the Easter Bunny: &quot;Bring it!!!&quot; And the game was on!<br/><br/>This game is a print and play game for two players. It was designed to be relatively quick (29 turns; all quick) and be easy on the print cartridge. It also has basic strategy that may not be apparent at first. All images were public domain and taken from<br/><br/>The game consists of a series of bidding contests in which the winner of each contest receives a card. Cards that are won will later be used in future bids for new cards. Most contests are won by playing a card with high Excitement, Joy, or Happiness.

They know that the one who garners the most favor from Santa is rewarded a 2-month vacation in Hawaii with any other Elf at the North Pole. And the most important thing of all? There's only one girl Elf, Gizelda in the doll wigs department (and she's the only Elf that's been to Hawaii EVERY YEAR!)<br/><br/>All you need is a pair of six-sided dice (you're not playing Monopoly that often, are you?), 1 deck of standard playing cards, the game rules, and scoresheets.<br/><br/>Players take turns attempting to complete the assembly of toys that are on the conveyor belt. They receive bonus points for dice combinations, completing a toy that their department specializes in (the same suit as their score sheet), and for completing the toy that their department makes all the time (a specific card).<br/><br/>It's a family game for 1 or more players and available free as a print and play game.<br/><br/>Who will become the Great Garbanzo and earn the most Favor? Most importantly, who will get to take the beautiful Gizelda to Hawaii?<br/><br/>",

The trip may end but the fun never stops. The journey continues by adding cards to your collection.<br/><br/>The aim is to score the most points before either a certain distance is covered by the transportation you are in (eg 10 miles) or when you reach a destination (eg Grandma's House). Vroom is played by playing out 'object' and 'transmission' cards. Object cards are played when the player sees the object on the card (eg 'Stop sign'). Players score points for playing objects and for collecting sets of like objects (the latter achieved through the play of transmission cards).<br/><br/>",

In each round a category of questions is read out and each team bids on the number of correct answers they think they can give, until one team outbids the other.  The winning bid is then multiplied by 10 and this is the number of points now at stake in the round.<br/><br/>The team that made the higher bid must now attempt to give their answers, against the clock.  If they manage to give enough right answers, they win the points.  If they give a wrong answer, the opposing team scores the points.<br/><br/>The game ends when one team reaches a total of 250 points.<br/><br/>",

Each running cars through a series of moves, shooting attacks, ramming actions, and special maneuvers, the players struggle to be the best of the best.<br/><br/>-- Description from the back cover of the Gearmageddon Core Rules Book<br/><br/>Gearmageddon was designed to be a game, plain and simple. We wanted to make something fast and fun that could be played within a hour to an hour-and-a-half with minimal brainwave expenditure. Gearmageddon is kind of a zero-calorie asphalt death match.<br/><br/>- From the Introduction of the Gearmageddon Core Rules Book<br/><br/>In Gearmageddon, there are three basic actions: move, shoot, and ram. Movement is determined by a player setting the speed of a vehicle and selecting maneuvers. Combat is performed using a target number system. Collision damage is calculated based on speeds and structures of vehicles. Driver Cards provide opportunities for rule-breaking events that can instantly change the tide of battle. Weapon and Upgrade Cards are used for quick reference during games.<br/><br/>In addition to rules for arena combat, Gearmageddon has rules for combat races based on the 2008 movie Death Race.<br/><br/>The Core Rules includes rules for cars, motorcycles and tractor-trailers. Gearmageddon was designed to be used with 1/64 scale vehicle miniatures and 3D components. The game's simple rule of erring on the side of a rules decision that causes maximum damage accelerates gameplay.<br/><br/>In 2011, Exploding Goat Games, LLC started the Worldwide Arena Series, a tournament that ranks Gearmageddon players according to their performance in each game played. Standings are posted weekly on the Exploding Goat Games, LLC Web site.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Wizard of Oz : The Game (Kids version) is an entry-level game with the objective of collecting three token cards while travelling down the path of the Yellow Brick Road and arriving first at the Emerald City. The game is played on a colorful board with beautifully reproduced scenes from the movie. This is a roll-the-die-and-move game with different spaces on the Yellow Brick Road where you collect your tokens and perhaps encounter the Wicked Witch (who causes you to lose your turn) or Winged Monkeys (who you must battle using competitive die rolls - win and you gain a Token card, lose and you miss your next turn). There are also spaces for drawing Toto cards which provide players with special abilities.  Landing on an Emerald City space allows you to draw an Emerald City card and a corresponding Token card. Corner spaces are considered &quot;enchanted&quot;. The Glinda corner space lets you move ahead 6 spaces. The Ruby Slipper space allows you to double your movement that turn. The final corner space is the Wizard of Oz and allows you take a Token card.  For kids 6 years and older.<br/><br/>From the Rules:<br/><br/>Relive the most beloved motion picture of all time as you follow the Yellow Brick Road through the Land of Oz to reach the Emerald City. As Dorothy, Cowardly Lion, Tin Man or Scarecrow, you will defeat the Wicked Witch of the West, battle winged monkeys and collect your corresponding tokens. Help Dorothy keep her Ruby Slippers, Tin Man find a Heart, Scarecrow a Diploma and Cowardly Lion his Medal of Courage. Then, continue on to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>This is a different game from The Wizard of Oz: The Game.  Notably, that game is a family game, whereas this is children's game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS:<br/><br/>Agree before starting to play either 12 or 20 overs. Toss a coin to see who goes first.  Bowling team must use 4 overs of 'Fast Bowling', then 4 overs of &lsquo;Medium Pacers&rsquo; and then 4 overs of &lsquo;Spinners&rsquo;. For a 20 over game, overs 13-18 follow the same order in lots of 2 overs. The final 2 overs are the bowlers choice. Use your favourite players to compete against other favourites!<br/><br/>Even include yourself in the team!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/><br/>Bowler throws 2 dice and the batsman follows the directions on the card. The batting team then throws 2 dice and looks at the appropriate card for the result.<br/><br/>Example: 5th over (medium pace) bowler throws the dice and gets a 4 (inswinger). Batsman looks up Inswinger card and throws the dice. A6 is shown on the dice = 4 runs.<br/><br/>The only time the batter doesn&rsquo;t throw the dice is on the number 8 Spinners card, which is an automatic 1 run wide.<br/><br/>For this game it is recommended that no extra balls be bowled for extras such as No Balls and Wides.<br/><br/>Commentate the game it is played and add your own comments if you wish<br/><br/>",

By playing cards from their hands, they can implement solutions to these situations.<br/><br/>To start the game, twelve goal cards are taken randomly from the deck of 50, with four goal cards laid face up. Each goal card is labeled home, city or factory and shows two, three or four eco symbols, respectively, the symbols being air, water, energy and natural resources. Each player starts with a hand of five eco cards; most of these cards show one or two eco symbols, along with a description of what this solution represents, e.g., &quot;Recycle used paper&quot; shows one tree (natural resource) while &quot;Front-loading washers&quot; shows one water and one energy.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either starts a stack of cards on the table in front of him (with at most three stacks in play), adds up to one card to each stack in play, or else discards any number of cards from hand. The player can also play one action card (of which there are five in the deck) and claim one goal card, assuming he has the needed eco symbols in a stack and the environmental solutions match the situation shown on the goal. (&quot;Carpool lanes&quot; are useless in providing clean air at home.)<br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, he refills his hand to five cards. When a goal card is claimed, another goal card is revealed. Once the final goal card is claimed, the player with the most goals wins; in the event of a tie, the tied player who has the most eco symbols on his goal cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Unusually for Pepys at the time, they released this game in a double sized box so that it could offer two complete packs of 44 cards, one red pack and one blue pack. It was suggested in the rules that you should use one pack for 2 or 3 players, but two packs for 4 or more.<br/>The game seems to have 'borrowed' ideas in the playing card game Bezique. Players try to win tricks, in the normal way, i.e. you must follow suit, if you cannot, then you may trump the trick. There are no trumps at the start of the game but can be introduced later. If a player can lay down a 'marriage', that is, two pairs that go together:<br/>The Prince marries Snow White<br/>Donald Duck marries Donna Duck<br/>Mickey Mouse marries Minnie Mouse<br/>Big Bad Wolf marries The Witch<br/>The suit of such a marriage immediately becomes trumps, at least until another marriage is announced, then that suit becomes trumps.<br/>Points are scored for marriages and winning certain cards in your tricks.<br/><br/>",

In your turn, you hope to make a word from your collection of letters, the longer the better. However, some thought is needed because once a word is played, it can be added to, to make a longer word. Thus you would score some points for the first word, and yet more for the longer second word. So it pays to be thinking this through. The score increases as words get longer (1 for a two letter word, 2 for three, 4 for four, 6 for five, 10 for six, and so on.<br/>They obviously had AP in the 50's because the rules say &quot;To save time, players should be considering their next play while their opponents are playing&quot;.<br/>A more advanced game &quot;For experts&quot; allows you to intrduce a little more interaction.<br/><br/>",

This allows for a quicker and easier game, while still retaining all of the edge-of-the-seat dice-rolling thrills that players love.<br/><br/>In turn, players roll five dice and may choose to keep their results, or re-roll any number of dice up to two additional times, while trying to make the highest point-scoring combination of die results. At the end of their turn, players record their score on the custom score pad, and play proceeds to the next player. Play continues in this manner until all players have filled their score sheet, or until one player has scored 50 points. The first player to 50 points is the winner.<br/><br/>This version of the ruleset also includes bonus rules for Ja, See? Express Express, the fastest and most exciting way to play Ja, See?

        "description": "Highly collectable detective game from this famous British author of detective and horror stories. The rule book outlines a detailed scenario in which a murder has taken place and one of six infamous criminals must be to blame.  The players are detectives and move around a map of Britain and in various towns get to look at one of the cards which may help provide an alibi for one of the suspects, advance the investigation further or merely cause a delay.  When enough information has been gathered a player can race back to the town the murderer is in and arrest him to win.  Nice system which ensures it plays differently each time.  Includes metal detective figures.<br/><br/>",

The offensive and defensive players each have a set of play cards.  The defense card has a grid of colors on it; the offense card has holes representing the play.  After plays are chosen, the offense card is placed over the defense card and the results is determined by the colors showing through the play holes.  For some results a die is rolled for further resolution.  Overall, a simple but clever system to showcase the play-calling aspect of the sport.<br/><br/>",

Some tactical elements do come into play with differences between Pike, Musketeers, Dragoons,Forts, and Navies. Another aspect to the game is the Scottish dimension and trying to keep Scotland in the war.<br/><br/>Included with the game are secret order cards, either General Direction cards, or, Orders to the Armies.Once played, players are committed to a certain move or order thereby adding to the Fog of War.<br/><br/>The game comes in `Kit` form which means some preparation is required.(Cutting counters and adding 10 sided dice ).All counters are Regiments of Pike,Musket,Horse, etc<br/>Players recruit armies from either an historical or free set up.Army Commanders are then deployed to units (5 per Royalist and Parliament).Orders are then issued secretly to armies stacked only with Commanders from a pool of movement tokens ( i.e North, South, West, East, South East, North West, etc).<br/>Movement is up to 3 areas for Foot, 4 for Horse, and 1 for Guns. Players then roll a die to reveal who has the turn initiative and players then reveal their orders and move units checking for possible contacts with the enemy.  If contact is made with the enemy, tactic cards come into play, each side either playing, Search,Hold, or Evade and rolling a 10 sided die for the outcome, which may still lead to armies not engaging in battle. If battles do occur, then they are resolved using  10 sided dice and cross checking a percentage number for units engaged (Pike,Musket,Dragoons,Horse,Guns,Siege,Ships) on a Fire and Melee table. An example of Pike on Melee is 60%, so if 3 Pike regiments were involved in a battle on either side, 3 10 sided dice would be rolled and would hit on a roll of 1-6.<br/>These rolls can be adjusted by terrain the defender holds, and the Commanders used, who gain battle experience the further the game goes on. Most Commanders start at experience level<br/>0 or 1.Both The King and Cromwell start at 0 experience.<br/>The game is played in weekly turns and starts from Jan 1642 and lasts till September 1650 (a possible 36 turns ).Players may also recruit further armies during recruiting phases in<br/>1643, 1646, and 1649.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Available as the toy prize in a children's meal at A&amp;W Restaurants, Hot Dog Run is a simple matching game for 2 to 3 players.<br/><br/>Each player begins with a set number of hot dogs (7 each for a 2-player game; 5 each for 3-player), and then starting with the youngest player (who places their first hot dog near the &quot;start&quot; space on the package) they alternate placing one hot dog at a time so that the symbol on one end matches the symbol on the end of the previously played hot dog.   If a player cannot make a match, they must take a new hot dog from the draw pile and then may play it if it matches (if no match is found, that player's turn ends).<br/><br/>The first player to run out of hot dogs wins.<br/><br/>",

The active player now has to form the word either from the letters or the pictures. If s/he is correct, s/he can move his/her pawn to the next field of the word's color on a scoring track. Occupied fields are ignored, so there is a certain level of strategy involved. The first player to reach the top field on the track is the winner.<br/><br/>(User sumary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

A pack of 48 object cards and 48 word cards are used. 16 cards, from the object cards are placed face-down around the rim of the board (the yellow spaces), and 8 cards from the word pack are placed face-up on the central red spaces. <br/>Each player has a hand of 6 cards. In your turn, you can take a card, exposed or not, the only rule being that you must replace the card taken with a like-card (a picture with a picture or a word with a word). Or you can take the top card from the picture deck or the word deck,The object is to win tricks of 2 or 3 cards. The set must contain at least one card from the objects and a like one from the words. There is a table at the back of the rules which players may consult to check their trick is legal. Any time you make a trick, say, with an apple and the word apple card, check to see if any other trick has been collected in that family, for example, another player has played a banana picture with a banana word card. In this eventuality, you may take the banana trick, giving you two tricks in the 'fruit' family. And, of course, if a player makes a trick from one family and the two other tricks of that family have already been won, the player playing the third trick may take both the other tricks. Scoring takes place after one player has the required number of tricks (the number required changes with the number of players).<br/>Another set collecting game is described, called Family Triplets, in which you need to collect tricks of three cards.<br/><br/>",

The rules refer to a board, but a diagram on page 4 shows that it is very basic, essentially a square enclosing two diagonals. One diagonal is for the vehicles and the other for the pedestrians.<br/><br/>Rules are included for four different games using the set. The first is a suit-following game. One player places one of the four vehicle or pedestrian cards on the appropriate space. Everyone else must either follow suit, pass, or play a Stop card on top of the pile. The next player must pass or play a Caution card on one of the other three spaces. Then a Go card must be played, and the player after the one placing go leads off the new suit in the location designated by the Caution/Go cards. The policeman card allows a player to stop the play in the current suit and immediately start a new suit in its proper location. The first player to empty his hand wins the round and each other player is penalized for the values of the cards still held. A game is four rounds, with lowest total points winning<br/><br/>The rules do not specify a publication date, but the box has a &quot;Patent applied for 9963/38&quot;, which suggests a 1938 publication date. The clothes on the people in the illustrations scream the 30's. Also, Zebra Crossings were introduced to Britain in the 30's and this game may have been published to take advantage of the interest in such things. Indeed, the rule book notes that this was one of a series of &quot;Road Sense&quot; games being published as &quot;a splendid means of encouraging thought in road usage&quot;, adding that &quot;Police Chiefs, Local Authorities and Safety First Associations, etc., recommend this series of games.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Cards are revealed around the table and if the exposed cards total a shilling (12 old pence) or more then the first to shout that observation, wins. Very good to get children used to money and also good for their mental arithmetic calculations.<br/> This game is as entertaining and exciting as it is simple.<br/>The cards are dealt in the usual manner and played in rotation in front of the players without being seen until played. When any of the cards &mdash; not necessarily all of them &mdash; that are lying on the top &mdash; make up one shilling exactly, the player who first calls &quot; Shilling &rdquo; takes such cards, together with any that may be beneath them. The game finally rests with two players, and is won by the holder of all the cards above threepence ha'penny. An additional interest is added if a forfeit is given in the event of a player calling &ldquo; Shilling &rdquo; by mistake.<br/><br/>",

In this game, a cave girl named Sharr must compete for her existence with dinosaurs. each character in the game comes with several cards designating their fighting abilities which can be used in battle. There are several scenarios included with the game.<br/><br/>Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.<br/><br/>",

Getting called out on selling arms to politically dodgy customers means your diplomats will be shamed into retirement and your ability to do further deals is then reduced.<br/><br/>The first player to sell all their weapons wins.<br/><br/>From the game:<br/><br/>&quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt is reported to have said of the Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza, &quot;He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch&quot;. The story is apocryphal, but it tells a truth that persists today. We will support, encourage and sell arms to the worst of humanity as long as it is convenient to do so. Once the relationship sours, however, it's time to back out as quickly and quietly as possible, preferably invading in the wake to claim a righteous victory for democracy and freedom!<br/><br/>To sample the exciting diplomatic thrills of global politics, we bring you this game. All it takes is about 15 minutes, 30 coins, 3 dice, a determination to sell weapons to anyone and the cunning to avoid being caught.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In politics it isn&rsquo;t just about strategy, it&rsquo;s about how you can manipulate others into handing you a victory.<br/><br/>Politics support three to five players and plays in under an hour. Players must convince others to back their political agenda while keeping both their allies and enemies in the dark. Politics is based around the principle that nothing in the game can be accomplished without the help of others, but there can be only one winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Where's Tinker Bell is not a traditional board game in many ways, although there are certain elements like turn taking which are the same. The game comprises of a revolving green plastic base which looks a little bit like a small green hill. On the top of the hill you place a small plastic model of Peter Pan. He doesn't serve any purpose in the game at all, but the girls quite like him! There are eight plastic bluebell cups which are placed over eight holes on the revolving board. Under one of these is placed a small Tinker Bell fairy and the aim of the game is to discover exactly where she is! You might think this all depends on guess work but it does not because Tinker Bell makes a 'tinkle bell' sound when she moves.<br/><br/>So how does the game work? After you have put all the above pieces in place, each player then receive a number of playing cards. These have pictures of Peter Pan, Wendy, John and Michael, and depending which cards you have determines whether you can spin the revolving board or not! It does not tell you who should go first in the instructions but we normally say it is the youngest player. So if that player has the appropriate card, they can trade it in for a spin of the board. And this is what happens...<br/><br/>Firstly they have to be quite careful because if the board is spun too heavily all the bluebells will go flying. If you spin it too gently Tinker Bell will not make a sound. Therefore, the key to success in this game is getting your spin just right! If you do, the board should spin round and you should hear some tinkling music which hopefully should lead you to working out which bluebell Tinker Bell is hiding under! Now this is actually easier said than done! As an adult with probably better levels of concentration than my daughters, I find it quite difficult. You really need to have total quiet and place your ear as close to the board as you can! Then it is possible to get a good idea where she is although I still think it comes doen to a certain amount of luck!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "3 on 3 is a very simple game.  In it, you have 3 different colored pieces that can stack on each other, each a different color.<br/><br/>During a turn, a player moves the top piece on one of the spaces onto the board to another space, and scores points for that color.  Players must either move a piece from, or a piece to, a space which didn't either have a piece from it or to it the last turn (after the first turn this is true.  The first turn a piece may move to any empty space).<br/><br/>When a piece of a given color moves onto a space, its color scores 1 point for the number of pieces currently on that space (after landing on it).<br/><br/>Each player has one of the colors as their color.  The object of the game is for a player to have their color have the lowest score after any of the colors reached the target score selected at the start of the game (20-30 points is usually an ideal target score for a quick game).<br/><br/>While not initially intended, this game is now part of a planned series of games played on a single line, that will contain at least 3 games.  Two more are in the works.  This may change, but this is the plan of this moment.  Keep an eye out for a Geeklist containing the games in this planned series.<br/><br/>",

At this moment he passes to the opponent's turn losing the remaining shots.<br/><br/>Ther game ends when one participant hits the entire enemy fleet.<br/><br/>",

After a player loses $1,000 of their play money, the opposing player declares victory!<br/><br/>Both you and your opponent will each need a 54-card deck, damage counters to keep track of damage on the different Cardians in play, and $1,000 or more in play money. A player begins their turn by first drawing a card. On each turn, the player can do several things: Use a Support card, play an Action card, play a Field card, use an attack/special move, or just simply pass. Some Cardians can also Morph into a more powerful monster as long as the card has been in play for at least three turns.<br/><br/>Support cards are very useful, as they aid the player and add a twist to the game, but must be discard cafter use. But Action cards on the other hand never expire and can only be removed from its space by certain Support cards or Cardian moves.

This is done by removing some cards from a deck at the start and hiding them.  The rest are distributed, and as a player reaches one of their destination cards they reveal it, but also get to see one of an opponent's cards as well.  The idea being that once you have seen all the cards except those hidden you will know the secret destinations and win. Attractive large board showing available routes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sixteen Tons is a game for four players designed for a gallery setting, created by architect Nathalie Pozzi and game designer Eric Zimmerman. It also exist in a tabletop version aimed at dinner parties. On its surface, Sixteen Tons looks like a large-scale boardgame, in which players move very heavy pieces around a four-by-four grid, trying to maneuver their pieces into a winning position. The winniong position is pre the player to get her/his two game pieces orthogonally adjacent. This core gameplay is complicated by the fact that players can pay each other with real money. At the start of the game, each player takes out three one-dollar bills and this money is used to pay other players to move your pieces for you. Playing the game becomes an experience that critically blurs work and play, as the real value of money is grafted onto the artificial meanings of the game, and player identitiy shifts fluidly back and forth from cooperation to competition. Winning the game requires both strategic thinking and social smarts and the rules are intentionally ambiguous about whether players keep each others&rsquo; money after a game. Sixteen Tons is named after the folk song made famous in 1955 by Tennessee Ernie Ford about coal mining and debt bondage.<br/><br/>In Sixteen Tons, four players play a strategy game using heavy sections of steel pipe as the pieces of the game. At the beginning of the game, players take out three dollar bills from their wallets. This money is used to pay other players to move your pieces for you during the game. The play of Sixteen Tons combines strategic with social thinking. The strategy game is simple to solve &ndash; but the socal game is impossible to predict.<br/><br/>The rules are ambiguous about what to do with the money in hand at the end of the game. Some players return the three dollars back to their owners. Other players decide to play for keeps &ndash; or even increase the stakes and play with bigger bills.<br/><br/>",

In Paul Panda, players want to plant enough bamboo so that Paul has enough to eat and man has enough for their needs.<br/><br/>The game box has a perforated image of Paul Panda that can be lifted away from the surface and set vertically. This allows players to insert the included bamboo leaves into his mouth when he eats, with the leaves falling into the box. The bottom of the box consists of an &quot;empty&quot; forest where the 24 included bamboo poles can be placed to represent a growing bamboo plant. The remaining component is a spinner with four different areas in which actions will be randomly determined based on a spin of the pointer.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, after placing some bamboo poles in the forest, each player receives an equal number of poles, then the youngest player spins first. The four actions on the spinner are:<br/><br/><br/>     Paul needs to eat. The player takes a bamboo pole from the forest and adds it to his supply. One of the ten leaves is then placed into the Panda's mouth, removing it from play.<br/>     The lumberjacks cut down some of the forest. The player takes two bamboo poles from the forest area and adds them to his supply.<br/>     The sun shines brightly. The player takes one bamboo pole from his personal supply and adds it to the forest.<br/>     Rain helps bamboo grow. The player takes two bamboo poles from his personal supply and adds them to the forest.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to run out of bamboo poles wins; however, if Paul eats all ten bamboo leaves, the player with the fewest bamboo poles left wins the game, along with Paul the Panda.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the website:<br/>PUKEMASTER gets every party started, and is a brilliant drinking game for both single and team players. During the game you will face several challenges, which you help to develop. You&rsquo;re the one who sets the limit!<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re not in a festive mood after playing PUKEMASTER, you haven&rsquo;t played it right!<br/><br/>The board game has a very cheeky and smooth design. You can just wipe of the game board, if you should spill.The game board is magnetic, hence you can play the game everywhere &ndash; on the bus, at the festival, at the beach, or in the park.<br/><br/>The game board measures 16x16x4 cm. That&rsquo;s why it is so easy to carry with you. When the magnetic game board is folded out, it measures only 30&times;30 cm. Perfect for the bar desk, at your favorite bar!<br/><br/>",

The player's pieces and their movements are: a queen (one hex in any direction), drones (jump over adjacent hexes), adult workers (any number of hexes in any direction, no jumps allowed), young workers (one hex forward). If a young worker reaches one of the 5 <br/>opponent&rsquo;s pollen hexes she is promoted to an adult worker. If a bee finds an opponent&rsquo;s bee in one of the hexes where she could arrive, she can kill her. When a queen is threatened by an opponent&rsquo;s bee and she cannot escape to a safe hex nor she cannot protect herself with another bee, the player loses the game.<br/><br/>Our word &quot;centre&quot; is a word that we have inherited from Ancient Greek. The greeks called kentron the centre of a circumference, because kentron was the compass needle. But the primitive meaning of kentron was the insect sting. Kentron also meant &quot;the spike of the spear&quot;, and this is the name that this chess-like game recieves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game to make a long car journey a little easier.<br/><br/>Each player (hopefully not including the driver!) is given a 5 x 5 bingo card. The cards feature various things you might see out of the windows during the trip. If you see something, announce it to the other players (who can check that you aren't cheating), and then mark the item on your card.<br/><br/>A long game could be all the 25 items on your card. But a shorter game should be that the winner is the first player to complete a line of items.<br/><br/>Made by Gulf, the oil and petrol supplier, and mailed out in an envelope so no box needed. As the bingo cards need to be cut up into single cards, I would guess this is a pretty rare item to find in its complete, original shape.<br/><br/>",

Every player plays on ever turn in this Pokemon capturing frenzy. But watch out! It takes quick reflexes and fast thinking to snag the Pokemon you need to win! Features 36 all-new Pokemon from the Black and White televesion series!&quot;<br/><br/>The game uses pattern-matching skills to claim cards after capturing pokemon on the board.<br/><br/>Players turn over 3 cards each round. Each card lists 2 pieces of data which can be used to match one of three pieces of data listed on the game board for each Pokemon. You only need to match one thing to be able to capture the Pokemon. After you've played all three cards, you then check to see if you match any of the pattern cards set by the side of the board, ranging from 2 to 5 points. If you can claim a pattern, you keep that card and get the points. Once all 8 pattern cards are claimed, the game is over. It's all explained on one small two-sided rules sheet.<br/><br/>",

Hence it plays very fast, especially since the object is to get any one piece onto an opponent's goal space-- which  that player canot occupy himself. As in all games of this family, there are two different types of pieces which mostly move similarly. Pieces can jump over friendly pieces and jump over enemy pieces to capture them. With a board this small, sudden leaps to victory are common.<br/><br/>For those familiar with Camelot (1888):<br/><br/>Camette is a down-sized version of Camelot, even smaller than Cam, with a further reduced board size and number of pieces.  Camette was invented by Michael Wortley Nolan in 2002.<br/><br/>Camette is different than Camelot in the following ways:<br/><br/>1. The Camette board has 23 squares.  The Camelot board has 160 squares.<br/><br/>2. Each side in Camette has one Knight and three Men.  Each side in Camelot has four Knights and ten Men.<br/><br/>3. The object of Camette is to get one piece into the opponent's Castle.  The object of Camelot is to get two pieces into the opponent's Castle.<br/><br/>4. Victory in Camette also occurs if one side, even with only one remaining piece, captures all of the opposing pieces.  In Camelot, if the side capturing all of the opposing pieces has only one remaining piece, the game is a draw.  Victory in Camelot by capture of all of the opposing pieces occurs only if the victorious side has two or more remaining pieces.<br/><br/>5. Stalemate in Camette is impossible.  Stalemate in Camelot is possible, and is a victory for the stalemating side if it has two or more pieces.<br/><br/>6. In Camette, if both sides have only one remaining piece, the game continues until one piece captures the other, or one piece enters the opposing Castle.  In Camelot, if both sides have only one remaining piece, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

The remaining 63 cards are all shuffled and dealt to the players in rotation until the pack is exhausted.<br/><br/>The game is commenced by the player to the left of the dealer asking any other player for a card to complete a district of which he holds at least one card in his hand. If a player asked has such a card in his hand, he is bound to surrender it, and the first player then asks for another and so on until refused, when the right of asking is transferred to the player who refused him. The latter, in like manner, then asks for a card to complete a district in his hand, and so the game proceeds until all the districts are completed. Each district, when completed, is to be laid on the table (face downwards) by the player, and the game is won by that player who, at the conclusion, holds the most districts. A player may, at any time, refer to the Key Card in the centre of the table.<br/><br/>The game is undated, but one of the picture cards refers to &quot;the late Sir Gilbert Scott&quot;, the most famous Victorian architect. He died in 1878 so the game was probably new around 1880.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Early 20th century card game published by a Missionary Society, with the intention of making people aware of their work in the sub-continent. The game is fundamentally about India although Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) is included.<br/><br/>Three games are mentioned in the rules; Jugger, Picture Lotto and Buss. The former is the main game, the Lotto game has nothing to do with the traditional Lotto game, and there are no rules (in my set) to the game of Buss..<br/><br/>Players ask each other for cards in a set they already have at least one card in that set in their hand. In Jugger, the object is to collect the most sets. In Lotto, the object is to claim the most cards by answering correctly when a question is read out.<br/><br/>General Notes from the rules;<br/>Picture Cards<br/>At the top of each picture card there is the name of a place where missionaries are working. In the game these places are called 'Juggers', the phonetic spelling of 'Jugah', a Hindustani word meaning 'place' or 'post'. Where a place is not well known and the pronunciation is difficult, phonetic spelling is given.<br/><br/>Map Cards<br/>These are the Key Cards. Each map gives the names of the Juggers (marked by a heavy dot) in the set.<br/><br/>Question Cards<br/>All the question cards are essential for Picture Lotto.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The game with three pieces&quot;<br/><br/>Old Swedish boardgame published by Brio. An abstract strategy game for 2-4 players, it's reminiscent of Halma while also featuring Checkers-like piece elimination using rock-paper-scissors mechanics. Everyone has three pieces: &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. The goal is to move as many of your pieces as possible across the board. You can move your pieces left, right and forward, but never backwards, and diagonally only when jumping over other pieces. Hunters can kill eagles when jumping, eagles can kill snakes and snakes can kill hunters.<br/><br/>Because of the elimination mechanic, the winner is the player who reaches their target corner with the most pieces remaining (in case of a tie, the one who got there first). Unlike most similar games Trippel also supports a 3-player variant, though no specific rules for this are given.<br/><br/>Likely date of publication: 1950's-'60s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overview<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t Push Your Luck is an educational game, designed to incite discussion between the players about hemophilia, as well as help youth that live with the condition learn how to make decisions that are in their best interests.  The game supports 2-4 players and is played over the course of 45 minutes.  The game contains mechanisms that are not normally seen in educational games, and the effect is learning through engagement (fun).  It also features attractive youth-friendly graphic design to further increase the accessibility, engagement and desire to play.  Don't Push Your Luck combines light strategy of a family Euro with the fun and social exploration of a Party Game.<br/><br/>Just Another Day<br/>Each player in Don&rsquo;t Push Your Luck takes on the role of a child with hemophilia competing to have the most well balanced lifestyle, while trying to manage the risk they take in their activities. Players will be faced with the constant challenge of balancing of risk vs reward.  The game is played over three rounds, each representing one full day.<br/><br/>There is a central board surrounded by 16 activity cards, that are randomly drawn before the beginning of each round.  Each activity card represents a specific type of health: mental, social, emotional, and physical.  In turn, players go around the board picking up activity cards and placing them in their player area.  This represent them performing this activity.  For example: on your turn you may choose to take the &ldquo;hockey&rdquo; activity card.  Hockey provides 2 physical icons on it.  These icons are later used to obtain &ldquo;stars&rdquo;, at the various &ldquo;star spaces&rdquo; around the board.  The player with the most &ldquo;stars&rdquo; at the end of the game is declared the winner. <br/>  <br/>Inciting Discussion<br/>Players must be mindful of the activities they choose to participate in during the day, because at the end of every round (3 total), each player tells a story about their day by describing each of the activities they selected.  When the storyteller is finished telling describing each of their selected activities, the other players have an opportunity to discuss which of those activities they felt were not in the best interest of the story teller.   The storyteller will often be trying to play down the risk of their selected activities, as they will be judged by the other players.<br/><br/>",

Scoring is the same as in snooker, with cards representing the different coloured balls being &quot;potted&quot;.  Breaks can be built, but the tactical use of safety shots, including snookers, will be needed to come out ahead over a series of frames.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 5 cards, each of which represent a possible snooker shot: coloured balls score points, snooker and safety shots are defensive making it difficult for the opponent to &quot;pot&quot; a ball, whilst the fluke cards also score points acting as a &quot;joker&quot; for any ball.  Each player lays cards until they can no longer continue their scoring break, refreshing their hand after every card laid.  Their opponent then lays cards to score points in the same manner.  The game ends once all the red and coloured balls have been potted as in the real game of snooker.  The winner, as in snooker, is the player with the highest score.  More typically, one would agree to play a match over a number of games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rare word game from around the turn of the 20th century. Devised at a &quot;Famous London Literary Club&quot;, it was probably a new idea over 100 years ago.<br/><br/>52 cards all feature letters, each with a value that relates to the rarity of the letter in the English language (For example, an E would be 4, a Q would be 1, and so on). This value is important because if a player goes out whilst you still hold cards, then you give him the score of your unused cards - i.e. you are not penalised much for holding 'difficult' letters but you are if you hold common letters.<br/><br/>The game mechanic is simple. In a turn a player may lay as many cards as he wants but he must always have in mind a genuine word that could be spelt out eventually. For example, you might lay an L. The next player lays a T after the L (he is thinking of SALT). The next player might lay an I and an M after the T (he is thinking of ULTIMATE) and so on, until a player is challenged that there can be no such word with that array of letters (By the way, the letters must stay in the order they are laid, there is no rearranging letters). If challenged, a player must prove that he was thinking of a word, and if proven true, he receives payment (counters) from the others. If he was bluffing, he pays out counters to the persoin who challenged him.<br/><br/>When the game time is finished, the one with the most counters, wins.<br/><br/>By the way, in 1900 or so, they must have been aware of Analysis Paralysis because there is a fixed rule 'If you take longer than 30 seconds to play or pass, you forfeit your turn and must draw an extra card into your hand'.<br/>And another oddity, how often are you told to enjoy your game - in Latin? The phrase Experientia Docet!, is used at the end of the rules<br/><br/>",

In turn, you can choose to answer the question by passing the card to another player, who reads the question back to you and you give your answer.  Alternatively, you can challenge, where you will answer the question if another player answers it first.  A third option is to pass and not answer the question.<br/><br/>Answered questions give 1 point for a blue card, 2 points for a yellow card and 3 points for a red card.  After answering, each player can give you 2 bonus points if you revealed something they did not know about you.  Alternatively, if another player feels you went all out to answer the question, displaying honesty and bravery beyond the call of duty, they can say &quot;breakthrough&quot; and you get 3 bonus points.<br/><br/>Game is played to a pre-determined time limit where the most points wins (or a set number of points can be used).<br/><br/>",

This is a fairly traditional 'get to the end of the track' game.<br/><br/>Each player represents Pinocchio and receive 15 gold. You must start at the Carpenter's Shop and aim to arrive at the Cottage of the Talking Cricket. Movement is dictated by a spinner. If the spinner instructs you to take a card, you must obey the instructions on the card. If you are currently standing on a Safety Station you can ignore the card. The first to reach the cottage gains 5 gold and the winner is then the player with the most gold after all loans have been repaid.<br/><br/>A second version from Australia exists titled 'Walt Disney's Pinocchio the Merry Puppet Game' and mainly differs in the  graphics on and in the box. Only scant reference on the back of the rules pamphlet shows that the game was manufactured in Australia by John Sands. The playing components and rules are the same except for the playing pieces, with the Australian version having simple coloured wooden discs. Dated 1939 the game promotes Disney's second animated movie which was released in February 1940.<br/><br/>",

The board should be noted as A to F horizentally and as 1 to 6 vertically.  It is then left in the centre as a quick reference for each player to know where each of their pieces are standing. Each player will have 3 Warriors and 1 King.<br/><br/>Each player takes a player sheet on which they allocate 10 points in total secretly to their three Warriors. Then the four pieces (including the King) are placed on the centre back-line nearest to each player.<br/><br/>Decide a random starter. A player can move and/or have a 'battle'. Warriors move 1 square in any direction. Kings move up to 2 squares orthagonally. Moving a piece is done by crossing out the old grid reference where it was and writing in the new grid reference being the square that that piece has just moved to. No two pieces of the same player can be on the same space and a piece cannot jump over a piece of the same colour.<br/><br/>Battle is done by announcing the square a piece is currently on (so before a move). The Battle takes place if one or more opposing pieces are on that square. The attacker announces the strength of his piece and the defenders announce their strength. The strongest piece wins and there are tie-breakers should their be a tie. After a Battle, the victor receives one point for each of his pieces so he gets the reward of stronger pieces for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>If a King is challenged, it immediately loses and that player is out of the game.

        "description": "Fest im Sattel is a simple horse-themed roll-and-move game for children. It comes in a tin box whose lid is used as a board. The board shows a racecourse (shaped like an eight placed inside/onto an oval, with an extra circle inside one of the halves of the eight). Each player puts his/her horse token on the start space. Players take turns rolling the six-sided number die. If you roll a 1, 2 or three, you move your horse forward the corresponding number of spaces. Occupied spaces don't count, you just jump over them. If you roll a -1, you have to go back one space. Horses directly behind have to go back too. If you land on one of the special fields, you have to take a detour or lose a turn.<br/><br/>The player whose horse is the first to reach the finish line wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In each of the ten columns the players distribute four 0's, three 1 's, two 2's, one 4, and an A for appeal in any order. The players then take it in turn to bowl an over. It is advisable for each player to record the outcome of his over on a spare grid.<br/><br/>Object<br/>The player who scores the most runs before all ten of his appeals are located is the winner.<br/><br/>Play<br/>The bowler picks a line of six contiguous squares as the over. They are announced by simply giving the starting square and the direction &mdash; e.g. E5/SE. The batsman plots this line on his grid and announces the total number of runs scored (i.e. the sum of the numbers passed through) and the number of appeals.<br/>If a bowler thinks he knows the position of all ten appeals, he cries 'Howzat!' and reads out the positions. If any are wrongly placed the batsman draws up a fresh grid and continues anew. If the bowler is right, the batting side is all out. Obviously, if one side is still batting with more runs scored when the other side is all out, they need not continue. The bowler can then guess at the positions of the ten appeals, to discover the number of wickets down, and so determine the winning margin.<br/><br/>With a little ingenuity, limited-over and two-innings matches can be devised, together with individual batting and bowling figures, etc.<br/><br/>",

The size is such that matchsticks can be placed along the sides of the triangles. The large hexagon contains seven smaller 6-triangle hexagons, the centres of which are marked with large black dots.<br/><br/>One player is the 'mouse'. This is represented by a small coin which the player may place in any of the 24 triangles at the start of each game.<br/><br/>The other player is the 'cat' who attempts to trap the mouse in one triangle, by placing his matchsticks on the lines and gradually restricting the mouse's move-ments. His first move is to place a match anywhere on the board. The players then move alternately.<br/><br/>The mouse must move when it his turn. He may move to any triangle in the same small hexagon. That is to say he may move anywhere round the one dot. He may not cross over a matchstick.<br/><br/>Each player has two consecutive turns as the cat. He has 19 matchsticks which he may use on his two attempts to catch the mouse. He scores one point for each success. If he catches the mouse with 8 matchsticks in his first turn, he has 11 matchsticks for his second turn.<br/><br/>The first player to score 9 points is the winner.<br/><br/>The cat can always win with his first turn, but to get a lead over his opponent he must win and still leave himself enough matchsticks to win the second game as well. The best technique for the cat is usually to place his first two matches in opposite directions from the centre of the board as if to divide the board in half. He then ensures that the mouse is confined to one side of this division and in the smallest possible area.<br/><br/>The mouse, on the other hand, tries to keep to the largest possible open space, and to triangles where he has a choice of several dots round which he may move.<br/><br/>",

All that is required is a 7 x 7 squared grid, four playing pieces per player, and a die.<br/><br/>The pieces start in the positions as shown in the diagram (squares 0 and X) and the object is to manoeuvre the pieces so as to occupy two opposite centre squares (A-A or B-B in diagram).<br/><br/>Players move in turn according to the roll of the die as follows:<br/>1 or 4 = 1 square,<br/>2 or 5 = 2 squares<br/>3 or 6 = 3 squares<br/><br/>Movement is only allowed in a vertical or horizontal direction. It is not permissible to occupy the centre square, nor is one able to jump over another piece. Also only one piece can occupy any one square and it is obligatory to move the full number of squares if possible. The highlight of the game occurs when a piece lands upon a square occupied by an enemy piece. The owner of the moving piece must shout in a clear, loud voice the word &quot;Clobber&quot;. Having complied with that rule, he may remove the enemy piece and replace it anywhere on the board that he wishes, preferably as far from its target as possible.<br/><br/>This quick, simple game is well worth a try, it can become quite compulsive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Played upon a nine-by-nine squared grid, Synchro is an abstract game containing a number of very interesting concepts. Reference to the diagram will show that the board has four black squares, known as Vantage Points, and two Castles.<br/><br/>Each of the two players begins with twelve playing pieces of three types.- Lumps, Blobs and Things. Each piece also bears a number from 1 to 6 and a pair of pieces with the same number constitute a unit. A player's four Lumps consist of two units numbered 1 and 2, his four Blobs are units 3 and 4, whilst the four Things are 5 and 6.<br/><br/>The board is placed with a Castle in front of each player, who then places his pieces anywhere in the three rows nearest to him, one piece per square. On a turn, a player must move one of his units. Pieces may not move onto or over an occupied square, except when capturing an opposing piece. The actual moves that can be made are as follows:<br/>(1)    Where both members of a unit are on the board but neither is on a Vantage Point, both pieces are moved one or two squares in any direction, but both must move the same distance and direction. It is this feature that gives the game its name.<br/>(2)    Where both pieces are on the board with either or both on Vantage Points, they can move as above but independently of one another.<br/>(3)    One piece of a unit on the board, not a Vantage Point, moves one space in any direction.<br/>(4)    One piece on a Vantage Point, one or two squares in any direction.<br/><br/>Pieces may only capture certain other pieces as follows:<br/><br/>Lumps (1 and 2) capture Blobs (3 and 4).<br/>Blobs (3 and 4) capture Things (5 and 6).<br/>Things (5 and 6) capture Lumps (1 and 2).<br/><br/>When captured, a piece is removed from the board and may only return under one circumstance; if it is the last piece of any one type, a player may exchange one of his pieces in play for the captured piece, which is immediately swapped with it and placed on the board. The object of the game is to move a piece onto one's opponent's castle, or to capture all of his pieces. At first, this may seem very similar to a hundred other games, however, the synchronised movement adds a new dimension.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THROWDOWN! is a turn based card game that uses the Draw-Attack-Discard system or D.A.D.s. During the game you will have a character, a deck, and a discard pile. First you need at least 2 or more people to play and each person will need to have their own character card (a Robot, a Cowboy, or a Samurai), and deck, (the deck contains only 50 cards and is full of attacks, equipment, and modifiers). The objective of the game is to attack your opponents deck. You do this with your character card and cards you draw from your deck. You win when their deck is completely depleted. No matter how many people play you will always attack the person to your left, so until you get down to two players you cannot attack the person that attacked you.<br/><br/>Setting up to play is easy just place your character card next to your deck and your discard pile will go on the other side of your character. Flip a coin to see who goes first, then follow 3 easy steps. STEP 1 DRAW - On your turn DRAW a card from your deck and place it in front of your character card. STEP 2 ATTACK - Your character must ATTACK on your turn and will automatically defend your deck on your opponents turn. Total and resolve conflict damage. Follow any additional rules on the card. STEP 3 DISCARD - Now discard the card in play and put it into your discard pile, it is now your opponents turn and they follow the 3 easy steps.<br/><br/>",

The player with card number 1, lays it on the table, and then reads out the text (or Mum or Dad does). After that, the player with card number 2 places it next to card 1 and reads out the text. This is repeated with card no. 3, then 4. etc., and the first player to use all their cards, wins.<br/><br/>I must say this is a game in the poorest taste. It is a young children's game because there is no skill whatsoever. When all 22 cards have been read out, that would be the same as telling a short story. But, for a children's game, why pick on the subject of animal killing? Look at the card examples. They are virtually all as bizarre as you could imagine. My children would not be able to touch it with a barge-pole.<br/><br/>",

Naurally we want to wish them the best and bring lots of presents.  The first packet is on the truck, and another ... and it's going!  Now we have to run after the truck and load more packages on it; the more, the better! Can we get them all on the truck?<br/><br/>Hallo Paket! is a cooperation game.  The goal is to load 12 gift packages on a truck, before it arrives at the birthday party. All children win if they can do it, otherwise all lose.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Wieviele Geschenke bekommen Steffi und Max? Die Zwillinge Steffi und Max haben Geburtstag. Und wir sind alle eingeladen! Nat&uuml;rlich wollen wir den beiden eine gro&szlig;e Freude machen und so viele Pakete mitbringen, wie wir nur k&ouml;nnen. Geschafft! Das erste Paket liegt auf dem Lastwagen und noch eines und ... Da f&auml;hrt er auch schon weiter. Jetzt aber schnell hinterher und weitere Pakete aufladen; je mehr, desto besser! Ob es gelingt, alle Pakete aufzuladen?<br/><br/>Aufmachung: Der Kurs besteht aus 20 Feldern und f&uuml;hrt zu einem Haus. Der Lastwagen ist recht gut gelungen und wurde aus Holz gefertigt. Auf seiner Ladefl&auml;che k&ouml;nnen die Pakete gut untergebracht werden. Die Pakete sind kleine Holzquader in verschiedenen Farben, die auf einer Seite mit einer Schleife bedruckt sind. Sie werden im mitgelieferten Stoffsack aufbewahrt. Der Spezialw&uuml;rfel hat Werte zwischen 1 und 5, sowie ein LKW-Symbol. Das gesamte Spiel ist in einer ittelgro&szlig;en Verpackung produziert worden.<br/>Ziel: Bei diesem Kooperationsspiel m&uuml;ssen alle Pakete auf den Wagen aufgeladen werden, bevor dieser schlie&szlig;lich das Haus erreicht.<br/>Am Anfang werden die Pakete auf das Startfeld gestellt. Der Lastwagen startet von einem etwas entfernten Stra&szlig;enfeld. Jeder Spieler hat eine oder zwei eigene Paketfarben (je nach Anzahl der Spieler).<br/>Der Startspieler beginnt und w&uuml;rfelt. Entsprechend der Augenzahl darf er ein Paket voranbewegen. Auf einem Feld d&uuml;rfen beliebig viele Pakete stehen, man darf jedoch nicht &uuml;ber den Lastwagen hinaus ziehen. Kann man kein eigenes Paket bewegen, mu&szlig; man das eines Mitspielers nehmen.<br/>Landet das Paket genau auf dem Feld des Lastwagens, wird es aufgeladen.<br/>W&uuml;rfelt man ein Lastwagen-Symbol, wird das Fahrzeug um ein Feld in Richtung Haus bewegt.<br/>Wenn bereits zwei eigene Pakete auf dem LKW sind, darf man in seinem Zug auch Mitspielern helfen und deren Pakete ziehen, wenn dies vorteilhafter ist. Auch wenn der Spieler alle eigenen Pakete im LKW hat, spielt er weiterhin mit und hilft den Mitspielern.<br/>Spielende: Die Partie ist vorbei, wenn der LKW das Zielfeld erreicht. Hat er nun mindestens acht Pakete geladen, gewinnen die Spieler gemeinsam.<br/><br/>",

At the front of the stable there is a circuit around which the players race their horses. <br/>There are two versions, one for older and one for younger children. In the former, players have to answer questions to get food for the horses or move obstacles. Movement is determined by a die roll; obstacles within the range of the roll can be overcome by answering another question. <br/>In the latter, only number cards are used. Every player secretly chooses a number card. The active player moves the number of fields shown on the number card; the other players can move one field if they chose the same card as the active player.<br/>The first player to cross the finish line is the winner.<br/><br/>",

This game actually simulates is a war using projectiles between two fictional factions. The two factions hurl projectiles at each other, like in the game battleships. This game is different from battleships in two aspects - the players can see each others' boards and it is a dice roll which determines where the projectile hits. <br/> Each player has a board of 25 squares (5 rows x 5 columns) where he deploys his nine soldiers in any fashion. Players take turns rolling the two dice. First die is used to select a row and second one to select a column. Each dice roll is a hurl of the projectile at the opponent field. The outcome of the 'hurl' is determined as below.<br/><br/>If the outcome on both dice are less than or equal to 5, then soldier at the square determined by the row and column found from the dice roll (if not empty) is removed. If only row dice is equal to six, then the player can choose a row. If only column dice is equal to six, then the player can choose a column. If both dice give six, then the player cannot move this turn.<br/><br/>Play continues till one of the players run out of all his soldiers. Then the other player is the winner. A variant can be played on a single board with all the soldiers of both players in it. Rules can be modified to accommodate 'friendly fire' (player hitting his own soldiers) or 'field battle'(if player hit his own soldier, he can move the soldier one square to capture an opponent soldier)<br/><br/>",

Each crab holds a number between its claws, which must be matched to the equation of another crab. Each crab has a single equation on one of its three hind edges, in which one of the factors is replaced with an empty box, that must be filled with an answer number from another crab. For example, a crab holding the number, 4, could be attached to a crab with the equation, 8x[]=32, on its back.<br/><br/>Once the players have placed their six starting dominoes face up in front of them, the top domino of the draw pile is then placed in the center of the play area, and play begins.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they first draw a new domino, placing it with the others face up in front of them, and then try to add as many of their dominoes as they can to the line of crabs. Players may also move crabs from the front of the line to the back of the line, and vice-versa, but only if they can immediately add a domino from their hand, to one of the two new positions. If a player can no longer add more dominoes to the line, their turn is over. If a player plays their last domino, they win the game.<br/><br/>Players may use the answer wheel to check their math at any time.<br/><br/>The game also comes with two solitaire variants.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Professional is a dice rolling game where players go around the board &quot;training&quot; themselves in any of the four sports in the game: golf, snooker, tennis and track. It has a board resembling a Monopoly board with spaces with sports competitions, training, and both specified and random events. The game features five decks of cards: One for each sport and one for random events, much like the Chance cards in Monopoly. Also included is a variety of paper currency.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to train oneself and compete in the various sports to gain a million dollars. The first player to obtain that amount wins. The tournaments are divided into minor and major competitions with varying prize amounts for the first two places, as well as a &quot;walkover&quot; prize which will be handed out if only one player were to enter the competition. Training cards can be obtained in the training spaces. These cards are not only necessary to gain access to competitions, but can also boost the &quot;skills&quot; of the player when dice are rolled. Throwing dice is done to move on the board as well as determine competition winners, with the highest rolls winning unless card modifiers are in play. Other spaces include sponsorship funding, income taxes, injuries, travel fees, sporting luck (chance cards) and the start square, which trains a player in all sports.<br/><br/>While the game cover says that it supports 2-6 players, the rules inside the box mention 3-6 players. While it can be player with only two players, the game works much better with more players. Even 3 is quite few and in order to really play well, at least 4 players should be present as the competition dynamics really require that many players.<br/><br/>It was made and printed in South Africa.<br/><br/>",

Now, the other players have to answer the question.

With the aid of a powerful Telepath (Psi-Guardian) she sought out others of various talents to swell their ranks. She organized them in preparation for a war she foresaw hundreds of years into the future. The Psight competed with each other to gain strength and to teach the future generations to use their abilities. This competition became known as Psight, after the order itself.<br/><br/>In Psight, each player takes on the role of a psychic within the order of Psight. The goal is to defeat your opponents using your various Powers, Memories, and Abilities. If you gain Dominance over a Domain, your road to victory may become easier, as your opponents will no longer be able to use any additional Powers, Memories, or Abilities from your Domain. However, plan your actions carefully, because one wrong move could easily spell defeat. With a well-planned strategy and a little luck, you can be the last psychic standing and claim victory!<br/><br/>Psight is a strategy card game designed for 2-4 players. The objective is to out think your opponent and be the last player with cards in your hand. It plays similar to many CCG's without the expense of constantly buying booster packs or individual cards. We strongly disbelieve in the pay-to-win gaming model so everything you need to play with up to 3 other friends or family members is included in the game!<br/><br/>Psight is also a color-blind gamer friendly game with the use of Domain names and symbols on every card in the game.<br/><br/>",

This means you will have to barricade yourself in whatever relatively safe place you can find, scavenge around for supplies, and of course, duct tape multiple weapons together to create one massive weapon of destruction that by all means should not work, but does.<br/><br/>How do you accomplish this goal is simple. Each turn a card is flipped over from the Situation Deck. These cards contain global effects that help/hinder your dice rolling, or supply locations for you to clear out and possibly barricade yourself in for added protection.<br/><br/>Once this is done, 3 dice are grabbed at random from a group of 12. The dice contain everything from weapons to barricades to scavenging abilities and killing sprees. The dice are rolled and placed aside for points, barricades, weapons, etc... But if you roll 3 &quot;Bite&quot; symbols before voluntarily ending your turn, you lose any points you might have gained. Play continues until somebody reaches the agreed upon victory points to win the game.<br/><br/>",

First you have to try to make your horse take the required strides to the fence, this might be 8 for example. Then you turn over cards three at a time, like in Patience, and you can add the third exposed card to the table. If you do, the second card will become exposed and that can be used. Once you have a total of eight (in our example) from 2 or more cards, you switch to the Jump cards which are dealt with in a similar way. Eventually you ride over the 10 Jumps required to finish the course.<br/><br/>When you are blocked in your attempts to jump (a combination of 1, 2 and 3 required in that order) then you can choose a card that is not required. This will result in four faults or worse.<br/><br/>Extra rules include racing against the clock and playing with more players who each take turns to get their horse around the course whilst the other riders watch.<br/><br/>",

Each set of 2 cards represents one &quot;It's a Knock Out&quot; game. It's a Knockout was a hugely successful TV show that featured people representing a  were invited to play very silly games. See the illustration where a man must ring a bell but he has to climb a greased slope to get to the bell. This would be a very typical It's a Knockout game.<br/><br/>The cards must be well shuffled and the complete pack dealt between the players. If some players get more than others, this does not matter in the normal course of the game. Every player looks at his cards and tries to find groups whose words and pictures fit together. Two fitting cards will be called a game, and the player who has one can lay it down when it is his turn to play. (If a player retains a 'game' in his hand he runs the risk of having the cards taken by his opponents.)<br/><br/>Each player holds his cards in his hand in such a way that the picture side cannot be seen by the other players. A nominated player starts and draws one card from his neighbour. If with this card he can form a game he can lay it down. Then his right neighbour draws one of his cards, and so on anti-clockwise. The first player to complete all his games shouts &rsquo;Knockout&rsquo; and places all his cards on the table.<br/><br/>The players then total up the number of points scored by each competitor on the basis of 5 points for each completed game, with the exception of the 'marathon' game (denoted by letter M) which qualifies for 10 points.<br/><br/>The Joker can be used at any stage of the game to complete the other half of a two card 'game', but this particular game only qualifies for standard points, i.e.5 If the Joker card is laid on top of a matching 2 card game this entitles the player to double points for the one 'game', i.e.10 points. The player with the highest number of points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A miniatures game, centered around the Roman Empire.  The rules cover the period between the time when Augustus seized power (25 BC), right through the period of the Empire&rsquo;s height, down through the crisis of the third century, and ending with the reign of Aurelian (275 AD).<br/><br/>Shooting and combat are determined using a number of ten-sided dice.  The number depending on the size of the units involved. The dice rolls are modified by a few factors, and the result looked up on a simple chart. Units which take more than a specific number of casualties become &quot;Shaken&quot;.  Commanders have a limited ability to rally Shaken troops, returning them, at least temporarily, to more or less full effectiveness.<br/><br/>Games are scenario based rather than the familiar points based systems.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is based on a unique card based system which emphasizes command control and battlefield friction.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Christian card game made by The Mothers' Union, an organisation started in mid-Victorian England and now a worldwide sisterhood.<br/><br/>The game is a set collecting game but unlike quartet games, the sets have different numbers of cards in them. For example, Fasts has three cards - Lent, Advent, Fridays; but Prayer has five cards - Adoration, Thanksgiving, Confession, Petition and Intercession. There are 10 sets in all and List cards are provided to help players know how many cards are needed.<br/><br/>The procedure for collecting the cards is traditional. In your turn, you may ask any player for any card from a set that you already have at least one card from that set. You go on until you are unsuccessful, then the turn passes to the left. There are minor extra rules relating to courtesy and mistakes. Full sets are laid out on the table and are now 'Safe'. It says that once all sets have been collected, each player scores for each set in front of them, 1 point for every card in your collection (which means the larger sets are more difficult to collect but will score more points.)<br/><br/>The presentation is very unusual. There is no doubt that this is a properly published game, not an amateur production. Yet the cards have very basic illustrations and all text is as if it had been handwritten. I suppose they wanted to give the impression that it was illustrated at Sunday School (which might actually be true).<br/><br/>THE CHURCH GAME<br/>RULES<br/>1. The cards are divided into sets numbered 1 to 10. Each set consists of a LIST card (no picture) and PICTURE cards, whose names appear all together on the LIST card.<br/>2. Different Sets contain different numbers of cards. The Winner of the game is the person who has collected the greatest number of cards (not sets) after an agreed number of hands.<br/>3. Players cut for deal, the person cutting a card bearing the highest number is the dealer but should two cut the same highest number they cut again until one is<br/>higher than the other. Thereafter the deal passes to the original dealers left.<br/>4. The cards are dealt out singly beginning at the dealer's left. This may result in one or more players having an extra card to begin with but this is immaterial.<br/>5. The game begins with the dealer asking any player for ANY card by name belonging to a set of which he already has one or more cards. E.g. having in his hand the List Card &quot;Greater Sacraments&rdquo; he might ask someone for &ldquo;Baptism&quot;; or having Maniple he might ask for Vestments (the List Card); or Alb (which belongs to the same set).<br/>6. Before every request the player making it must say &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and after a successful one he must say &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;. If he forgets to do either his turn is immediately forfeit; if the latter he must also return the last card so obtained.<br/>7. After a successful request a player may make a further one and continue until either he is unsuccessful or forgets to say &ldquo;Please&quot; or &ldquo;Thank You&quot;. In this case the turn passes to the player on his left and so on round the group.<br/>8. As soon as a player has a complete set he lays them on the table in front of him and they are thenceforth<br/>&quot;Safe&quot; (i.e. none can take them from him).<br/>9. A player must not (with the single exception of Rule 10 below) ask for a card belonging to a set of which he has not at least one card already. Should he accidentally do so (i.e. by imagining that an Amice is a Greater Sacrament and asking for the latter on the strength of possessing the former) he must return the card and forfeit his turn.<br/>10. If a player whose turn it is to ask finds himself without a single card in his hand he may ask for ANY card still in play (i.e. he is exempt from Rule 9). But as soon as he is successful and has a card in his hand Rule 9<br/>applies again.<br/>11. When every card is &quot;safe&quot; the hand ends and players count the cards to their credit and score appropriately. The deal then passes as explained in Rule 3.<br/>NOTE: When players are new to the game it is a help to familiarize them with the sets by giving them a list of the sets&rsquo; names and the numbers on them. These should be withdrawn as players&rsquo; become more familiar with them.<br/><br/>",

Aimed at all age levels from Preschool to Seniors.<br/><br/>Each Requester begins play by asking another player if he/she has a certain story and play continues around the table until all 4 cards in a particular story has been collected by a Requestor for 10 points. The person on the left of the Requestor must then try to tell the story or pass to the person on the left. If the story is told correctly, that person also collects 10 points. If not, the Requestor reads it aloud and play continues until until someone is out of cards. That person collects 10 points plus 1 point for each card remaining in opponent hands.<br/><br/>First person to reach 100 points after a few rounds wins.<br/> Comes in a deck of 62 cards including &quot;Directions for Play&quot; and a &quot;Publisher&quot; fact card.

This is a &quot;take that&quot; card game with silly cards.<br/><br/>There are two similar versions of the game in the box. <br/>Everyone starts with some ship cards randomly drawn from the ship deck.  Each ship gives you access to use particular kinds of weapon cards that you draw from a shared deck.  These cards like &quot;red laser&quot; and &quot;drones&quot; are used to wear down other ships.  Some cards destroy ships in ways outside of weaponry.<br/><br/>When you destroy another ship you get the printed Victory Points for it. If all your ships are destroyed you go to the deck to see if you are lucky enough to get a card that gives you another ship to stay in the game, otherwise you are eliminated from play, but victory (in one version of the game is based on points).<br/><br/>",

The cards, which show either one of several sea creatures or a smaller island, are used to create a path towards the target island tile. They are placed face down.<br/>Players take turns rolling the die. The die roll determines how far the player may move his/her turtle. The card it lands on is turned over and depending on the type of card, the turtle is moved several spaces forwards or backwards.<br/><br/>The player whose turtle is first to reach the main island wins the game.<br/><br/>",

An item has a trait - one of the above four or the detestable Mainstream. In turn order, each player selects a card from that hand to play. A player can play the card on himself, which will give him positive score if it matches one of his traits and negative score otherwise. If the player already has a negative scoring card, he can play a negative scoring card on another player. After each player has chosen played one card, everyone rotates hands to the next player.<br/><br/>Each trait has one card of each of ten point values. If a card is played on a player who already has a card of that value, the new one covers and replaces the old card. At the end of the game, each player totals their score and adds or subtracts points for a run of at least two cards of the same color - scoring or losing a point for every card in the run, depending on whether that color is positive or negative for the player.

Then she asks the players in turn to point to two cards that add up to 7. If the child is right, he or she gets a point. After the playxers have all had a turn, the parent can choose a different number like 5 for instance, and so on. First to get, say, three points, wins.

        "description": "The 'Wensput Spel' (Wishing Well Game) is a children's game loosely based on the 'Sprookjesboom' franchise from the Dutch theme park 'Efteling'.<br/><br/>In the game, players start as one of the many creatures of the enchanted forest (like a frog, a snail or a hedgehog). All other playing pieces are stored -together with the prince charming playing piece- in a mechanical and musical wishing well. The players then start their journey through the forest trying to reach Cinderella's castle before the other players do. In order to win the game, they must transform their playing piece into the prince charming piece before reaching the castle.<br/><br/>For that purpose, players roll-and-move through the forest and whenever they reach a transformation square they may (depending whether their playing piece is shown on the square or not) transform into another creature. To do so, they drop their playing piece in an empty slot of the wishing well, then spin the handle on the well until another creature 'magically' pops up out of the well. The player then continues the game with that playing piece.<br/><br/>",

Weapons inflict realistic effects, and proper naval tactics produce accurate and believable results.<br/>Game-play is with dice, and no game boards are used - a protractor and tape-measure are used to measure distances and angles. A calculator is useful for determining distances based on the scale used.<br/>Included are statistics for real-world surface, subsurface, and air units, allowing for any number of historical or what-if scenarios.<br/><br/>",

The highest number of identical colours is the number of spaces he/she may paint or cross out on the penguin's racing track on a sheet of the notepad. To make this easier, there is a drawing template that covers all five possible cases (1-5 spaces). The first player to have covered the complete track wins the game.<br/><br/>In the advanced variant, an ice pyramid has to be covered instead of a straight track. In addition, all players roll at least one die, even if it is not their turn: each player gets one die, the active player the remaining dice. The active player can try to win matching dice from other players by winning a rock-paper-scissors duel (which is re-themed as ice floe, water and rock). The first player to have covered his/her pyramid wins the game.<br/><br/>The drawing template also includes a penguin shape that the children can draw on their sheet and add further details, like hats or clothes as a drawing activity.<br/><br/>",

A number of games using the pack are described.<br/><br/>First game: Happy Families: Despite title this is a regular Quartet game. Collect sets and the one with the most when all the cards are collected, wins.<br/>Second game: Codebreaker. Problem setter chooses a code, consisting of a regularly recurring pattern of cards; Example: Red, Green, Green, Blue - Red, Green, Green, Blue, and so on. He takes cards that match this pattern and reveals the first card. If no-one guesses the code, he reveals a second one, and so on until someone guesses the code first and wins.<br/>Third game: Pairs. Traditional memory game but as there are no duplicate cards in the pack, a player must identify pairs of cards within the same set.<br/>Fourth game: Card Race. For two players. A frenetic game of matching cards. Three cards are dealt face up and one face down. The 44 other cards are shared ouzt between both players. At the word &quot;Go&quot;, both players start revealing cards with the objective of being able to lay a card on one of the revealed cards. A card that 'goes' must be the same colour or the same letter (A B C or D) or the same geographical name. First to use all their cards on to the three stacks, wins.<br/>Fifth game: Beggar-My-Neighbour. The traditional British game.<br/>Sixth game: Fortune-Telling. A game and not a Tarot-like prediction system. In their turn, a player turns over a card. The cards are ranked from red A to D, green A to D and blue A to D. The player must 'predict' the next card he turns over as being higher or lower ranked than the revealed card. If he is right, he can try again. If he is wrong, his turn ends and the next player tries. If the card revealed is identically ranked, that ends the player's turn but he does not have to miss a turn. First to turn over all his cards, wins.<br/>Seventh game: Tops. This is exactly the same mechanism as traditional Top Trumps.<br/>Eight game: Patience. A solo game. Cards are ranked as in the Fortune-Telling, described above. As in traditional Patience games you win if you can sort the cards in order.<br/><br/>",

The sequence of cards may be collected irrespective of suit, but the following particular cards carry forfeits or advantages:<br/>2 of clubs: Attacked by crocodiles: Miss 2 turns<br/>3 of spades: Boat upset by hippopotamus: Miss a turn<br/>4 of hearts: Calm water: Miss 4 turns<br/>5 of spades: Boat wrecked in waterfall: Miss 4 turns<br/>6 of diamonds: Guide shows short cut: Omit 7 and 8<br/>7 of clubs: Attacked by hostile tribes: Miss 2 turns<br/>8 of hearts: Favourable winds: Take an extra turn<br/>9 of spades: Follow false trail: Miss a turn<br/>10 of clubs: Catch malaria in jungle: Miss 3 turns<br/>Jack of diamonds: Rainstorm lowers temperature: Take an extra turn<br/>Queen of spades: Boat damaged in rapids: Miss 2 turns<br/><br/>You should cut out four small paper boats, differently coloured, as markers, and move them up the river as the cards fall.<br/><br/>",

You must not look at your own cards until all have been drawn from the pack. Each player then turns up his &ldquo;catch&rdquo; and adds up the total number of ounces.<br/>You will see the weight of each fish is given in the picture together with numbers which represent the numbers on an ordinary playing card. If you draw a 9 or Jack they are too small to count and you must return the 9 with one fish from your catch and return the Jack with two fish from your catch to the pool.<br/>If you draw a 2 you will find you have been &ldquo;caught in the weeds&rdquo; and you must return your heaviest fish to the pool. As there are four 2&rsquo;s in the pack you may have to return more than one fish.<br/>Divide the total number of ounces you have &ldquo;caught&rdquo; by 16 to turn the ounces into pounds, and the first to &ldquo;catch&rdquo; 100 pounds of fish will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

Spongebob likes yellow and Patrick likes pink, so those are the two colours used.<br/><br/>Five tiles are laid out in a neat row. In his turn, a player may rearrange the tiles as much as he likes, even turn them over (the tiles are double-sided but not identical. When the player is ready, the five tiles will feature Spongebob or Patrick in the centre. Remember which colour the character likes. Example. If the five tiles are Spongebob, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick and Spongebob. This would be a pattern of Yellow, Pink, Pink, Pink, Yellow. All the other players (not the player who arranged the tiles) now look for that pattern around one side of the five tiles. The first to spot it puts their finger on it and the other players check to see if he is correct. If he is, he gets a juicy hamburger tile. If not correct, the others continue to look.<br/><br/>The first player to get 4 Hamburger tiles, wins.<br/><br/>",

The idea is to pack a suitcase with 5 matching cards /same colour).<br/><br/>Every player gets 5 cards and 5 cards are dealt question side up in the middle of the table. In a turn, a player chooses one of the question cards and a question on it that he would like to try to answer. If he is right, he gets the card.

        "description": "Felli is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Morocco. It is related to Alquerque and draughts as pieces leap over one another to capture. Felli's closest relatives are actually several thousand miles away in the form of Lau kata kati from India and the game called Butterfly (game) from Mozambique. One main difference is that the Felli board has only one horizontal line across its breadth as oppose to two found in the other two games.<br/><br/>There is another version, and perhaps even the correction version, where the pieces are promoted to &quot;Mullahs&quot; upon reaching the other player's first rank. The &quot;Mullahs&quot; are like the &quot;Kings&quot; in International Draughts, and they can move any number of unoccupied spaces. They can also leap over an enemy piece from any distance, and land any distance behind it.<br/>The game is also called Fich.<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to capture all the other player's pieces, or stalemate the other player by immobilizing its pieces.<br/><br/>The board is two triangles joined together at a common vertex. Each triangle has one horizontal line that dissects it across its breadth. A line also dissects both triangles across their lengths through the common vertex. There are a total of 13 intersection points of which the pieces are played upon.<br/>There are a total of 12 pieces of which 6 pieces are black and 6 pieces are white.<br/><br/>Gameplay and rules:<br/><br/><br/>     Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In the beginning, each player's 6 pieces are set up on their respective triangle. The only vacant point is the common vertex which is also the middle point of the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A piece is moved one space (in any direction) per turn onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     A piece captures an enemy piece by the short leap as in draughts. The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, leap over it, and land onto a vacant point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. Captured pieces are removed from the board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Only one piece may be used to move or capture per turn. Players alternate their turns throughout the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Mullah Version: If playing the &quot;Mullah&quot; version, then pieces are promoted to Mullah upon reaching the other player's two corners on the first rank. The Mullahs may move any number of unoccupied spaces on the board, and capture an enemy piece from any distance and land any distance behind it provided no other pieces are in between. Multiple captures are allowed. If a non-Mullah piece captures enemy pieces in a sequence of multiple captures, and happens to land on the other player's first rank corners in the process, the player's piece does not become promoted to Mullah. Captures are compulsory.<br/><br/><br/>(Source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>",

One side shows one of five magic objects (elixir, charm, magic hat, spell book, owl) on a white background. The other side shows one of five hiding places (bed, grandfather clock, chest, tripod, fire place) on a coloured background. There is one card for each magic object/background combination.<br/><br/>The cards are laid out on the table, with the coloured hiding place side facing up. The start player rolls the two dice. One die shows what object the players are trying to find. The other specifies what hiding places they players may search to find that object (i.e. if one die shows the owl and the other the bed, the players are allowed to turn over the bed cards to find the owl). If the active player manages to turn over the correct card, he/she gets to take the card and rolls the dice again. His/her turn ends when he/she turns over a wrong card.<br/>The sixth side of the dice is a joker - the lucky player gets to choose the magic object, hiding place, or both (if he/she rolls the joker on both dice).<br/><br/>If a player rolls a combination that has already been found and he/she remembers, he/she gets to steal it from that player.<br/><br/>The game ends when all five cards of one type of hiding place have been claimed.

There are eight of each letter and, in the main, they have different coloured backgrounds.<br/><br/>Each player, in turn, may lay a card on the table, that can legally go next to another card. There are none at the start so a U must be placed. After that, you may lay an N next to the U. You can place the N alongside the U or beneath it. The next player may now play a legal letter next to any card on the table. Thus, the word UNESCO will be spelt many times perhaps, horizentally or vertically. Think of it as a UNESCO crossword. If you cannot play a card, you draw one from the stock.<br/><br/>The first player to use all their cards wins the round. The other players total the value of cards left in their hands and take a score for them. Colour matches can matter because this makes a more penal score.

If a player is the first to land on one of the numbered spaces, he draws the card from the deck of 30 cards and reads out the information on the blue side of the card. Then he turns the card over to see what instructions he has to follow. This are fairly predictable; Miss a turn perhaps, roll the die and move backwards, and so on. The player then takes the card and keeps it in front of him where all the players can see it. The card will have a value ranging from 5 to 30, with the value being commensurate with the penalty value of the instruction on it. If a subsequent player lands on a numbered field that has already been taken, then he treats the space as a normal space without number.<br/><br/>When the numbered space 30 has been reached, that player has finished. The others play on. When all the players have reached the 30 space, the 'won' cards are added up and the winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

So Musi-Matics will not be described here.<br/><br/>MUSI-WINKS<br/>A Round Game for Everyone<br/>In each packet are,<br/>TEN HAPPY SAM FACES, TEN MOURNFUL MICK FACES and THREE WINKER WILLY left and right EYES. They are perforated so as to be torn into a total of 86 small cards.<br/>As the name implies the game is best played to music and a piano, gramophone or other music should be available.<br/><br/>INSTRUCTIONS TO THE M.C.<br/>Shuffle the 86 small cards and put the pack into an elastic band. Ask the players to sit or stand in a circle and when the music starts the pack is passed round. At intervals the music is stopped and on each occasion 3 (more or less according to the time available) players commencing with the one holding the pack take the top card. When the music recommences the pack is passed on by the last player to draw a card and play continues until all the cards are used up. Twelve players would each have on the average about 7 cards.<br/>Each player then proceeds to make up complete faces, observing the following rules:<br/>1. A Winker Willy Eye (left or right, but only the appropriate one) can be used to make a complete face with Happy Sam and Mournful Mick Cards, mixed if necessary although it is advantageous not to do so.<br/>2. If a Winker Willy. Eye is not used then Happy Sam faces must be made up entirely of Happy Sam Cards; likewise for Mournful Mick faces.<br/>3. Any player holding a Winker Willy Eye may exchange it with any other player for three other cards.<br/>4. Only ONE Winker Willy Eye can be used in making up a face.<br/><br/>SCORING&mdash;<br/>Complete Faces&mdash;<br/>A face made up of 1 WINKER WILLY EYE and 3 HAPPY SAM CARDS or 3 MOURNFUL MICK CARDS ... 10 points<br/>A face made up of 1 WINKER WILLY EYE and mixed HAPPY SAM and MOURNFUL MICK CARDS ... ... 8 points<br/>A complete HAPPY SAM FACE ... . 5 points<br/>A complete MOURNFUL MICK FACE . 5 points<br/>Features&mdash;<br/>Odd cards are valued as follows&mdash;<br/>A complete MOUTH made up of HAPPY SAM OR MOURNFUL MICK CARDS or both .... 2 points<br/>AN EYE ... 1 point<br/><br/>The winner is the player scoring the highest number of points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game found in The New Book of Games, circa 1950. Two boards are provided, one for the batting side and one for the bowling side.<br/><br/>Opening batsmen, before beginning play, are allotted a colour, either red or white. When a batsman is out, the next batsman in takes the colour just vacated.<br/>One counter is used for batting and one for bowling. These are placed on the squares marked &ldquo;Start&rdquo;.<br/><br/>To start play, the bowler throws the dice and moves his counter forward the number of spaces indicated by the throw. Should he fall on a red square, the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; is considered to be playable and the batsman is enabled to make a scoring stroke. He does this by throwing the dice and moving forward the number of squares on the batting chart thus indicated. The number of runs shown on the square is credited to the batsman on whose colour the counter is lying after the move is completed.<br/><br/>If the bowling counter falls on a wicket-taking square, the batsman who is out is the one whose coloured square is occupied by the batting counter. After taking a wicket the bowler bowls again before the batsman can make a stroke. Should the bowling counter fall on a square marked &ldquo;extras&rdquo;, these runs are credited to the batting side, but the batsmen make no stroke, and therefore the bowler must play again.<br/><br/>Batsmen cannot be out when lying on the square marked &ldquo;Start&rdquo;. It is a simple matter to work out the averages of all the different batsmen, and if bowling averages are also wanted, six throws of the dice would constitute an &ldquo;over&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Each of the two players controls a team of 11 batsmen, two of whom must always be batting at the same time. When 10 wickets have fallen the innings is considered closed, so that one batsman is left &ldquo; not out.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Each player rolls the die (that has to be assembled) to see which Rugrat they are for that round. All the cards are laid out face-down. The seemingly same card backs actually hide an image of one of the Rugrats, and you have to use the special viewer to see it. So it is a race to find your Rugrat as each player searches at the same time. First to find their Rugrat claims the card and then the die is used again to determine which character you are for round 2, and so on. The player who wins the most cards, wins.<br/>Game 3 is Rugrats Hideout. Players draw one card each which they can look at but must keep secret. Players take turns to ask 3 questions to try to find clues as to which card your opponent holds. If you guess the most correct answers, you win.<br/>Game 4 is Rugrats Showdown. This is played like Slap Jack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card game published by a German private health care company.<br/><br/>Deal out all the cards. You must play a card to the middle of the table if you can. A legal card to play is any card to a sport if that sport has never been played before. Or a legal play is to play the next card to a card already on the table but the card played must be the number above the sport card you want to play or the one under:<br/>For example:<br/>Let us say that on the table is No. 4 Watersport. A legal play to this card would be the Watersport card numbered 5 or 3. If one of these is played, the next player could play a Watersport card if he chose, provided it was numbered one below or one up again. There is one Champion card which serves as a Joker.<br/><br/>When a card is played by any player, score the points for that player on the card (same as the number) and record this on a score-sheet. The cards rank from 1 to 6 and there are 5 different sports possible in play.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to use all their cards.<br/><br/>",

There are five versions of play which can be intended for different age groups. All the games though relate to collecting pieces and forming complete boards. The games range from very simple where the players do little more than to complete 5 mini-boards each. The gameplay is negligible, Mum just piles up the pieces and then the children look for the pieces they are interest in.<br/><br/>And so each game adds a little more gameplay, ending with a game for three players where the pieces are traded back and forth.

The rules:<br/><br/>Howdy, folks.<br/>It&rsquo;s the Cactusville Cattle Market and the local ranch owners are in town to buy up cattle. The biggest buy is a herd of buffalo which has been split amongst four neighbouring farmers. You have each been hired by one of the farmers, to get his share of the herd home first.<br/>So let&rsquo;s get them steers a&rsquo;rollin&rsquo;!<br/><br/>This is a game for two to four players.<br/>You will need a dice and coloured counters (coloured pieces of card will do just as well). Each player must start on their own coloured circle in the middle, the highest roll of the dice deciding who goes first. The players must follow their coloured arrow and go round the board in an anti-clockwise direction. If they land on a square with instructions on it they must follow these instructions. The winner is the first to get his or her coloured counter to the ranch of the same colour.<br/><br/>(A longer version of the game can be , played where each player has an equal amount of counters. When each throws, they can then decide which counter to move. The winner here shall be the one to get all their counters home!)<br/><br/>",

All players take two cards in hand, then everyone simultaneously tries to play onto the face-up cards by spotting the matching flag and giving its state's name when playing the card. With a region card, the player has to name a flag in the region being played.<br/><br/>After playing one or two cards, the player refills her hand. The first player to play all of the cards in her deck wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The successor of the Gundam War CCG. Although most mechanics are still similar, Gundam War Nex-A was designed as the next &quot;age&quot; of the CCG, featuring a different card backs and streamlined rules.<br/><br/>As the namesake implies, players take control of the various Mobile Suits and pilots of the different Gundam series. In addition to the previous shows, such as the ones set in the Universal Century like Zeta and Char's Counterattack, the game also features the alternate timeline series, such as Wing, 00, Turn-A and, the newest addition, Gundam Age.<br/><br/>Similar to Gundam War, combat in Gundam War Nex-A is still divided into two zones, Earth and Space, with the players able to designate different Units into squads. Players attack one another in turn, attempting to deplete each others' Nation Pile(Draw deck), in order to win. Character or Operation cards can be placed on existing Units, giving the assigned Mobile Suit or Armor a bonus in its stats or additional effects. Command cards also give one time effects which players may trigger during their appropriate phases. Ace cards, the rarest card type typically found in boosters, combine Units and Characters into one cost efficient card.<br/><br/>Unlike Gundam War however, Gundam War Nex-A no longer has Generation(Resource) cards. Instead, each card can be played as a resource. Further, Roll-ing(Tapping/activating) a card may now include a cost in resources. Alternatively, players have the option of using Graphic card, which combines resource generation, buffing and defense into one card.<br/><br/>Though the card backs of Gundam War Nex-A are different from Gundam War, Gundam War cards can still be converted for use in Gundam War Nex-A, though with a penalty or drawback of sorts.<br/><br/>Gundam War Nex-A is only available in Japanese.<br/><br/>",

The game comes with a wooden tree stand, leaf-base and 30 wooden leaves of three different shapes (fan-shaped, diamond-shaped and spade-shaped) and three colours (red, green and yellow).  Players take turns rolling a pair of special dice.  One die has the three colours on it and each color appears twice.  The other die has the following numbers on it: 1,1,1,2,2,3.  After rolling both of these dice the player must combine the number and colour.  The player must then place the total number of correspondingly coloured leaves on the leaf-base. The player can place the leaves in any fashion, so long as they do not fall from the tree-base. Once finished the player pass the dice to the next player (clock-wise order) and that person repeats the aforementioned steps.  If during the leaf placement stage any of the leaves fall off the tree the player doing the placing loses the game. All players managing to complete all leaf placement stages successfully win the game. Alternatively, if all other players fail during the leaf placement stage, the remaining player wins.<br/><br/>",

The grid spaces are purchased one at a time by players; on each turn the active player chooses an unowned space to be sold. If it is one of the spaces on the main diagonals, it has a printed price (from 1-7 units) and the player simply buys it. Otherwise an auction is conducted.<br/><br/>Each space on the board has an intrinsic value of 1, but a group of orthogonally-connected spaces is worth the square of its size.<br/><br/>If players need more money, they can take loans equal to half the value of their owned spaces. The rules for this are a bit unclear (no mention of repayment, for example). Players can also sell spaces back to the bank to acquire cash; such spaces are not resold  to players (a fifth color of marker is provided for them).<br/><br/>The game ends when all spaces have been sold. The player with the greatest net worth is the winner.<br/><br/>A few simple variants are provided (e.g., ignore the prices on the main diagonal spaces, don't allow loans, etc.).<br/><br/>",

The King wins over all cards except the fool (2), all other cards win over the fool. If a player has played a card higher than the number he rolled, he cannot turn the card, and it's a Pariah, which loses to all. Each win is awarded 1 point.<br/><br/>Every card has a special power, that usually affects his ability to play next turn. For example, the Pariah allows the player to not roll the die, but choose die result for the next turn.<br/><br/>This is repeated for 5 rounds, which counts as one hand.

        "description": "A cardgame based on an animated TV-series called &quot;Die Ketchup-Vampire&quot;. Game includes 56 playing Cards and is similiar to an old german traditional cardgame called Mau-Mau that is close to the wellknown UNO.<br/> Players will start with 6 cards each and play one card each turn following suit or color. About half of the cards have wellknown rules like &quot;draw 1 or 2 cards&quot;, &quot;lose turn&quot;, &quot;choose color&quot;, but also special rules like &quot;guess card under the magic book card played&quot;, or &quot;stop play and play card no matter whose turn it is&quot;.<br/><br/>Game ends when one player has played all his cards. Cards still in hand will score negative points.<br/><br/>",

The king, queen, rook, bishops, and pawns move and capture the same as they do in chess. Special pieces and changes to normal chess rules are as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    The wolf moves and captures as a chess rook or a chess knight.<br/>    The fox moves and captures as a chess bishop or a chess knight.<br/>    The nightrider moves and captures as a chess knight extended to make any number of steps in the same direction and in a straight line.<br/>    The sergeant moves and captures one step straight or diagonally forward. A sergeant can move, like a chess pawn, a double-step straight forward on its first move.<br/>    A pawn (but not a sergeant) may capture an enemy pawn or sergeant en passant.<br/>    Pawns and sergeants promote on the last rank to queen, wolf, fox, rook, bishop, nightrider, or knight. Pawns (but not sergeants) have an additional option of promoting to an elephant; the elephant piece, not present in the starting setup, moves and captures as a chess queen or a nightrider.<br/>    Wolf Chess has no castling.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Also includes the Game of Archery and Game of Morrice.<br/>Double Sided Game Board opens to full color Game of Quoits board on one side (11&rdquo; x 9&rdquo; x 3/4&rdquo;) and the 2 Games of Archery and Morrice on the other side.<br/><br/>Components: 26 Round Wooden Game Pieces (9 Blue, 9 Natural, 4 Green, 4 Purple).<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>GAME OF ARCH<br/><br/>Implements - Twelve men, a set of three for each player, and the Double Teetotum. The men represent and are called arrows, and are shot at the target by the proper moves. The object of the game is to see who will make the best shots with his three arrows. All moves are made by the spin of the Teetotum, using the mum of the numbers obtained by the spin, and moving an arrow aver a corresponding number of spaces. Spin for lead. The highest spin plays first. The arrows are first entered according to the spin, beginning st. and counting from the space at the flag-staff. After entering, each player, in turn, advances his arrows ac-cording to his spins, until they reach the target. Any arrow that is carried beyond the target by the spin is a miss, and counts nothing. An arrow is carried beyond the target when there are not enough spaces for it to be moved over, to use up the spin. Each ring of the target represents two spaces, one on each side sf the bull's-eye, as though the target were divided by a vertical (meat its center.<br/><br/>The arrows are moved from the flag-staff to the target as though the whole formed one continuous line of 23 spaces-7 in the target, and 16 outside. As soon as an arrow reaches the target its move is ended. Two or more arrows of the same, or of opponent players, may 'soupy the same space at the same time. The game is ended when all the arrows have reached or missed the target. Each arrow on the outer circle counts 1; on the next ' circle, 2; on the third circle, 3; and, on the bull's-eye, 6.<br/><br/>The player having the largest count wins the game.<br/><br/>GAME OF MORRICE (Nine Men's Morris)<br/><br/>Implements - Eighteen men in two colors; a set of nine for each player. The charming game of Morrice, which closely resembles, and is probably the source of &quot;Go-Bang,&quot; is the inside game, laid out in black lines, with circular spaces at the points where the lines cross or intersect each other. The object of each player is to get three of his men in a row, that is, upon the three spaces on any one of the straight black lines. All of the lines are used alike, no distinction being made between the long and the short ones. Play in turn throughout the game, and place or move but one man at a time. The players in turn, first place their men, one at a time, upon any vacant circular space, each trying to get three men in a row, and at the same time playing to prevent his opponent doing so. Thus, a player trying to form a row, will lay down two men upon the same ; but the opponent, if on the lookout, will lay down one of his men on the third space of the same line, and stop him. Sometimes players scatter their men in such a manner, that by laying down a single man, they have two ways by which they can form rows, upon their next turn, and as only one of these can be stopped by the opponent, they necessarily gain a point. Each time that a player, forms a row, he captures and removes One of his opponent's men front the board, but must, if possible, take one that will not break his rows. When all the men have been placed upon the board, one at a time, as above described, the players try to form rows by moving their men from space to space, in any direction. Sat all moves must be along the lines, always moving to the next space. As often as a player forms a row, whether in placing or moving his men, he captures one of his oppoaent's men. As soon as either player loses all but two of his men, he can form no more rows, and therefore loses the games<br/><br/>GAME OF QUOITS<br/><br/>Implements - Sixteen men in four colors&mdash;a set for each player, and the Double Teetotum. There are two sets of Quoit spaces, at each side of the board. The first and third players play for one set, and the second and fourth for the other.<br/><br/>Play and spin in turn. The highest spin leads. Use the sum of the numbers indicated by the Teetotum in making the moves, except in case of a doublet, which has its corresponding numbered Quoit space. The first player spins and places his man upon the Quoit space which corresponds to his throw. The others follow in turn playing in the same manner. Four rounds are played in this way, and the score is then made up. The count is as follows : Each man on the hub counts ten ; on a double number, three ; and on the other numbers two. In addition to the above, the man nearest to the hub counts five I the next nearest, three'; and the third, one. If two men hit the same space, the first corner is set back one space, if the rear space is vacant ; if occupied, the man goes for-ward on space, but should this space also be occupied it is removed from the board and does not count for its player. When four rounds have been played, the game is begun anew, and the play continues until some one of the players scores 60, which wins the game. The object of the game may also be to see which will make the highest score in four rounds.<br/><br/>",

Players gather items, find bunnies, and initiate actions using the cards they&rsquo;ve been dealt. There are 11 bunnies to find and collect and each has its own needs and difficulty level. The higher the point value of the bunny the more difficult it is to collect it! Players only need to collect three bunnies to finish the game and the player with the highest combined value of bunnies wins! Simply put, collect the bunnies&rsquo; needs, the first player to collect three bunnies ends the game, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Each player starts with 5 cards. On their turn they may either draw three cards from the deck or look at the top three cards of the discard pile and pick one card. They may play as many cards as the wish during their turn.

But beware of Kaos, if he shows up that will cost you. Collect the most cards and win!<br/><br/>Players each have a side of 5 Skylanders on their force and a die with the elemental symbol of each of their 5 Skylanders and a wild symbol.  The one battle at a time, the two Skylanders across from each other do battle.  Both players roll their dice simultaneously, if their Skylander's symbol comes up, they win and collect the two Skylander cards.  A wild is considered a symbol, and the Kaos symbol is considered a loss.  Ties are re-rolled.  This is done for each Skylander.  The only exception is the Kaos Skylander, in which case you lose points if you collect them, so you hope they are taken by the other person instead.<br/><br/>The player with the the most points (Skylander cards minus Kaos cards) wins.<br/><br/>",

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.<br/><br/>",

If the other player has the card, you get it and can ask for another card. If the other player doesn't have the requested card, you have to take a card from the draw pile and it's the next player's turn. When you have a complete subgroup, you put it on the table.

Each six-sided card has either two different sets of three identical icons (ie: 3 Fire icons and 3 Beaker icons), or has one set of identical icons (ie: 6 Beaker icons), known as a hextuple. (Hextuple? We made up this word. Think of a &quot;double&quot; in dominoes.) The value of each card is the sum of the values of each icon and is displayed in the center of each card.<br/><br/>Hextuples<br/><br/>A hextuple is a card where all the icons are the same. There is a hextuple for every icon. Every round of the game is started by placing a hextuple in the center of the playing surface. You can play just one round, or you can play multiple rounds, starting with a different hextuple each time. Choose it before distributing cards to the players.<br/><br/>If you play a hextuple during your turn, you can play another card during your turn to match it.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>During your turn, you play one card from your inventory by matching icons with one or more cards already played. Your score is the value of your card plus the value of the cards you matched.<br/><br/>Replenish<br/><br/>You must always have ten cards in your inventory. You can keep your inventory in your hand or just place them in front of you on the playing surface. After you play a card, you replenish your inventory by drawing a card from the pile. If you play a hextuple and are able to match it with another card from your inventory, you draw two cards.<br/><br/>Jokers<br/><br/>Jokers are wild. They can match any icon and each of the three Joker hextuples can be used to match six cards at once. They have no point value when played, but make sure you play them, because their value switches to 100 points and count against your score if left in your inventory.<br/><br/>Ending Rounds<br/><br/>Keep playing until all the cards in the pile are drawn. Then play until someone has played all their cards or until no other play can be made. Each player then adds up the card values left in their inventory and subtracts the sum from their score.<br/><br/>Ending Play<br/><br/>If you play multiple rounds, you can add the scores from each round to determine the winner. Or, you can treat each round separately and award a point to the player with the highest score for each round, and the winner is the player who won the most rounds.<br/><br/>",

Viva Niku is a card game with a theme of an eating race in a grilled-meat party.<br/><br/>In a grilled-meat party in Japan, they sometimes have a yakiniku bugyou (grilled-meat governor) who annoys everyone else by intervening in everything about grilling meat, such as when this meat should be turned over or lifted from the plate, who should eat that meat. Sometimes the Governor gets furious at you if you have slightly overgrilled meat.<br/><br/>To reflect the situation, this game favors the Governor.<br/><br/>Each card has a big effect and a small effect such as &quot;Gain 400 kcal/Gain 100 kcal&quot;. Each round, the opening player plays a card, saying &quot;big&quot; or &quot;small&quot;. Then in clockwise, the other players must play the same card and declare &quot;big&quot; or &quot;small&quot; if they have, or pass if they don't. Small effects are granted to all players who declared &quot;small&quot;, but the big effect only goes to one of the players who declared &quot;big&quot;, and if the Governor is involved, it's the Governor that grabs the big effect.<br/><br/>Everyone else tends to be worried about the Governor's hand. Be cautious until you manage to take over the Goverment's position.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player gains total of 2500 kcal, and the player with the most calories wins the game.<br/><br/>The first edition of Viva Niku is labeled for 3-5 players, while the second edition is for 4-7 players.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>Tonight, it's &quot;The Day of Meat&quot; for a family.

Not just lucky, the aim of the game is to win by psychological methods. It is more pleasant with more players in many cases. And ending within 30 minutes with many players, please enjoy the chance to play again.<br/><br/>The game is based on irregular trick-taking systems such as Witch's Brew. The designer added card-drafting and stronger elements of competition between players.

Meanwhile they have to try to maintain resources on the island to stay alive such as food, water and shelter.  Players battle it out till one person sails off or everyone else is dead.  Can you survive?<br/><br/>Island Survival pits you against your opponents.  As you find food, water and shelter you also collect items left from previous castaways that help you survive.  In your search for items to survive you will come across pieces of a raft.  There are eight pieces in all and as each piece is uncovered everyone must assess their health and pay the price for their missing essentials (food, water and shelter). Once all 8 raft pieces are found, the first person to take possession of both oars is able to sail off the island and win the game. Of course, you can always take your hand made weapons and hunt the other players. Last man standing always gets off the island.<br/><br/>This is a turn-based card game with combat decided by dice rolls and strategic card playing.  As you role play one of six unique characters, you will find new ways to survive the island.<br/><br/>",

When you arrive at the lantern with the ring, press on the lantern to see the result. An unlit ring means you have to go back on the track. A lit ring means... you've won! Light up the ring and recite the Green Lantern oath!<br/><br/>Players roll a pip die to move around a circular board. Only after collecting all four types of Green Lantern Constructs will a player leave the main board and have an opportunity to win the game. Varying spaces along the way distribute Constructs or force players to discard Constructs, while other spaces allow a player to send themselves or other players to a space of his or her choosing.<br/><br/>Two notable components also affect game play. By landing on a ring space, a player might take the Lantern's ring (an actual light up ring component), allowing him or her to roll the pip die twice and pick from the outcomes. Finally, even after collecting all four Constructs, a player must successfully charge their ring to win. A large Lantern battery piece gives a player a roughly 2/3 chance of victory by spinning a plastic piece, pressing a button, and awaiting the random response.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "True to Life Baseball is a dice/board game that accurately simulates all the drama of a real baseball game. In extensive testing the average team runs and hits were within 3% of actual game stats. TTL Baseball comes with 6 teams from the 2011 season. Each team has 23 players printed on 3 separate 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; card stock ivory paper. The player sheets come in 3 hole punched sheet protectors that make the game easily transportable in a standard binder. (binder is not included)<br/><br/>The game has 4 different player modes; intro, basic, advanced, and 'Ultra Simulation Mode' which consists of using the advanced version along with all optional rules. After familiarity with the rule set, average game times range from 20 minutes for intro games to 40 minutes for advanced games. USM games would take a bit longer.<br/><br/>The game is for 1 to 2 players and is highly suitable for solitaire play. TTL Baseball has over 1800 hours in development. The advanced game was designed first, then to shorten average game times a simpler pitching system was designed for the basic game. Finally, the intro game is a simplified version to allow players to start playing games without knowing all the advanced rules.<br/><br/>Think you could have managed a team to a better season record than the actual manager did? Now you have the opportunity. Play a single series or an entire season with season player stat sheets available separately. In addition, extra player sheets are available for most seasons that add an additional 4 players to every team. This would bring each teams roster to 27 players.<br/><br/>This game features base stealing, squeeze plays, maximum pitch counts, pitch guessing, defensive depth adjustments for infield and outfield. The advanced games pitching system is perhaps the most accurate available. Optional rules limit use on how often each pitcher may be used within any 5 game period. Bullpen managements are included to keep track of pitcher use. There are also ballpark ratings that make parks either allow more or less home runs just as in reality. A rare play table accounts for almost every possible play possible in baseball. ie. triple plays, double steals, power outages, rain delays leading to arm stiffness for starting pitchers, outfielders colliding....etc.<br/><br/>TTLB uses a unique pitching check mechanic that uses a separate roll on 50% of key batting outcomes. This 'Pitcher Check Roll' (PCR) ensures that both hitter and pitcher attributes are taken into account. This makes both pitchers ERA's and hitters BA's as accurate as possible.<br/><br/>",

Other cards allow you to manipulate the cards in front of you and others.<br/><br/>As soon as only one player is left or the stack runs out, the game ends.

To be sure, when the Whites seized the city from the weak 13th Army using aircraft and tanks, Lenin and Tolstoy were in panic mode. So much so, they began massive defensive work programs building barriers on Moscow approaches. The White Army seemed unstoppable with its elite, well trained and armed Volunteer Army. All resources were diverted and sent to the Orel area. First, the Reds had to halt the advance and then counterattack, otherwise, Moscow could be reached. The main forces of the Red Fourteenth and Thirteenth armies continued their retreat toward the north and northwest under attacks from the White forces. Kornilov&rsquo;s division defeated the right-flank units of the Thirteenth Army and captured Orel on October 13. The retreat of the Red 7th and 9th Rifle divisions exposed the flanks of the main attack force, and its communications with the Thirteenth Army were disrupted. From the 13th to 19th, The Whites held the city but their flanks were being broken. The Reds took it on the 20th.<br/><br/>",

Theme examples include, &quot;If this wine had a job, what would it be?&quot; or &quot;Use sexual innuendo to describe this wine.&quot; The wine waiter reads all submissions aloud and the object of the game is to earn &ldquo;Perfect Pairing&rdquo; points by correctly guessing WHO wrote WHAT. If you guess correctly, you earn 1 &ldquo;Perfect Pairing&rdquo; point and you get to guess again. If you are guessed correctly, you are eliminated from the round.<br/><br/>When there&rsquo;s just one wino left standing, that person becomes wine waiter of the next round. The wine waiter also  awards 1 point for the answer they like best, and 1 &ldquo;gratuity&rdquo; point to themselves. You play as many rounds as you have wines, and the player with the most points at the end of the game is deemed winner and MASTER CONNOISSEUR and will seal their victory with a grand toast!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungeon Talk (DT) has been described as a hilarious mix of Dixit, Apples to Apples, Munchkin, and with a sprinkle of story telling fantasy RPG. DT can be learned in 5 minutes and played in under 30 minutes with endless replayability.<br/><br/>Dungeon Talk is a 2-6 player fantasy party game for family, adults, and kids and comes with over 280 game cards with 12,000 variations for endless re-playability.<br/><br/>Basic Game Overview: In the basic game, a new fantasy picture is revealed (each picture is on a huge 6x4 card). Players choose a Talk Card from their hand which they feel best represents the picture, is the most silly, or drums up the most laughs. One player acts as the Adventure Master, which rotates every turn, reads each Talk Card aloud then chooses a Talk Card he/she likes most. This continues every turn until a player's Talk Card is chosen three times!<br/><br/>Advanced Game Overview:  After choosing your hero (each having a unique game power), you'll draw 5 Dungeon Talk cards (talk cards have funny sayings, quotes, etc on them).<br/><br/>Talk cards are used by you to describe an adventure card (a fantasy scene with some really cool art). Each turn a new adventure card is drawn from the current Act deck of your quest. The acts are The Fellowship, Journey, and Destination.<br/><br/>Each turn a new player acts as the Adventure Master (AM). Players, except the AM, chooses a talk card from their hand and plays it face down.<br/><br/>The AM then draws a random talk card from the talk card deck and shuffles it in with the players' chosen talk cards. He reads aloud each talk card and chooses one he/she feels best describes the picture, is the funniest, most outrageous, drums up the most laughs, and so on.<br/><br/>If a player's card is chosen he gains a level and loot (loot can be in the form of gold coins, equipment,potions, spells, or weapons which can be used to aid yourself or hinder others).<br/><br/>If the random card was chosen, one player is cursed (a random negative effect is played on him). Throughout the game, players can use their special hero power and unique items they've earned to help themselves or hinder other players getting too close to winning!<br/><br/>The game ends when a player reaches glorious level 5! Whomever has accumulated the most gold wins! There's a few more rules but that's the general gist of Dungeon Talk.<br/><br/>",

So get your golfers together and have fun.<br/><br/>User Description:<br/>Mulligan's Wild is a golf-themed roll-and-move game with a &quot;send your opponent back to the start&quot; mechanic similar to Backgammon or Sorry. Although this game claims to be &quot;Golf game of the year,&quot; the golf theme seems entirely pasted on. Players roll dice and try to move their pieces (or &quot;tees&quot;) out of their tee box, along the track, to their green and then into their hole.  There is a special &quot;Mulligan's Wild&quot; die included, which allows players to move a number of spaces of their choice. First player to move all tees onto the matching green and into the matching hole wins.<br/><br/>",

It's time to go Hardcore!<br/><br/>Hardcore Mode contains two brand new modules for Epic Death! which add all new game-play to the base game. If you're looking to bring in more strategy and depth to the game, this has been made with you in mind!<br/><br/>Hardcore Mode is broken down into two modules: A set of Epic Adventurers (comprising of 40 cards) and a bunch of new Epic Loot (made up of 52 Cards). If you like, they can be played with individually but for the full Hardcore experience it's very much recommended that you bring them together.<br/><br/>You'll also remember the incredible treasures found in the original game. Epic Loot adds an entirely new Loot deck full of Magical Loot which can affect gameplay in surprising and... 'interesting' ways when equipped on your Adventurers. You'll get 40 all new Loot Cards as well as 12 very special Heritage Powers.<br/><br/>There's a reason we're calling it Hardcore Mode...<br/><br/>",

Choose from one of the five double-sided category sheets and install it in the spinner. Throughout the game, players take turns being the quiz master. On your turn as the quiz master, push down on the lever to get the letter and category dials spinning simultaneously.<br/><br/>Once the spinning stops, the quiz master reads the category and letter aloud - &quot;Countries! L!&quot; All players think fast to come up with a word that fits the category and begins with the letter shown. If you think you've got it, throw one of your marbles into the bowl. Don&rsquo;t tell out the answer yet because many marbles might go in, but only one will make it to the bottom first. All others will be sent to the tray to be used again later.<br/><br/>The player whose marble made it to the bottom first has five seconds to call out their answer. If they're correct, the quiz master turns the dial counter-clockwise and the marble falls into the quiz tube. But, if they're wrong, the dial gets turned clockwise and the marble can't be used again for the rest of the game!<br/><br/>Keep up the spinning, marble-tossing, and answer-yelling fun for as long as it takes. The first player to get all six of their marbles into the tube wins the game. But if that doesn't happen and the tube gets filled up to the line, the player with the most marbles in the tube wins!<br/><br/>Think fast, pay attention, and try not to lose your marbles as you play the fast-paced game of Quiz-A-Majig.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A humorous party game for 3-8 players. Players take on the role of a Psycho!Therapist and attempt to treat people with problems ranging from weird to WTF?!<br/><br/>This game is like something out of Whose Line Is It Anyway, and Machine of Death.<br/><br/>Components<br/>Cards: There are a variety of cards in Psycho!Therapist. Each is described below:<br/>TYPE Cards: These cards have adjectives that describe the way the client presents themselves, such as Angry, Friendly, Groggy, etc. <br/>CLIENT Cards: These cards typically identify your client&rsquo;s occupation, such as Doctor, Lawyer, Ice Cream Truck Driver, etc.  <br/>PROBLEM Cards: These cards provide a description of the kind of problem the client has, such as a phobia, being on probation, or medical illness that is related to the behavior. <br/>BEHAVIOR Cards: These cards describe the specific action the person is taking that is deviant, dangerous, dysfunctional, or causes distress such as: Giving play by play commentary on other people&rsquo;s behavior, doing inappropriate things on the copy machine, or poking an eye out (Mama told you it would happen!)<br/>TOOL Cards: These cards list objects, some very specific (a 10 foot pole) and others up the players imagination (something that begins with the letter B) that the player uses to enhance their chances of a successful treatment. These also contain a modifier (+5, +10+) which is added to their dice roll to determine success or failure. <br/>DICE: The dice included in the set are called Percentile Dice. There is a tens dice and a ones dice. The scores range from 01 to 100 (a roll of 00,0). Thus a roll of 40 on the tens dice and 7 on the ones dice equals a result of 47%. <br/>MODIFIER Cards: these are double sided, with +10 (in green) on one side and -10 (in red) on the other. These are used when players either make exceptionally good rolls (critical success) or exceptionally bad rolls (critical failures).They only last until they are played on their next turn.  <br/>GAMEBOARD and PLAY MATS<br/>The Mats are included to help you keep score in terms of Therapeutic Successes, Therapeutic Failures, and to keep track of the Tools you use.<br/><br/>The Base Mechanic: Players will come up with imaginative treatments for the clients described in the game. Patients are made up of a Type, Client, Problem, and Behavior. So when creating a random patient for the game, you draw one of each card and place them together (Game mode determines if they are laid out in the center of the board, or stacked with only the TYPE card on top face up). <br/>All patients have a Base Chance of Success of 50% to start (though this can decrease if a Player fails in their attempt at Psycho!Therapy). Players then describe their treatment plan with the patient in an attempt to cure them. Using the Tools adds to the chance of the Players success. Players will rarely have more than 3 Tools, but the bonuses are cumulative. Whenever Tools are used, they modify the Base Chance of Success (hence, a player using all three tools that have +5 modifiers now has a 65% chance of success). <br/>Once the treatment plans have been described (and in some modes the Clinical decides which player&rsquo;s treatment plan sounds best), the modifiers from the Tools are added together, the player rolls the dice and tries to get the target number or below in order to have a therapeutic success. <br/>So if Player 1 had used all three tools and gained a +15, they would need to roll 65 or less on the percentile dice (50% Base Chance + 15 from the Tools = 65% chance of success).<br/><br/>A Role-playing Suggestion:<br/><br/>    Completely Optional but very fun: Instead of just drawing the cards and focusing on the solution, the game can be a lot more fun when other players decide to improvise things the client might say or do. Remember that they will generally be compliant with the therapist and the use of tools (refer to the Type cards &ndash; hence, in the case of a Belligerent Client, the therapist might just have to make them use the tools despite their stubbornness, a Shy client might have to be coaxed or encouraged to use them). This opens the window to some really funny one-liners and statements!<br/><br/><br/>  Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to invent other objects that help place the Tools in context. You can certainly use other things besides your tools, they just don&rsquo;t add to your chances of Therapeutic Success (see the example in the next column where Mark used an emergency air mask). <br/>When Tools are generic, such as &ldquo;a flask containing a liquid&rdquo;, you get to choose all the details!.<br/> To help with the characterization of the patient, think of any stereotypes about the Client first. Then, think of what would be frustrating to them about their job. What would they complain about? This is a good way to get a funny initial feel for the Client. You can even name them if you want!<br/><br/>Winning And Losing The Game<br/>See the different modes for specific win/lose conditions. In general, the game continues until a Psycho!Therapist reaches 4 Therapeutic Successes, or there are no more clients to treat (either all in jail or have become Serial Killers). <br/>Alternate Rule #2 (for Court Ordered or Dark Mode): If having no winner bothers you, the person with the most Therapeutic Successes when the game stops is considered the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a two-player game about building a farming village in rural Vietnam. The board comes in two double-sided halves that can be fit together to form four different configurations. The assembled board displays a 6x6 grid, with each row and column marked by the face of a die. Six of the squares on the board (those with identical row and column numbers) are action spaces.<br/><br/>Players purchase tiles that represent resources, such as food or animals, or buildings. These tiles are then placed on the game grid. On each turn, the active player takes one die chosen from among the dice rolled by the opponent, then rolls three remaining dice and may select one of those three. The player then resolves any actions or income produced from tiles on the board where the rows and columns corresponding to the two dice intersect. Any income may be used to purchase more tiles to be placed on the board.<br/><br/>The players are striving to reach five specific goals. The first person to reach three more goals than the opponent (3 vs. 0 or 4 vs. 1) is the winner. If no one leads by three, the game ends when all 30 non-action squares on the game grid are filled, and the player who has obtained the most goals at that point is the winner.<br/><br/>",

In your turn you can ask any player for a card. If he has it, he passes it to the question player who can then ask for another card from the same or different players. When someone is asked for a card that he doesn't hold, the questioner's turn ends. Once sets of at least three cards are collected, they are laid face-down in front of the player, who may add to them during the rest of the game. The game ends when the last card has been played.

Each piece in your arsenal has unique movement abilities, capture abilities, and other powers at their disposal, and you may only bring 5 out of 8 of them to every game, so each game will play out very differently.<br/><br/>With unique rules that keep the game balanced and fair from beginning to end, every game is intense, and even if you're winning in one moment, the tide can quickly turn. Compete with your opponent for supremacy on the battlefield in a mental tug of war. You take one piece from him, he places another. He takes one from you, you place another. Eventually something has to give, and it shall. This is a game of strategy and skill and only the strong shall prevail.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Letter Chess is a solitaire word game that combines Word Search and Chess. Players move letters like Chess pieces to string together words that connect horizontally, vertically and diagonally on a 7-by-9 grid. To score big assemble long words and make sure you have a end of game strategy to clear the board.<br/><br/>Setup: 48 Letter tiles are randomized on a 7-by-9 grid. At the start of the game there are 15 empty squares near the center of the board. The center horizontal row is always empty. Bordering the center row, two rows are made up of four empty squares and three letter squares (like a parapet which is the alternate name). Use any word game you may own to play the game.<br/><br/>Game Mechanics: The main object of the game is to assemble words on the grid. Eligible words must have letters connected on the board horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Acceptable words must be at least three letters long. Words cannot be played more than once per game and proper nouns are not allowed. Individual letter tiles cannot be used twice in the same word (such as &ldquo;o&rdquo; twice to spell book or &ldquo;d&rdquo; to spell dad).<br/><br/>During a single turn, a player can move multiple letters together to construct words. All letters moved during a turn must be used to construct a word that round. Consonants can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally (like a Queen in Chess) to an empty square. When moved, however, consonants cannot jump over other letters. Vowels can move two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally (like a Knight in Chess) to an empty square. Unlike consonants, vowels can jump over other letters. After a word is constructed those letter tiles are removed from the board and play continues. The game ends when all letters have been used or no more plays are left. Lastly, the letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; moves as a consonant even if used as a vowel.<br/><br/>Scoring: Letter Chess uses simple formulas to tally a score at the end of the game. So when playing keep a pencil and paper nearby. Vowels count as 2 points and Consonants count as 1 point. The letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; counts as one point even if used as a vowel. A word is tallied by multiplying the letter score by the letter count. For example, &ldquo;murals&rdquo; has a tally of forty because there is a letter score of eight (two vowels and four consonants) and a letter count of five (8x5=40). There is a bonus score when all the letters are cleared from the board. The bonus is calculated by multiplying the number of rounds by 10 and subtracting that amount from 200 (arbitrary number). For example, a whole board was cleared in twelve rounds then 200-(12X10)= 80 points. When letters remain on the board with no more moves left those letters are tallied as a word and subtracted from the score. For example if the letters &ldquo;I, X and O&rdquo; remain on the board. The letter score is 5 and letter count is 3 which equals 15 minus points.<br/><br/>At most there are 16 rounds per game assuming all words are 3-letters long. In Letter Chess, a high score is in the 400&rsquo;s and a low score is around 200.<br/><br/>",

Players spin the spinner (that shows colours now) to spin the required colours for their next step, in a race to the other side of the board, where te stars await.<br/><br/>The Nutty Forest Maze: players spin the spinner to race to Tico's treehouse. They have to choose the right way through the maxe, and can loose turns (when encountering Swiper the fox) or getting extra moves (when encountering stars).<br/><br/>Beach Day!: players spin the spinner and move to the first next square showing the same picture as the picture shown by the spinner to race to the beach (candy land variation).<br/><br/>",

Divide them into 4 teams of 3 players and seat them at tables or suitable furniture in groups of four so that at each fable there is a member of each team. A dice is allotted to each table.<br/>Put the vowels (well mixed) in one box and the consonants in another; then place the boxes in a convenient position.<br/>At a starting signal one player at each table throws the dice. If he throws a 6 he gets a vowel, 1 blind from the box as quickly as possible. If he throws 1 or 5 he collects a consonant. Figures 2, 3, 4 do not count. If he throws a useless figure he passes the shaker to the player on his left who shakes and plays accordingly, but if he has thrown a useful number then after collecting a letter he throws again until his is unsuccessful, when he passes the dice on. (This prevents crowding round the letter boxes).<br/><br/>When all the letters are used up, or at the end of an agreed time the 3 members of each team get together and make up as many words as possible (plural nouns not counting) from their letters, bearing in mind the following method of scoring.<br/>A word of 6 letters or more ...    Scores 20 points<br/>A word of 5 letters scores 15 points<br/>A word of 4 letters scores 10 points<br/>A word of 3 letters scores 5 points<br/><br/>A time limit of 5 minutes or so should be fixed for composing.

        "description": "The legend of the 8-bit battle goes as follows. In a distant kingdom lived a King who ruled over a mighty nation. But alas, the kingdom was torn in two as factions began to form against the King. Now the king must draw upon his closest allies else he will battle against them for the future of the kingdom. They are: The King, The Warrior, The Wizard, The Queen, The Goblin and The Villagers.<br/><br/>This game creates several unique strategies. Do you choose items or characters that you can stack up to ensure victory, but at the risk of letting your opponent have automatic victory points because you cannot engage in every battle? Or will you go with special characters like the wizard who have a high probability of victory on their own? Or will you use special items to gain the advantage by increasing your attributes or peeking at the other players cards before you have to make a decision. The choice is yours, but choose wisely, because every decision you make will lead to victory or your untimely demise.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>The 8 character cards are shuffled and placed between the two players, face down. Each player draws two cards, then decides which of the two to keep and which to put back. Shuffle and repeat until there are only two character cards left.  These two cards are randomly distributed.<br/><br/>Repeat these steps for the item cards except stop once each player has three item cards.  Place the remaining item cards to the side as they will no longer be needed this round.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>The player who went first is now the attacker. They select one character card and one item card and place them face down.<br/><br/>The second player is now the defender. That player selects a character card face up and an item card face up. If a card allows additional cards to be played, it is played now.<br/><br/>The attacker then reveals their cards. If a card allows additional cards to be played, it is played now.<br/><br/>The battle: If the attacker's Attack value is higher than the defender's Defense value, the attacker wins. Else the defender wins. In the event of a tie, the defender wins.<br/><br/>Winner takes all of the cards and puts them in their discard pile. Once a player is out of characters to play with, the other player places the rest of their cards into their discard pile.<br/><br/>Players go through their discard pile and count up the Health Points (which are victory points). Player with the most points that round wins the round. Winner decides who goes first for the next round. Best of 3 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Immediately after you've picked up the card the player to the left of you gets a chance to steal your new card by guessing which one of all Fred's (because this game is about Fred no matter what card you pick up) favorite hobbies is on the back. There are 5 different hobbies represented on each and one of all the character cards (fishing rod, grammophone, grilled meat, golf and TV). So the chance to immediately steal the card is 1 to 5. Once you've collected one of every character card you need to get back home as quickly as possible in order to win.<br/><br/>When you're picking up cards you might get a specialty card. If the back of the card has a picture of Wilma you must move your piece to the beginning.

If you can't use it, it is shown to the other players and returned face-down to the table.<br/><br/>If an Evil Digimon is revealed you must duel with another player. A duel is resolved by a die roll each, the highest thrower wins. If the challenger wins, the other player has to turn over one of his tiles. The Challenger gets the Evil Digimon as it is worth points at the end of the game. If the challenged player wins, he gets the Evil Digimon tile and the challenger turns over one of his tiles. A further advantage on winning a duel is that you can turn back a tile in front of you if it has previously been turned face down.<br/><br/>The game continues until there are no more tiles from the middle of the table to be revealed. Points are awarded for:<br/>A complete team (all face-up) scores 5 points.<br/>Any other turned up team members in uncompleted teams score 1 point each.<br/>An Evil Digimon in your possession scores 2 points.<br/>The player with the most points, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Les Petits Pirates is a mini game played on a single, small game board.  In Les Petits Pirates, players are pirates, working to gather resources and gold while trying to prevent their opponents from doing the same.  Through action selection and dice manipulation, players will plunder, attack, and sail the seas in their quest to bury enough treasure and enjoy a decadent pirate retirement!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tFeatures:Les Petits Pirates is an easy game to expand for more players or larger games.  A single 5.5&rdquo; x 8.5&rdquo; game board can support 2-4 players with 3 ships each.  Multiple game boards can be combined, or a larger board used to easily expand the game for 5-6 players.  Special rules and map also allow for solo play.  More variety can be easily introduced by simply printing new maps that can be used alone or combined with other maps.  The game can easily be re-themed for a variety of genres, like Vikings, Space, High Fantasy, etc.  Les Petits Pirates can easily be played with just the game board and typical household items, like dice and coins, but the game lends itself to having a &lsquo;deluxe&rsquo; edition that includes nicer components.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOverview:Les Petits Pirates is played in two phases per round.  In the first phase all players roll Action dice for their pirate ships and then place them in turn order.  In the second phase each Action die is resolved from the lowest to the highest.  This means that the player order for the second phase changes every round.  Each die provides a choice of Actions, from attacking other pirates to plundering ports to burying gold.  However, players are able to manipulate their dice by spending gold and resources to take their desired action.  The first player to successfully bury twenty gold coins is the winner.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAccolades:Les Petits Pirates has been tested at Protospiel and other game design meetups.  Les Petits Pirates won 2nd place in the 2015 MicroGame Print and Play Contest on Board Game Geek.  Les Petits Pirates was a finalist in the KBG Design Contest.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPrint &amp; Play:Print &amp; Play files are available in the Web Links section at the official page (at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://georgejaros.com/LPP\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://georgejaros.com/LPP</a> )<br/><br/>",

Collect tokens from each area and be the first one home, to win.&quot;<br/><br/>Bubble Guppies Fin-Tastic Field Trip Game is a spin-and-move game where players move their characters around the track, collecting tokens. The board is modular and may be reassembled in different configurations. Each section represents a particular location, such as a museum, farm or supermarket. The object of the game is to visit each location and collect a token from each before returning to the starting space. To make the game more challenging, tokens can be placed face-down to add a memory element.<br/><br/>There are also three other versions to play the game included. In Gil's Game, players must claim tokens held up by a game leader by matching them to pictures on their board. The first player to fill his or her board wins. Molly's Memory Game is a re-theme of the classic matching game Memory. In Mr. Grouper's What's Missing? Game, players take turns playing the role of Mr. Grouper. Mr. Grouper lays out five tiles. After looking at them, other players close their eyes and Mr. Grouper removes one tile. Players in turn try to identify the missing tile. The first player to identify the tile wins it. The next player to the left then becomes Mr. Grouper. The player with the most tiles at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Rolling both dice and joints, players make their way around the board in a quest for the perfect buzz while completing hilarious challenges and satisfying their lust for &ldquo;munchies.&rdquo; Pass the Grass can be played with 2 or more players but they must be 21 or over. Clearly, this is a game for adults (cough).<br/><br/>Take turns drawing cards (and puffs) and complete challenges to win. Includes: 1 game board, 2 dice, 6 game &quot;tokens,&quot; 2 decks of cards, and a rule book.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY: Everybody puts $1 in the jackpot. There are two sets of cards, you roll dice and there are places on the board that tell you to do different things. You take a card, and each card will tell you to do something different. There are credit and pass cards. A credit card means you do what the card says, which could be anything from taking a hit off a joint, to eating some munchies, to telling an embarrassing story. If you take a pass card, you pass it to anybody and then they have to do it. If they choose not to, they&rsquo;re out. If you land on the jackpot, you get all the money and everyone replenishes it with $1 each, but it can be more if players want. Players who choose not to ante up are out. Last player still playing wins the pot. (Everyone else wins a nice buzz.) For a shorter game, play ends when someone lands on the jackpot.<br/><br/>Players may substitute a shot of booze for a puff of pot.<br/><br/>",

The Legendary Characters are Ophidian League Gladiators, they may be included in any Team, and they act like any regular Gladiator. When a Legendary Gladiator is destroyed he is placed in the Funeral Pyre, and your opponent&rsquo;s gains the double of the VP of the Legendary Gladiator. The Legendary cards are also unique cards, and even though they don&rsquo;t have the  keyword written on them, they automatically count as unique cards.<br/><br/>Minions that act like Gladiator Cards<br/><br/>This Set include Minions with the following text &ldquo;CARD NAME counts as a XVP {DISCIPLINE}{DISCIPLINE} Gladiator&rdquo;. Currently only one Minion cards has this Mechanism, Doombringer (from The OutWorlds Revelations set). The Minion can use Pumps that apply for the stated Disciplines and VP, but for all the purposes the card is still a Minion card. It also mean that when the Minion is destroyed he also is Placed in the Funeral Pyre alongside the Gladiators cards, and as that the<br/>opponent will gain the VP mentioned on the Minion card. If the Minion card has also the Legend  keyword, the VP that the opponent will gain when the minion is destroyed is determinate by the Legendary Cards Mechanism.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Somewhere outside your safe nest there is a tasty cheese. The catch is that the stupid humans have not only placed it in a maze but also that the maze keeps changing. Nevertheless, you want that cheese, even if it means that you have to face dangerous traps. Beware, there are other mice in the maze as well and they may trick you to leave the cheese in their nests instead.<br/><br/>For each cheese that you take to your private nest, you score 1 point. For each cheese that you take to a shared nest, the players of the adjacent private nests score 1 point each. The player with the most points when all cheeses have been taken or no more actions are possible wins.<br/><br/>The game starts with 7x7 maze tiles, of which only the central one (the Cheese Chamber) is turned face up. The players start with 1 maze tile each. Each turn, a player does the following:<br/><br/>1. Move your mouse as far as you can along the path. In a nest, you may choose not to move, and in the Cheese Chamber, you may choose through which exit you move.<br/>2. Move marbles as far as they can along the path. Marbles are traps that return mice to their nests and cause them to lose 1 turn.<br/>3. Replace a maze tile anywhere in the maze by placing the one on your hand face up. If the maze tile you replace is turned face up, the next maze tile you replace must be turned face down.<br/><br/>When you leave the Cheese Chamber, you take a cheese, and when you enter a nest, you leave the cheese there, even if it is not a nest of your own. If you are hit by a marble, the cheese is left in the maze, and if you pass another mouse, you exchange whatever you carry. If you move out of the maze, you return to your nest and loses one turn while the cheese is returned to the Cheese Chamber. If the path is a loop, neither mice or marbles move.<br/><br/>The combination of free placement of maze tiles and forced movement through the maze creates a strong take that mechanism. Not only can you prevent other mice from finding the cheese but you can even force them to take it to your own nest. When you place a maze tile, each other player gets to place a maze tile so you must be very careful when moving in the maze!<br/><br/>",

They are divided into 5 categories: Ceremony and ritual (blue), sports (yellow), Danes in the Olympics (red), athletics (green) and legends (orange).<br/><br/>It can be played by 2 to 5 players or teams.<br/><br/>Each player/team rolls a die by turn and then has to answer a question in the category rolled. If you answer correctly you will receive a marker in the same color. If your answer is wrong nothing happens and the next player gets his turn. The object of the game is to collect a marker of each color. If you roll a color that you already have you will loose your turn.<br/><br/>The sixst side of the die is blank. Whenever this is rolled a punishment will be dealt. Who will receive this punishment is decided by spinning an Olympic torch. What the punishment is can be decided from game to game. Usually it is to loose a marker or your turn but for party games it can be getting a round for the table or something similar.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to split it apart, divide the spoils, and form complete dinosaur skeletons. Large dinosaurs are much more lucrative, but incomplete skeletons do not score!<br/><br/>Using wooden sticks to divide the board, players collectively determine which tiles will be claimed and by whom. As the board splits and shrinks, players are pressured to finish what they've started before every fossil is claimed. Timing is everything, so sometimes it is best to take a partial turn and conserve resources for later. Each player also holds a unique single-use tool. This should be employed at the best moment for the greatest reward.<br/><br/>Fossil Hunters is a short small-box game, taking only 20 minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the box:<br/>&quot;The intoxicating game of skill and chance! Cheers! It's always happy hour when you play this outrageous party game! Take a chance and roll the dice--this may become your latest vice!&quot;<br/><br/>Shotzee is a Yahtzee-like game (hence the name) that incorporates drinking but can also be played without it. In the game, players roll dice to try to assemble either a full house, strait or a Shotzee (five of a kind). On his or her turn, a player rolls five dice. Each die will show one of six symbols, which may instruct the player or another player to drink, or may display a &quot;party foul&quot; for which no one drinks. The player will then look as his or her dice and decide which ones he or she wants to save (in order to try to get one of the winning combinations) and then marks those saved dice on a score card. Players then refill their glasses and play passes to the next player. When the original player plays again, he or she rolls however many dice were not &quot;saved&quot; on the first turn, trying to complete the chosen combination. Play continues until one player completes a winning combination of dice. The game comes with six tiny plastic shot glasses.<br/><br/>",

One player has 6 red counters, the other has 6 blue. <br/>Starting position: Red places 4 counters along the upper edge, and the remaining two counters on the two points on the sides that adjoin his two corners. Blue places his 6 counters on the remaining edge points.<br/>Players take turns to move one of their counters either vertically or horizontally. The rules do not state how far a counter may be moved.<br/>If, by moving a counter, a player creates a horizontal or vertical line of exactly 3 counters, consisting of two of one colour and one of the other, then the singleton is removed from the board. Rules suggest, but do not confirm, that the line of three must be unbroken. No capture is made if a line of four is created. Rules do not state what happens if horizontal and vertical unbroken lines of 3 are created simultaneously.<br/>When one player loses all his counters, the other is the winner.<br/><br/>This game was included in a Christmas cracker in England in about 1998.<br/><br/>The name given above is a place holder, as no name is given. It was chosen as the board is embellished with a picture of a person with a cannon!  The game is printed on a small piece of glossy paper, which also bear the rules. This is folded into quartets, and supplied in a small polythene bag, along with six red counters, and six of another colour (blue or yellow), weighing just 4 grammes.<br/><br/>",

To win a player must be the first to capture all of the opponent's pieces. Each player&rsquo;s ability to move or return a piece to the board is determined by rolling a die. This highly replayable game, which features a game board, die, twelve game pieces, and a rule sheet, incorporates a unique method of play that makes the game both easy to learn by the youngest players and a challenge for mature gamers. (Level: Beginner-Intermediate)<br/><br/>BATLHEX Commander is a variation of the basic game that removes the die and adds a Commander piece to both sides. The object is to capture the opponent's Commander first. All of the pieces (with the exception of the Commander) share the same unique movement capability, and both player's have a chance to bring a captured piece back during a turn if they occupy a certain hex. BATLHEX Commander allows both players to think several turns ahead and develop various long-term strategies. (Level: Intermediate-Advanced)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "See-Schlacht is a card game based on battleship. Each player receives a couple of empty sea cards, 3 single ships (red ship cards), 1 small fleet (2 brown ship cards) and 1 large fleet (3 yellow ship cards). First each player lays out his sea cards in a grid defined by the players (e.g. 4 x 5 cards). Then each player replaces secretly empty sea cards by his ship cards. Single ships are placed by its own, fleets need to be placed on adjacent spaces. In order to trick the oponents he can also replace empty sea cards with other empty sea cards. The game consits of players taking turns in naming a card in an apponents area (e.g. 3rd row, 4th card). The named card is flipped. As sea cards have identical sides players should try to remember which cards have been named. Each player whose ships are all turned face up are out of the game. The last player with hidden ships wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players roll a special die to move their team of animals along a path to complete a journey to the other end of the path.  However the mammals are travelling the opposite direction of the reptiles.

        "description": "The first in a series of four games by Green Games, Taking out the Trash focuses on the seemingly simple act of recycling. Packed full of information on each of the three trash types featured in the game (landfill, recycling and organics), it raises important questions about the materials we use and where they end up.<br/><br/>The game can accommodate between two and four players. It consists of 58 oversized cards, including 9 Action Cards which add an element of strategy. With hands of four concealed cards, players pick-up and discard one card per turn as they try to collect sets of four matching Trash Cards to &quot;fill&quot; each of their bins. The first player to &quot;fill&quot; each of his/her three bins wins.<br/><br/>This intentionally simple mechanic keeps play time short at around 10 minutes, making it ideal for classroom applications and as an icebreaker to the otherwise quite serious subject of sustainability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kingdom is a game where players battle against each other trying to be the first to match &ldquo;The Ideal Kingdom&rdquo; which needs to be made of the right collection of cards. However, the right cards needed in this game may not be the right cards in another game. True, you may pull the same set of cards, but it is highly unlikely there are 531,441 different combinations. You could push ahead getting the right cards in the positions you need them to be in, or do you work to thwart other players efforts. Adding the change a winning combination of the ideal kingdom allows for changes in strategy from one game to the next. Each player starts with three cards and needs to work to create the &ldquo;Ideal Kingdom&rdquo; which is a combination of six cards. Each color of card has specific attacks, defense, and special action. Certain colors cards can only sit next to other certain color cards, and coming in contact with opposing cards leads to inactivity or removal. That has something to do with court politics. Cards are drawn and played in turn order, with actions being directed by the cards you have laid out in front of you. Some of those actions allow you to draw extra cards, look at another player&rsquo;s cards, steal cards, or battle. But, your strategy has to be planned so you can create the ideal kingdom to win. There are 9 major game changer cards in the deck, like creating Immunity from the Black Plague, or Jesters that will play tricks and change the cards. This actually helps the player with the least amount of cards to actually come back and try to win.<br/><br/>",

It was created by Ray of Ash and is featured on the Pagat Invented Games list.<br/><br/>Gameplay begins by dividing the cards into a face up attack deck and a face down monster deck. A card is selected from among the royals to represent the player and strength and hit point stats are determined by rolling six sided dice. The player draws hand of attack cards for each point of strength.<br/><br/>The game progresses through a series of monster battles. Monsters stats are determined by dice rolls and an attack pile of four cards is set aside for it. The player and monster alternate playing attack cards from their respective piles, the player by choice and the monster randomly until one of them is defeated. The player may attack with pairs simultaneously for double attack points.<br/><br/>Hit points are reset following the conclusion of the battle and a new monster is created. Experience points are gained in the amount of the hit points of the defeated monster and gold is gained equal to half of that amount. Experience points contribute to the leveling up of character stats and gold may be used to purchase attack cards from the attack pile. A player who dies in battle may be resurrected by voiding gold and experience points. The game may be concluded or suspended at any time.<br/><br/>",

One person in a team looks at one card, and must get the other persons in the team to guess what was depicted on the card with gestures, to get one point for the team. To do sounds (not words) is ok. The charade must be done in a specific amount of time. Then it is the other teams turn. The team with most point in the end of the game, eg 10 rounds, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each round of the game is a 3 vs 3 infantry encounter.<br/><br/>Each player will have 6 soldiers - 1 on each side of the 3 cards. These soldiers are labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F for clarity. Each soldier (card face) is also named alphabetically to give it more of a human touch.<br/><br/>Each soldier card has 2 actions per side, for a total of 12 actions per player.<br/><br/>All battle resolutions are: <br/>1) Determine # of dice to roll: Attacker's dice +/- Defender's modifiers<br/>2)Roll the determined number of dice, 1 or more &quot;6&quot; = opponent card side (not the entire card) is defeated. So, in effect, the game will play as if each player has 6 1-sided soldier cards, but in reality, each will have 3 2-sided soldier cards. Hope that makes sense.<br/><br/>The game challenges each player to decide which soldier actions to play, where to play them, and when to attack.<br/><br/>",

Certainly it was published just pre-war or early war, since it's objective (other than fun) is clearly to familiarize players with all of the people and equipment needed to deal with the bombing of London.<br/><br/>The game features a striking black board with an outline of the west end of London and its major streets. The objective is to move one's car from one corner to the opposite corner, either between Marble Arch and Charing Cross or between Hyde Park Corner and Holborn. There are four cardboard cars with wooden stands enabling one player to start from each corner.<br/><br/>The game is played with a deck of 52 cards, four each of 13 different people, signs or pieces of equipment: Red, Amber and Green Crossings; Road Refuge; Fire Alarm; Auxiliary Fire Squad; Air Raid Warden; Policeman; War Auxiliary Policeman; Fire Fighting Equipment; Sandbags; Fireman; and Sand Buckets.<br/><br/>The streets are littered with barriers, each of which requires one of the 13 card symbols to get past. Plotting a winning course across blacked-out London therefore requires not simply finding the shortest route, but the best route available with the cards obtained.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Intrachange is a marriage of Chess and the I Ching inspired by The Glass Bead Game conceived by author Hermann Hesse. Gameplay proceeds as in normal Chess with the exclusion of the moves Castling, En passant, Promotion of the pawn, and Check/Mate. The gameboard consists of a standard chessboard superimposed with the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching with a different arrangement from the opposing black and white perspectives. Each chess piece is associated with one of the six line ranks of the Hexagrams based upon type and a yang or yin line based on color. Each player begins by making an exoteric move according the normal movements of Chess. If the piece lands in a square that doesn't match the line type in the associated rank of the I Ching Hexagram, then a second esoteric move is made to the appropriate correlative square. All pieces except the knight may pass through other pieces during an esoteric move. Pawns may only capture pieces esoterically after exoteric movement to squares of the seventh rank of the board. The game ends by moving a piece onto a square occupied by the opponents King.<br/><br/>",

Acquiring trade goods is very quick and simple. Players<br/>draft cards from a deck of goods and add them to their hands. The first player draws cards equal to twice the number of players (for example, 6 cards for a 3 player game) chooses one and passes the rest to the next player. The rest of the players do the same, except for the last. The last player, chooses 2 cards then passes the rest to the previous player. This happens until the first player takes the last remaining card. (example: Nick, John and Mary have 6 cards to draft. Nick goes first chooses 1, then passes 5 cards to John. John also chooses 1, then passes 4 cards to Mary. Mary chooses 2 then passes 2 cards to John. John chooses 1 then passes the last card to Nick.)<br/><br/>During the 2nd phase, players deploy their trade goods gathered from the 1st phase on planets of their choice. But the real reward is not money. The real reward is the trade agreement that may be established with a planet. If such a trade agreement is active, a player may benefit from it later on the game.<br/>Planets are divided in Age I and Age II. Age I planets provide trade agreements and just a few credits, while Age II planets provide lots of credits but no trade agreements.<br/><br/>",

West into the wilderness, where wretched Goblins roamed and the Warlock  held sway. West, into the blackness of Thil Asara. Their mission was clear. To set a beacon to quell the dark, a beacon that would grow in brightness and strength. A shining light to announce to all the world that they had returned. And that light came to be known as &ldquo;Anduine - First City in the West.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In Anduine - First City of the West, a cooperative fantasy board game for 1-5 players, each player will take a role as a member of the Elvish Elder council: Galadhon Master Builder, Nienna the Ranger, General Istaras, Mardiel the Sorceress and Mithrond, Lord of the Elves.<br/>Together they will build a new city, master challenging Events and defend their fledgling home from vicious Goblin Raids. <br/>All while the Warlock lies in wait, plotting to defeat the Elves and destroy the city of Anduine, once and for all.<br/><br/>Negotiation and strategy are paramount, as players will come together to decide how best to use the resources of the Elves to develop and defend their city. Players will research new magic, master new abilities and command the Elves of Anduine to construct a city worthy of legend. <br/>With teamwork, planning and a little luck, the Council of Elders and the Elves of Anduine, will successfully defeat the menacing Warlock and his hordes once and for all.<br/><br/>",

There are two Periods that Players can choose to Play. The first is the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) when there is a risk of Mongol Invasions. The second Period is the Sengoku Period or Age of Civil War (1467-1603) which is set during the time of the Wars of Unification. There are many rich rice paddies, thick forests with deer and boar and rolling hills, all ready for the taking as the riches of Medieval Japan can be yours. All you need is to demonstrate a firm hand and fruitful estates. A strong sword (or Katana) and loyal followers are also required to maintain your lands and ensure the villagers are providing the proper taxes. You must also be able to defend your territories from rival Lords and invading Mongols.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE<br/>Players assume the roles of Samurai Daimyos in Feudal Japan during either the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) or the Sengoku Period (1467-1603) with the goals of expanding and improving their territorial control. Daimyos do this by raising Retinues and conquering neighboring territories. Daimyos can, also, improve their holdings by building Hans (Hamlets), Manors and Castles. A Game consists of up to 10 Campaign Seasons. Players may agree to play fewer or more as desired. The Player, who at the end of any Campaign Season (Spring, Summer or Autumn) controls the greatest Settlement Value from their Hans, Manors and Castles, is the Victor.<br/><br/>",

Players are fighting a tug-of-war for points, similar to games like Twilight Struggle, and if a player gets to 3 points, she wins.<br/><br/>The game was designed to mimic the more meta-decisions involved in CCGs while being able to be played with just 18 cards.  Strategies like Aggro and Control are present in the game.  There are also options for pre-built decks and drafting.<br/><br/>While it does not have the depth of true CCGs, The Most Brilliant Mage is a brain-burner that can scratch that same itch.<br/><br/>",

Will you focus on Strength, Agility or Resistance ?<br/><br/>- Modular Board: Create your own path, each step into the unknown could be your last, but be aware of the empty hexagons you create while building the map. Cthulhu wants them, Cthulhu wants your defeat.<br/><br/>- Storytelling: Each new tile is supported by a new story, each story has two choices and each of them leads to one of 6 outcomes (3 good ones, 3 bad ones) resulting in 1080 astonishing possibilities. Each choice is based on your character's features and your luck.<br/><br/>- Uniquely designed miniature models for every monster in the game (Heir of Cthulhu, Shub-Niggurath, Azatoth and Yog-Sothoth) and for every character.<br/><br/>- Enemies among Friends: In each game you play, you'll never know if the player by your side is a friend or a foe. It starts  as a cooperative game, but one of your &quot;friends&quot; might be a cultist for one of the Ancients.<br/><br/>- Turn Based: You don't have much time, you need to find the site of the ritual trying to bring a Ancient Ones into our world through a portal. You only have a few turns to do it!<br/><br/>- Equip Yourself: As in any RPG game, your character can use weapons, like a Machinegun or an Axe, find marvellous objects, like powerful Talismans, or outlive danger through the use of protective gear.<br/><br/>- The Goal: If you're one of the investigators of the occult, your goal is to close all the Ancient portals, but if you're one of the cultists, your goal is to complete the ritual to bring your Ancient One on Earth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Woomal is an educational cooperative board game published internally by The Guides and Scouts of Finland as part of the 2009-2011 Finnish-Senegalese environmental project of the same name (the word means 'development' in the Wolof language of Western Africa). Although the game contains a lot of snippets of text describing basic environmental problems and solutions around Senegal, the actual game play is language independent producing simple, thematically imaginable situations which the players can use as a node of thought for discussions and learning.<br/><br/>During the game, players move their pawns around a highly abstracted map and use combinations of knowledge cards in three colours to remove corresponding combinations of problem markers from affected areas. Starting with just one card, players can acquire new ones by collecting enough markers from the map or by going to the education center. The three different colours represent three generic categories of issues: water, the natural environment and human activities.<br/><br/>Because the problems are often too complicated or become too large, players need to work together and plan their turns carefully so that their characters can work together in the game and share their knowledge and effort in the most effective way. Due to the randomly allocated problem markers giving players new objectives and blocking movement on the map, the game is constantly presenting small, changing spatial puzzles for players to solve. Separate game sessions can develop in very different ways and provide varied narratives to think about.<br/><br/>Players win the game by removing all the larger problems from the map or by each player collecting enough knowledge cards so that everyone is prepared for the future. The players lose if all the villages on the map are covered with problem markers or if too many larger problems accumulate anywhere on the map. Woomal could be described as a very simple version of Pandemic, played on a grid of hexagons.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Troll Bridge you play an intrepid messenger competing against other messengers to deliver their messages across a very unstable, Troll-infested bridge. But these aren't your normal Trolls, that would be boring.<br/><br/>There are two types of Trolls, Ug Trolls which aren't all that smart and would rather smash the bridge and create holes to avoid than get into any kind of friendly small talk. Then there are their smarter counterparts, the Tollosophers which want to chit chat and you have to answer their questions to pass.<br/><br/>Along the way you can collect Treasure that can help you fight Ug Trolls, hinder your opponents, patch the bridge, and even swap Ug Trolls for Trollosophers and many other interesting and sometimes useful things.<br/><br/>Just make sure not to die along the way.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their messengers along the bridge one space at a time. Each space reveals a tile that indicates if they fight an Ug Troll, a Trollosopher, or if they have found some treasure and possibly nothing, which grants an extra move.<br/><br/>Players must navigate around holes in the bridge created by Ug Trolls. They can risk death by jumping over a hole and hoping they don't fall through the rickety bridge on the other side. In some cases this may make sections unpassable and players will have to go around those sections.<br/><br/>Defeating the Ug Trolls is determined by dice roll to damage the Ug Trolls.  Each turn the Ug Troll remains, the player cannot advance and he knocks out sections of bridge. Defeating a Trollosopher is done by successfully answering their trivia questions. While they remain, they just keep a player from advancing.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player successfully reaches the end of the bridge. Once that happens, the game is over and the winner is determined by score. Players score points for finishing first, and for each Troll defeated as well as any treasure they have remaining.<br/><br/>",

You may come across animals 'endemic to' - found only in - that place as well as other wild animals found in that biosphere. The game covers vast biospheres that are spread across a few hundred square kilometres.<br/><br/>You score points from the animals you sight on the game cards. The rare or difficult-to-find animals get you higher points. The game ends when all cards are drawn. However, we have gamers who have developed their 'own' ways to end the game. You can do it too. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is almost entirely controlled by the dice. Ideal for children aged 6 years or more.<br/><br/>While safari-goers share their experiences eagerly with other fellow safari-goes in a 'real' one, players swap their hands in this game. Or you could be punished with a missed turn if you overspeed or make too much noise and disturb wildlife.<br/><br/>There are basic strategy bits too. For instance, how you would make use of the special cards: the Paapa card or the Kaadoo card. You can use these cards when you need them, you do not have to play these cards immediately. Or you have the 'turnaround' card that lets you make a complete u-turn and go in the reverse direction. You can play this card if you appear to be leaving the forest in the next few rounds.<br/><br/>The safari course is fixed and you cannot go off that. But, there are a good number of elements from the game that make it refreshing every time you play it. For example, on-board elements such as 'move to the nearest water body', bonus card pick  from an alarm call.<br/><br/>We have tried to recreate the experience for those who are completely new to safaris as well as seasoned safari-goers. The game board tries to capture the signature of the terrain - arid, dull or lush green as the case may be.<br/><br/>",

An Odd numbered rat or mice card is played to an Odd numbered Puss card.<br/><br/>If a player turns over a single Puss card, he can take the pile that states the either Odd or Even card.  A  Puss card depicting two cats can take any pile.  If there aren&rsquo;t any piles to take, then the player just plays the card to the matching Even or Odd pile.<br/><br/>When the players are out of cards, they take from the dealer&rsquo;s set aside pile.  Once these are all gone, then the winner is decided upon.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who captured the most mice and rats.<br/><br/>",

Your students will have a blast learning about New Zealand bird life through addictive gameplay and trading. This game is designed to be fun and engaging while teaching students about our many manu (birds) and how to identify them.<br/><br/>Each bird's card has three ability ratings that range from 0 to 9, 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest. The uppermost ability rating is flight (F) followed by camouflage (C) and special (S). The numbers reflect the bird&rsquo;s abilities for each category. &lsquo;Special&rsquo; indicates how unique or special that bird is to New Zealand.<br/><br/>1. Each player starts with an odd number of cards in their hand.<br/>2. Before the game starts each player may place down one environment card.<br/>3. The youngest player starts by calling flight (F) camouflage (C) special (S) or night time (which is all three numbers added together.)<br/>4. Each player places a card face down on the table.<br/>5. Name your card and flip it face up.<br/>6. The player with the highest rating for that ability wins and leaves their card face up on the table and the loser places theirs face down. If the rating is even, then the player who didn&rsquo;t call the round wins.<br/>7. It is now the other player&rsquo;s turn to call and start a new round.<br/>8. Once there are no more cards left, count the number of win cards you have in your pile.<br/><br/>If you want to play the advanced version, read the abilities on the cards and use them when you turn your card face up. If a card talks about the pile, these are the cards you have down on the table.<br/><br/>",

A game of social advancement in 17th century France in which players, by means of the purchase of ennobling offices, advance their bourgeoisie families into the aristocracy.<br/><br/>Each player builds up 1 family at a time.  Once a family has been ennobled and has an income of 30+ silver per turn from investments, it is retired and the player must start a new family.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck comprising card types:  Families, Trade, Bonds, Land, Offices, and Events. The Land, Bond, and Office types are collectively called Investments. Most cards have a value and may also have special characteristics.<br/><br/>The opportunity track has a place for the deck and 10 cards to be laid out: <br/>Discard | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | Deck<br/>A card&rsquo;s position on the track is the cost in opportunity tokens to take it.<br/><br/>There are 4 different types of Common Markers: silver coins, gold coins upgrade markers and opportunity tokens<br/><br/>Each player starts with 1 random family card in play and with 1D10 Silver. <br/>10 cards are laid randomly to each of the 10 spaces on the opportunity Track.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn divided into 9 phases: <br/>1.  Family Phase<br/>-   If you have no family card in play you may put one in play from your hand at no cost. You may have a max of 1 non-retired family card in play at a time.  Cards in play are placed face up in front of you. <br/>-   You may put a trade card in play for gold equal to its value. You may not put a trade card into play if you don&rsquo;t have a family card in play.<br/><br/>2.  Revenue Phase<br/>-   Gain Silver equal to the combined value of every card you have in play for your most current family.<br/><br/>3.  Fate Phase<br/>-   Gain 1D6 Opportunity Tokens (OT).  OT can be saved from turn to turn.<br/><br/>4.  Opportunity Phase<br/>-   You may buy cards on the Opportunity Track using your OT. Place these cards into your hand. A card&rsquo;s position on the track is the cost in OT to take it. Some Event cards are resolved as soon as you buy them.<br/><br/>5.  Capital Phase<br/>-   You may discard one or more cards from your hand. Gain silver equal to the value of the discarded cards.<br/><br/>6.  Conversion Phase<br/>-   Convert silver to gold. Every 10 silver converts into 1 gold. Keep the change.<br/><br/>7.  Investment Phase<br/>-   If you have a trade card in play with your current family, you may buy Land and/or Bond cards from your hand. These cost gold equal to their value. A family may have multiple Land and Bond cards in play. <br/>-   If your current family has at least one Land in play, you may buy an Office card for gold equal to its value. A family may not have more office cards in play than land cards.<br/><br/>8.  Noblement Phase<br/>-   If your current family has at least 1 office and is making 30+ Silver per turn, it may retire. <br/>-   If it is making 50+ Silver per turn, you must retire it, even if it has no office. <br/>-   Set the retired Family aside in its own stack.<br/>-   When retiring, you must discard all your gold.  <br/>-   Next turn you may start a new family.<br/><br/>9.  End Phase<br/>-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/>-   If there is a card in the 1 spot on the Opportunity track discard it. Then slide all the remaining cards down from 10 to 1 filling in all empty spaces on the Track.  Flip over cards from the deck to fill in empty spots (starting with the 10)<br/><br/>The game ends when a turn ends and there are no cards left in the deck.<br/><br/>Score Prestige Points (PP) for each of your families. A family gets PP equal to the value of its Lands and Offices. If a retired family has no Offices it gets -5 PP. Get an extra +5 PP for each retired family you have after the first.<br/><br/>The player with the most Prestige Points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A space colonisation game for 2-5 players in which players attempt to establish high scoring colonies before their opponents.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck formed of seven different cards types: Planets, Ships, Extractors, Protection, Distance, Events and Growth.  <br/><br/>       Planet cards have 2 attributes: hazards and resources.  There are 8 types of hazard and 8 types of resource.<br/>       There are 4 types of ship cards, representing 4 propulsion types and 4 corresponding levels of speed. Certain ships cannot be used with certain distance Cards. <br/>       There are 4 types of Extractor card. Each type of extractor can successfully extract 2 types of resource. Additionally, each Extractor card has a secondary trait of colonist. There are 6 types of colonists each worth a different amount of points in settlement scoring. <br/>       Each hazard has a specific type of protection card required to overcome it. Each protection card has a secondary trait of control. There are three types of control each worth a different number of points in settlement scoring. <br/>       Each distance card lists a distance value from 7 to 30. Each distance card also has an obstruction attribute. There are five types of obstruction.  Each obstruction type may prevent the use of one specific ship type. <br/>       Event cards have a wide range of game altering effects such as increasing or decreasing trip times; stealing or destroying colonies; stealing, gaining, or losing cards; stealing, gaining, or losing VP.<br/>       Growth cards are added to a player&rsquo;s existing colony. A single colony can have a maximum of one growth card attached. <br/><br/><br/>To start each player is dealt 5 cards.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising eight phases:<br/><br/>1.  Draw Phase<br/><br/>       Each player draws 1 card from the top of the deck and puts it in their hands. <br/><br/><br/>2.  Trade Phase<br/><br/>       Players may trade cards from their hands. They may also trade ownership of missions and colonies.  <br/><br/><br/>3.  Event Phase<br/><br/>       The current player may play 1 event card or 1 growth card from his hand. Discard event cards once they are played. <br/><br/><br/>4.  Travel Phase<br/><br/>       The current player places travel markers on his missions. <br/>         A mission with solar sails adds 1 travel marker.<br/>         A mission with gravity repulsors adds 2 travel markers. <br/>         A mission with a ram scoop adds 3 travel markers. <br/>         A mission with an antimatter drive adds 4 travel markers. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>5.  Launch Phase<br/><br/>     The current player may launch a mission. A mission consists of 5 cards: 1 planet card, 1 ship card, 1 extractor card, 1 protection card, 1 distance card. All cards in a Mission must be compatible with each other, for instance, the protection card must be specific to the hazard type of the planet card. The stack of mission cards are placed face-up and staggered so as to be visible to all players<br/><br/><br/>6.  Settlement Phase<br/><br/>     A Mission that has accumulated travel markers equal to or greater than the distance value listed on the mission&rsquo;s distance card has arrived at its destination planet and set up a functioning, established colony. <br/>     The player in control of the mission colony immediately scores a number of VP = the value of the resource type plus the value of the colonists type plus the value of the control type. <br/>     Represent the conversion of the mission into a colony by discarding the distance and ship cards and the travel markers. Keep the Planet, extractor, and protection cards stacked face up in front of you. <br/><br/><br/>7.  Scoring Phase<br/><br/>     The current Player gains 1 VP for each colony he has in play. <br/><br/><br/>8.  End Phase<br/><br/>     Current player max hand size = 8 cards.  Discard excess cards. <br/><br/><br/>The game ends as soon as ten colonies are in play.  Check for each of the 8 resource types.  The player with the most colonies of a type gains an extra 3 VP.  The player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game for 2-4+ players based on the Cow Click social network game.<br/><br/>Players share two common decks: The Basic Cow Deck and The Premium Cow Deck. Each cow is worth a certain amount of mooney as listed on its card. Mooney levels are low in the basic deck and higher in the premium deck. Optional event cards can be added to the basic deck which take effect as soon as they are revealed and then immediately discarded.<br/><br/>To set up, 7 starting cards are separated from the premium deck and laid out face-up in &ldquo;the stockyard&rdquo; - the middle of the playing area. <br/>The basic and premium cards are shuffled separately into two decks. <br/>When shuffling the premium deck, 10 cards including the Cowmageddon card are shuffled separately and set to one side. This is known as the Cowntdown deck and comes into play towards the end of the game when the remainder of the premium deck runs out.<br/><br/>Each player draws 3 cards from the basic cow deck and puts them in their &ldquo;pasture&rdquo; (the area directly in front of them)<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising five phases:<br/><br/>1.  Sale Phase<br/>-   You may discard a basic cow. The most basic cows you can have in your pasture is 5.<br/><br/>2.  Buy Phase<br/>-   If you have 4 or less basic cows in your pasture, you may draw the top card of the basic deck and add it to your pasture. You may only add 1 basic cow to your pasture this way per turn.<br/><br/>3.  Upgrade Phase<br/>-   You may discard 2 or more cows (basic and/or premium) to gain a premium cow, from the stockyard, with a mooney value exactly equal to the total mooney value of the cows you discarded. For Example: There is a 17 Mooney cow available as one of the 7 stockyard cows.  You have in your pasture a 5 mooney cow, a 2 mooney cow, and a 10 mooney cow. (5 + 2 + 10 = 17). You discard them to get the 17 mooney cow and put it in your pasture.<br/><br/>4.  Stockyard Phase<br/>-   If there are less than 7 stockyard cows available, flip over the top cards of the Premium deck until there are 7. If one of these is the Cowmageddon card the game ends.<br/><br/>5.  Out to Pasture Phase<br/>-   Take the highest Mooney cow from the Stockyard and place it on the bottom of the Premium deck. If you are into the Cowntdown deck, skip this phase.<br/><br/>Players may trade (or Gift) Cows at any time. Trades (but not gifts) must be acceptable to both parties. The most basic cows you can have in your pasture is 5 and you cannot gift or trade someone basic cows if it would cause them to exceed their limit. You can have any number of premium cows.<br/><br/>The Game ends when the Cowmageddon Card is revealed. Your score is equal to the total Mooney value of all your cows divided by the number of cows in your pasture. (get the calculators...)<br/>The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board game for 2 players with a Biblical Theme. One player is David, the other is Goliath. The aim of the game is to smite your foe.<br/><br/>The game area is a regular 8 X 8 grid.  There are 2 rock tokens and 2 tree tokens placed randomly on the board.  Figures are used to represent David and Goliath and start on opposite back rows of the board. Figures cannot move into or through rock tokens, but they can sling or throw through them. Figures cannot move or attack into or through Tree Tokens.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck. Some cards can be used by both players, others by David or Goliath, only. Cards allow players to move, attack or defend, or may be an event.<br/><br/>Each player draws a hand of 7 cards. Goliath gets 1 spear token. David gets 5 stone tokens.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 7 phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw Phase<br/>         Each player draws 1 card from the deck and adds it to their hand. <br/>    <br/>     Event Phase<br/>         Each player may play one event card in this phase. Events are resolved immediately.<br/>    <br/>     Goliath Move Phase<br/>         The Goliath player may move his figure on the board.<br/>         Discard a move card to move exactly the indicated number of spaces. Cards will indicate if the move can be orthogonal, diagonal, or both. <br/>         The David player may discard a negate card to end a move at any point  during its progression. <br/>         Goliath cannot move into or through the space occupied by David. <br/>    <br/>     David Move Phase<br/>         The David player may move his figure on the board (using the same rules as applied to Goliath) <br/>    <br/>     Goliath Attack Phase<br/>         The Goliath player may make a spear attack or a sword attack.  The Goliath player starts play in possession of a spear. As long as the Goliath player has his Spear he must make a Spear attack. <br/>         To make a sword attack discard a sword card to attack David if he is in an adjacent space. The card will indicate if the sword attack is orthogonal or diagonal.  The sword attack will be one of three types: Thrust, Slash, or Chop.  The David player may discard a defence card to block a sword attack. Some defence cards will not work against a certain type of sword attack. If a defence card is not successfully played, David is wounded. <br/>         To make a spear attack, the Goliath player must discard a sword card or a throw card. If a sword card is used, the attack is treated exactly like a thrust sword attack (even if the card says Slash or Cut). If a throw card is used the spear will hit exactly at the range indicated on the card. <br/>         Once thrown, if the Spear misses (a defence card is successfully played) place the spear token in the space occupied by David. Goliath is then without his spear. He can retrieve it simply by entering the space where it landed. If a defence card is not successfully played, David is wounded. <br/>    <br/>     David Attack Phase<br/>         David may only make a Sling Stone Attack. To do so both a sling card, and a stone card must be discarded. The sling card determines the range. and can be used for orthogonal or diagonal attacks. The stone card is of 3 types: Fast, Curved, and Sinker.<br/>         The Goliath player may discard a defence card to block a sling attack. Some defence cards will not work against a certain type of sling attack. If a defence card is not successfully played, Goliath is wounded. <br/>         Once slung, if a stone misses (a defence card is successfully played) place a stone token in the space occupied by Goliath. David can retrieve it simply by entering the space where it landed. <br/>    <br/>     End Phase<br/>         Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Players share a common set of 4 wound tokens. For each wound your max hand size is decreased by one. Three wounds is death. The game end when one player kills the other.<br/><br/>",

Some cities may have an effect on die rolls or creature capabilities.<br/><br/>There are 3 decks: <br/>-   The Character Deck represents advantageous traits that the characters start the game with.<br/>The Research Deck comprises cards aid that aid the Demon Hunters in their quest. Players acquire these during play. Card types include: Events, Spells, Weapons, Armour, Items, and Companions. <br/>-   The Creature Deck need to be small to fit easily on the map and represent the creatures that can be found in the various cities.

        "description": "A card game based on the TV series Arrow.<br/><br/>The game starts with 2 decks: Arrow Deck (green cards) and Villain Deck (pink cards).  As the game progresses, players will create their own personal hero decks composed of Arrow (green) cards they have previously played.<br/><br/>Each card has a power level. Green cards range from 1 to 4. Pink cards range from 1 to 7.  Certain Green cards will also get extra power depending on their text.  Each card will also have usually 2 or more traits: Criminal, Guns, Archer, Petty, Brawler, Drugs, Psycho, Police, Tech, Government, Organization, Money, Political, Skill, Equipment, Action, Arrow, Romance, Ally, Friendship, Family.<br/><br/>Each round has 6 phases, with players taking it turns to act first each round:<br/><br/>1.   Foundry Phase<br/>-    At the beginning of each round flip over the top 3X cards from the Arrow Deck and place them face up in a row (Foundry Row). X = the number of players.<br/><br/>2.   Starling Phase<br/>-    At the beginning of each round flip over the top 2X cards from the Villain Deck and place them face up in a row (Starling Row).  When you flip over a minor card (power of 1 or 2) flip over another card and stack the minor card with it. The stack counts as a single card on the Starling Row, but has the combined power of all of the cards in the stack. (The stack may contain several minor cards under the major card (power 3 or higher)).<br/><br/>3.   Hero Phase<br/>-    Starting with the round leader each player picks one card from the Foundry Row and puts it into their hand. This continues until each player has picked 3 cards. If you pick a card that says draw 1 immediately draw one card from the Arrow Deck and put it in your hand. If the drawn card also says draw 1 then draw again and so on. If the Arrow Deck is used up draw 3 cards from your Hero Deck instead. At the end of the phase the lead player passes to the player on his left.<br/><br/>4.   Capture Phase<br/>-    Starting with the (new) lead player, each player captures one or more cards (or stacks of cards) from the Starling Row and puts them into their Victory Pile. The total power of the pink cards you capture must be equal to or exceeded by the total power of the green cards you picked/drew this turn.<br/><br/>5.   Bonus Phase<br/>-    Put a victory token in your victory pile if you have played in capture phase 2 or more skill cards, 2 or more money cards, 2 characters with a romantic relationship or 2 characters with a family relationship<br/><br/>6.   Recovery Phase<br/>-    Place all green cards you played this turn into your Hero Deck discard pile.  Any Villain card not captured remains in play.<br/><br/>Each player has his own victory pile. During the course of the game players will acquire victory tokens and villain cards which they will keep in their victory pile.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the villain cards are captured. Players add up the value of all the cards and tokens in their Victory Pile. Each villain card is worth victory points equal to its power rating.  2 extra victory points are gained for each Super Villain captured. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Trump Card is unlike any other board or card game not just because of how you play, but because of what it&rsquo;s about. Most games have a rather neutral, light-hearted subject; pirates, zombies, rabbits, or a fantasy land far-far away. This is not one of those games.

        "description": "A card, dice and storytelling game for 2-6+ players. Each player takes the role of one of the Gods of Magic. The Gods create magical realms and fill them with all manner of strangeness. The God whose realms are the most complete and fantastical becomes the current Chief amongst them.<br/><br/>Players share a common Deck. There are 5 suits of 40 cards each:  Location, Action, Entities, Descriptors and Objects. Each card has a victory point value between 1 and 10.<br/><br/>Each player has his own domain - a player&rsquo;s part of the table where he keeps his realms. A realm is a group of cards that must include one location card and are placed face up in a separate group within your domain. A complete realm contains at least one card of each of the 5 suits.<br/><br/>To start each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards. Each player may play up to 3 cards to their domain to make 1 or more realms.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 Phases:<br/><br/>1.   Draw Phase<br/>-    Draw 1 card and place it in your hand. Max hand size is 10 cards. Discard excess cards at the end of this phase.<br/><br/>2.   Play Phase<br/>-    Play one card from your hand to add to one of your Realms or to create a new realm. If creating a new realm, the card played must be a location card.<br/><br/>3.   Dice Phase<br/>-    Roll the D10 and consult the Magic Table. The die result will have an effect such as discarding cards, drawing extra card, playing an extra turn, etc.<br/><br/>The realms and what happens to them tell stories. In the spirit of the game players are expected to say something about a realm when they modify it, thus describing the whims and actions of the Gods of Magic.  This is usually a statement listing all the cards within the realm and how they interact with each other. This may include elements not listed on the cards themselves. If any description fails to meet the playing groups standards, the play may be stopped by the other player and the offending player must make a different action.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to score 200 or more victory points. If 2 or more players score 200+ at the same time, the player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>",

All the &ldquo;late&rdquo; cards are shuffled to make the bottom third of the deck.<br/><br/>There are 13 resource card types:  Indians, Mines, Fish, Wood, Ships, Ground, Air, Government, Military, Oil, Agriculture, Service, and Tourism.  Resource cards have an associated cost, score and revenue value.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 2 dollars.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 2 phases:<br/><br/>1.   Revenue Phase<br/>-    Gain 1 dollar for free. <br/>-    Roll 1D6 or 2D6.  Gain revenue from every one of your resources whose score matches your roll. <br/>-    If your roll did not match any of your cards gain a second dollar for free.  <br/>-    Dollars normally come from the Bank. If, however a resource is marked &ldquo;ticket&rdquo;, then 1 dollar comes from an opponent instead of the Bank.<br/><br/>2.   Investment Phase<br/>-    The top 3 cards of the deck are turned face up. <br/>-    You may buy one card for its face value. <br/>-    You may buy a second card for double its cost. <br/>-    You may buy the third card for triple its cost. <br/>-    You may buy a fourth card for quadruple the cost and so on. <br/>-    Cards not bought are set aside and can be bought later by any player on their turn in addition to and/or instead of the top 3 that are always revealed.  <br/>-    If the card is an event card it affects the player who draws them. Event cards, once drawn and played, are removed from the game.  If an event card allows a free buy, it must be of a card set aside or drawn this turn; if there are no candidates, it has no effect.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more cards left to draw.  All players in order may ten spend the last of their dollars. Scoring is undertaken as follows:<br/>-    Score 1 VP for every card you own.<br/>-    Score 2 VP for every Government and Military Card.  <br/>-    Score 3 VP for every Oil and Tourism Card. <br/>-    Score 2 VP if you have the most cards of a type (check all 13 types)<br/>The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game for 2-4 players about the modes of death and character types in the plays of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>There are two decks of cards:<br/>-     Character Deck.  These represent the characters within the play.  Each character card has a special ability which are generally activated by die rolls.<br/>-     Death Deck.  These represents the methods by which characters die within the play.  Each death card has a rating of 1 to 6.<br/><br/>To start roll 1D6 +3. This will give a random number between 4 and 9.  This is the number of characters who will die before the play is over.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 5 random character cards. These are kept face up on the table in front of the player.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn having 3 acts:<br/><br/>1.   First Act: <br/>-    Draw 2 death cards. You max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>2.   Second Act: <br/>-    Place 1 death card on an opponent&rsquo;s character card. A character may have any number of death cards stacked on him.<br/><br/>3.   Third Act: <br/>-    Roll 1D6. This is the Death Die. If the rolled number matches the number on any death card on an opposing character, then the character is killed. If there are multiple characters that can be killed, pick just one. A killed character and any death cards on it are discarded. <br/>-    The death roll will often activate the special abilities of one or more characters. The attacked player may respond first with the reaction of one of his characters. Play of reactions of other characters proceeds in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>The game ends when the pre-determined number of deaths is reached. The winner is the player having the most living characters left at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game for 2-4+ players with a Tarzan theme. The game involves playing cards to complete the storyline for an adventure involving Tarzan.  The form of the adventure is described as a Tarzantra and has the form:<br/><br/>My name is Tarzan, (Title)<br/>I have great (Attribute)<br/>And am skilled at (Ability)<br/>I like to wrestle (Animal)<br/>Me and my friend (Ally)<br/>Journeyed to (Locale)<br/>Where with (Object)<br/>We executed a daring (Action) <br/>And defeated the (Foe)<br/><br/>Players share a common deck.  The deck has 9 suits of 9 cards each: Title, Attribute, Ability, Animal, Ally, Locale, Object, Action, and Foe.  Players are dealt 5 cards each at the start of the game with the remaining cards being spread out face down in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>In a sing-song fashion the leader says the first line of the Tarzantra.  The first player to his left gets to play a Title card from his hand if he has one.  If he does, then he keeps the card face up in front of him in his personal victory pile and he draws a face down card and puts it into his hand.  (He must also say the name of the card to complete the line of the poem)<br/><br/>If he does not have a Title card, he must look at one face down card on the table. He may keep it, or leave it and put a different face down card into his hand.  If he had to draw a card, the next player to his left gets a chance to play a Title card to complete the line. This continues until someone plays a Title card.<br/><br/>Once someone does, the leader speaks the second line of the Tarzantra. The player who played the Title card gets the first chance to finish the second line with an Attribute card. This continues line by line, until the full Tarzantra is completed.<br/><br/>When the Tarzantra is complete, the player to the leader&rsquo;s right becomes the new leader and starts a new Tarzantra.<br/><br/>The game ends when 5 Tarzantras have been completed (or 3 for a short game, or 7 for a long game).  The player with the most cards in their victory pile at game end wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game for 2-4 players with a Fantasy theme.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck of 60 cards of 5 card types: Character, Holding, Group, Event and Thing.  Some event cards are designated as Spells.  Cards have a points value between 1 and 4 and 1 of 2 types of abilities (cards used in combination with each other or cards that have a special ability).  Abilities activate as soon as the card is played.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 2 cards and then take turns to draw 1 card from the deck and play 1 card from their hand.  When a card is played it is placed face up on the table in front of the player.  If the card has a non-combo ability (e.g. discard 1 group, steal character, draw 1 card etc.) this gets used immediately. All the cards in front of you are known as your Fief.<br/><br/>When the last card is drawn the discard is shuffled and cards drawn from it (cards only ever go into the discard pile when another card sends them there).  When there is no deck or discard left, players continue taking turns, playing one card at a time from their hands until all cards are played.  At this point scoring is undertaken.<br/><br/>Cards score their basic points value but if they are combo cards may score extra points if the player holds the right combination of cards. The final scores are based on all the cards in your Fief and the combos they make. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A 2-player card game based on the Resident Evil franchise using collectible card game style mechanics. One player is the Heroes. The other is the Umbrella Corporation.<br/><br/>There are 2 decks:  <br/><br/>     The Hero Deck has 3 types of cards: Teams, Characters and Events.  These have the following sub-types: Operative, Merc, Survivor<br/>     The Umbrella Deck has 3 types of cards: Facilities, Units and Events.  Unit cards are further divided into the following sub-types: Soldiers, Monsters, Zombies and Vehicles. Traps are a subtype of Event.<br/><br/><br/>Event cards and Traps, when played, take effect immediately and are then discarded. Other types of cards remain in play.<br/><br/>The Umbrella player starts with all 6 Facility cards in play except for the New Facility. <br/>The Hero searches his deck for 1 Team Card and puts it into play. <br/>Each player draws 2 cards for their starting Hand.<br/><br/>Each turn has 6 phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw Phase<br/>         Each player draws 2 cards from their respective decks.  <br/>         If the Hero player has no teams in play, he must search his deck for a team, put it in play, and then shuffle his deck. <br/>    <br/>     Event Phase<br/>         Certain event cards are played only in this Phase.  Players take turns, starting with the Umbrella player. <br/>    <br/>     Recruit Phase<br/>         Cards are put into play from the players hand. When putting a card into play it is placed face up on the table. <br/>         The Hero player puts team cards into play. The Hero player then puts character cards into play. Character cards must be attached to team cards.  A team card may have up to 2 characters attached (or 3, if at least one of them is a survivor).<br/>         The Umbrella player may play one or more Units.<br/>         The Umbrella player may play the New Facility card.  <br/>    <br/>     Assault Phase<br/>         The Hero player may conduct one assault - one of his teams may attack one target facility.  The Hero player commits the team, its characters, and any event cards he wants to play that will assist an assault. He adds up the force values and bonuses of all these cards and adds 2D6. This is the Assault Force Total (AFT). <br/>         The Umbrella player commits the targeted facility, one unit, one or more traps and any events that will assist in defending against the assault. He adds up the force values and bonuses of all these cards and adds 2D6. This is the Facility Defence Total (FDT). <br/>         If the AFT is equal to or greater than the FDT the base is destroyed and removed from play. If the FDT is greater the Team is destroyed and removed from play.  Of the attached characters of a destroyed Team 50% are discarded and 50% put back in the Hero players hand. <br/>         If the facility is destroyed all other cards used in its defence are discarded. If the facility wins, there is a 50% chance the defending unit is still discarded. Win or lose all Event and Trap cards are discarded. <br/>    <br/>     Search Phase<br/>         The Umbrella player may conduct one Search and Destroy Mission - one of his Units may attack one target team.  This is handled just like an assault.  The Umbrella player generates a Search and Destroy Force Total (SDFT). The Hero player generates a Team Defence Total (TDT). An Umbrella unit, even if it wins, has a 50% chance after combat of being discarded. <br/>    <br/>     End Phase<br/>         Max hand size is 5 cards.  Players discard excess cards. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The Hero Player wins if all the Umbrella facilities are destroyed.  The Umbrella Player wins if all the teams are destroyed.<br/><br/>",

The 7th suit (Neutral) can be used by both players.<br/><br/>During a turn 5 cards are dealt to each player. Each player may discard up to 3 cards and draw replacements. Players then reveal their hands and score them.

Most of the locations are for sale, the moving player can buy them. If a player's pawn later enters an already owned location, the player must pay rent to the owner. When owning all locations of a site (two to four locations per site), the owner can build houses and later hotels on the locations to increase the rent for other players. The game ends after a fixed time, or if all players but one are bankrupt.<br/><br/>This version includes some major differences to the standard DKT game:<br/><br/>In every region there are two souvenirs, priced 50 and 100. You can buy one of them when you stop in the region, the cheaper one is sold first. You can only own one souvenir per region. Whenever you pass start, you get 50 extra for each souvenir you own.<br/><br/>Field 21 is a Geb&auml;ude (&quot;building&quot;) special field. It allows you to build up to 2 houses or 1 hotel (if you already have 4 houses) on each property you own, even if you do not own the whole region.<br/><br/>There are no auction rules, only the person stopping on an unowned property can buy it.<br/><br/>You can sell properties among players at all times for whatever prices you settle on.<br/><br/>The rulebook includes a long section describing the various tourist attractions depicted in each region.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FusionPlay &ndash; Heroes is the first mobile NFC card game. It&rsquo;s played with physical cards, each containing a Near Field Communication chip. These chips enable communication between the playing cards and a smartphone. As soon as you slide a card under the smartphone, it appears on the screen of the phone. Then the app processes the actions and visualizes the results. The game itself is a duel between two players like a digital-analog homage to beat-em-up games of the 16-bit era. Each player chooses one of the 4 heroes and uses the heroes&rsquo; unique skills to win the battle. The game is fast paced and always motivates to play &ldquo;just one more round&rdquo;. All components are pocket sized, so the player can always have them with them.<br/><br/>Before starting the game, the smartphone tray plates need to be placed on the table, and the smartphone should be placed on top of the tray plates. These little bars make it easy to slide the cards under the smartphone. Both players choose one hero and take all 7 cards of this hero. The app is launched, and a &ldquo;Single Round&rdquo; or a full match is selected. Then both players scan their hero cards in the &ldquo;Choose your Heroes&rdquo; screen.<br/>The game begins.<br/><br/>Both players shall choose one card, and slide it (with the face down) under the smartphone. The players will take their cards back again. The app will uncover both played cards, then process and visualize the effects of the cards. Depending on the actions taken, the players will deal damage, heal themselves, buff themselves, lower the stats of the opponent, or debuff; e.g. inflict negative conditions like burning or bleeding. Attacks can also miss or hit critically, which depends mainly upon the Dexterity values of the heroes. The game ends, when one player runs out of lives. When playing a &ldquo;best of 3&rdquo;, you need to win two rounds for winning the whole match.<br/><br/>Many effects from the actions depend on one or more attributes of the heroes. An example: Donar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Into the Skies&rdquo; raises the Dexterity for one round. His &ldquo;Hammer Throw&rdquo; adds twice the Dexerity to the damage. It may seem like a good move to raise dexterity first, and use the &ldquo;Hammer Throw&ldquo; one round later. A good, but also very predictable move. Each hero has 6 unique actions that all trigger different effects. Most of them trigger multiple effects at once. If you remember beat-em-up games from the good old 16-bit era, then imagine every card symbolizes one button on the controller, triggering a specific move.<br/><br/>Besides using your actions in the right situations, they can also be used to sum up to powerful combos. Each hero has two unique combos and one mighty super-combo. To trigger a combo, you need to play the cards in a specific order and then activate them by playing the hero card itself. The hero card can also be used to block an opponent&rsquo;s combo, or to pause one round, and regenerate some energy.<br/><br/>--description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The map is populated with terrain in the form of 4 randomly placed lakes, 4 randomly placed mountains and 4 randomly placed valleys.<br/><br/>Six dinosaurs are placed randomly on the board (but not adjacent to the visitors centre). These dinosaurs are selected at random from a table of 6 dinosaur types. Each dinosaur type is immune from one of the tactics that might be employed by the players (e.g. you cannot outrun the Velociraptors).<br/><br/>Each player starts with an 8 member team.  Players roll 8 times on a Team Table to get the composition of their team. The 6 different types of team member have skills that improve the tactical abilities of the team. Results and changes are recorded with paper and pencil. During the game, players will lose and gain team members.<br/><br/>Players share a Common Deck. The deck has 7 types of cards representing the tactics that can be employed to evade the dinosaurs: Hide, Run, Block, Trap, Shoot, Distract, and Special.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 phases.<br/><br/><br/>     Equip Phase <br/>         Draw 1 Card from the deck and add it to your hand. Max hand size is 5 cards. <br/>    <br/>     Special Phase<br/>         Special cards not meant to be used in other phases may be played (discarded) for their effects in this phase. <br/>    <br/>     Dinosaur Phase<br/>         Pick 1 Dinosaur by random and roll once on the random movement table to determine how it moves. Dinosaurs move orthogonally but not diagonally and must obey a set of movement rules related to terrain and the location of other dinosaurs.<br/>         If a dinosaur enters the same space as a team, the team will be attacked. The team must attempt to escape. An escape attempt must use 1 tactic from the 6 available (Shoot, Run, Hide, Trap, Block, and Distract. Next, the player must make an escape roll using 2 six-sided dice. Add up the total of the 2 dice rolls and add to this the number of teammates with the matching tactic. Next, play (discard) up to 2 tactics cards and add their bonuses. At least 1 of the tactics cards played must match the chosen tactic. If the Total (roll + team bonuses + card bonuses) is equal to or greater than 12, then the team escapes with no casualties. If the total is less, the team loses a number of random team members equal to the difference. If a team loses all its members, that player is out of the game. <br/>         After the attack, the team must retreat 1 space away.  If you are attacked and you control the kids token you may lose control of the token.<br/>    <br/>     Move Phase<br/>         Move your team pawn 1 space orthogonally. You may play (discard) 1 special card to move the team farther per the cards instructions. Terrain will affect where the teams move to and teams cannot enter spaces occupied by dinosaurs or other teams. If you enter the space containing the kids you take possession of it. The kids token moves along with your team pawn.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "A dice and board game for 2-4+ players themed on the race to the North Pole undertaken by various explorers in the early 1900s. Players move their pawn from the start space to the North Pole and back again.<br/><br/>Players choose from one of 6 pre-defined expeditions or use a random method to generate their own expedition.  Each expedition has 9 stats: Men, Dogs, Food, Gear, Skill, Will, Ship, Time, and Hoax. These stats represent the composition, skills, supplies, start point, start time and legitimacy of the expedition &ndash; these may change during the course of the game.<br/><br/>The board is a track 30 spaces long including a start space at one end and the North Pole space at the other end. Players share a 50-card common travel deck which influences how far an expedition will move during a particular turn.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn has 3 Phases:<br/><br/>1.  Event Phase<br/>-   Roll once on the event table. Except for the blizzard result, all other results will require the player to make a test against either Gear, Will, or Skill. A test is resolved by rolling 1D10. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the value of the stat, you pass the test. If it is less, you fail the test which will usually result in a permanent loss of a stat or a penalty to your move total in the travel phase.<br/><br/>2.  Travel Phase<br/>-   Draw 5 travel cards. You may discard up to 2 cards and draw replacements. <br/>Add up the move values of all 5 cards.  This is your move total - move that many spaces forward. You must stop upon reaching the North Pole. <br/>-   If you land on an opponent&rsquo;s pawn that is not on its starting space, move it back 1 space. <br/>-   If you have 2 or more dog cards move an extra +1. <br/>-   If you have 4 or more trek cards move an extra +1.<br/><br/>3.  End Phase<br/>-   Consume 1 food point. <br/>-   If there is no food left then -1 dog. <br/>-   If there is no food or dogs roll on the casualty table and resolve.  This will result in the loss of men, will or skill.<br/><br/>Play continues until all expeditions return to their start point, or fail in the process.  Victory points (VP) are awarded as follows:<br/>-   1 VP for reaching the North Pole. <br/>-   An extra 2 VP for being first to reach the North Pole. <br/>-   1 VP for getting back (Surviving). <br/>-   1 VP for being the first to get back. <br/>-   1 VP for never failing a morale check. <br/>The player with most VP wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card drafting game for 2-4 players in two parts. In the first part the players build up their dance schools. In the second part the schools participate in competitions.<br/><br/>There are 3 Decks. The build deck is only used in the first part of the game. The Judging and Competition decks are used in the second part of the game.<br/><br/>Build Phase:<br/><br/>The build deck card types include: Students, Teachers, Classes, Numbers, and Modifier cards. Cards have a score in one or more traits, or will give other cards a bonus to their score in one or more traits. Traits include: Base, Beginning, Intermediate, Advanced, Jazz, Tap, Ballet, Contemporary, Modern, Lyrical, Musical Theatre, Hip Hop, Solo, Duet, Form, and Heart. All traits are assigned a score.<br/><br/>The top 12 cards of the build deck are laid out face up. Players take turns picking 1 card at a time until all 12 cards are picked. This constitutes a round. A short game will have 3 rounds, a medium game 4, and a long game 5 rounds. After the first round, the first player to pick goes to the player who was the last to pick in the previous round. Picked build cards are placed face up in front of their owner in a grid format and remain in play for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Build cards are placed next to each other in a grid like matrix. Side by side (orthogonal) cards and cards whose corners are touching (diagonal) are considered to be adjacent. Many cards will give point bonuses to adjacent cards: <br/><br/>     Teachers give bonuses to all adjacent students. <br/>     Students give bonuses to adjacent numbers if their style matches, so for example: If it is a jazz number, the number will get jazz bonuses equal to the jazz bonuses of any adjacent students.   <br/>     Some cards give bonuses to all cards of a particular type even if not adjacent. <br/><br/><br/>Competition Phase:<br/><br/><br/>     Before a competition, each player may switch the places of 2 cards within his grid.   <br/>     First shuffle the Judging deck and draw 5 cards. These are placed face up in the middle of the table. Each judging card lists a trait that the judges are emphasizing. <br/><br/><br/>All scores in these traits are doubled for all players in this competition. <br/><br/>     Next, shuffle the Competition Deck. Each player draws 4 cards and places them face up in front of them. Competition cards will modify a player&rsquo;s base score. <br/>     Each player adds up the total value of all of his cards including build cards, current competition cards and current Judging cards. <br/>     The player with the highest total score wins that competition. At the end of the competition discard all judging and competition cards.  Repeat as necessary dependent on game length (1 round for short game, 3 for medium, 5 for long).<br/><br/><br/>The winner is the play with the highest overall score after the appropriate number if rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card bidding and building game for 2-4+ players themed around the Belize Mayan ruins of Altun Ha, occupied and built up between 200 BC and 900 AD before it was abandoned, probably due to a combination of overpopulation, drought, famine, social unrest, and civil war.<br/><br/>The players share a common deck comprising three types of cards: Bid Cards (also used for building), Trade Cards and Maya God Cards (wild cards).  Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards.<br/><br/>The calendar token is used to keep track of turn order within a round. It is assigned randomly at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Each Round is divided into 8 Phases: <br/>1.   Calendar Phase - the player with the calendar token passes it to the player to his right. <br/>2.   Population Phase - the population level increases by 1 (it starts at level 2).  <br/>3.   Draw Phase - each player is dealt 2 cards from the deck. <br/>4.   Trade Phase - staring with the player with the calendar token, each player may play one trade card from his hand. Trade cards allow players to draw extra cards, look at opponent&rsquo;s hands, cause opponents to lose scoring points etc.<br/>5.   Bid Phase - all players must bid zero to two bid cards from their hands. Bidding is simultaneous with players revealing their bid cards at the same time. The player with the highest value bid wins the bid and becomes the Priest King. <br/>6.   Farm Phase - the Priest King must discard 1 or 2 Bid cards with a combined value equalling or exceeding the current population level. If unable to do so, the game ends immediately and the current Priest King loses 13 scoring points. <br/>7.   Build Phase - The Priest King may play up to 2 bid cards as build cards.  A card of value 1 is placed by itself face-up in the middle of the table and is considered the first stage of a new temple. Higher level bid cards can be added onto already existing temples.  They are placed staggered on the top of a temple with a level 1 less than the card being placed. (i.e. a level 2 card is placed on top of a level 1 card; or a level 6 card is placed on top of a level 5 card). The Priest King gains scoring points equal to the value of the cards he places. If unable to build, he loses 7 scoring points. <br/>8.   Cycle Phase &ndash; maximum hand is 5 cards - players discard excess cards.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately in any turn in which the Priest King is unable to feed his people in Farm Phase. The player with the most scoring points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

The Room cards are further divided into 3 types: Food Cards, Sleep Cards and Play Cards.  Players start with a hand of 7 cards.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 7 Phases:<br/><br/>Itinerary Phase<br/>-   Draw 1 card from the deck and put it in your hand.<br/><br/>Investment Phase<br/>-   You may reduce your Cruise Point score by 1 to draw an extra card. <br/>-   You may then reduce your Cruise Point score by another 2 to draw a second extra card. (total 3 points)<br/>-   You may then reduce your Cruise Point score by another 3 to draw a third extra card. (total 6 points)<br/><br/>Business Phase<br/>-   Players may trade cards and Cruise Points with each other.<br/><br/>Launch Phase<br/>-   You may launch a new cruise ship. To do this you must play 7 cards from your hands. 6 cards must be Room cards (2 Sleep cards, 2 Play cards, 2 Food cards)<br/>The seventh card is a city card; the location where the ship will start from. <br/>-   Start a Ship Log for the new ship and select a ship token.

You score Cruise Points for arriving at a destination - gain 2D6 Cruise Points and add the value of your ship to get the base number of cruise points earned. <br/>-   Next, each other player may play one or more Mess cards from their hands against you. You may play crew member cards from your hand to negate Mess cards on a one to one basis. For each Mess card not negated, you earn 1 less Cruise Point. <br/>-   You may play 1 or more Souvenir cards. Gain 1 Cruise Point for each such card played.  <br/>-   Record on the Ships Log the destination (City) you arrived at and the number of Cruise points you scored. <br/>-   Discard all cards played.<br/><br/>Port Phase<br/>-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when players have gone through the deck 3 times and a turn starts and there are no cards left to draw. Scoring is then conducted.<br/><br/>The Ship that visits the most Cities gets 25 Cruise Points.<br/>The Ship that visits the most Regions gets 25 Cruise Points.<br/>A Ship that visits a city no other ship has visited gets 10 Cruise Points for each such city. <br/>When a ship visits all the cities in a single region, this is called a Hat Trick.

When completed place the labour card in your Victory Pile. <br/>Each Labour can only be completed if your pawn is in a specific space on the track (e.g. the Lion of Nemea can only be conducted in Greece, the Wild Mares of Diomedes in Thrace, the Golden Apples of Hesperides in Africa etc&hellip;)<br/><br/>     Once one player has completed a Labour it is finished and is no longer available to other players to complete.  <br/><br/><br/>End Phase<br/><br/>     Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. <br/><br/><br/>The game ends when all 12 labours have been completed. The player with the most labour points, gained by completing labours and adventures, wins.<br/><br/>",

When adding an ID card to your starting force, you must also add an associated ID character to your Sideline. [ID cards have a cost of 5.]<br/><br/>Here is the text of ID cards:<br/>Inspiration: &ldquo;A specific effect that varies from ID card to ID card.&rdquo;<br/>Setup &ndash; At the beginning of the game, choose a character on your sideline with a name or real name matching this ID Card and turn it to a starting line. This character is called an ID Character. You can&rsquo;t have more ID characters on your force than you have characters placed on the map at the beginning of the game. (If the card is Unique, it will say so here.)<br/>Call in Help &ndash; At the beginning of your turn, you may activate one ID Card per force. To activate an ID Card, choose a friendly character that has no action tokens and is equal to or more points than the ID Character's starting line. Give the chosen character a power action, place the ID Character adjacent to it, and then remove this ID Card from the game and your opponent scores it. The ID characters can&rsquo;t be carried, given double power actions, replaced, or assigned resources. The ID character returns to your sideline immediately: (a) at the beginning of your next turn, (b) if it's not within 5 squares of the chosen character, or (c) if it is removed from the map by another game effect.<br/>Inspire &ndash; When a character friendly to an ID Character is in an adjacent square, they can use that ID Character's Inspiration.<br/><br/>",

This deck is composed of cards the Stalkers use to avoid <br/>Hazards and find Artefacts. Each card has a Rating in 2 Traits: Avoidance Rating (used to avoid hazards) and Detection Rating (used to find artefacts)<br/>-  The Zone Deck.  This deck has 4 card types: Location, Hazard, Artefact and Events.<br/>-  The Character Deck. These represent Stalkers. Each one has a special Ability.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn having four phases:<br/><br/>1.  Stalker Phase<br/>The current Stalker fills his hand to 10 stalker cards drawn from the top of the stalker deck.<br/><br/>2.  Zone Phase<br/>A player may decide to completely skip the Zone Phase on his turn. <br/>The current stalker flips over the top card of the Zone Deck and places it face-up in the middle of the table. This card is called the Primary Zone Card. <br/>-   If the Primary Zone card is a location the Stalker must discard a stalker card of his choice from his hand along with the location card. <br/>-   If the Primary Zone card is a hazard the Stalker must play (discard) a stalker card to avoid it. The Hazard card will have a danger rating. The Stalker must roll 1D10 and add the avoidance rating on the Stalker card he played to the roll. If this total is equal to or greater than the danger rating of the Hazard card he successfully avoids it. If the total is less, he must roll 1D10 on the Hazard Table. Either way discard the hazard card. <br/>-   If the Primary Zone card is an Artefact the Stalker must play (discard) a Stalker card to find it. The Stalker must roll 1D10 and add the detection rating on the Stalker card he played to the roll. If this total is 7 or greater he successfully finds it. The stalker places it face-down next to him in his Swag pile. If the total is less, he does not find it; discard the Artefact card. <br/>-   If the Primary Zone card is an Event card, resolve it and discard it. <br/>-   The Stalker may repeat this process as long as he still has Stalker cards in his hand.<br/><br/>3.  Recovery Phase<br/>If the Stalker skipped the Zone Phase completely, he may remove one injury marker. If he has 1 or more bracelets in his swag remove 1 additional injury marker.<br/><br/>4.  End Phase<br/>The player may discard none, some, or all of his Stalker cards. Players may trade Stalker and Swag cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when only 1 player is left alive or a new turn starts and there are no cards left in the Zone Deck. The winner is the last Stalker left alive or the one with the most Swag Points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

The other player is the Holnists.<br/><br/>The map shows about 40 owns linked by roads and includes other features such as rivers, forests, and mountains. The distance between two adjacent towns linked by a road is called a space. Towns have a rating of either small, medium, or large (which affects recruit rolls).<br/><br/>There are a variety of different types of units each of which have four differing statistics:<br/><br/>     Move - the maximum number of spaces the unit can move in a turn. <br/>     Fight - when rolling the D6 to attack, a roll of this number or higher will kill an enemy unit in the same town. <br/>     Sneak &ndash; a unit may attempt to move through a stack of enemy units. To do this, it must roll this number or higher on a D6. This stat is also used to retreat from an enemy that enters a unit&rsquo;s location. <br/>     Recruit - when rolling the D6 to recruit, a roll of this number or higher will convert a militia in the town into one of the player&rsquo;s unit types. <br/><br/><br/>A regular 52 card deck is used. The Postmen can use red cards. The Holnists can use black cards. Cards are played to influence dice rolls and statistics or to generate special events.<br/><br/>Players take turns with the The Postmen going first. Each turn is divided up into five phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Move Phase<br/>          Units can move a number of spaces up to their move stat rating and may attempt to move through a stack of enemy units by rolling their sneak number or higher on a D6. <br/>    <br/>     Fight Phase<br/>          If opposing units are in the same town, they will fight. All units get to make one attack and all attacks are simultaneous. <br/>    <br/>     Recruit Phase<br/>         Each unit may make 1 recruit roll if it occupies a town with 1 or more militia in order to convert 1 militia in the town into one of its unit types. <br/>    <br/>     Militia Phase<br/>         If a town is unoccupied by Postman or Holnist Units roll 1D6 to see whether a militia unit appears. <br/>    <br/>     Mail Phase<br/>         Draw 2 cards.

These merciless overlords send their mind-controlled horse minions to feed, breed, and conquer - until only one Stable remains!<br/><br/>This game was designed live at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) Australia 2017, during the &quot;Let's Make a Board Game - Live!&quot; panel. 'Unstable' (also 'Foal Play' and various other equestrian puns) was created on audience suggestions (horses, unstable relationships, mind control, area control, 'Animal Farm') and then condensed into a tabletop board game to be added to the PAX Aus Tabletop Library (and in print-and-play through BGG).<br/><br/>In Unstable, a game for 2-4 players, players split into two teams. Each turn, players all draw one Hay, Water and Equus (Love) card. They then draw an additional card of any type matching a territory they control. Each of these card types has one of four actions on it (Breed, Attack, Gallop or &quot;Turn into Glue&quot;). After drawing, and without being allowed to speak to each other, players place up to three cards facedown in front of them and then reveal and action those cards one at a time. If teammates both reveal the same action, they get a bonus.<br/><br/>So, you must mind-meld with your partner, control the board, and collect up to 20 horseshoes to win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The way the game works is each player has a deck of 40~60 cards, after shuffling you draw 6 cards from the deck, decide who goes first, etc. then each player starts with 30 Loyalty (its like your Life Points) and 10 resources (just as important as Loyalty). Each player will spend their resources to play creatures to attack their opponents with and defend their Base (their side of the field), and play powerful spells, weapons, and artifacts to power up their creatures! Be careful though, because you might trigger an opponents Event card! (It's like an instant or a trap card) and then you might get set back as a result! Plan carefully as you set up your Terrain cards (Their like lands and field cards) to bolster your creatures defenses (by giving them a safe place to hide) and be prepared when you play your Epics (similar to legendary artifacts) because though they may greatly aid your creatures, one slip up and it could be stolen from you, if that happens 3 times you lose the game! Oh and don't forget to pay attention to the placement of your creatures to (because it matters big time!) If your not careful you might leave your weakest creature on the Front Lines (where it can be attacked) when it should have stayed in your Base (where its more safe)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On certain places of the board there are specific 'challenges' or random 'challenges' according to the card the player takes. Challanges can be solved by a 12-sided die, and even 3 helper cards can add a bonus. For every solved challenge the player gets so called 'Omnitrix' cards.<br/><br/>Players have to use a 6-sided die for moving, but only the numbers 1, 2 and 3 can be found on it, and if they roll 3 then they may move backward, too.<br/><br/>The game ends for a player when he/or she reaches the center of the board, however the winner is the player with the most Omnitrix card. So it's a good strategy to move back every time if possible.<br/><br/>The story according to the prologue from the rulebook is that Ben Tennyson and his team (Kevin Levin and Gwen Tennyson) look for a 4th person to the team. The players compete for this opportunity.<br/><br/>",

To find out, concentration and a good memory are required in Mini-Memo. The player who can best remember the same pictures and therefore collect the most card pairs wins. A fun and colorful memory game.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>The player whose turn it is turns over  two memory cards, one after the other.<br/><br/>Do they show the same picture?<br/>Excellent! Keep these two memory cards. You may then turn over two more cards.<br/><br/>Do they show different pictures?<br/>What a pity! After everyone has seen the memory cards, turn them back over again.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the cards have been turned over and therefore all the pairs have been found. Stack your own memory cards. Whoever can build the highest card tower wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Your opposing wills for the fate of the world will have to be resolved as they always are, where kings are pawns, on the board populated by the Souls of millions, in this broad land under the sun.<br/><br/>Control was designed with the idea that the best part about playing card games is playing cards.  You and your opponent each bring a 14 card deck to the table.  There are a total of eight possible colors of cards to make your deck from.  On your turns, you can play as many cards of two colors as you want, and once per game you may switch you hand and your deck.  This means that you could play all of your cards on your first turn (if you made a two color deck).<br/><br/>However, you would lose the game.  To win, you must cause your opponent to have zero cards in her deck.  This means that you have to strike the right balance in how many cards you play and when you play them.<br/><br/>The game has full color cards for print and play, printer friendly cards, and a Tabletop Simulator module.<br/><br/>",

This excess supply has led to Drifters far and wide forging new creatures. The emergence of 2 new Guilds, Treeforge &amp; Shardveil, brings all to the brink of war.<br/><br/>Shardveil, their ice not limited to any part of the color spectrum, seeks to bring a halt to the chaos by permanently freezing the world. Treeforge and their vast forests of living trees &amp; mushrooms fight to uproot the spreading ice. Which Guild do you choose?<br/><br/>A Competitive Expansion (Set 3) Crystal Forge:<br/>With new Rarity mechanics, new creature types, &amp; new effects like Reveal and Freeze, the Crystal Forge expansion set introduces all-new cards with new themes &amp; new artwork all jam-packed into 2 new decks that are ready-to-play &amp; fully customizable! None of these cards can be found in other sets!<br/><br/>Details:<br/><br/>This set consists of 2 Competitive Decks. The Treeforge Competitive Deck revolves around Treefolk &amp; Mushfolk and the Shardveil Competitive Deck features ice creatures of all colors, shapes and sizes called Shardfolk. These decks are geared for advanced players who are already familiar with the basics of the game and heavily feature type and rarity mechanics. The decks can be played standalone or customized, and many players purchase 2 of each deck to get a playset (x2 copies) of each card since the set contains 100% new cards. This set contains extremely powerful Ability creatures that combo well with their respective types, and both decks feature a completely blinged-out 20-card foil energy deck with new artwork and a new foil treatment.<br/><br/>Two new Guilds are given official recognition with this set, with the emergence of 2 new Guild Leaders. Oliver Rose leads the Treeforge Guild and Crystallus is the self-proclaimed leader of the Shardveil Guild.<br/><br/>Set Breakdown:<br/><br/>This set consists of 43 cards, including:<br/>8 Rares<br/>15 Uncommons<br/>20 Commons<br/>In addition to introducing new mechanics like freeze and reveal, Existence Games wanted to spoil players by giving them a full foil energy deck in these decks for no extra cost.<br/><br/>Creature Types:<br/>This set introduces the following creature types:<br/><br/>Mushfolk<br/>Storm<br/>Shark<br/>Phoenix<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As in classical chess, the object of Tensor Chess is to checkmate the opponent's king.<br/><br/>The game is played on an 8X10 board with a new piece added to the array; the Tensor Beast.<br/><br/>The Beast Manuevers dependent on interacting with the new piece.  The beast can move one square in any direction like the king.<br/><br/>The beast can also leap forward or backward over its own or opposing pieces and land on the next square if that square is unoccupied. It can leap diagonally, or leap horizontally along a row (rank) and vertically along a column (file). The beast can hop both vertically and horizontally on the same turn, but horizontal and vertical leaping cannot be combined with diagonal leaping.<br/><br/>The beast cannot move one square and then begin leaping. Nor can it leap and simply return to its starting square as this would be skipping a turn. It can, however, return to its starting square on the same turn if it captures an opposing beast by its final leap.<br/><br/>The beast can only capture an opposing beast and can only be captured by an opposing beast. A beast captures an enemy beast by hopping over it rather than landing on the same square.<br/><br/>For example, a beast may hop over an enemy beast, not capture it, and proceed to hop over and capture another beast.<br/><br/>Or a beast may hop over an opposing beast, and not capture it on that first hop, but then hop back over the opposing beast (moving in the other direction) and capture it on that hop, all on the same turn.<br/><br/>In addition A bishop, rook or queen can pass through a beast of its own color, but not through an enemy beast.<br/><br/>A beast acts as a shield for its own pieces and blocks opposing pieces.<br/><br/>A pass through may involve more than one beast.<br/><br/>A king may pass through only when castling.<br/><br/>Similarly there are unique ricocheting and propelling moves associated with the Beast.<br/><br/>A beast may pass through another beast when propelled.<br/><br/>A pawn may pass through only on its first move and only when moving forward to an unoccupied square.  Pawns cannot pass though and capture.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WWII: Full Global Conflict is a territorial strategy game covering the second world war. A variant of the Axis &amp; Allies board game system, and a flagship game in the Empires of History game series, it offers an easy to play D10 based combat system and territories with resource values for production. More than 7 years in the making, it stands as king atop the Empires of History line of historical strategy games.<br/><br/>Two full color game maps present Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific in detail. Movement between the maps is clearly defined and a comprehensive series of off map boxes contain North America, South America, the Atlantic central and lower Africa and more. One game: the entire war. With Manpower Limits, detailed technology development rules, and accurate historical detailing, Empires of History: WWII provides all of the game play quality and historical detail that gamers have come to expect from the Empires of History board game series.<br/><br/>With over 1700 counters, 11 nation sheets and 3 political options booklets, players assume the mantle of command of the Axis &amp; Allied forces with an option for the US player to play with their own agenda. The game comes with a standard 1939 start for the war, but with the available political options, the game can either follow the path of the war or diverge from it fairly substantially. Limited resources like Oil Resources, Manpower Limits and difficult to defend naval sea trade resources, neither side has it easy and both should experience the desperate need for very limited resources.<br/><br/>A game for 2-8 players.<br/><br/>",

A piece can be played if it can be &quot;associated&quot; with at least one of the other pieces already on the table, along one of the two &quot;variables&quot; of the game.<br/><br/>The two &quot;variables&quot; are the color of each animal (white, black, brown, pink, green, white/black) and how it moves (two-legged, four-legged, flying, swimming).<br/><br/>The two pegs of each puzzle piece only allows the interlocking with another piece belonging to the right category. For example, the panther can be associated with the gorilla (because they're both black) or with the polar bear (because they have four legs).<br/><br/>But how do you win? Making the winning combinations before opponents, which are in all five different types and give different scores.<br/><br/>The winning combinations and the corresponding prize tokens that you earn to keep track of the points are explained in detail in the rules of the game, but an example of a winning combination can be to complete a row playing the fourth and last animal of pink color, or completing a column by attaching the sixth and last animal that flies ...

The dealer starts by playing a number 7 of any group; Animal, Bird, or Fish, the next player must follow suit/group and play a number higher or lower. Or he may play a 7 of any group. If you cannot play you must pass. When a player runs out of cards he is the winner. He receives a score equal to the number of cards left in the other players hands. It has a bit of a trick-taking mechanic. Players play to an amount agreed upon before the start of the game.<br/><br/>Because the cards are numbered it can also be used to play Rummy, Snip and Snap - which is similar to war, and Rally-up - a game where players try to get 12 consecutive cards of one group by passing 2 cards face down to the player on their left.<br/><br/>",

You've been put through hell and still you've only given your name, rank and serial number. As they take a break from interrogating you, you manage to break open the window to the room and climb out onto the ledge. You immediately notice the 500ft drop to the rocks below and feel the cool chill air of the Bavarian Alps. You work your way to the face of the mountain and look up to see sheer rock hundreds of feet straight up with occasional patches of snow covering section of the mountain. You have two choices; climb to freedom with no turning back or get recaptured and await certain death from the SS. Your choice is clear, climb the mountain and escape the Alps.<br/><br/>Your goal is to climb up multiple rock faced cards using dice to manage your movement direction.  On each rock face card are hazards, benefits, rest points and location markers.  You must climb through natural rock conditions as well as snow conditions.<br/><br/>Certain dice arrangement can gain you another movement die or allow you to modify existing direction die.<br/><br/>Each game is different due to 12 individual rock face configuration and marker locations.<br/><br/>WINNING CONDITION:<br/>Successfully manage your climbing piece up the face of a mountain to the top without falling. You must manage your climbing route and try to pass through specific zones while trying to avoid losing as little fatigue as possible.<br/><br/>LOSING CONDITION:<br/>Become too fatigued or lose your grip and fall off the rock face; losing the game immediately.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Collection compares favorably to the popular cooperative game Pandemic. In Clopper's game, a group of players must work together to resolve three major crises across the globe. The object is for players, who each represent different types of CIA officers, to collect enough relevant intel to resolve all three crises. If any one of the three impending disasters boils over (as represented by three increasing &quot;fire&quot; meters), the team loses. Every game must have at least three players to fill the roles of &quot;political analyst,&quot; &quot;military analyst,&quot; and &quot;economic analyst.&quot; Those three are only able to collect intel in their specific fields, while additional players (up to seven on a team) have their own specialties.<br/><br/>The difficulty comes from the low number of actions each player can do per turn, along with how quickly the fire meter ratchets up. Players can take two actions per turn: move your agent around the globe, foster new relationships in your current location, or attempt to acquire intel. The latter move is a dice roll. Those rolls are bolstered by having more relationships in a certain zone, by having fellow agents in that same zone (if they offer a specific &quot;colocator&quot; bonus), by having bonus cards, and by how good your relationship is with a specific agency.<br/><br/>",

Do you know who warmed up for Rolling Stones the first time they played in Oslo, or which Ray Charles song Kayne West has sampled?<br/><br/>After a million conversations about music among your friends, you now want to prove that it is you who is the biggest music lover. Now all the hours with LP-records, worn CD's and music streaming finally counts. Pop music is the soundtrack of life, and here the music is the focus.<br/><br/>Somebody will say that you don't need to know who was the drummer in The Beatles before Ringo Starr, or what has Elvis Presleys middle name. They can't be more wrong. Without this essential knowledge, you never will become the greatest in PopQuiz!<br/><br/>The d10 dice guides you fast to the correct music category. Now you must show what you know! Answer correctly, you move closer to the goal. Do you answer incorrectly, you can now enjoy that you have learned something more.<br/><br/>",

Different base colors denote better player skills in specific areas.  You'll need to build a balanced team including defenders, midfielders, and strikers and of coarse a top-notch goalie.  Winning is about knowing your player's powers and when to best use them.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to complete 32 moves in each match (16 in each half) and score more goals than your opponent.  The game is played on a pitch marked with a grid, where each grid point defines what may be accomplished from that position.<br/><br/>Moves are made by calling and winning Skill Challenges allowing you to progress the ball to better positions down the pitch.  There are 5,6,7,8, or 9 Skill Challenges in each Move and you can only score from one of the 32 shooting positions.  Of course the goalie will have a chance to block your shot.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>- MicroDome play pitch and stadium that doubles as a carry-case<br/>- 16 exclusive MicroStars miniatures including 2 black-base &quot;rares&quot;<br/>- 2 goals<br/>- Stadium backdrop and benches for your teams<br/>- Rules of Play<br/><br/>",

Launched from a base in Nazi Occupied Europe, it would travel down an approximately three-mile long monorail track, launched initially by V-2 rocket engines into space at a speed so fast, it would circle the earth in only a few hours. Its payload was to be a single composite bomb containing nuclear particles in a fashion similar to &ldquo;chaff&rdquo;, with an initial detonation in the higher atmosphere above a city to ensure complete coverage of the nuclear material.<br/>The bomb itself was a 5,000-pound high explosive warhead wrapped in special insulated blankets of radioactive silicone, detonating at about 2,000-3,000 feet above the target city. The end result would be radioactive sickness and death for those on the receiving end.<br/>After mission completion, the bomber would glide back to Germany reentering the atmosphere gradually and landing at a specially designated airfield. The cost of producing the bomb and the bomber itself though would render this weapon as a relatively expensive endeavor suited mostly for preemptive strikes against heavily fortified cities with the aim to wipe them out quickly.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

A player's score at the end of any hole is equal to how many times they needed to flip their ball (counter) plus any penalties they received. Whoever has the lowest score at the end of either 9 or 18 holes, wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this roll-and-move game, each player is attempting to either become the first player to get a job or to be the last player to go bankrupt. On each player's turn they roll the die and move their pawn around the board. Depending on which space they land on, they will most likely draw a card, which will either give them additional qualifications to get a job, interview advice, or contacts. A player can use these cards to move into the Interview Space, and with a little luck and the right cards, the player can win the game. Similarly, players will also collect &quot;Mail&quot; cards during the game, which are bills they must pay periodically. Thus, a player may end up going bankrupt due to their bills before they have a chance to find a job.<br/><br/>",

Roll up your sleeves &ndash; it&rsquo;s time to start a rumpus!<br/><br/>Rumpus is a pocket-sized betting card game that is incredibly easy to learn and play. Aggress other players to show what a desirable gentleman you really are &ndash; but don&rsquo;t pick a fight you can&rsquo;t win! Oh, and please don&rsquo;t start an actual fight. You are better than that.<br/><br/>In Rumpus, each player draws three cards, then chooses one card to place face-up in front of them so it is visible to the other players. Each card will consist of one of three symbols - Bicycle, Mustache, and Top Hat. At the beginning of each turn, the player with the Your Turn card must choose an opponent to fight. The players not involved in the fight may place a bet on who they think will win; be careful though, your bet cards will be lost if your fighter loses the fight.<br/><br/>The fighting players will select cards from their hand of a single symbol to play. Once both players are ready, they will reveal their selected cards to see who wins the fight. The player with the most of symbols of their suit wins the fight; in the case of a tie, there is a listing of which symbols are most effective against another symbol in the instructions (think Rock-Paper-Scissors). The winner will take a Victory Card and must read the description on the card out loud (e.q. &quot;Good Show!&quot;); the other players who bet on the winner will take their bet cards back and draw an additional card from the deck that can be used for future fights.<br/><br/>Once all of the Victory Cards have been drawn, the game is over, and the player with the most Victory Cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The game is published in Japanese but is language free in gameplay.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing a card on the table to form a four-column grid. When a pair of cards of the same color are connected, orthogonally or diagonally, that player takes these cards and scores points, and the taken spaces are filled by existing cards in a certain rule. If another pair is made, that player takes them and scores again, which is called chaining. Repeat the process until no pairs are made.<br/><br/>There are several game modes. In one mode, you just draw a card and place it, and you should take as many cards as possible. In another mode, you choose one from your hand of two cards, and you score negative points if a single pair is made in a turn; only chainings are counted positive.<br/><br/>In another game, special cards may be added to change the rules slightly.<br/><br/>Depending on the game mode, the player with the most positive points or the least negative points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;User summary<br/><br/>同じ色が縦・横・斜めのいずれかに揃えばカードをゲット♪ <br/>カードを集めたり、マイナス点として押し付けたり&hellip; <br/>付属のカードで遊び方いろいろです♪<br/>小さいお子さんから大人の方までみんなで遊べるカードゲーム！<br/>《プレイ時間10〜15分・プレイ人数2〜10人》 基本の遊び方は2種類。 <br/>さらに発展ルールで遊び方のバリエーションが増えます。 <br/>一撃堂オリジナルゲーム第1作目 カードゲーム「ちぇいにんぐ」<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is primarily a trivia game, with quaint illustrations and quick facts for children and teens to learn. There are no formal rules for using these cards as a trivia game.<br/><br/>As with other games in this series (such as Know Canada's Heroes) this deck also includes rules to use the deck for other card games. This deck includes two rules cards to play Rummy and Triplets. The proposed Rummy is the classic 2 to 4 players version of the card game. The rules for Triplets describe a simplified 2 to 4 player version of a game most often called Indian Rummy or Pablu. In this version of Rummy, sets of three provide more points than in classic version.<br/><br/>",
