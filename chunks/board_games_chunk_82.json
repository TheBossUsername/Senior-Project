You earn points for the number of flowers in a bouquet (row of flowers) - simply put flower cards in the row on your team's side of the playing area. You have to match starting card with one of three attributes - a type of flower, its color, or ornament. As soon as there are at least 4 flowers in a row you can score, but more flowers means more points. On the other hand, waiting too long may cause losing all points for that row.<br/><br/><br/>Możecie samodzielnie lub w parze stanąć do konkursu i podjąć wyzwanie wykonania najbardziej okazałych bukiet&oacute;w.

Every false step could make you miss the most important events; every mistake in planning your itinerary could make you be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The winner is the player who best moves around the city finding the most important places and events according to the time of the day, just like it happens in real life.<br/><br/>Overview of the game<br/><br/>In the box we find a board summarizing the 68 Fuorisalone key locations of these past few years: La Triennale di Milano to Bar Basso, from BASE to the hidden historic buildings of the city of Milan. A dashboard/timetable subdivides the design week into three main phases: morning, afternoon and evening. Each time of the day will propose four events taking place at the same time in different locations: the objective of each player is to join at least one event to gain the corresponding card. Every location card represents a design icon-object; with more than one object you will be able to reach the targets that will allow you to achieve more points.<br/><br/>",

It follows on from the designer's previous game インヴァージョン (!nversion), and takes a theme of an illegal casino run by gangsters. The player who wins the most money loses the game, because they get picked up by the police. So the real winner is the player with the second highest score.<br/><br/>Before play starts, a line of cards is laid out (similar to !nversion), and this dictates the lead suit for each trick. However, players can alter the line by paying bribes. In this way, players can win tricks unexpectedly.<br/><br/>",

To celebrate the harvest of the last plunder, he held a huge party for pirates from across all oceans. Unfortunately, while everyone was present enjoying the party, an explosion interrupted the festivities. The navy had discovered their hideout! Every guest ran for their lives, but biggest treasure was still on Blackbeard's ship, Queen Anne's Revenge. Blackbeard and his men had no choice, but to defend their ship from being captured by the navy!<br/><br/>In Ocracoke: Gold and Glory, if you are the navy, you fight for the glory of the country, trying to collect enough treasure that you can place Blackbeard in jail. Otherwise, you collect as many gold coins as you can, then run away from the turmoil. In game terms, you want to collect five coins before anyone else, and you do this by taking actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Use the ability of one of two double-sided action cards, then flip the card to its other side.<br/>     Declare the answer with all players.<br/><br/><br/>Players continue for several rounds until one player collects their fifth coin, at which point the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>",

If you can use your powers to damage the target, they die when they run out of life points.<br/><br/>To use the Resonance Ring, you must detect the opponent's two abilities and destroy them with a single blow, by releasing the matched wave from the ring.<br/><br/>Do you want to use your abilities actively or conceal your abilities by bluffing and deflection, and aim for a blow with the ring? You make the decision.<br/><br/>With three or four players, your target is the player to your left.<br/><br/>With only three actions, attack, pass, or use the ring, players must choose different strategies. Players that are aggressive and attacking, risk being destroyed with a single blow from a ring. This keeps the game uncertain and tense.<br/><br/>",

To win, you have to move two of your pieces onto the other side.  Your pieces are all the same shape, in red, yellow, and green.  You roll a die, and then get to move one of your pieces that number.<br/><br/>The gimmick is this: before moving your piece, you choose which one you want to move, and then turn a hidden dial to that color.  Your opponent then turns his hidden dial to the color he THINKS you're going to choose (or the color he wants to stop you from choosing).<br/><br/>After both players have set their dials, a button is pressed, and the colors light up, revealing the choices.  If he guessed right, you don't get to move.  Otherwise you do move, and then the turn alternates - your opponent rolls and you have to guess.<br/><br/>There are passages on the board that can be blocked strategically, and you can't pass another token - but if you land on it exactly, you send it back home<br/><br/>There's a lot of double- and triple- thinking (&quot;he thinks I'm going to do that, but instead I'll do this.  But what if he realizes that I know he thinks I'm going to do this...&quot;) to it, and it has a built-in balancing mechanism - when a player has gotten one piece in, he then only has two to choose from, which increases the chance of his opponent stopping him.<br/><br/>Most games take around 30 minutes, but with a lot of good guessing, the game could, in theory, go on forever.  I've seen one game take almost an hour-and-a-half!<br/><br/>",

Each player must then place one chip of the same denomination on each of the ten spaces on the Bonanza wheel. Deal the cards one at a time beginning at the dealer's left and dealing one extra hand as a &quot;widow.&quot; Continue dealing until the pack is exhausted, regardless of the fact that some of the players will receive an extra card.<br/><br/>The players examine their cards. The dealer, without looking at the &quot;widow,&quot; chooses either to discard his hand in exchange for it or to keep his hand and sell the &quot;widow&quot; to the highest bidder. If he announces that the &quot;widow&quot; is for sale, the other players, without looking at it, may bid for it if they choose, the bidding starting at the dealer's left and continuing around the table as many times as necessary to determine the highest bidder. The successful bidder gives the dealer the number of chips bid, discards his original hand, and picks up the &quot;widow.&quot; If the dealer offers the &quot;widow&quot; for sale and no one bids, it is discarded.<br/><br/>The play of the hand falls into two parts, the first on the upper half of the wheei (Joker, Queen-Jack, Sequence, Ten-Two, and Poker) and the second on the lower half (Ace of Spades, King of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs, and Center Section).<br/><br/>VALUE OF POKER HANDS<br/><br/>Poker hands are ranked as such:<br/><br/>1.

You have to negotiate the political landscape, deal with crazy things like dwarven larceny and ogre attacks, and build a wildly successful military while also bringing culture to your uncouth citizens.<br/><br/>In Super Hardcore Hamlet Builder Pro 5000 Of The Stars; 1599 AD (or just Hamlet Builder Pro for short), each player will design and build their own hamlets. You can start off small with tents and mining camps, and work your way up to smelters, blacksmiths, siege factories and more. But you can't just focus on military, after all, your people need to eat. Many will want a better place to sleep, too, and that is just the beginning of your job as magistrate.<br/><br/>Over 7 rounds of game play, each player will build a couple dozen buildings into their hamlet, while managing their income, storage, military, and culture. Each round presents a new challenge. Will you be a Hamlet Builder Pro?<br/><br/>",

Half your territory, half your opponent's. You win by either destroying your foe's Staging Area, or running them out of cards by keeping units in their territory. The more powerful the unit, the faster your opponent's cards go away. When they're out of cards, they sue for peace. Game over.<br/><br/>iA has no &quot;mana&quot;. Rather, you get a certain number of actions each turn, which can include collecting resource points, deploying units, making attacks or using special abilities. If you can't deploy a unit, spend an action to collect the resources you need to pay the cost! And, iA minimizes the luck of the draw. Your opening hand is exactly what you want. You start each battle with the forces you think will bring you victory. Of course, your opponent is doing the same, and only one of you will be right...<br/><br/>",

Today we dig oil, process it into various petroleum products at a refinery, and ship it all over the world. The game ends when someone builds their sixth building or there are no coins left in the stock. By then, it is the victory of the player who has accumulated more wealth than anyone else by building buildings or shipping various petroleum products. Wealth is measured in VP. Eight kinds of products are refined from rainbow-colored crude oil to control the world oil industry! I want to be an oil king.<br/><br/>In this cut-throat 3-player petroleum industry game, manage your action selection to collect the most victory points at the end of the game.  Balance the supply at your refineries to ensure you can maximize every action, and leverage the random board setup to cash in on the various buildings and factories made available.<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>各プレイヤーは6つのアクションを駆使し、事業を進めていきます。ただし、このゲームでは全員が同じアクションを行います。すなわち、あなたが選んだアクションをほかの二人も行います。そして、他の二人が選んだアクションを&hellip;あなたも、行います。よって、強いアクションを先に行ったほうが良いとは限らないのです。<br/><br/>大切なのは、より自分にとって必要で、他の二人にとって無意味なアクションを選ぶことになります。また、アクションを選択したプレイヤーには特権というおまけがついてきますので、他人に選んでもらうより少しだけ有利になります。<br/><br/>アクションは以下の6つです。アクション同士の並び方やウラ、オモテは遊ぶたびに変わります。ウラとオモテで建物の効果が変わり、その並び方で建物のコストを構成する色や得点が変わる仕組みです。<br/><br/>・出荷：倉庫にある石油製品をお金と得点に換えます。もっとも効率の良い得点源です。あなただけが出荷したなら、ですが。<br/><br/>・建設：お金と労働者、倉庫にある石油製品を使って、アクションを強化し得点にもなる建物を建てます。同じ建物は、先に建てた人ほど高得点ですが、後から建てた人ほど安くなります。使い捨ての建物や、得点になるだけの建物もあります。<br/><br/>・倉庫：製油工場4箇所から1箇所を選び、そこにあるうち、最も数が少ない色のキューブが1色だったならば、その色のキューブすべてを倉庫へ運び込みます。<br/><br/>・製油：製油工場4箇所から1箇所を選び、そこにあるすべてのキューブを、4箇所に好きに分配します。<br/><br/>・採掘：公開されている4個１セットの原油のキューブ3セットから、望む1セットをあなたの製油工場1箇所に手に入れます。<br/><br/>・雇用：建設と採掘の際にいろんな仕事をしてくれる労働者(使い捨て)を手に入れます。<br/><br/>バッグから出てくるキューブの色こそランダムですが、ほかにはランダムな要素はありません。三人専用の、濃密なインタラクションをお楽しみください。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

During the game you can<br/><br/>1, move to top card of a column to a foundation, if it fits<br/>2, move the top card of a column to a flipper space<br/>3, move a card from the flipper to a foundation,<br/>4, move a card or a sequence of cards from the flipper or the top of the column to the top of another column if they, together with the earlier top of that column, form an unbroken decreasing sequence in one suit<br/>5, start a new foundation with the beak if it is the top of a column<br/>6, move a card or a sequence of cards, forming an unbroken decreasing sequence in one suit, from the top of a column or the flipper, to the place of an earlier emptied column, if the rank of the largest card in the sequence is smaller than the rank of the beak by one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game set in the Battlestar Galactica Universe using a variation of Dice of Arkham by Mads L. Brynnum.<br/><br/>The Setting: After the Cylon surprise attack that wiped out the 12 colonies of man, the Battlestar Galactica leads a rag-tag fleet of the last remaining humans on a long and perilous journey to Kobol, the home of the lost 13th Tribe. You control the fleet as you make you way to your new home, deciding when to run, when to fight, and how to survive.<br/><br/>Game Overview: This game is more than a simple re-skinning of &quot;Dice Of Arkham&quot;, the mechanic has been changed and modified to lend itself to this unique Sci-Fi Universe, yet it remains true to its heritage. Those familiar with &quot;Dice Of Arkham&quot; will have no problem picking this game up. For those who aren't, first of all I recommend you grab DoA RIGHT NOW (the link to it is above). It's an excellent game! There is also a very complete set of rules that will explain this game fully included in the pdf.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Game Sheet &amp; Rules (which you print)<br/>8 tokens (which you provide)<br/>8 Dice, 6 of one color and 2 of a second color (which you also provide)<br/><br/>Approximate Game Length: 10-20 minutes<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each turn you roll your Jump Prep Dice (6 dice, however you only roll 5 of them until you complete the first &quot;Humans&quot; event) to perform your actions such as repairing your ships or advancing along the Jump Preparation Track. You will also roll the Draidis Dice (2 dice) once per turn which shows you what Cylon threats will have to be resolved in this area of space before you can continue. The Cylons are also attempting to move down their track and perform Traitorous Acts to prevent the Humans from reaching the home of the lost 13th Tribe, Kobol. As each side completes their Track, an event is triggered. If the Cylons complete 3 events before the humans do, you lose. If you complete 3 before the cylons do, you win!<br/><br/>This game will ALWAYS be free to Print and Play!<br/><br/>--Lord Malachi<br/><br/>Submitted for the 2013 Solitaire Print and Play Contest<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of a mad scientist, sending minion pawns around the board to collect cards which represent the body parts of fantasy or horror creatures. Each part has specific stats and may provide a unique special ability. Each player then constructs a beast out of these collected parts and can use their assembled beast to score victory points by either defeating other players monsters or by capturing locations in the town centre on the board. The first player to reach 15 victory points wins. Beasts that fall in combat lose one of their limbs, but may have new ones stitched on and be sent back out on to the board.<br/><br/>The town also fights back through a special pawn on the board: the angry mob. Each turn a card is drawn from the villager deck which determines how the mob will act for the turn. Generally these cards strengthen the mob and send it to attack the players beasts and minions as well as occasionally scoring victory points for the board. If the board reaches 15 victory points before any of the players, the villagers have successfully stormed the castles of the mad scientists and the players lose. The players can steal victory points from the board, but this usually requires cooperation between at least 2 players in an otherwise directly competitive game.<br/><br/>",

Players cooperatively play the fresh ingredients from their hand and cook to finish the order. The order will move on a time track, which represents the status of the steak from rare to well done. Serve the completed steak safely to the customer as they requested it.

With the help of your dog, Jasper, and a loaded shotgun, you must stave off the zombies attempting to breach the four entrances to the cabin, and survive until dawn.<br/><br/>Worse, Woods&rsquo; wife, Rebecca, is suffering from a zombie bite to the arm, and is doing everything in her power to keep from being overcome by the zombie infection.<br/><br/>Once the sun rises, the zombies disperse, and you can make your escape.<br/><br/>As John Woods, you can defend the cabin by building barricades, commanding Jasper to help, and using your limited supply of shotgun shells. When you have the chance, you can also help Rebecca treat her wound. You may do as many of these actions as you wish, but, when you choose to stop, the zombies will take as many turns as you did.<br/><br/>There are three types of zombies attacking the cabin, each represented by a different colored card. As the zombies attack, cards are drawn from the deck and placed at one of the four entrances to the cabin. Eventually, the zombies will gain enough strength to begin breaking in. If all four entrances are breached, you lose. Just before dawn, the zombies launch one final attack.

For instance, all grey cards are 6's, and green cards are numbered 3-9.<br/><br/>Cards are dealt out evenly, with each player then choosing a few cards to discard.  The players are adding cards in a pyramid structure that is 8 cards wide on the bottom.  To play a card on the bottom row, a player simply plays it next to a previously played card.  To play a card on a higher row, it must be supported by 2 cards, and at least 1 must be the same color as the card being played.<br/><br/>The game ends when all players are out of cards, or no player may legally play another card.<br/><br/>If the pyramid reached the 5th tier (4 cards wide), then the last player scores positive points equal to the sum of the values shown on all cards in the 5th tier and above; all other players lose points equal to their single highest card.  However, if the pyramid does not reach the 5th tier, the last player loses points equal to their single highest card, and all other players gain points equal to their single highest card.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after a number of rounds wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Laura and her younger brother Tommy have been playing all day and their toys are scattered across the little room. They must tidy the room before they go to bed, but it is already beginning to get dark. Will the children be able to finish and be in bed before Laura's star is twinkling in the sky?<br/><br/>Laura's Star Game is about playing - hearing - feeling - reading!<br/><br/>The 12 Displays form the entire room of Laura's as a 6&times;2 picture. Each display has two empty slots for a couple of almost identical items like cars, airplanes, hand mirrors, flashlights, rubber ducks and slippers.<br/><br/>These items are placed inside a bag that has two separate pockets, and each pocket will contain one of each item plus either the dog or the bear. The 7 pieces of the Sun is assembled to form a clever timer: it has a central star-shaped part plus 5 pieces, each with 3 beams filling out the slots between the arms of the star. Finally is a cloud piece covering the sun when the game begins.<br/><br/>A player will stick a hand into each pocket of the bag, trying to identify two identical shapes without looking. This is much harder than it seems since the pieces have nicely rounded edges that makes them feel somewhat like each other, and even adults will find it difficult. It is however good training of the motor skills - especially for the wrong hand!<br/><br/>When the player is confident that two identical pieces have been found are the two pieces simultaneously retracted: If identical have the player succeed and the pieces are placed in the corresponding display and placed in front of the player.<br/><br/>Should the two pieces turn out not to be identical are they returned to the same pockets they were drawn from, and a piece of the Sun puzzle is removed. When only the central part of the sun remains will it be flipped over the next time a player fails, thus showing the star of the story. It's bedtime, the game is over and all the players lost because they didn't make the room tidy in time.<br/><br/>If the players manage to make the room in time, that is when the only tiles left in the bag are the dog and the bear, will the winner the player with most displays in front of her.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crossroads is a Biblically-based, tile-laying, cooperative game where 1-4 players encounter challenges, trying to gain enough resources to be triumphant in a story. The overture box comes with four stories, one each based on the Biblical stories Deborah and Barak, David and Goliath, the Seven Seals, and Joseph and his dream coat. An expansion available from BoardGameGeek in July 2011 has the story of resettling Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. 100 stories are planned in total.<br/><br/>A game turn in Crossroads starts with rolling dice to determine how many tiles you'll have available to lay on the grid board during your turn, and how many spaces (tiles and challenge cards being the spaces) you can move your traveler disk. When you end your movement on a challenge card, the card may have something it does in the game right away. Either way, you'll want to &quot;face&quot; the challenge. This can include needing have have stats at a certain level (others on the same space can add their stats to yours), giving up a resource you've gained during the game, rolling dice and adding to them based on various criteria, and more. Each player also has a number prayer cards which will help in facing challenges. Players can use some prayers only on themselves, while others may be used on any traveler.<br/><br/>Each story is a little different in the way it plays. What you need to do to gather resources and what you need to do with them once you do can be different, as well as what it is that's pushing you along.<br/><br/>Since this is a cooperative game, the players are facing the board rather than each other. The thing that there are facing in each game is represented by a lion playing piece that travels the board effecting players in one way or another. How the lion moves about and what it does to a traveler when it finds one is different (and themed appropriately) in each story.<br/><br/>The game's re-playability comes in the random, face-down layout of challenge cards, that you only put out 7 of the 9 challenge cards a story has when you play (leaving a mystery two out of each session), and that you can pick which prayer cards you will have with you before each session.<br/><br/>The publishers were involved in Anachronism, so the cards have excellent, historically-accurate artwork, and the game is very true to the Bible, while being nondenominational and not preachy. The game is more about the setting and the stories, which is interesting as a gamer, and/or useful as a Christian. The components are like those you're used to getting in a quality Euro-style game. The cards are not shuffled, so the publisher has made them thick and sturdy. The tiles are a standard thickness and have a good coating. And again, the art is fantastic.<br/><br/>",

The attack took place on the most holy of days for Jews in an attempt to catch the Israelis as unprepared as possible.  At first, it was a massive success.  Syrian forces marched through the weak and scattered forces in the Golan Heights while Egyptian forces easily crossed the great Suez Canal and set up a strong defensive line along the east bank of the Canal and, under their strong umbrella of Surface-to-Air missile support, awaited the inevitable Israeli counterattack.  And counterattack the Israelis did &ndash; only to be shocked at the effectiveness of new Soviet weapons and surprising Arab resolve.<br/><br/>The battle would take unexpected turns as the Israelis finally found answers to the new technology of the Arab army and fought off the challenge &ndash; even attacking into Syria and Egypt in the final stages of the battle.<br/><br/>But both sides could claim victory in this war.  The Israelis were still king of the battlefield, but their throne was more uneasy than ever before.  The Arabs proved they could defeat the Israelis in open battle and now were a force to be recognized and respected.  The war had changed everything in the region.<br/><br/>A Test of Faith is a new game in the Operational Scale Series using the new added rules from the Doomsday Project to show this war in a way that has not been seen before.

        "description": "From the creator's webpage:<br/><br/>London Underground<br/>In 1931 Harry Beck, a signal officer at London Transport, designed a map of the London Underground System, that today has become the standard for tube maps all over the world. However, the British transport authorities was skeptical about the map that Harry Beck made in his spare time. The passengers, on the other hand, were very satisfied, so soon the map became the official map of the London Transport. Harry Beck was paid around &pound;5 for his effort!<br/><br/>My Tube map is a representation of the Tube map as of 2007 (notably with the Circle Line still a &quot;circle&quot; rather than the &quot;spiral&quot; it is today). I have used appropriate colors for the different tube lines, but I had to use yellow for both Circle Line and the DLR; white is used for both Hammersmith &amp; City and the National Rail. Piccadilly and Victoria Line share the same blue color; District and Waterloo &amp; City lines share green. I also had to invent some new stations, where the different lines cross.<br/><br/>The map can be printed on 8 A4-pages using either the PDF or the individual JPGs in the ZIP-file. The destination cards is designed to be printed on Avery C32011/C32016 (Business Cards) or on plain A4 paper. There is an optional backside included in the set.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>In order to play using the map of the London Underground, you need the trains, the colored markers for each players and the train cards from the original game (either the USA- or the Europe-version). If you don't own the game, I encourage you to buy it. The Tubemap can be played by using the rules from the USA-version or the Europe-version. However since there isn't any ferries or tunnels on the map (despite the fact, that it is map of a underground-system!), you only need the stations from the European version.<br/><br/>The destination cards is divided into two categories: short routes &lt; 17 and long routes &gt; 17 points. In the European version of the game, each player is dealt three short routes and one long route at the beginning of the game and has to keep at least two routes. In the USA-version, the destination cards is mixed and you are given three to keep one.<br/><br/>",

Tires blowout, engines sputter and stall, weapons jam and ultimately fail and your armor could shear off - taking parts of your car with it! Even the vehicle's driver isn't safe: one bullet could injure or outright kill the driver. <br/>  <br/>The Dealin' Damage Bolt-On contains rules, damage cards, targeted damage cards, critical effect cards as well as a set of smoke and debris markers to enhance gameplay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sticks &amp; Stones is a card game romp through a prehistory that time forgot. Players control one of four clans struggling for survival and dominance at the dawn of humanity. To win, you&rsquo;ll have to use everything you&rsquo;ve got: shamanic powers, mighty beasts, brutal weapons, cunning inventions, shiny rocks, diplomatic grunts, threatening stares, and more! Just remember no talking during your turn!<br/><br/>Each player assembles a clan of archaic Homo sapiens, Dino sapiens, Neanderthals, or Troglodytes. Archaic Homo sapiens are our primitive ancestors. They are physically weaker than their rivals, but make up for it with character types that include the nimble Florz (cave halflings) and Cave Nerds (who create amazing prehistoric &quot;technology&quot;). Dino sapiens are semi-intelligent dinosaur people who enlist fierce dinosaurs as their allies. Neanderthals have brawny fighters and shamans who use powerful magic. Troglodytes are the most primitive clan (making even Neanderthals look civilized) but have fearsome creatures like Trogres and the dreaded Dragonasaurus working for them.<br/><br/>Sticks &amp; Stones is a 2-4 player card game. There are 110 cards, including characters from each clan, Woot! cards (events, gear, and special items), and Quest cards (challenges faced by your clan). An optional 5th player can serve as the Cave Master for the game. Players must resort to prehistoric roleplaying as they bluff, intimidate, and cajole each other--all without speaking during their turn!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;In the Shadow of Byzantium&quot; puts you at the head of a principality struggling to survive and overpower your neighbors. Judicious use of slender finances to create armies, alliances and acts treachery is essential to victory. Bind other princes to you with marriage alliances to gain a breathing space to perhaps build fortifications to protect your land. Who dares truly wins in this game of big chances and big payoffs, but the winner of today could easily be the loser tomorrow.....<br/><br/>The game can go up to twenty turns, but thanks to our variable game termination rules, the last turn could be anytime between turns 12 and 20, thus making it virtually impossible for the &quot;gang up on the leader&quot; syndrome to ruin everyones fun. One player is rarely so far ahead that they become the target of other players anyway.<br/><br/>The players to choose from:<br/>The Empire of Constantinople<br/>The Nicean Empire<br/>The Duchy of Athens<br/>The Principality of Achaea<br/>The Despotate of Epiros<br/>The Kingdom of Thessalonika<br/>The Venetians of Crete (Lords of the Archipelago)<br/><br/>In the Shadow of Byzantium can be played with up to seven players. A four player game takes about 2 hours to play. There is very little set up and almost no record keeping (just treasury- big deal!). We had so much fun playing this game first time out we believe it is destined to be one of our most popular products ever. It is a fast paced nail-biter where the victor is in doubt until the last turn.<br/><br/>This is a web-published game that is free to download and play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In ねこやしき (&quot;Cat Mansion&quot;), players are cat-lovers trying to attract stray cats from a nearby vacant lot to come live in their yards.<br/><br/>There are 6 different cat types (&quot;suits&quot;), of which players are striving to collect majorities for points, plus a &quot;rare&quot; cat type that acts as a wild suit at the end of the game. The cats in the regular suits can be values of 1, 2, or 3, while the rare cats are only value 1. There are also &quot;item&quot; cards that give special abilities.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 3 cat cards in the player's &quot;yard.&quot; The vacant lot begins as 4 face up cat cards and the rest of the draw deck face down. There are two ways to obtain cards from the vacant lot. First, a player may simply draw from the face up cards either A) up to 2 cats of value 1, B) 1 cat of value 2 or 3, or C) all visible items. Alternatively, the player may take a card from the player's own yard and return it to the vacant lot, then draw the top card from the deck. If the top card matches any of the cards in the vacant lot, the player gains the drawn card plus any that match it. (If no cards match, the drawn card remains face up in the vacant lot.) This second option may be repeated as often as desired until the player gains cards.<br/><br/>When gaining cards from the vacant lot, the player must be careful of the suit. The suit(s) in the player's yard with the most cards is considered threatening to cats in any other suits. If a player gains a card in a suit of which the player already has more cards than any other, one cat card in each of the suits with lower numbers of cats will return to the vacant lot due to fear.<br/><br/>Points are awarded at the end based on the highest value cat in the yard in each suit. One point is added for the player with a majority in that suit, while one point is subtracted from each player who has at least one card in that suit but does not have the majority. Every player with 2 or fewer suits at the end of the game gets a &quot;maniac bonus&quot; of 3 points. The player with the most points at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each cube has two sides that are all dark, two sides that are half-light (diagonally separated into a dark and a light triangle, marked with a white dot), and two sides being fully light (with a white dot on each triangle). Each light triangle counts as 1 light, so a fully light side counts as 2 light. The starting player tilts one cube into an open space and places Buh, the blocking token, onto any other cube, then the second player starts with the first normal turn.<br/><br/>On a turn, you take two actions. An action can be to (1) slide a cube into an orthogonally adjacent open space, not changing its orientation, or (2) tilt a cube into an orthogonally adjacent open space. You cannot take an action where Buh is located, and after taking your actions, you must move Buh onto any other cube. At the end of your turn, all cubes must be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to at least one other cube and the total amount of light on the top faces of the cubes must have increased.<br/><br/>A &quot;light area&quot; is created by one or more cubes that have orthogonally (edge to edge) adjacent half or full Bright faces. Multiple light areas can exist on top of the cubes, and they will shift and change over time.

        "description": "This is it &ndash; you've finally been called up to the big leagues. There's one open position in the homicide unit and the competition for the job is fierce. The police chief is going to give all of you, the aspiring beat cops, a couple of murder investigations to see who has what it takes to become a real detective.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: All of you absolutely do not have what it takes.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean you aren't going to give it your best. You've watched, like, a whole marathon of police TV shows last weekend and you think you've got the formula for justice all figured out. And if there's one thing you've learned about the criminal justice system, it's this: It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong, it just matters how good you can look in front of your boss.<br/><br/>Bad Detectives is a tile-based card game for 3-4 players, which takes approximately 45-60 minutes to play. Players take turns adding information to a network of Polaroid photos and strings, creating a map of the murder investigation. The players will use these strings to connect a Suspect, Weapon, and Crime Scene to the Victim. Once completed, the case is ready to go to trial.<br/><br/>However, solving the murder investigation is simply a means to an end. The true objective of the game is to be the detective with the most Evidence Points when the central case goes to trial. When a player adds a new card to the investigation, Evidence Points are put into play on the card as it is placed. However, these are only counted towards a player's final score if those cards are used to directly link the Victim to the most relevant Leads. To succeed, players will need to undermine the credibility of their colleagues, take creative shortcuts to justice, and put their contributions to the case in the places that matter most.<br/><br/>",

The raging waves consumed the ship and its load, too. Luckily, he escaped and pulled through the storm on a lonely rock. Four sailboats set out after him competing with each other to hurry to his aid.<br/><br/>There is six wind strength discs (which mark the steps), that lay face down at one end of the board. First player turns over any of the wind strength discs and takes as many steps as shown on the disc. After everyone has looked at the disc, he turns it back over immediately. There is two rules:<br/><br/>     The total number of steps on the disc have to be taken.<br/>     You can step forwards or backwards, but only in one direction at a time, you can&rsquo;t change direction while in motion!<br/><br/><br/>If somebody steps on the field where the guard of the lighthouse got shipwrecked, he has to place guard in the boat and continue the trip with him (since the aim is to reach the goal together with him)! If player placed him in the boat, he has to mix the wind strength discs at once, before the next player&rsquo;s turn. This makes the game harder, since the discs memorized so far change their places. The goal is still to arrive on the field where the guard or the ship transporting the guard is standing. According to some rules, the guard can change the boat.<br/><br/>The player who first docks at the isle of the lighthouse with the guard sitting in his or her boat, wins.<br/><br/>",

Pilots raced to their planes from a starting-gun's signal, flew off from a standing start, and then raced at speeds of hundreds of miles an hour, scores of feet above ground. The roar of the aircraft's engines were hardly drowned-out by that of the crowds as they witnessed aerial duels in which planes and pilots were pushed to their limits and sometimes beyond.<br/><br/>September's Eagles is a low level, fun to play game on the Thompson Trophy Air Race of 1929-1939. Players use cards to activate their planes and pilots, and to stymie (Trump) the moves of their opponents. Play is very interactive, intense and true to the history.<br/><br/>The colorful counters represent all of the major aircraft of the period, and pilot cards portray the famous aviators. In more detail, the game includes 36 different planes, from the first race winner (the Travelair R 'Mystery Ship') to the iconic Gee Bee R-1 and Roscoe Turner's 'Gilmore'. Planes are rated for endurance, turning radius, ability to climb or dive and speed. Thirty-three different pilots are represented, including pilots such as Jimmy Doolittle, Steve Wittman and Howard Hughes. Each pilot is rated for his skill level and fatigue. A deck of 54 Action Cards are used by players to move and maneuver their planes as well as rallying their planes and pilots. Players may also play cards on other players to disrupt their game.<br/><br/>Each game of September's Eagles comes with a full color and extensively illustrated Rules of Play booklet. In it is a comprehensive example of play to assist in learning the game. Along with the Rules of Play booklet comes a Racing Program which allows for the gaming of all the Thompson Trophy Races starting with the first in 1929 through to the final one in 1939.<br/><br/>",

Players construct a racing machine from components found in the junk pile and battle down the track to the finish line.<br/><br/>There are four components every racer needs to race: chassis, wheels, steering, and propulsion. There are over 250 racer combinations, so players may customize a racer that fits their style. Each component has its own attributes; some are quick and flimsy, others slow and sturdy. Junk cards may be combined to build contraptions and upgrades. Contraptions are single-use items that affect may damage another racer, speed up a racer, or repair racers quickly. Upgrades are permanent add-ons to a racer which improve its stats.<br/><br/>Once built, the cart moves along the track according to its speed rating. There are five hazard spaces on the board. When players hit a hazard, they interact with it by rolling dice and adding the relevant modifier from their custom racer. Hazards can slow down a racer, stop it temporarily, or damage it.<br/><br/>Each damage dealt to a racer is represented by a token which covers a beneficial stat on the racer. While covered by a damage token, that stat isn't added to the racer. As long as you have a positive net speed, players may move with damage on their carts. Players may repair damage by skipping a move step and removing two damage tokens, then continuing to race on the next round. The first player to pass the finish line wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the popular Japanese TV show Run for Money Tousouchuu (逃走中) contestants take the roles of Runners as they try to avoid capture by the Hunters.  Confined to a predesignated area of play, the Runners earn more money for every second that they avoid the Hunters until the game time expires.  Should a Runner choose to surrender before time is up, they can use a pay phone to exit the game and they will receive money equal to the time until they quit.  However, if a Runner is tagged by a Hunter not only are they eliminated from the competition but they also receive ZERO cash.  To make matters more interesting, the Runners are given missions via their cell phones.  Successfully completing a mission may give the Runners more cash or it may prevent more Hunters from entering play.  From start to finish, Tousouchuu is a game of risk vs reward.<br/><br/>In Tousouchuu THE Board Game, 2-5 players assume the role of Runners as they try to earn the most money possible without being caught by a Hunter.  As Missions come up, the Runners have to decide whether or not they will risk participation or if they'd rather hide to avoid being discovered and eliminated.  But unlike the TV show, Missions have an added bonus: Runners who successfully complete a Mission earn powerful Items that will help them avoid capture by the Hunters.<br/><br/>As the time ticks away and the money adds up, the Hunters continue their patrol.  Once a Runner is spotted by a Hunter, the chase is on!  Escaping the inhumanly fast Hunters will require both luck and endurance.  Run out of either and you will be caught and sent off to Detention.  But even while eliminated, you may find that sometimes even the Hunters are in need of Informants...<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the winner is the Runner with the most earned cash. Will you last until the time line hits zero?  Will you Surrender and walk away with only a portion of the cash?  Or will you get caught by the Hunters and receive absolutely nothing?<br/><br/>Tousouchuu THE Board Game features a double-sided game board and time-line for either a Short Game (for beginners) or Exciting Game (for those wanting a challenge).<br/><br/>",

In each of the three rounds, you configure your basket with two face-up cards; the most common color among all players' cards is the trump suit. Each trick, players either play from their hand, play a sandbag (to sluff, that is avoid winning the trick), or play one of their opponents' face-up cards. During the round, it's possible for the trump to change as the number and kind of face-up cards are exchanged for face-down sandbags. Five rocket cards worth negative points are in play each round, and you want to win these while avoiding the sandbag cards because in the end the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Sandbag is a highly interactive trick-taking game for 3-6 players that excels at higher player counts!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Good Guess is the perfect casual party game for friends and families, for teams and individuals. It&rsquo;s part riddle, part trivia and part just sound logical reasoning.<br/><br/>We love this trivia game because it stimulates more conversation than (dare we say) any game ever!<br/><br/>Clues come one at a time - the first team to guess correctly earns points. Use wild cards to pull a fast one on a leader who thinks they&rsquo;re cruising to victory. With for ways to play ranging from fast-paced to highly collaborative, it&rsquo;s a great addition to any dinner party, getaway, family evening or long car ride.<br/><br/>Our family created this game over 10 years ago after we couldn&rsquo;t find a simple, fun and stimulating game to play in the evenings. We love it because it stimulates conversation, stories and all sorts of goodness that contributes rather than detracts from a great evening. We intentionally made the game play simple. We eliminated the need for game pieces, a game board, die and, of course, complicated instructions that bewilder and frustrate.<br/><br/>The clue cards are loaded with astonishing facts about everyday people, places and things that are certain to entertain. Our rule of thumb was: the clues needed to make the folks playing the game excited about guessing and learning the answer. Did you know, for example, that Harry Houdini died one week after being buried alive?<br/><br/>",

Both levels feature the throwing of two batting dice which result in 15 standard batting outcomes and 6 situational play outcomes.  In addition, the advanced level utilizes 14 different strategy offensive and defensive play cards which are used at the descretion of both managers/players in order to influence the flow of the game.  Also in the in the advanced version, the fielding team manager interacts and intervenes using a single fielding die.  Both versions include the use of a standard baseball scorecard record keeping method.

During each of the seven hands, a different meld is required, starting with two sets for the first hand and working its way up to three runs for the last hand.

Cards left in others' hands count as penalties (of 5 to 30 points each).<br/><br/>The rules also discuss drawing discarded cards out of turn, using Shoot the Moon and Go Chicken cards, and the bonus tokens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Christian based game for married and unmarried couples to encourage communication and strengthen relationships.<br/>The game consists of a board, dice, pawns, and question cards. The cards are in five categories; God, Self, Each Other, Others, and Becoming One. The questions explore a wide range of subjects including jobs, friends, entertainment, God, church, and more intimate themes. Some of the questions are dated to the seventies but most are still relevant today. It can be played with two couples but can get quite personal so you don't want to play with just anyone. There is a defined end to the game but there are no losers.<br/>This is a great game for engaged couples and newlyweds to learn more about their partners, and build a strong relationship.<br/><br/>",

In End Rush each player seeks to capture the board's center space. Some solitaire puzzles are also included. Cylindrical wood playing pieces have felt on one side to indicate their status.

In addition there are seven yellow pieces representing treasure to be captured.<br/><br/>The board is a hexagon of hexagons (think Settlers, but it's not geomorphic).  Each edge of the entire hexagon is made up of six smaller hexagons.  These are in three colors: red, blue, and yellow, such that no two hexes of the same color border each other.  Two of the corners have castles printed in them.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving one piece at a time.  Each of the pieces moves and captures differently.  Basic chess-like rules apply: one piece per space, you can't move through a piece (though there are some knight-like pieces that can jump), land on a piece to capture it, promotion of the lesser pieces if the reach the opposite side, etc.<br/><br/>There are five different victory conditions given in the rules.  Players must decide on victory conditions before beginning the game.  They can be combined, such as &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (capture the opponent's sorcerer) and &quot;Castle Occupation&quot; (just what you think it means).  The treasure pieces aren't used unless one or both of the treasure victory conditions are in play.<br/><br/>That's basically it.  The pieces are rather bland, but the board is a must for abstract game designers who think in primary colors ...<br/><br/>",

Sometimes you will only experience different sights and sounds of the Haunting. Maybe you will feel a chill or smell something unfamiliar. The Mystery of the Haunting can only be solved according to The Legend, and The Legend reveals that only one Spook is doing the Haunting in a specific Room. It will be your brave task to explore your way through the house with your friends while playing cards and asking questions until you know the 3 card Haunting Mystery sealed in the Book of Spells. Be careful, you're only allowed to look in the Book of Spells once, if your answer is correct you win, if you're wrong you might be turned into a toad!<br/><br/>This is a fascinating game that can be enjoyed by everyone including children as young as 8 years old. The game involves a special patented process of card presentation that lets all players participate on every turn and creates the excitement of a race where all players are close to solving the Haunting Mystery near the end of the game. All players will take a slightly different path through the Haunted House, and even though all players have some shared information, your path will unfold in a unique way. There are 546 different Haunting Mysteries and an unlimited number of ways to move through the house, so it is unlikely you will ever play the same game twice.<br/><br/>",

The launching of the reconstructed trireme Olympias has also provided a great deal of information on the performance of ancient oared warships. These rules are intended to provide a detailed, yet playable, re-enactment of ancient naval warfare based on the latest data.<br/><br/>They are primarily intended for 1/1200 scale ship models, from small engagements to large ship actions.<br/><br/>The time period covered by the rules represents a singularly large sweep of history from approximately 3000 BC to 600 AD. In terms of ship types, the rules cater for the earliest paddled ships of the Mediterranean through to the small galleys of the Later Roman Empire. It is the period of the development, supremacy, and decline of the ram equipped galley.<br/><br/>NAUMACHIAE (pl.) is the Latin name used by the Romans for the 'sea battles' that various emperors staged at their games. The arena would be flooded and several galleys brought in to fight each other - for the amusement of the crowd.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This fun little game comes in a plastic box that doubles as the playing field. The field features 36 squares. There are 32 &quot;cubes&quot; (i.e. dice) used in the game. The dice feature directionals on five sides and the word &quot;Cubit&quot; on the sixth side. At the start of the game, the cubes are randomly placed on the field, with the four corners left empty. From the instructions: A cube may jump only in the direction (or one of the directions) indicated on its upturned face. However, when the word &quot;Cubit&quot; appears on the upturned face, that cube may jump in any direction, except diagonally, which is never allowed.<br/><br/>In the two-person game, each player removes as many cubes as possible as long as he can make a jump with the same cube. The player who has jumped the most cubes at the end of the game, when no more moves are possible, is the winner. In the solitaire version, the win occurs when only one cube remains on the board, and it has &quot;Cubit&quot; on its upturned face.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A self-published game that shares components with Dail Eireann, with both games being themed to Irish politics.<br/><br/>From the review by Stuart Dagger in Sumo Magazine:<br/><br/>Each player is a presidential candidate, with a playing piece that moves around the map picking up votes. Movement is by die roll. My first reaction when we started to play was that there was really nothing much to the game, but by the time we were a third of the way through, everyone was clearly having to think, I was enjoying myself and my opinion had been changed.<br/><br/>Three constituency cards are dealt face up by the board. The first candidate to visit the constituency collects the card and replaces it with another one from the deck. The object is to collect as many cards as you can and eventually an overall majority. Very much at the ``6 and up level so far. The fun again comes with the markers. When you collect a card you place one of your markers in the constituency, and on a turn when you fail to pick up a card you place one in a constituency of your choice. The effect of these is to slow down the movement of your rivals. The basic cost to move from one constituency to the next is one point from the die roll, but if you are trying to move into a constituency where some other player has more markers than you, you increase the cost by the number of markers you are behind the constituency leader.<br/><br/>So what starts as a level field soon develops some very adverse gradients, and regional fiefdoms begin to appear. If this were the only effect the markers had, the game would still be fairly straightforward, but it isn't. Once again, this is an Irish election, and a simple majority is not enough to become president; you need an overall one. So after all the cards have been picked up and a pecking order established on the first count, votes start being transferred. When a candidate is eliminated, the votes they had switch over on a constituency by constituency basis, going to whichever still active candidate has most markers in the constituency. The effect of this is that in the later stages of the game proper you have to start making choices. Do you place markers so as to impede your rivals, or do you start planning for the count? And if the latter, whose switches do you aim for? What looked easy at the start isn't any longer.<br/><br/>",

Game one is Hangman using a historical name as a puzzle. Game two tests how well one knows the other players. Game three has the player trying to guess what noise another player is trying to make. Game four is true-false quiz. Game five challenges the players to guess the prices of merchandise. The sixth space gets its entire deck. This deck gives the lucky player who landed on it money.<br/><br/>Which game is played is determined by rolling a die and moving one&rsquo;s pawn on the gameboard. When all of the first five decks or all of the sixth deck is spent the players move onto the Grand Prize game. Anyone who can draw randomly all six parts of the picture of the automobile before drawing all three strikes is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>The game is based on the long-running television series.

The Comic Book Ad claims the game was dedicated to the &quot;Fighting Heroes&quot; of the Battle of Chickamauga,where &quot;34,400 troops were killed or wounded.&quot;   Cannon Ball seems to have included 64 3D Toy Soldiers representing Blue &amp; Grey Civil War Troops; as well as a Playmat and multiple Accessories such as &quot;Exploding Bridges&quot; (these were small hard plastic pieces which were triggered by rubber band tension, similar to the Tank Trap War Game's &quot;Exploding Tanks.&quot;) The Troops of Cannon Ball were evidently made by GIANT in Hong Kong. However, it has also been suggested that some versions of the Game featured generic/non-brand-name Troops clearly made with the same GIANT molds but not stamped with the GIANT logo. <br/><br/><br/>",

The next stop was Orel. Then Tula and finally, Moscow! Its 25,000 well trained soldiers were equal in training to a British infantry division were opposed by the Bolshevik 13th and 14th Armies. A collection of polyglot men with dubious training and questionable morale. Some 60,000 of them. Time was running out as the Fall weather set in, both sides knew it. Lenin and Trotsky began the ultimate propaganda campaign to stir the emotions of the peasant workers. Free food and clothing was the lure to fight. Thousands enlisted. For Denikin, he instinctively knew time was short for a variety of reasons and thus launched the, &quot;To Moscow&quot; offensive on Oct 6th. The White player will also feel the pressure of time. The Red player will toss anything and everything to delay and play for time! <br/>200 Miles covers this epic offensive in a unique game design capturing the essence of the battle and the differences between the forces. Use of supply and command is important. The technological edge of the White forces is fragile, yet potent, if it can be harnessed. Cavalry remains the fast moving forces for both sides.<br/><br/>200 Miles contains 280 counters, one 11x17&quot; beautiful map, and rulebook. The game scale is 4-5 miles a hex, aircraft counters = 4-6 aircraft, tank units = two tanks, infantry regiments and brigades. Units include: MkV, Whippet tanks, DH9A Bombers, Re 8 Fighters, Armor Trains, Artillery, Armor Cars, Cavalry, Machine Guns, Engineers, Headquarters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brain Chain is a trivia game with a twist.  2-3 teams compete to answer questions- when correct, the team places a &quot;link&quot; of its color (red, green or blue) on the corresponding space of the large 10X10 grid that makes up the playing board.  To win, a team must get six &quot;links&quot; in a row- horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br/><br/>The twist is that all teams move the same yellow marker around the edges of the board through the use of movement cards and &quot;brain pills&quot; (bonus cards gotten by answering questions correctly).  A team can ONLY attempt to answer a trivia question on a square that is in the same row or column as the yellow marker.  However, the yellow marker itself can be used to complete a row of six for the win!<br/><br/>The four corner spaces that have special powers: remove an opponent's token, place a free token, move any token, or attempt to answer a question on any square.<br/><br/>The trivia categories are: Business, Entertainment, Geography, History, Sports, Science, Potluck, and Oddball (you must figure out what trait 3 of the 4 items listed share in common).<br/><br/>It's Trivial Pursuit with a Go-Moku win mechanic and a dash of Pueblo added in.<br/><br/>Available at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.brainchaingames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.brainchaingames.com</a><br/><br/>",

Geometric progression refers to the way you get double the points for throwing 4 of a kind as you do for throwing 3 of a kind and so on to 6 of a kind.<br/><br/>You play to 10,000 points, hence the name, but the first one there does not necessarily win. The time it takes to play is about ten minutes per player. Even the very young can play &ndash; with a little help. You score points by throwing 100&rsquo;s, 50&rsquo;s, or 3 or more of a kind of anything. Every game is different and fun because the dice thrower must decide whether to continue to try for more points at greater risk.<br/><br/>The game comes with 6 custom dice, rules, a points card, velour carrying pouch and packaged in a beautifully embossed TEN GRAND box.<br/><br/>This game is similar to Dice 10,000 and Farkle. It originated in the 1930s (Hugo Kastner: Die gro&szlig;e Humboldt Enzyklop&auml;die der W&uuml;rfelspiele. Humboldt 2007, pp. 205-208).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game supposedly reminiscent of Viking games of old, this game was first available in museums with the &quot;Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga&quot; traveling exhibit.<br/><br/>From the publisher's web site (edited):<br/><br/>Pillage &amp; Plunder are two Viking brothers roaming the High seas in their Longship looking for fame and adventure. Pillage &amp; Plunder is a game of luck and skill. Players take turns loading barrels onto the deck of the Longship.<br/><br/>Be careful! Keep the load balanced or you will dump all of the hard won treasure right into the Sea. Play Pillage &amp; Plunder alone as a skill toy and see how many barrels you can fit on deck. The movable men and thousands of barrel positions will provide hours of entertainment for yourself or a group of friends.<br/><br/>Pillage &amp; Plunder is a fun toy and game for the whole family. Easy set up and rules make it an instant hit with young and old alike.<br/><br/>Viking children played with many types of toys that we would recognize today. Lifelike toys such as dolls, toy animals and especially wooden toy boats, were extremely popular with children in Scandinavian lands during the time of the Vikings.<br/><br/>Natural materials like wood were the obvious choice when it <br/>came to making toys in those legendary days and Acorn Games strives to keep that spirit alive today. Each Pillage &amp; Plunder game is made out of solid wood and stained in natural, earthy tones to evoke the warmth of the early toy makers and to give you years of pleasure and a game that you can pass along to future generations of game players.<br/><br/>Each Pillage &amp; Plunder Game comes with:<br/><br/>* Decorated wooden Dragon Longship<br/>    * Wooden Pillage and Plunder pieces<br/>    * 18 hardwood &quot;Treasure&quot; barrels<br/>    * 1 color coded wood playing die<br/>    * playing instructions parchment<br/>    * felt lined box with clear-vu lid<br/><br/>",

        "description": "General Glen's Combat Rules for Toy Soldiers is the set of rules you need to get your dusty old toy soldiers out of storage. Whether you play in 54mm scale with exquisitely detailed soldiers, or with small 20-28mm plastic soldiers, you'll find these rules bring the focus of WWII skirmishes back to what it should be: detailed yet fast paced, balanced yet fun.<br/><br/>The scope of these rules pretty much allows a maximum of a platoon per side for a 4-6 hour game, with maybe a dozen per side for a 3-4 hour game. For us, this means we can run the games in our big 54mm size, because we don't have that many minitatures to bring with us - only about 30-50 soldiers per side, if you include all the different poses - standing , kneeling, prone.<br/><br/>Our rules encourage the use of actual postures of your miniatures, so that line of sight and actual cover are used to determine whether a toy soldier can &quot;see&quot; another. The exclusive use of a d12 for all die rolling has caused us to dub our game the &quot;d12 system&quot;, long before those other guys came out with their &quot;d20 system&quot;.<br/><br/>",

If you are familiar with the storybook character, Corduroy, than you know the cute bear sketch that I am referencing. In addition to the bears, there are party hats, cakes and presents. The floor tiles assist toward shape and color recognition. I enjoy observing which/how many children count the candles on the cake(s) (there are five). And because there is a connection, via the character, to books... it is my belief that this game inspires reading...this set is best suited, for day care, preschool or kindergarten aged children.  It would be great in the classroom; especially with the storybook, as a compliment.<br/><br/>Out of the 10 activity games 3 are non-competitive while the other 7 are competitive in which case the winner receives prize tokens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Crawl into the skin of a Mesoptamian ruler during the age of the great Hammurabi of Babylon. Relive how kings managed to secure their power and gain the respect of their tribes. The construction of temples and canals, agricultural development and military victories can all spread your fame and secure your rule. Make constant decisions on how best to govern your land: rely on the rule of law and the gentle persuading powers of the Ishtar priestesses and strife for a blossoming agricultural system, or turn to the fanaticism of the Marduk priests and the battle strength of their troops. However you choose to exert your rule - you can only win the game if your rule is so successful that your fame, in the eyes of your subjects, has acquired a god-like status, making you the undisputed ruler of Mesopotamia.&quot;<br/><br/>This is the first game from Hilmar M&ouml;hlmann and has undergone several years of development. Its final version was made available to the gaming community through his website and ebay. Having acquired a copy it is obvious that this is a labor of love. The design of board and cards is beautiful - the rules are well tested, clearly presented and relatively short for such a ambitious game. Ongoing support for players is in place through website updates and direct communication. And having just acquired my copy, I wonder if the price asked actually covers the materials provided. An impressive entry for this budding designer and a one to seek out for players who enjoy games like &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; but yearn for something a bit meatier and with a stronger theme. With an Arthurian themed game in the pipeline, this one-man act might be an interesting one to follow.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to have the most military units and construction works of your color on the board. This can be done over 2 to 5 rounds. Resources can be acquired through natural growth, trade and military conquests. Trade takes place along caravan routes. Players can trade freely with their trading partner, pay toll to players whose territory is crossed en-route, or exchange resources against a set course with the bank. These resources can then be used to generate new buildings or units. Each turn a player can use an influence card, adding flavor and variety without unbalancing strategic play. A nice twist is that players who allow toll-free trading between other players if the caravan route passes their territory see a generous windfall from the opening of this trade route in the next round, when some resources are added to the storage in that province. Each year round ends with construction and military campaigns. Conflicts are settled by dice rolls which are modified by markers on the board.<br/><br/>This game appeared in 2 versions:<br/><br/>The self-published &quot;2D&quot; version (quality is at the very high end of desktop publishing).<br/>Some assembly is required, mainly joining the 8 pages that from the superbly produced full colour game board. In total you get 39 multicolour A4 sheets, including several photo-quality prints, six pages of clear and well presented rules, and lots of event cards, markers and game aids.<br/><br/>The wooden case with the handmade &quot;3D&quot; version of the game board is fit for a king, and for those with a rather large game budget.<br/><br/>",

When it's your turn, lay down cards in  your hand that make sets (3 or more of the same value) or runs (3 in a row of the same color) or play cards on another player's piles to get rid of your cards faster.  For those who really like to explore all their possibilities, transport cards from other piles to combine with new cards, and make new piles.  Just remember, each pile must always have at least three cards.  The possibilities are out of this world!<br/><br/>The Action Cards make INFINITY even more fun.  Give every one of your opponents three extra cards when you play the Re-Fuel card.  Get new cards to replace the ones in your hand with the Re-Entry Card.  Or play the Countdown Card to force someone to make a play and gain control of the board.  Don't wait for your turn, either, play any of these any time you want!<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a team of bellhops in the hotel and attempts to earn the most tips by helping the guests off of the elevator and with their luggage as they arrive in the lobby.<br/><br/>You can backstab your friends' bellhops and reduce his/her tips by stopping their elevator. Be careful, though, as you might not be able to get your guests to the lobby without help! The player who has received the most tips at the end of the game wins. Maximize your points by collecting guests of all types. Try to get a bonus by helping the most guests of any one type.<br/><br/>Bellhop plays with 2-5 players and lasts between 45 and 60 minutes.

Stories are told day and night of the many adventure the great wizard has had over the years, defeating dragons, tricking demon princes and battle foul necromancers. Yes the stories and song offered by the city&rsquo;s many bards about the mages' exploits have turned him into quite the local hero.<br/><br/>The Arch Mages' days of travel though, are long over, for he now sits alone in his great tower of white stone, working on magical treaties and concocting strange magical brews. Few can say they have seen the great mage leave his tower, and fewer still can say that they have even met him. There are stories of course, stories that he is dead, that his tower lies empty of guardians, waiting for the brave thief to enter and take his vast treasures and magical toys.<br/><br/>Dark Dungeon 4, Tower of Magic is the newest adventure for the Dark Dungeon solo game system.

The sumptous graphics for both the map and the counters make this one a joy for the eyes.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 8.5&quot; by 11&quot; map <br/>64 counters <br/>Rulebook<br/>Charts<br/><br/>Released as Print-n-Play in June 2007.<br/><br/>",

Each round, both players draw eight cards. They may then discard up to four cards and draw replacements. After that, they calculate the score for their hand. The player with the highest score wins the round. After that, all cards are discarded, and a new round is started.<br/><br/>Cards are divided in four basic types: Strategy, Tactics, Resources and Morale. Each of these cards has a value between 3 and 10. When scoring, a player may take two cards from each category and add their values together. Two special types are present: Leader cards, who can be counted as any of the basic types, and Disadvantage cards, which lower a players's score.<br/><br/>The first player who wins three consecutive rounds wins the game. If neither players has won by the end of the eight round, the player who wins the eight round wins the game.<br/><br/>Available for free download (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.webalice.it/alecrespi/warpspawn/FreeGames/GallicWars.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.webalice.it/alecrespi/warpspawn/FreeGames/GallicW...</a>).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>&quot;By the year 2750, the 150 year old galaxy-wide war had escalated to the point where casualties were measured in millions per day.  Entire populations were wiped out and planets made uninhabitable by the fallout of warfare.  Faced with annihilation, both sides (the United Democratic Planets or UDP and the Republic of Soviet-Socialist Planets or RSSP)developed an alternative method of waging war.  Their solution was the Omega Suit.<br/><br/>&quot;The Omega Suit represents the ultimate development of military technology.  Each suit stands over 7' tall and is manned by a genetically superior soldier called an Omega Warrior.  The Omega Suit is a fully enclosed system which enhances strength, reflexes and senses of its wearer.  Omega Suits can withstand tremendous amounts of damage and can carry enough firepower to lay waste to an entire division of conventional armored vehicles.  Instead of sending tens of thousands of infantry to fight a battle, the same goal can be accomplished with a handful of Omega Warriors.<br/><br/>&quot;Now, in the year 3000 AD, the war continues.  Big armies, while maintained by the larger factions involved in the war, are seldom used.  Most battles are fought by the Omega Warriors and where they go the ground trembles and the skies burn, for no target is out of their reach.<br/><br/>&quot;Omega Warrior is a miniature rules set for creating the battles of the future using 6mm-28mm figures.

Several times during the period from 1833 to 1876 the Carlists &mdash; followers of Infante Carlos (later Carlos V) and his descendants &mdash; rallied to the cry of &quot;God, Country, and King&quot; and fought for the cause of Spanish tradition (Legitimism and Catholicism) against the liberalism, and later the republicanism, of the Spanish governments of the day.<br/><br/>Dios Patria Rey uses a beefed up and revised Libertadores system (Soldados y Estrategia n. 10) to simulate eight of the most decisive battles of this war: Arquijas, Luchana, Oriamendi, Barbastro, Maella and the 1st and 2nd battles of Perecamps.<br/><br/>The game features the several foreign units which fought in Spain in 1833-40 including the British, Portuguese and Belgian legions and the French Foreign Legion. There were also French, Prussian Austrian and Russian Absolutist fighting on the Carlist side. In fact, the Carlist pretendant died in exile in the Austrian Empire. He is buried in a church at Trieste, now in Northern Italy.<br/><br/>",

Combat is based on a single d10 combat chart and bombardment chart with die modifications for terrain and odds. The game looks similar to SPI's old Blue and Grey Quad Series.  The Federals try to cut off the escape of the Confederates as the Rebs victory conditions are based on leaving the board after inflicting some losses on the Federals.<br/><br/>",

You may begin at the foot of any column with a hand of 4 storm trooper cards.<br/><br/>Each turn, after you draw 1 card, your squad advances to any adjacent space and if in range of an enemy first they attack and then you have an opportunity to attack them. Enemies range in strength of 1 to 16 men. Pennies, tokens, or scrap paper should be used to keep track of men. Some battles may last over several turns or you may want to leave some battles unfinished until you get the cards and the confidence to return to them.<br/><br/>To play the game with 2 players (or more), field two squads of storm troopers playing cooperatively, but competing to be the first to capture an enemy HQ space (say, one of the &quot;blockhouse&quot; cards) agreed upon by the players before beginning the game.<br/><br/>",

The cards depict elements of the historical campaign.<br/><br/>The players attempt to play the highest ranking card combination each hand. &quot;Victory: The German Player must win 3 Hands in a row (Ignore Ties) to win. If the German player has not accomplished this by turn 10 the Soviet player wins.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game consists of two players or managers moving the player figures and the ball on the game board using dice. The player who has scored more goals by the end of the game wins. The game is designed to serve the skilled and strategic mind - but just as in real football, luck can always bring an unexpected challenge!<br/><br/>The Basic Rules make it easy and fun to get into the game. Later the managers may choose to follow the Extended Rules. The extended rules will add more realistic football features to the game turning it more challenging. The extended rules contain special situations such as goal kick, corner kick, throw-in, free kicks and penalty kick.&quot;<br/><br/>Re-implements<br/><br/>    Die wilden Fussballkerle: Das dampfhammerharte Fussball-Spiel<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented in:<br/><br/>    Soccero (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Polemos - American Civil War<br/>    <br/>The American Civil War was fought between two fledgling armies with little experience, over a vast area and with little knowledge of the technologies that would be brought to bear over the course of the war.<br/><br/>Inexperienced armies and generals, state driven mobilization and a belief that with one battle it would be over added, to the mixed and muddled beginning to the war. However with the emerging use of mass production for weapons, ammunition and supply there were some compelling reasons why this would not be so. With both the Union and Confederate governments aiming to mobilize, train and arm the volunteers and militias to the field within a few months gives us the opportunity to re-construct battles that were, in the main, very unpredictable.<br/><br/>This mixture of inexperience and technology would directly affect the course and length of the war. Both forces involved were made up of Regulars, Volunteers, and Militias that varied in size, experience and term of service. The protagonists also relied on conscription to add more troops to their armies as the war progressed and the volunteers began to dry up.<br/><br/>With Polemos, American Civil War (ACW), the opportunity to produce two sets of rules in one book is irresistible. This set of rules will allow the war gamer to re-fight the larger battles of the period such as: Lee versus Meade at Gettysburg or Bragg versus Rosecrans at Chickamauga fighting with armies of well over 50,000 men each.<br/><br/>The other allows the war gamer to fight Division or Corps sized actions and re-create smaller engagements within larger battles like Breckinridge&rsquo;s final assault on the high ground at the Battle of Stones River (Murfreesboro) in January 1863, or the battle that lost Arkansas to the Confederates, Prairie Grove in 1862.<br/><br/>Polemos ACW is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, On They Came will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Crisis of Allegiance will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period.<br/><br/>The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal - only the nominal scale will differ.<br/><br/>Polemos ACW aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Basing and Representation:<br/>The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos ACW is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position and number of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.<br/><br/>A 60mm x 30mm base of infantry represents an infantry regiment - about 300-500 men. <br/>A 60mm x 30mm base of cavalry represents a regiment of 300-500 men and horses.<br/>A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents two batteries each of 4 to 6 guns.<br/>A 30mm x 30mm Officer base is use for Generals, Corps and Divisional commanders<br/><br/>In Crisis of Allegiance, 60mm square bases are used. These can be formed by using two OTC bases, butted up one behind the other or a single larger base which allows a more creative and dioramic approach.<br/><br/>A 60mm square base of infantry represents an infantry formation of between 1200 and 2000 men. This may represent a brigade or division, depending on the size of the army being modeled.<br/>A 60mm square base of cavalry represents between 1200 and 2000 men. This may represent a brigade or division. <br/>A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents 16 to 24 guns,<br/><br/>All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.<br/>This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organised on this basis.<br/><br/>",

I can assure them, it is much, much more important than that.&quot;  -  Bill Shankly<br/><br/>In The League players take turns playing cards to attempt to build up an attack culminating in a shot on the opponent's goal or to foil that attack with a well placed tackle or save.  The two-player game pits the players head to head where the 4-player game has two players per team working as a partnership.  Each player starts with 7 cards, replacing cards played with cards from the deck and the game comes to an end after one run through the deck.<br/><br/>The cards are divided into attacking cards eg. Pass, Dribble, Shoot, defending cards eg. Tackle, Save, referee cards, eg. Offside, Penalty, and wonder cards, eg. Wonder Goal, Wonder Save.  The side with possession aims to build up a series of attacking cards leading to a shot thundering past the opponent's keeper, the defending side tries to get possession with a tackle or to get the keeper on the end of the shot with a save card.  Tackles have the risk of being countered by a referee dishing out a yellow or a red card or even a penalty which can only be saved by a Wonder Save.<br/><br/>The game plays in under half an hour and makes for a good filler especially with football fans.<br/><br/>",

The attack was the Australian army&rsquo;s first division level operation in WW2 North Africa.<br/><br/>The player takes on the role of Australian Major General Mackay while the game&rsquo;s system of priorities guides the player in controlling the individual Italian units under General Bergonzoli&rsquo;s command in a manner designed to appropriately reflect the locally focused nature of the Italian defense.<br/><br/>",

Murray's book &quot;A History of Chess&quot; on pages 133-134.  He writes:<br/><br/>There are also enlarged games of chess in China.  One of these is the San-kwo-k'i, or Game of the Three Kingdoms, which is described by v. M&ouml;llen-dorf.  It is supposed to illustrate the war of the Three Kindoms, wei (blue), Shu (red), and Wu (green), A.D. 221-64.  I give a diagram of the board; it will be noticed that the lines are not straight throughout, and that each kingdom faces the other two.  The pieces consist of the usual 16 with, in addition, 2 new pieces [F] in each of the three armies.  These are called: Red, Chuo (fire); Blue , Ch'i (banner); Green, Feng (wind).  Their move is an extended Kt's leap, viz. two steps vertically or horizontally and then one diagonally.  The game is said to be very complicated and difficult, but is not considered as interesting as the ordinary chess.  When one of the Generals, who are named Wei, Shu, and Wu after the names of the three kingdoms, is mated, the player who has mated him removes the King from the board and adds the remainder of his army to his own.<br/><br/>The diagram he mentions can be found in the images section of this games entry page.<br/><br/>",

In fact, it contains the same game board, but instead of dice there are building bricks in different sizes, rubber bands and wooden balls. <br/>The original game contains a rule sheet with three games and the encouragement to invent more (much like in &quot;Spiel&quot;, for which way over 100 game ideas were submitted by players, about 50 of which were published in a rule booklet).<br/>The game rules supplied include:<br/>- &quot;Das Nest&quot;: Two players place their bricks on the game board, trying to build &quot;nests&quot; (holes which only consist of their own color). Then they can put an &quot;egg&quot; (wooden ball) into the nest. The player who placed most eggs at the end of the game, wins.<br/><br/>- &quot;Balance&quot;: The game board is placed upright, with one brick under it in one corner. Another brick is placed on top of that corner. All players then take turn placing bricks into the other side of the base, trying to make it topple. The first player to suspect an imbalance can lift the brick on top of the corner. If the board topples, that player wins.<br/><br/>- &quot;Die h&auml;ngenden G&auml;rten der Semiramis&quot;: The game board is turned over. Two rubber bands are stretched over the bottom, then bricks are piled up by the players. Whoever topples the fragile construction, loses.<br/><br/>",

It's for adults, teens, and older children.<br/><br/>There are two teams, one at each end of the table. Play consists of rolling steel balls down steerable chutes across a field into target balls to knock those target balls into the other team's goal area, behind the raised barrier.

However the game was first published in Świat Młodych (Youths' World) - #84/1985. The intro and the rules were exactly the same, only graphics were different.<br/><br/>The mechanics of Bestia resemble popular Battleships in it's basic, being a paper and pencil guessing game played on sets of the same diagrams but that's where the similarities end.<br/><br/>In Bestia one of the player assumes the role of the Beast - the master of a group of mosters lurking in the depths of a dark dungeon.<br/><br/>The other player (or players) lead a small band of adventurers who seek to destroy the monsters and escape the dungeons with their treasures.<br/><br/>Before the actual game all players secretly deploy they units (the mosters and treasure hoards/adventurers). Players in turns try to find and destroy monsters/adventurers, throwing spells and using weapons.<br/><br/>",

The NVA B3 Front had an audacious plan to split South Vietnam in two with a strike through the central highlands, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the intervention of America&rsquo;s latest formation in airmobile warfare they could have very well succeeded. The Campaign had many varying types of force engagement; sieges, ambushes, running battles and whole unit encirclements. <br/>The simulation is meant to reflect the uncertainties in jungle fighting and the rapidly changing situations involved with airmobile operations.<br/><br/>",

Resources and Engines are new to the mix.  Research the latest locomotive designs to reach deposits of iron ore or carry grain and lumber to build your empire in the Great White North!<br/><br/>Three maps are included with this expansion.  Eastern Canada will have you building routes out from Toronto and choosing to cross the border or building west to Thunder Bay for precious iron deposits.  If you are looking for a challenge, try the Denver and Rio Grande map - the distance between destinations is great and the terrain is difficult.  For a more relaxed railroad experience, try your skill at Ireland where you can build ports and bring in goods from other countries.  Build your rails across the island to victory! <br/>In addition to downloading and printing the PDF's, you will need 27 Event Cards from the original Bindle Rails game as well as most of the cubes.  If you need to print out cards for the expansion, please refer to the main game page to direct you to the PDF that will allow you to print the cards.  The Goal Cards and Manager cards are not used in this variant.  Mats are included for tracking your company worth, resource values and engine roster.<br/><br/>Future versions will include upgrades for artwork to mats and rule changes if required.<br/><br/>",

What also adds to the fun is the deteriorating turn sequence. Play commences with the turns switching regularly between both sides, but as the battle develops and armies become fully engaged, the turn sequence becomes more and more fickle.<br/><br/>As players would expect, the rules contain details of a large array of weapons, armour and equipment as well as extensive vehicle data and vehicle construction rules. Also included is wide-ranging background material that details the main warring factions and the cities and terrain that they fight over.<br/><br/>OVERKILL<br/>also features a large section on campaign games which deal with army progression, promotion, recruitment, training and experience as well as details on trading, currency, intelligence gathering, propaganda, infiltrating, hiring mercenaries and executions! In addition to this OVERKILL also includes complete rules for solo gaming and seven scenarios for solo games.<br/><br/>At heart, OVERKILL is a fast, simple and exciting rule system backed up by high levels of detail that allows players to expand the game in different and interesting directions. The rules require the clever use of weapons and tactics, command and strategy - and a bit of luck. Victory will go to the skilful player - not just the one with the biggest guns - although there are plenty of them in OVERKILL!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;OSTSEET&Ouml;RN&quot; is an entertaining and exciting boardgame for the whole sailing family in the western part of baltic sea between Denmark, Germany and Sweden. &quot;Non-sailers&quot; will soon be using the same sailers terms as their sailing players. It gives an insight into the eventful life of sailors. The player who plays tactically with his itinerary plans and exploits the ever-changing winds skillfully  has big chances to be the first to regain the home port. The game is also playable in a &quot;race-variant&quot;.<br/><br/>Each player receives a yacht, two spinnakers cards and a number of port cards, which depends on the number of game participants. Pulled Harbor charts indicate which ports must be visited in each case. If you want to shorten or lengthen the playing time, one can agree on a larger or smaller number of port cards per person. The &quot;race-variant&quot; is played with only 1 set of port cards, which is valid for all players.<br/><br/>Publiced for Verlaghaus Die Barque<br/><br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, being somewhat shy of means (i.e., broke), you are unable to afford the more reputable establishments. Acting on Kaka&rsquo;s dubious suggestion, you<br/>head out to the edge of town to a place your mother told you never to go: the old, abandoned tower built by that nutcase, K&rsquo;Dak. K&rsquo;Dak was a washout from pyramid building school. He just could never get the pyramid concept straight. Big on the bottom and small on top. How is this hard? Anyway, his attempt at building a small summer<br/>pyramid for the pharaoh ended up as a six-story, straight up and down tower. The pharaoh was not amused and K&rsquo;Dak was banished from the community in disgrace. That should have been the end of it, but K&rsquo;Dak had in mind one last futile gesture before he left. He returned to the tower, hid small amounts of gold throughout the structure and then set up a booby trap for anyone who tried to retrieve the gold. However, before he could spread a story of a fabulous treasure residing in his tower, he was run out of town by the authorities and never seen again. The pharaoh intended to condemn the place for demolition, but got distracted with a border war and K&rsquo;Dak&rsquo;s tower was largely<br/>forgotten. And now, you and Kaka are heading to this questionable monument on the outside chance that there is something inside that you can barter for a camel makeover.<br/><br/>K&rsquo;Dak&rsquo;s Tower of Confusion and Camel Wash is a game of exploration. You and your opponent climb through an abandoned tower hoping to collect enough treasure in order to pay for a bath for Phredd. Things go just fine until one of you reaches the top layer, at which time the tower starts shaking itself apart. You then have to get out before the whole structure collapses on you while still finding enough treasure to make the expedition worthwhile.<br/><br/>",

Only 6 sided dice are needed.  46 pages plus 1 quick sheet.<br/><br/>The &quot;square bashing&quot; system, as it has been named, is a departure from normal miniature systems in that it imposes a seven by five square grid over the battlefield. This grid affects movement and combat - doing away with tedious millimeter measurements and allows the player to focus on maneuvering his units and rolling the dice. Squares can be either open (no impediment to movement) or closed (terrain impedes movement).<br/><br/>Equipment needed for the game:<br/><br/>     A Table (7' x 5') marked out in a 1 foot grid.<br/>     Some pieces of terrain.<br/>     An army for each player. Most armies will have ~22 units and 2 generals. Normally, a unit consists of 4 bases, except Character, Artillery, Chariot, Monster consist of 1 base only.<br/>     About 15 Dice (Ordinary 6 sided dice)<br/>     Some dead body models to represent casualties for the purpose of morale tests.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Designer: Two teams of Dwarves battle it out for control of areas. Players can use special cards that invoke the ability of the gods to attempt to gain the upper hand, but be warned! Each team has a limited supply of troops and once that supply is gone you will have no more reinforcements.<br/><br/>Players will engage each other in skirmish like battles to gain control over 6-7 locations. Locations are worth additional points if controlled by it's matching teams, thus the players must strategically place their units and decide when and where to attack.<br/><br/>To add variety there are are 30+ community cards which each player draws from to attempt to gain an advantage.<br/><br/>During the 8 rounds of the game players will place their units, use power ups, and attack each other. Movement of the units once placed is very limited so it is important to place the units in regard to where the player wants them to end up.<br/><br/>The game comes with 54 cards, instructions, and 2 dice. The game has been designed so that it is not required to reshuffle the cards except between games, ensuring that downtime is at a minimum.<br/><br/>",

Repeated tragedies at the Acadamy have made people aware that the legend of the existence of the 'Witch of the Acadamy' may indeed be true.<br/><br/>To get rid of the witch, 5 members of academy start the research about the  legend of the Witch.<br/><br/>The aim of the members of this group  is to find and to get rid of the witch.<br/><br/>By the way, the legend also says that the witch can transform into whomever the witch has killed.<br/><br/>This means there is always a question about,  if one of the research members is already a witch.<br/>  <br/>Humans have their own magic which is different from magic users from far beyond the beginning of the academy. This magic is called &quot;information&quot;...<br/><br/>The frightful magic of the 'Witch of the Academy' can celebrate the murderer as a saint, and can execute a bonny innocent  girl as a witch.<br/><br/>About this game<br/><br/>You become one of the 5 possible characters, and by gathering information about the witch, you try to contribute to the research and to become the most reliable character.<br/><br/>Also you must pay attention to the possibilities that one of the members is actually a witch, you may point out a member as a witch.<br/><br/>(In this game, you must discard a field card and take a field card.)<br/><br/>Discarded character card gives you information, while you point out a character as a witch by taking cards.<br/><br/><br/>To tell the truth, there may be no witch amongst the members of the group. However, a character who is pointed out as being the witch may lose the trust of the rest of the players in the game and  may be executed.<br/><br/>So it is important to gather information, but at the same time it is important to cast doubt on the other characters by spreading witch rumors, or by trying to avoid being accused of being the witch yourself.  The winner is the person who survives the swirling eddy of information and misinformation surrounding the Witch Distrubance.  <br/><br/><br/>",

This easy-to-learn card game captures all the fast-paced excitement of the National Football League and puts you in control. Build your ultimate fantasy team and dominate your opponents with stars like Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, Tim Tebow, Adrian Peterson.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>Each of the five starters on Offense and Defense can be used only once per set of downs, with the exception of the Quarterback on Offense.<br/><br/>All cards must participate in a play before you can reuse them, with the exception of the quarterback. Even in the event of a first down, cards cannot be reused until each has participated in a play.<br/><br/>Play Calling: Next, the Offense announces their play call: Run or Pass. Run plays use only one starter, while Pass plays involve two starters (Quarterback plus another player). <br/>The Defense is allowed to &quot;boost&quot; the Defense Run or Pass Rating of the selected card by combining that number with the Star Rating of a second card. The Defense may &quot;boost&quot; just ONE play per set of downs.<br/><br/>After the cards have been selected, the Offense and Defense reveal their players and the outcome of the play is determined by the ratings.<br/><br/>Run Plays: Compare the Offense Run Rating and the Defense Run Rating. The difference of the two determines the yardage. For example, if the Offense is 50 and the Defense is 41, the Run gains nine yards. If the defense uses its &quot;boost&quot; on this play and the &quot;boost&quot; rating was six, then the new Defense rating is 47 the rush gains only three yards instead.<br/><br/>Pass Plays: Add the Quarterback Pass Rating and the Pass Rating of the selected player. Take that total, and compare it to the Defense Pass Rating. The difference of the two determines the yardage. For example, if the Quarterback Pass Rating is 30 and the selected Offense Player is also 30, for a total of 60, and the Defense Pass Rating is 50, the Pass gains 10 yards. If the defense uses its &quot;boost&quot; on this play, and the &quot;boost&quot; rating was five, the pass gains five yards instead.<br/><br/>Substitutions: Teams may substitute players only at halftime. However, they can use the same starters throughout the game.<br/><br/>Overtime: If the teams are tied after four quarters, a new coin flip will determine who has the first possession of overtime. The first team to score wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

To score a point, the numerical value of a drive must total exactly 21.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>In order to play the game you will need 2 different team decks, a printout of the rules, and a play mat.Each 16 card deck represents a different football team themed after mythic characters and races.<br/><br/>Game-play:<br/>The game-play is fast and simple with each coach simultaneously playing cards into the down positions in order to either score or keep the opponent from scoring. Each card has four values associated with the four down positions. This means that the usefulness of each card varies depending on when it is played. If the coach on offense doesn't score within those four downs then the drive ends and possession switches to the other player. Some cards also have special powers that can be triggered on certain downs that help add flavor to the different teams. An example power is &quot;push&quot; which pushes all the cards back one down position causing all their values to change.<br/><br/>Touchstone was followed by Touchstone: Oubliette.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reconstruction of an alleged race game played by the indians in Yucatan, based on an original board. The gameplay is reminiscent of games like Parcheesi or Patolli: players have got to throw pebbles and then use the outcome of the throw to move their stones along a closed track. The goal is to bring their pieces home first - pieces of the opponents can be taken on the way and so get sent back to their home square.<br/><br/>Yucatan, though, has got some interesting additions to make it more tactical than the average race game: it is best played by partnerships of two, who can under certain circumstances move the partner's pieces; a cross within the track allows the pieces to take shortcuts, and similar pieces can be stacked and moved as a unit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quest Chess was self-published by Donald, in 1974. It is a Chess variant. It consists of an A4 sheet of rules.<br/>(Conquest on the Chess board)<br/>Quest-Chess is played with a standard chess set. The moves of the pieces are the same as in regular Chess. White begins by making any five moves. After that, each player may make up to ten moves per turn. However, no piece may be moved more than once during your turn, unless that piece has first made a capture, or has moved to create a check. You may pass your turn any time after making at least one move.<br/>When you make a capture you must stop and give your opponent the opportunity to capture your piece which made the capture. He has one move in which to do this, but may make this 'recapture' in any way possible. He may also refuse to recapture. Once he has made his recapture (or refused to recapture) you then continue on with the rest of your ten moves, and you may again move that piece which made the capture any time during your turn.<br/>If you make a capture on your last move, your opponent does not get a free recapture, as it is then his turn and he must start counting his moves. If he then captures, you may recapture. If you intend to capture and pass, you must announce your pass when making the capture.<br/>When you put your opponent in check, you must stop and allow him one move to get out of check. He may capture the checking piece, he may interpose, or he may move the king. Once he is out of check, you continue on with the rest of your ten moves, and that piece which moved to create the check may move again. If you check your opponent's king on your last move, it is then his turn and he must count his first move in getting out of check.<br/>Castling is considered a king move. Therefore, if you castle, the king may not move again, but the castled rook may still move.<br/>If you move a pawn two spaces, passing your opponent's pawn on the fifth rank, you must allow him the immediate option to capture 'en passant'. When a pawn is promoted to a major piece, that 'new' piece may move on the same turn.<br/>You may never make a move that exposes your king to check, regardless of whether the checking piece has already moved. If your opponent puts you in check by making a recapture and the only way to get out of check is by moving a piece that you have previously moved on that turn, then this is permissible even if it involve a capture. However, if you have a way of getting out of check by moving a previously unmoved piece, you must take that alternative.<br/>When a player is in check and cannot get out of check in one move, it is checkmate, and the game is over. Sometimes checkmate may occur on a recapture. If ten consecutive turns are made without moving a pawn and without capturing a piece, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

The game begins with the Soviets on the all-out offensive, but its second half is dominated by a German counterattack.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a historical scenario covering the battle as it was fought, plus a what-if scenario that allows players to explore the possibilities inherent in the all-out effort originally proposed to Stalin by Marshal Timoshenko. In it, the Soviet player begins the game with the historical force along with a total of 26 more rifle divisions and tank brigades: everything that was then in the Soviet strategic reserve. Of course, to win that scenario the Soviet player needs to accomplish a lot more than he does in the historical one (capture all three hexes of Kharkov).<br/><br/>Each hex represents five miles (eight km) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents two days. Each unit of maneuver represents a division or brigade of roughly 2,000 to 14,000 men and 50 to 400 armored fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>Special rules cover such things as: Soviet untried units, initial German unpreparedness, air interdiction, historical and alternative set ups, multi-step German units, sudden death victories, fog of war, German inter-army cooperation, close air support, Soviet armor doctrine, Soviet panic, and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I.    Soviet Player Turn<br/><br/>A.    German Air Interdiction Placement Phase<br/><br/>B.    Soviet Movement Phase<br/><br/>C.

If the players can trace this sand trail properly, they'll find and capture the robbers.<br/><br/>To set up the game, shuffle the eight forest chips and place them face-down in the box. Shuffle the 24 sand chips, place three of them in a row behind the wagon cart (assembled by the players or their parents), then place the remaining sand chips in the wagon.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player reveals the last sand chip in the line (unless it's already face-up), then reveals the forest chip that she thinks matches the image on the sand chip. If they match, she claims the sand chip and turns the forest chip face-down again, then the next player takes his turn. If they don't match, she hides the forest chip again, then rolls the die. On a red result, the robbers advance, moving the wagon forward with another sand chip falling through the hole in the wagon and adding to the trail; on a yellow result, the robbers are resting, so the good guys luck out and don't fall further behind.<br/><br/>If the players reach the wagon &ndash; that is, if no sand chips lie between the players and the wagon &ndash; the robbers are captured and the players collectively win, with the one who collected the most sand chips receiving special commendation. If the last sand chip falls out of the wagon, each player takes one final turn, and if they catch the wagon they win. If not, the robbers escape and the players are run out of town as bungling galoots.<br/><br/>The rules include a few variants to make the game easier or more difficult based on the skill level of the players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gitti Giraffe &ndash; as with other titles in HABA's &quot;My Very First Games&quot; series &ndash; is a game for small children that's designed to teach them the concept of rules. In this case, players need to choose colors, stack blocks and carefully move a tipsy object across a table.<br/><br/>The components of Gitti Giraffe are two trees, a color die, foliage cards, eight blocks and a giraffe on wheels. To set up the game, place the trees some distance apart, place the foliage cards on the trees, and stack one block on the giraffe's body with its head on top.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the color die, then uses a block of this color to lengthen the giraffe's neck (taking the head off at first, then replacing it). The player then pushes the giraffe from one tree to another. If no blocks fall, the player receives a foliage card as a reward; if one or more blocks fall, the player gets no reward and the blocks are returned to the pool. When all the foliage cards have been claimed, the player with the most such cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A variation of the classic cricket action game. Small plastic fielders, a mechanism to allow batting, another one to allow bowling, a ball and a field made up of different run areas. It doesn&rsquo;t get much simpler. Sister product of Balyna Football. Both games were designed to be a competitor to Subbuteo's cricket and football games.<br/>In many ways the game is quite surreal, with the bowler being represented by an aluminim funnel from which the fielding team bowls the ball. The batsman is a counter weight which is held by a piece of cotton by the player. When the ball is bowled, the batsman releases the counter weight and, depending on the angle can play a variety of shots. Great scoreboard too, but completely useless as the scoreboard is metal and the score numbers cardboard. They fall apart far too quickly.<br/><br/>",

Red balls are considered &lsquo;neutral&rsquo;:<br/><br/>●&ensp;●&ensp;●&ensp;●<br/>●&ensp;●&ensp;●&ensp;●<br/>○&ensp;○&ensp;○&ensp;○<br/>○&ensp;○&ensp;○&ensp;○<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Two players, White and Black, alternate turns moving a ball of their colour or a neutral ball (red) to jump over a single ball of another colour and land on any ball to capture it. Jumps may be diagonal (as per Checkers) or orthogonal. Players must capture a ball each turn.<br/>The ball landed on is removed and the ball jumped over is converted to the colour that is not the jumper or the jumpee, e.g. if the jumper is a white ball and the jumpee is a black ball then the jumpee gets replaced with a neutral ball (red).<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when a player can't move on their turn (which could happen if there are not three balls in a row somewhere, or if all remaining triples are unusable by the player).

However, scale is not important in &quot;Victory Decision: World War II&quot;. As long as your minis are individually based you can use the rules straight away. In fact we found that the weapon ranges look more realistic when using individually based 15mm infantry miniatures. If you want to play with smaller tables, just use centimeters instead of inches and all will be fine.<br/><br/>Using individually based infantry miniatures is the recommended way of playing &quot;Victory Decision: World War II&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introductory game for the English Civil War series by TCS Games, it is a small print &amp; play wargame on this minor battle from the English Civil War, more a fighting retreat and a sequence of cavalry clashes than a complete battle.<br/><br/>The game features the now classic system from TCS, made of random chit draw leaders activation, based on the quality of the leader himself, that leads to units activation and subsequent movement and combat.<br/>Each leader is rated from 1 to 3 (the higher the better, as he has more chance to be drawn earlier); when his chit is drawn from the pool, the player may move and have combat with all the units under his command. The activation is renewed for each other leader in the pool, except the last one that didn't move on that turn. there are no zone of controls (so movement is very fluid), terrain plays an important effect (as some terrain gives restriction to the attacker and improve the chances of the defender), combat is fast and furious (with advance, retreat and immediate elimination).<br/><br/>There are rules for melee, morale, cavalry charges, artillery and so on, with a very streamlined system that you may read and play in a few minutes.<br/><br/>Very good for introducing new players to the hobby, a sort of SPI quad games revisited and modernized<br/><br/>",

Playing cards for the opponent may seem odd, but it is the only way to gain new cards. And since 11 cards in one of the card-rows end the game, you will need some more cards than the 3 you start with if you don't want the game to end early.<br/>Nearly every single one of the 30 cards contains a unique effect, but while some of these effects are executed immediately, others wait for the end of the game before beeing executed. And you can't be completely sure whether they will be in the same position on the same side at that moment.<br/>When the end is declared and the last effects have been executed, it is time to count the strenght and see who has collected the stronger - or more effective - little horde.<br/><br/>",

The S&ouml;ldnervariante was also made available as downloadable file by Lookout Games.<br/><br/>In this variant, the mercenary can be hired when playing conflict cards (Phase 3). The player hiring the mercenary immediately loses 3 victory points but in conflict resolution (Phase 5), the mercenary counts as 5 conflict points.<br/><br/>",

As the incidents increased in frequency and severity it soon became clear that they weren&rsquo;t the ramblings of madmen as initially suspected. But by then it was too late; far, far too late&hellip;<br/><br/>Survival Horror Tabletop Game is for 1 or more players and is an exploration/survival game in which tiles are laid to reflect the SHPD precinct house. You need to find specific items to complete the mission and escape, and the zombies spawn as rooms are uncovered and they gain successful spawn points. The zombies are fairly easily picked off to start with, but once they start gaining a hold survival becomes a lot more difficult!<br/><br/>Health and actions are controlled by the same points (so the more health you lose, the less actions you can perform), and there are modifiers for combat/damage etc. You also need to find a way of opening locked and barricaded doors, and working either with or against the other human players. Of course, if you are the zombie player then all you really need to do is to kill all humans...<br/><br/>The 59 page pdf contains all you need to play the Survival Horror Tabletop Game and enter the world of 30mm scale tabletop Modern Horror gaming!

The theme of Cozmica is about relocating Earth life in DNA form, to a new world in the cosmos for survival.                                   Both players sit on opposite sides of a 9 x 9 line grid board similar to a Go board.<br/>Each player receives either 18 black or 18 white &ldquo;Go stone like&rdquo; playing pieces (Bio-ships). Playing pieces are marked with either an Animal, Plant, or Microbe symbol. The pieces interact with each other similar to the mechanics of Rock, Paper, Scissors, i.e.<br/>Animals eat Plants, Plants absorb Microbes, and Microbes infect Animals.<br/>All pieces move the same way&hellip;1 or 2 places, Horizontally, Vertically or Diagonally.<br/>The objectives of the game are: <br/>1. Surround and capture opponents Bio-ships.<br/>2. Intercept and eliminate opponents Bio-ships.<br/>3. Cross your own Bio-ships to the other side and off the board. <br/>4. You acquire colonies by capturing opponents Bio-ships or crossing your own to the other side and off the board.<br/>5. To win the game, you must establish at least one colony. They may be mixed [your&rsquo;s and/or your opponents as long as they form a colony.<br/>A colony is: 1 each of all 3 DNA types, 1 Animal, 1 Plant, 1 Microbe.<br/>Playing time is about 30 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>",

In the morning you are awakened by the loudspeaker system, this is very much not usual.  It appears to be a recording.  A young insulting voice is outlining the victory, which his group achieved overnight.  You realize he is part of the youth movement, which has been threatening the establishment, as usual.  The voice declares that they have taken over the government and the first new law has been set into motion is nobody over the age of 30 is worthy of life.  However, the law had been quickly modified to allow for one &ldquo;Old Folk&rdquo;, as they are to be called, to be allowed to live per retirement home.  The first Old Folk to make his or her way out of the home will receive the pardon for life.  Be aware however, the entire home has been booby trapped and there will be no medical teams sent in to help the fallen.  The recording starts again.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/>Players should agree to a victory point total before play begins, 20 points is a short game, 30 average and 40 long.  Points are scored<br/><br/>How to score points:<br/>After playing some room cards you may play a Passkey.  This will do two things, 1) will allow you to move to another Quad if you wish to.  Once the points are calculated the scorekeeper should note the player's new score and announce to all players what the score is.  There are four scoring positions, position one, two, three, and four.  The first room you play is in &ldquo;Position One&rdquo;, the next card your play will be in &ldquo;Position Two&rdquo;, then next &ldquo;Position Three&rdquo; and finally the fourth in &ldquo;Position Four&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

Once players move into the Field, they may not move back into their own or any other player's Base, unless it is as part of a multiple jump that ends back in the Field.  Once a piece is in the Field, it moves as a promoted piece, in any direction.  Captures are compulsory, and a player's own pieces may be captured.<br/><br/>Variations are provided, either for last-man-standing victory conditions, or for scoring points.  Also a more challenging variation called &quot;DUBL-CHEKRS&quot; is described.<br/><br/>The board itself is reversible, with a standard 8 x 8 checkerboard on the reverse.<br/><br/>The board and instructions feature small diagrams of variations of the Fourplay board, with larger Base areas; it is unknown if the game was ever published with these alternate boards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fan expansion of the popular board game Ticket to Ride designed for 2-5 players. Contains a large map of the Russian Empire back to 1912, 54 destination tickets (48 regular routes and 6 long routes).<br/><br/>To play the components from the original game are required, be it Europe, USA or any other genuine edition with train cars and stations as well as illustrated cards of wagons and locomotives.<br/><br/>The basic rules of the Europe edition are applied to the game setup and main principles concerning Tunnels and Ferries. Double routes are used only with 4-5 players, otherwise only one track is accessible. Please note that some drastic changes were introduced into the scoring system. To evaluate your progress and receive earned winning points it is recommended to use a new scoring table, presented at the right bottom corner of the board allowing to assess built tunnels and regular routes separately.<br/><br/>At the end of the game some bonuses +10 might be awarded for players' achievements such as the longest route, the biggest number of visited cities or any other trophy at your option.<br/><br/><br/>NOTE: &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and &quot;Days of Wonder&quot; are registered trademarks of Days of Wonder, Inc.

Разумеется, существовавших в начале 20 века путей оказалось недостаточно для создания более менее сбалансированной игровой карты, а потому были добавлены несуществовавшие, а частично даже сейчас несуществующие маршруты, тоннели и паромные переправы (то есть на особую историчность и реалистичность не претендую). За неимением сколько-нибудь крупных городов в северо-восточной части Российской империи в качестве игровых узлов были взяты либо губернские центры, либо военные посты, основанные еще при освоении Сибири. Часть этих поселений в наши дни практически неизвестна и представляет подчас еще более жалкое зрелище, чем тогда, в царское время - счет населения в некоторых из них ведется не то что на тысячи, а лишь сотни человек.Постарался выдержать оригинальный стиль игры. Поле довольно большое, рассчитано на 2-5 человек. Для двоих даже великовато, но это, как с Европой и Америкой. Маршруты довольно разветвленные, но имеются и узкие места. Для игры рекомендуется использовать базовые правила Европы - двойные маршруты только для 3+ человек, классический принцип строительства туннелей и переправ, то же число вытягиваемых и оставляемых коротких/длинных маршрутов. При желании можно и похоумрулить. Внесены, на мой взгляд, логичные изменения в механику подсчета очков - туннельные ветки стали несколько ценнее, что нашло свое отражение в таблице подсчета очков, приведенной в правом нижнем углу поля. В конце игры возможно добавление участникам стандартных бонусов +10 очков за наиболее длинный маршрут или максимальное количество посещенных городов.<br/><br/><br/>ВНИМАНИЕ: &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; и &quot;Days of Wonder&quot; являются зарегистрированными торговыми марками компании Days of Wonder, Inc.

The name of the game is the strategic plan given by the adviser of Shu to his King at the place called Long Zhong.<br/><br/>In this game, players can play the roles of one of the three major States or as misc. warlords power.  A player can take two actions each turn.  The options for the actions include:<br/>1. occupy neutral city;<br/>2. transfer of armies;<br/>3. recruit armies;<br/>4. attack an enemy city; or<br/>5. use a strategy card.<br/><br/>Players would vie for control of different cities on the game board, with their General and Army cards, the exact contents of which are hidden from the view of other players to create a fog of war.  The bulk of the game lies in the action of &quot;attack an enemy city&quot;, where two players would lay down their Army cards in formation and reveal them at the same to compare the strength and decide the outcome of the battle.<br/><br/>The first player who conquers all other capitals is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

Zasłużony urlop &ndash; PRZEPUSTKA &ndash; w czasie kt&oacute;rej, można było odwiedzić rodzinny dom czy też stęsknioną narzeczoną. Łatwiej powiedzieć, trudniej wykonać. Trwała wojna, wszędzie zniszczenia, pociągi przepełnione, po drogach grasują Kozacy a na wszystkich maszerujących z frontu, podejrzliwe spoglądali austriaccy żandarmi. Nasza Przepustka obowiązywała jednak tylko 7 dni - 7 kr&oacute;tkich dni i nocy. Legioniści musieli więc się spieszyć i liczyć na łut szczęścia.<br/><br/>Przepustka to gra przeznaczona dla 2,3,4 bądź 5 graczy. Otrzymują oni pod kontrole dw&oacute;ch legionist&oacute;w. Gracze muszą starać się tak poprzez zagrywanie kart ruchu sterować swoimi legionistami by ci dotarli do swoich rodzinnych dom&oacute;w narzeczonych i nie wpadli w tarapaty. Gracze za osiągnięte cele otrzymują punkty zwycięstwa. Te można r&oacute;wnież zyskać dzięki kartom lub odwiedzeniu miejsc pamięci. Wygrywa ten gracz kt&oacute;rego legioniście zdążą uzbierać najwięcej punkt&oacute;w zwycięstwa<br/><br/><br/>After numerous battles and heroic efforts, a much-desired rest aould arrive for every soldier. Well-deserved leave - Furlough - during which it was possible to visit home or a fianc&eacute;e. Easy to say, hard to accomplish. The war continues, and there are disuptions everywhere and overcrowded trains. Cossacks are prowling along the roads and suspicious Austrian military policemen are looking on marching from the front soldiers. Our Furlough is in force only for the week - 7 short days and nights. The soldiers must act quickly and count on a bit of luck.<br/><br/>Przepustka (A Furlough) is a game intended for 2, 3, 4 or 5 players. Each of players controls two soldiers - using movement cards they help them reach family and friends safely and don't get into trouble. Victory points are awarded for visited destinations. It is also possible to gain these points thanks to cards or by visiting storage locations. The winner is the player whose soldiers manage to gather most victory points.<br/><br/>",

The Rebel player, who starts the game with little apparent power but a great deal of information, is in conflict with the Government player, who has power (with his assortment of Agents) but very little information on the Rebel&rsquo;s resources and capabilities.<br/><br/>The pieces represent small groups (Insurgents and Agents), support organizations (Sympathizers), and nonexistent things or misleading information (Dummies).<br/><br/>The map (a field of 91 hexes) is perhaps the most abstracted part of the design, in that it does not represent physical distance, but something more like organizational proximity. With the Rebel pieces starting on the outer perimeter, and the Agents starting in a tight group around the Nexus, it can be displayed how far the revolt must go and how much larger it must grow in order to challenge the government for ultimate power. However, being out in the margins allows time to organize and gather strength....<br/><br/>",

Along the way, you need to pass carefully because skillful lane changes are required in order to avoid unforeseen obstacles.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player drives one of the five racecars along the curvy racetrack through the forest. On your turn, roll both dice, then reroll one of the dice if you want to. The result on the number die moves your car forward along the racetrack; the result on the action die allows the nimble racecar drivers either to move an obstacle on the track, which you otherwise would have to avoid, or to make a lane change &mdash; to shift to the inside lane of a curve, for example. The good news: A lane change can be made before, during, or after the number die's movement. The game consists of two laps, and whoever first completes the second lap wins the big race.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train pieces and the train cards from either the US or Europe base games (or you can buy them from the Days of Wonder shop. You can use stations if you wish.<br/><br/>There is an extra set of cards for the &quot;cities&quot;, each with a value to be earned by visiting that &quot;city&quot;.  These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules. Some of the cards give you extra facilities to complete your tickets. There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for these.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn.  This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the beginnings of times was Keberadaan, and he decided to release the energy whose expansion created all the known planes. The tenth plane is the one of Kallat. A summoner society that uses the energy form Keberadaan to bring life to incredible creatures and fulfill the missions that are imposed.<br/>Now you can be a Summoner from the Kallat&rsquo;s universe, start your training and fight against others who are trying to enter in this world.<br/><br/>'Kallat' is a strategy game in which you are a Summoner that materializes different creatures to fight against a rival or between teams. You have the possibility to choose your own Summon&rsquo;s grimoire that will contribute Life and Existence Points to your Pyre. These points are the ones you need to take care if you do not want to lose your battle.<br/>At first, you will take 6 Tactic/ Strategy Cards and place your Monolith in the board. Now is the moment when you can start summoning the creatures that will represent you in the battle field. In the second turn, your Summons will be able to move around the board as well as they can attack using their weapons, skills, spells, etc. in the quest to reduce the Life of the opposite party and wind the encounter. There are certain attacks with altered states that produce extra damage and there are others in which magic is involved; therefore, they not only consume your Action Points but also your Existence Points. So be careful when you use them! Even though they are very powerful, excessive use of them can put your creature in a high risk since loosing all your Existence Points will make you loose the battle.<br/>Tactics and Strategy Cards are not only to summon a creature since they can also bring you extra help that, if you use wisely, can turn around the outcome of the game.<br/>Another way of winning the game is with special attacks meant to destroy all the enemy creatures by removing their Projection Points. Each eliminated Summon gives you one Victory Point. At the beginning of the training, the party can decide the maximum number of Victory Points needed to win the game (usually 3 to 5 points).<br/>Furthermore, you have different boards to create sceneries in the shape you want. Also, you can determine the weather and lightning of each territory. Notice that each feature comes with its own consequences.<br/>Kallat is thought for you, as Summoner, to feel part of a world full of energy and action in which your battle expertise and the knowledge of the creatures you choose from your Grimoire can make you the best Summoner of all times.<br/><br/>",

If answered with &quot;yes&quot; you are allowed to ask another question, if answered with &quot;no&quot; the turn moves on to the next player. <br/>Asking questions is done with the cards laying face-up on the table with all the case items in a pattern.

All other tiles lie face up on the table.<br/> In your turn you choose one of the open tiles and put it at your starting tile. One side of your new tile have to fit to your starting tile. If you start with the 6/6 tile you have to choose a tile with a 6.<br/><br/>In the second round you can choose where you place your new tile. It is not allowed to place a tile with different numbers close together; at the corner it is ok. If it`s possible you could place a new tile in the second (or even third) level. In this case both sides of the new tile must fit with the sides of the two tiles beneath.<br/><br/>A player who can't move passes. The other player continues. To determine the winner, the numbers of stones in the first level are multiply with the number of stones in the second level.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1923 publication was designed to transform Babcock Rules Mah-Jongg into a card game. (As the rules book notes, Mr. J. P. Babcock &quot;originated the name Mah-Jongg, adapted all that was best of the Chinese forms of play, and added the Arabic numerals&quot;.) The rule book credits Douglas Lawson for having &quot;correlated&quot; the Babcock rules with card play.<br/><br/>The 164-card deck replicates the mix of tiles in the classic game. It includes four cards for 1-9 for each of the three suits (Dots, Bamboo, Characters), as well as four each of the North, South, East and West winds and Red, Green and White Dragons, plus the 8 Flower cards. As in the classic rules, players try to collect sets or 3 or 4 of a kind or in a sequence, with bonuses for various combinations and special tiles.<br/><br/>Instead of ivory or bone scoring sticks, the card game uses thin colored wooden rods for scoring. The game includes 40 short green sticks worth 2 each, 32 medium-length yellow sticks worth 10, 36 longer red sticks worth 100, and 8 long blue sticks worth 500.<br/><br/>While the rule book focuses on the Standard and Royal games for four players, it does include variant rules for 3, 5 and 6 players. (The Babcock rules were largely superceded in North America in the 1930s by American Mah-Jongg rules.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the super-fast competitive card game Bitcoin Empire, you are a plucky, pioneering entrepreneur trying to collect and keep as many bitcoins as possible in storage. Bitcoins are represented by face down cards. The game ends when the last card is drawn from the deck and whoever has the most face down cards at that point in storage is the winner.<br/><br/>Every player gets a character card. Characters have ranks on three different skills: law, coding and marketing. You also have a bitcoin storage rating which determines how many face down cards can be stored underneath the character.<br/><br/>The main deck of cards is shuffled and each player is dealt two cards. There are several different types. Exchanges can be played down as places to store face down cards based on the bitcoin rating. Hack, Lawsuit and Smear Campaign are attack cards that can be played against an opponents Exchange or character is your ranks in law, coding and marketing respectively are greater than the targets. If successful all the cards in that storage are discarded without looking at them and the Exchange card is taken to the hand of the attacking player. Alternatively these attack cards can be played underneath the character as extra ranks of the applicable icon. Internet Meltdown cards can also be played on the characters to increase their ranks but the Satoshi card will wipe them all away if played. Also, Head Hunter cards can steal an opponents skill cards. Bribe cards can be played to cancel any attack or the Head Hunter.<br/><br/>So keep your wits about you as you take on the fledgling crypto-market and build your empire.<br/><br/>",

Unless you are a forgetful goldfish, there's no one who can defeat you. Come on! Our savior~~AMNESIA HEROES!<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>1. Shuffle challenge cards and skill cards separately. Place these two decks in the middle of the table. <br/>2. In the beginning, draw a challenge card and place it in the middle of the table. <br/>3. Place damage marks and goldfish marks aside.<br/>4. The player who looks like a goldfish goes first.<br/><br/>COURSE OF PLAY<br/><br/>There are four stages in this game. The leader in this turn executes the action.<br/> Learning skills: Through this stage, the leader deals the skill cards to each player. During the process, the leader has to remember which skill cards are in whose hands. It is the key to defeat the monster at the next stage.    <br/>1. The leader deals the skill cards face-up to each player clockwise. <br/>2. Two options to deal cards:<br/>A. Each time deal a skill card to each player clockwise.<br/>B. Deal the skill cards to a player one time. Then deal the skill cards to the next player clockwise.      <br/>Tip! No matter which option you choose, the process of dealing the skill cards can help you to find the best way to remember these cards. <br/>3. Each player chooses a skill card from your hands. Then places it face down in front of you as a skill you can't remember.<br/><br/>※ The leader doesn't have to execute this action.<br/><br/>Select a monster: The leader selects a challenge card from the table or the deck.<br/><br/>Attack:<br/><br/>According to the attack sequence shown on the challenge card, the leader has to play skill cards from the left to the right or use goldfish marks to attack the monster.<br/><br/>※ Remember the skill cards you dealt? Who has the skill card you need?!<br/><br/>",

Cards can be a combination of positive cards (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), negative cards (-1, -2, and -3), and special Action Cards. Each player mixes and matches their cards each turn to create as many 6-point hands as possible with the ultimate goal of playing all of their cards (thus scoring zero points) and catching other players with points. The lowest score after 6 rounds wins.<br/><br/>Each player creates their own Laydown Pile of 6-point hands during each round. As a twist, when every player has started a Laydown Pile during a round, the board becomes Open for Business, and players can start making 6-point hands off the top of other players' Laydown Piles.<br/><br/>Several Action Cards allow players to both help create additional 6-point hands and also block (or at least delay) other players from making their own 6-point hands. Action Cards include both offensive and defensive cards, cards for stealing hands or forcing other players to steal each other's hands, cards that change positive cards negative or negative cards positive, and cards that force other players to draw varying numbers of cards.<br/><br/>",

When he/she has finished, it is then the turn of the player on his/her left, who throws only the dice not used for the first player&rsquo;s equation, and tries to make a new equation using at least one new die. The dice used in the initial equation cannot be changed, but can be rearranged to make the new equation.<br/>The round continues with fewer dice at each throw, until the player throwing the dice is unable to add any new ones.<br/>The last person to add a die to the equation wins the round and is awarded 1 point.<br/>A new round starts with a new throw of all the dice.<br/>There is a target score to win.<br/><br/>GAME N.4 - YAHTZEE<br/>The 5 combinations to achieve are:<br/>- Blue: the equation contains at least 3 blue dice (with 4 blue dice, you get 3 bonus points).<br/>- Green: same as Blue, but with green dice<br/>- Red: same as Blue, but with red dice<br/>- Poker: the equation contains 4 dice of the same colour<br/>- 101: there is a number greater than 100<br/><br/>",

Ancient history is combined with deck building mechanism.The game is based on an ancient war which happened thousand of years ago and resulted in over one and a half billion casualties. The war only lasted for 18 days.<br/><br/>There are 14 characters divided into 2 teams (each team has 7 characters,--- blue and red team) in this game each having special ability, belonging to a particular faction (Archer, swordsmen, Spearmen, Macewielder). All of them have health points and defense value.<br/><br/>There are money cards (silver) and infantry cards to start the game , which are shuffled to form drawing deck. There are money cards (Gold), weapon cards (spear, mace, swords, bow &amp; arrow), Potion cards which form trade row. Each weapon card has cost, value, and extra ability on them.<br/><br/>In this game the players draw initiative cards depending on number of players playing. The player drawing no 1 initiative card chooses either blue or red team and draws a random character. Each player gets initial money cards and attack cards and shuffle them to form their drawing deck. Out of which they draw 5 cards as starting hand and buy cards from trade row. The players have to raise their army by buying weapon cards from trade row. These cards help them to draw more cards, trash cards, add more money, add more attack points etc.<br/><br/>The players attack each other and resolving combat by either direct hit or by rolling dice if attack is equal to defense. The game ends when opponent/opponent team is eliminated.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Sanskrit. n. &quot;ring&quot; or &quot;wheel.&quot;<br/><br/>Chakra is a turn-based two-player strategy game descended from Go, a game of creating life through structure. Chakra is a game of territory, capture, and flow that exercises and improves your lateral thinking, spatial reasoning, serialization, and more. You will learn how to extend, trade-off, circumnavigate, and consolidate gains along subtle curves and beautiful shapes.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of game pieces (stones): black and white. Black plays first and traditionally played by the the less experienced player. Like Go, each stone is placed on an intersection of crossing lines. Unlike Go, the board is made up of twelve interlocking circles and an outer rim that functions as a thirteenth circle.<br/><br/>The player's goal in Chakra is to create as much &quot;living territory&quot; as possible by the game's end. Players create living stone groups by connecting chains of stones around two or more &quot;eyes&quot; (empty intersections). In each turn, a player will optionally pass or place a stone on an empty intersection, after which liberties are counted and any captures removed. The player may then choose to slide another stone on either of the two circles it resides on, with stones of either player blocking movement. Liberties and captures are then counted a second time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>ゲット★スマートラブ (Get★Smart Love) is a Japanese card game of match-making, but with somewhat adult themes and language.<br/><br/>In the game, players are dealt hand cards and draw and play more cards through the game. There are four male character cards dealt face up on the table, and the players are boy-chasers, competing to win the 'best' one. But which man is best is only determined at the finish.<br/><br/>During the game, players play hand cards against their chosen targets. These attribute cards have positive values for virtues, and negative values for bad behaviour. Some cards are played face-up, some face-down, so there is a strong element of bluffing in the game. Some attribute cards alter the rules as they are played.<br/><br/>The game is very social and encourages table talk about the good or bad attributes.<br/><br/>Players also put secret tokens on the male cards, to show their likes or dislikes. After the cards have been played, the players must 'Express Love' by simultaneously pointing at the man they chose. If only player chooses one man, they get him. If more than player points at one man, the player with the highest token wins him.<br/><br/>Then all the attribute cards are flipped and the value of the different men is calculated. The player who picked the best man, wins!<br/><br/>There are two Versions of the game, this second edition is themed on women trying to get the best boyfriend. There is another edition with the genders swapped, and the men are trying to get the best girlfriend - ゲット★スイートラブ (Get★Sweet Love). Whilst the games are very similar, there are differences in the special cards which affect the gameplay. With both editions, you can combine and play an 8 player game.<br/><br/>The game name has a couple of twists. The English name can be abbreviated to Ge★S Love, which for Japanese readers equates to 'guess love', trying to guess which girl to choose. But the name ゲスラブ in Japanese, has the word ゲス in it, which is used in many vulgar or even obscene words in Japanese. So the publisher is deliberately signalling to buyers that the game is for adults but still sociable, since the girl-chasers will be nice to some girls, and not so nice to others. This version has gone through five reprints in Japan and always draws a crowd at game shows, with its risque design (by Japanese standards).<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>グループ交際の中で相手の男性に様々な『属性』を付与し<br/>最も点数の高い男性を恋人にした人が勝利。<br/>通称ゲスラブ（Guess Love）<br/><br/>Get★Sweet Loveと混ぜて1名～8名で遊ぶ事も可能。<br/><br/>",

Players each have a hand of five river cards and one bear card. At the start of the round, players take turns laying down cards face down one at a time in a pyramid shape until each player has placed three cards. Then players take turns placing their salmon on a card in the first row.<br/><br/>Players then take turns in an action phase in which they optionally swim their salmon to a new location, jumping occupied spaces and revealing the card where they land, if it were hidden. Land on a bear and you're out for the round unless you can counter with a bear from your hand. After moving, you can either place a card from your hand face down to add to the river or pass. Once all players pass in turn, the round ends and players then collect ikura tokens equal to their rank in the pyramid.<br/><br/>In the third round, players score an ikura bonus depending on their final rank, then whoever has collected (a.k.a. spawned) the most ikura wins!<br/><br/>",

Playing on an 11&times;16 hex map of a classic football pitch, two teams with 10 player pieces on each side compete to control the ball, pass to forward players, tackle to control the ball, and advance to a position to make a goal.<br/><br/>The game uses dice, player pieces, and cards to control the action. There are no springs or finger-flicking in this game; the rules, based on the 17 laws of soccer, the map, the cards and dice rolls determine success on the field and glory in the stands.  Each player side has two key phases: the initiative phase in which the side with a high die roll spends momentum points to move, pass, tackle, and score; and a teamwork phase in which the whole team moves, enabling the game to reproduce the flow and movement of the Beautiful Game.  Special cards may give special opportunities: a burst of speed or a cannonball kick; the hand of fate or owner interference... Ready your formation, lead your players to victory, and battle for the ball!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With the included Campaign Chapter, your heroes will be able to go under Castelray, the royal capital of Istarra and explore its repulsive sewers, infested with rats. They are humanoid rodents,that live in smelly tunnels and look to devour every intruder they can find.<br/><br/>By living underground, rats are also filled with diseases. They are almost immune to their own germs - even if they don&acute;t live long enough to get old &ndash; but infect whoever gets too close, which usually gives them a certain advantage. Disease reduces the attack and physical ability of those wishing to confront them.<br/><br/>The sewers are also filled with traps that can quickly neutralize intruders (or food). Event cards will make the place more dangerous, by making swarms of little rats show up or by making your heroes fall in deadly traps. There's still a positive side to all of this, though. With all the waste that is thrown in the sewers, some good surprises may sometimes be found.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If you want to be the first compiling and building your program, you will need big doses of caffeine, some undocumented shortcuts and maybe a few pokes. Obfuscate the code by hardcoding not-easy-to-remove constants and try to distract your peer with pizza... But, what if your program does not &quot;exactly&quot; fits the requirements? Well, let's see if we can sell this little bug as a brand new feature.<br/><br/>Peer Programming is an anti-cooperative game of software development for two players. <br/>The players take the role of software developers who want to write a pretty simple code which just prints a sequence of 6 characters on console. The source code is shared by both players but the requirements are different for each. The players take actions to modify the shared code towards meeting their requirements. The first player to make the shared code print the character sequence in his requirements wins the game.<br/><br/>The shared code is built using a tile placement mechanic based on the logic of code statements such as FOR loops, IF and PRINT. A player can draw motivation cards each time the shared code gets closer to meet his requirements (in the &quot;compile&quot; phase). These cards give one-turn special powers breaking the risk of stalemate and adding a fun thematic variation (distracting your opponent with pizza, asking for help in Stack Overflow, obfuscating the code...).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

While this loss of detail may be mourned by some, it allows battles to be fought in a timely manner and players to concentrate on the tasks of generals rahter than of junior officers.<br/><br/>The rules aim to be compatible with figures from 2mm to 28mm size, and almost any basing scheme. There are also boxed sets of 10mm figures from The Wargaming Company purpose-made for the rules for those who don't already have an Napoleonics collection.<br/><br/>The title, French for &quot;And without result!&quot;, is from Marshal Ney's comment on the indecisive yet bloody battle of Eylau.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Cooperative Game of Survival, Exploration, and Escape<br/><br/>Loosely based on Jules Verne's novel &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;<br/><br/>In the early 1860s, a hot-air balloon carrying six friends, crash landed on an uncharted island in the South Pacific Ocean. Together, they must craft, explore, and move during the day and fight off threats at night. Survivors will move across the island finding clues that will reveal story moments and help them how to escape the island. However, as they move toward their ultimate goal, time is running out, as a catastrophic event will unfold at the end of 30 days!<br/><br/>Mysterious Island is a cooperative survival game that uses an action point system for players to make strategic choices. In conjunction with those choices is the variability of cards drawn during the Day and Night Phases. These cards often will determine how players make their choices.<br/><br/>The Day and Night decks double as a &quot;timer&quot; for the end of game. Once they run out, the game is over and the survivors lose in catastrophic fashion. Of course, staying alive while searching for a way off the island is another adventure of its own.<br/><br/>The Craft and Explore decks offer the player ways to improve their skills and chance of survival. The 35 Craft cards will ALWAYS provide items to help survivors along their way. The 35 Explore cards have both positive and negative effects on the players depending what is drawn.<br/><br/>Out of the 130 cards used in a game, only 6 are doubles, which makes each game session very unique. These variables offer high re-playability and make the gaming experience different each time.<br/><br/>If you or someone you know love adventure games with elements of survival and exploration, give Mysterious Island a try!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The preferences are balanced so that no party has a greater likelihood of victory than any other.<br/><br/>Each player receives several points cards which indicate the points they will score for winning a given issue. Some are dealt face up and some are dealt face down, giving other players incomplete information about how much their rivals stand to gain on any given vote.<br/> Each round, players take turns nominating issues and casting votes in a rotating order.<br/><br/>Players can only cast a limited number of votes each round, which they must ration carefully.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players can form voting pacts with each other―however, the pacts are non-binding and so betrayal is always possible.<br/><br/>",

Each pigeon is a unique character. Each has its own art and limerick that tells a short, plucky story. But players and pigeons must watch their tail feathers, because there are Urban Vermin like Panhandler Possums and Pizza Rats who are out to pluck up their big city dreams.<br/><br/>Easy to learn and play but difficult - if not impossible - to master, you need a combination of memory, strategic pluckery, poker face and pluck of the draw to dupe other players into giving up their hard-earned pigeon cards. And just when you think you've won it all, an Urban Vermin could pluck up your game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You can all be victorious and live happily among celestials or you can all finish on the scaffold. Only you can decide your path, will you cooperate with your peers or will you try to be the only one to live?<br/><br/>Every move, every action, every card you play have consequences. Help a fellow comrade accomplish a mission and he can help you achieve your goal but, take the renown of a more ambitious fellow player and see how fast revenge will come.<br/><br/>Each turn, the active player chooses the mission he wants to do. He can either do it alone if he has enough profession or ask another player and share credits. By doing a mission you gain renown but the more you are, the less you gain.<br/><br/>Then, any player can play cards from their hands. They can either be good with you and help you out or they can try to steal your points or your own cards.<br/><br/>People will do missions and amass points until one if them gets 75 points. At this point you have only a few turn before the game ends and all of those with 75 will have won, all the other will lose their heads and die for good this time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/><br/>From inside front page with User Summary:<br/><br/>This book represents &quot;Amara Wintersword : Female Barbarian with Axe&quot; in the LOST WORLDS combat book games and is playable, with all other LOST WORLDS books.  Each book is unique and has its own special qualities.<br/><br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>This Special Convention Edition is identical to the other, except for a cover that depicts Amara in front of the castle, having lost the top portion of her armor.<br/><br/>",

Maybe you just need to liberate the participants of your corporate team building?<br/><br/>With the board game Gradus, you will not only diversify your fun but also get an unforgettable sensation and experience with a touch of the piquancy of adult competition. But what can I say: the roof will blow away completely from jokes, gags, eroticism, and alcohol. Everyone will play the board game Gradus because you simply won't be able to get out!<br/><br/>Hit the table with a Degree!<br/>Before the start, all players receive tablets, presented by the designer in the form of beer mugs, and tokens with the volume of alcohol consumed to record their achievements in conventional alcoholic drinks. Do you want to be limited to conventional alcohol and liters? Prepare thoroughly: a few bottles of pleasure and a good snack will not be superfluous. Companies of teetotalers can simply eat well and drink tea.<br/><br/>The set includes 6 decks of cards with different themes:<br/>Basic - it is also basic and participates in all mixes;<br/>Alkotresh - the name speaks for itself, so the tasks are tied to the &quot;alcohol&quot; part;<br/>Move your body - tasks from this deck will crush your bodies sitting at the table;<br/>Tin - the special coolness of the tasks will blow anyone's mind;<br/>Spicy - a little eroticism will not hurt;<br/>Brain ON - don't want to move your body - move your brains. Components of the game Degree<br/><br/>It is recommended to use no more than three task decks in one game party, shuffling two more decks from the base one if desired. A menu with a standard section and a part of wishes is also available for players.<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to reach the liter or two-liter value on their tablet by drinking or drinking points. Points are awarded after completing a specific task.<br/><br/>So, you are in an entertainment establishment, and just burn with the desire to drink! Wait for your turn and, in the clockwise direction, make a move: take a card from the general deck and announce your task to all participants. If you successfully complete the task, you will receive a point by noting the amount taken internally on the tablet. Please note that if you refuse to fulfill the conditions, then you drink a free &quot;penalty&quot; for which points are not awarded.<br/><br/>During the game, you can use the menu once and drink your points to order any dish for another participant. The standard section is available at any time during the game, and the Wish Menu is available after completing the task. If the victim of your choice did not complete the task, then, like all losers, he drinks a &quot;penalty&quot;, while receiving the right to use the Menu for free.<br/><br/>The board game Degree can be adapted to suit any company by using suitable decks, making some decks suitable for families as well.<br/><br/>",

From a hand of 5, players play a card at a time, either deducting from or dividing into the current sum. Totals start at 101 each hand and go down to as close to 0 as possible. The catch is: If card played divides into the sum without remainder then it may not be deducted but must divide. (For instance a 5 played to 20 must divide for 4 rather than deduct for 15, whereas a 3 must deduct since it can't divide into 20 evenly.)<br/><br/>An Ace counts either 1 or 11. A Jack played repeats the same value as the previous card. A Queen reverses the digits of the current count. However, you may only play a Queen if reversing the digits reduces the count. A King divides by any desired number higher than 1 and lower than the current, provided that it leaves no remainder.<br/><br/>The hand ends when one player plays their last card or is unable to play without going below zero.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "迷宮推理 (Labyrinthine Mystery) is an asynchronous cooperative game for 3 to 5 players. Players are guests who have been invited by the owner of a grand manor on a snowy winter night. While the guests have never met each other before this night, they share one thing in common: they all have their own reasons for hating the owner of the manor and have designs on his death. When the owner turns up dead, everyone realizes that a formal police investigation might end of leading back to their own person&hellip;so they decide to resolve it among themselves by collecting evidence to find the murderer concealed amidst their numbers.<br/><br/>If the players can expose the true identity of the murderer and reveal the tricks and weapon he or she used within the time constraints, they win. Oppositely, if the guilty party is able to deceive everyone and go undetected, that person wins the game.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player can chose to either investigate, accuse, or make a final accusation. Every action costs minutes of the player's limited time.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the time is consumed or if the murderer is discovered.<br/><br/>According to the publisher blurb, this version improves on the original Mystery Homes (2018) by adding new murder weapons, tricks, and changes to the scenario. Aspects of the components/box have also been improved based on feedback from the previous game.<br/><br/>",

It will be your job to finish genetic codes for our dinosaurs so we can sell them for profit. We can get a little competitive here, the boss has promised extra money to the scientist that finishes each dinosaur first. Oh and try to ignore those people across the way at Embryonic Inc, they are always bribing our employees trying to get our secrets, you aren't that type of person are you?<br/><br/>Jurassico is a roll-and-write game heavily inspired by the process of reconstructing dinosaur DNA as seen in Jurassic Park. To do this, the players share a common pool of dice and take turns selecting pairs of dice to utilize, crossing off their sum from their scoring sheet (representing different dinosaur genomes, with six sets of genes needed to complete each), then re-roll the used pair for the next player.<br/><br/>Much as in Jurassic Park, it is possible to take shortcuts by splicing your DNA with that of modern reptiles and amphibians, modifying dice values and/or colors, but the uses of this ability are limited only do this a limited number of times for each die. It is also (again inspired by the events of the book and the movie) possible to sell samples to a competitor (Embryonic, Inc) to earn additional points.<br/><br/>The game continues until a player reaches five points based on the genomes they have completed and/or sold to the competition. There is also a solo mode where the player tries to reach a set points goal before Embryonic does.<br/><br/>",

There is an old mansion surrounded by disturbing rumours: &ldquo;The owner, a wealthy man, was devoted to ancient and blasphemous cult.&rdquo;, &ldquo;A decade ago, the inhabitants suddenly vanished.&rdquo;, &ldquo;All who entered the mansion disappeared, and the few who returned took their own lives soon after.&rdquo;&hellip; The many strange phenomena that occur here hold a dark fascination attracting experts in mysticism and magic. Then, one day, the mansion is visited by a new group of people: A team of investigators from Miskatonic University. How they will end up only depends on the mysterious girl who will hold their fate in her hands&hellip;<br/><br/>Madness Hour is an asymmetrical cooperative game of exploration, based on the Cthulhu Mythos by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. One of the players takes the role of the mysterious girl, while the others play investigators, searching for ancient artefacts and trying to escape from a dangerous mansion. You won&rsquo;t know whether the girl you will encounter in the mansion is human or something more terrifying. The girl&rsquo;s intentions will depend on her identity, and she will manipulate and change the course of the investigators and the objects they hold. As they investigate, they will have to try and figure out what she is and what she is not.<br/><br/>The mysterious relics that the investigators find in the mansion will drive them into madness and turn them into something else. The investigation within the dark mansion is a mixture of madness and suspicion, leading to unexpected consequences. Will you be able to unravel the true identity of the mysterious girl who controls your destiny and escape from the mansion &ndash; while still being human&hellip;?<br/><br/>",

Each player in turn places their block on the board, with their tower fitting into a hole in this block and their ball placed on top of their tower.<br/><br/>Once everyone is ready, play begins, with each player in turn using a finger to push their block toward the blocks of other players. If you knock someone else's block off the board or dislodge their ball without yours falling out, then you receive a boar token as a reward. If you dislodge your own ball or you take too long and your ball comes to rest inside your tower, each other player receives a pig token as a punishment to you.<br/><br/>When someone scores, reset the board, then start a new round with the player to the left of the previous starting player.<br/><br/>Whoever collects ten tokens first wins!<br/><br/>",

In a round metal box (cinematic bobbin), 2 packages of 100 photos, original dashboard, wooden pawns and dice.<br/><br/>The board has a similar use as with trivia games, there is no start and end, but it's purpose is to stop over different frames (places) to be asked different questions about the movie between: &quot;title&quot; by doing pantomime or verbally by looking at the picture, &quot;director&quot;, and &quot;actors/actresses&quot;. For that, a pawn and a dice are used giving you the option to select the type of questions that you are most familiar with. One side of the card is showing a scene from the movie, while the other has the title, director and actors/actresses involved.<br/><br/>When a movie card is played, the player/team has to answer the question to win it. If he/she/they can't reply then the next player has the opportunity to do so, etc. A movie card never returns to the pile.<br/><br/>The goal is to collect as many movie cards as possible throughout the game. The game ends if all the cards from the deck are finished of when the predefined time has passed. The player with the most cards on hand is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On Base Baseball is a Sabermetric-driven tabletop baseball game using cards, charts, and dice. Using real MLB players gamers can recreate many modern and classic games and seasons. At its heart, On Base is a game engine that you can change and add to as you like. It is basic enough to be played quickly (similar to basic APBA or Strat-o-matic) but, through gamer mods, it can become more nuanced.<br/><br/>There are carded seasons for the game and there are whole decades of roster sheets available. The older cards have at bat outcomes right on the cards while newer card sets and roster sheets give you the values to use while playing the game but the outcomes are found on the game engine chart--the heart of the game.<br/><br/>Game play is based off of some of the original dice baseball games from the early 20th century--roll two d6 dice and a d9 (or d10). From that roll result the gamer cross references the player's game play values against the roll number to find the outcome of the at bat.<br/><br/>One of the unique features of the game is the pitcher/hitter interaction. Every at bat starts with the pitcher. If there is an outcome for the pitcher then the at bat is complete. If the outcome for the pitcher is blank then the outcome comes from the batter. The game is based on the DIPS Sabermetric theory so pitchers will affect strikeouts, walks, and home runs based on their ability to control those outcomes in real life.<br/><br/>",

The overly nice kitchen ladies keep the extra portions coming and your evil school mates try to get rid of their collection by tossing it on your food pile.<br/><br/>This is an easy to understand quick and fun card game. Each card has a color and a food on it. You start with three in your hand, no cards in your food pile, and one card in the common discard pile. The goal is to have less cards in your foodpile than the others when the deck runs out. In your turn you can play cards from your hand or your foodpile if the color or the food mathes the top card on the discard pile. You can continue playing cards until you don't have any that matches or you decide to stop. Kitchen staff, classmate and school pet action cards help you to get rid of your food pile, often by giving cards to other players.<br/><br/>",

The game requires four Rivals: in case you are only 2 or 3 players, the game itself will manage the other Rivals according to special &rdquo;AI rules&rdquo;. In this way, players may leave and join during the game: the &rdquo;AI&rdquo; will manage a team while they are gone.<br/><br/>The base rules of the game are simple, but choices can be tricky. A round consists of all Rivals playing their matches simultaneously. Each Rival has to play two cards (a blue and an orange card) on a team in any other match than their own: but each team can only hold one card. A blue card gives scoring chances to both your team and the team you play it on, and an orange card gives scoring chances to both your opponent and the opponent you play it on. As the game progresses, more rules are added that have the Rivals affect their cards with &rdquo;success points&rdquo; that are assembled by winning games.<br/><br/>The game has all the licenses required, so the teams, logos, and arenas are picked from the real world (teams like Malm&ouml; FF, IFK G&ouml;teborg etc). No knowledge of football is required, but the game is highly competitive as it requires you to win as many matches as you can &ndash; and subsequently have other Rivals preferrably lose their games.<br/><br/>",

If you translate German idioms into the English language you don't get the correct English equivalent, but rather a funny English sentence. Then it's not English, it's Denglish (&quot;D&quot; for Deutsch = German). So one by one the players draw a card and have to translate the Denglish sentences into German and then also have to find the correct English phrase. Only if a player can translate the Denglish phrase into German and then correctly into English they can keep the card. The more cards the players collect the more points they earn. Whoever earns most points wins.<br/><br/>This version includes idioms about daily routines in the office and business-related topics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Line Dice (ラインダイス), your goal is to reach your finish line first with your six dice.<br/><br/>Each player has their own movement track with six lanes for their six racing dice. The racing dice all start off the board on their 1 symbol, which is also wild. On your first turn or two, you'll roll two six-sided dice, choose a die, flip a racing die to the matching number, then place it in the &quot;start&quot; space at the beginning of the lane; you'll then repeat this process with the other die.<br/><br/>Once you have at least one die in a starting space, on a turn you roll the two six-sided dice, then use each die to either change the face of one of your racing dice or advance a racing die of the matching number. If you create a line of racing dice of the same number, say, two 4s that are adjacent to one another, then you can use a rolled 4 to move both of the racing dice four spaces at the same time. (A 1 counts as all numbers, so it automatically creates a line when adjacent to another racing die.)<br/><br/>If you land one of your dice on a change space in a lane, you can change an opponent's die to the value of your choice.<br/><br/>You must land a racing die in the goal space at the end of the lane by exact count. If you would have extra movement, then you move the racing die backwards in the lane until the full value of the die is used. However, if you land a racing die in the penultimate space in a lane, then when you roll that number again, you can push that racing die forward one space onto the goal.<br/><br/>Get all six of your racing dice onto the goals first, and you win. Alternatively, you can play multiple games, with each player scoring points for the face value of the racing dice in the goals and losing points for dice that didn't make it, with jokers now counting for -10 points.<br/><br/>",

Only the tycoon with the most successful ski area after 2 seasons takes over management of the mountain. Find synergies to make the most out of each turn and maximize your resources. The winner is the one with the most victory points from buildings, chairlifts, delivered skiers, and the completion of your goal cards.<br/><br/>Alpenglow is an engine building game that combines several familiar game mechanics to create a fun yet challenging experience. The game has elements of tile laying, card playing, and network building combined in two core areas: the mountain where you build your ski area competitively and the village where you expand the town to attract skiers collaboratively with the other players. The game includes starter tiles that allow for variable setup so that each game is unique!<br/><br/>During each season, you will take turns picking up skiers and taking actions to expand your ski area by playing run cards, adding buildings to the village, building chairlifts, and opening your ski area to allow skiers to hit your slopes.

Every round, players roll their action dice as quickly as they can and perform actions based on the symbol they roll. Every choice carries weight as the clock is always ticking.

You start with a 4x4 square of umbrellas, with four each of four colors. One umbrella of each color starts in a &quot;waiting zone&quot; to your left and right (with these being shared with the players sitting in those directions), a &quot;waiting zone&quot; in the center of play (shared by all players), and a &quot;waiting zone&quot; below your personal game board (shared by no one else). Start with two stacks of two figure tiles on your game board. Each figure tile shows you an arrangement of umbrellas in a single color that you want to create on your board.<br/><br/>On a turn, take an umbrella from an adjacent waiting zone, then slide it onto your game board from the direction of that area, pushing out an umbrella into the waiting zone on the opposite side. If you've created a unicolor umbrella arrangement that matches a visible figure tile on your board, place a scoring token on an empty space of the matching color on your scoreboard, then pass the figure tile to the player on your left; they place this tile on their board in the first empty figure space, rotating the tile to match the depicted orientation.<br/><br/>Continue taking turns in clockwise order until a player has no figure tiles in front of them, a player has ten scoring tokens on their scoreboard, or a player empties the pool of scoring tokens by taking the final one. Each other player takes one turn, then everyone scores their points: 2 points per scoring token, a variable number of points for groups of tokens (which differs per scoreboard), and points based on the number of umbrellas in their personal waiting zone.<br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific game.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Living elements interweave throughout the realm. A water guardian extinguishes a roaring wildfire that leaves behind unrecognizably scorched earth. The seared avatar of that earth rises and consumes the water of a dozen seas. With infinite variations on their eternal cycle, no element can ever reign supreme.<br/><br/>Mysticana is a Foundation Deck: an 18-card deck that includes multiple core games using just the base cards with even more games added through small expansions. The deck features cards with 6 ranks across 3 suits (elements) which have a &ldquo;rock-paper-scissors&rdquo; hierarchy. While each game might make use of the deck&rsquo;s design in different ways, the flexible foundation enables new games to fit in seamlessly alongside previous entries.<br/><br/>The base deck includes rules for three core games:<br/><br/>     Nine Perils: a quick but puzzly solo game of arranging a sequence of events that will avert nine disasters.<br/>     Sorcerers' Showdown: a game of outplaying your opponent, calculated risks, shrinking hands, and rising chaos.<br/>     The Path Ahead: a light game where players take turns guessing whether what lies ahead on the path is stronger or weaker than what they&rsquo;ve already encountered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nine Perils<br/><br/>The prophecy foretells nine great perils, warnings of coming doom. As a seer, you must peer into the future and find a path to avoid these perils.<br/><br/>A solo-only game of limited information and anticipating the future to avert nine disasters using the Mysticana deck. Using your hand of cards (based on the difficulty chosen) play against the central timeline of 9 peril cards. Each turn you&rsquo;ll flip one of the peril cards in the timeline face-up, draw a new card into your hand, then play a single from your hand into a free space in a separate row below any peril card. After 9 turns, compare each peril&rsquo;s rank and element against the adajcent card&rsquo;s rank and element. Each of the perils must be successfully outmatched to win!<br/><br/>Sorcerers' Showdown<br/><br/>Two sorcerers clash in battle, each spell and counterspell growing less predictable as they wear down.<br/><br/>A dueling-like game for 2 players using the Mysticana deck. In the first round, players are dealt 8 cards and choose 6 to battle with, setting aside 2 to hold onto for the next round. The first player then plays a card to start a clash. The other player responds with a card of their own, matching the element if possible. The clash is evaluated by rank and element, with the winner capturing both cards. Should an Avatar (rank ⟐) win a clash, the winner steals a pair of previously captured cards from their opponent. Clashes are played and resolved until both players are out of cards. Should one player have all of the captured cards, they win! Otherwise, players take the 2 cards set aside at the beginning of the round and draw a hand size that is 1 card less than the previous round to continue the duel.<br/><br/>The Path Ahead<br/><br/>In every corner of the realm, travelers engage in a timeless game of deduction and chance.<br/><br/>A guessing game for 2-4 players that uses the Mysticana deck. Each round, the active player guesses whether the next card drawn will be stronger or weaker than the currently showing card (accounting for rank and suit). A correct guess moves play to the next player; an incorrect guess earns a consequence card. These may count against the player&rsquo;s score if not used to make a set of matching consequences. At the end of each round, players add up any consequence cards they still hold and add it to their running score from previous rounds. The game is over when any player hits 20 points, with the lowest-scoring player the ultimate winner.<br/><br/>",

Two rivaling mafia families are fighting for control of the city, and they use all means available.<br/>The major is corrupt, the police powerless and the villagers despair...<br/><br/>In the game Mafia the goal, you goal is to become the new Godfather in Calozone's underworld. By placing mafioso pieces on strategic places you try to get control of 5 of the city's 9 areas before your opponent. If you play your cards right, you may capture your opponent's pieces and make them your own. But beware: One smart move may create a chain reaction on the board, and the road from success to fiasco is short.<br/><br/>Mafia may be played as an exiting duel game for 2, or as a fierce team game for 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>(Translated from the box in Norwegian)<br/><br/>",

Whoever does it first wins a card. The game continues until the end of the deck and whoever wins the most wins.<br/>Thanks to the variants included in the rules, you can try different game modes: for example, you turn 5 categories and you have to say words that belong to them, or each player has his own deck of cards and whoever finishes it first wins, or there are 5 letters in the middle of the table and you have to say a word that contains the largest number.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Briefly: Scrabble with poker hands.<br/><br/>Deal Me In is a board game in which players collect tiles (which represent playing cards) and attempt to lay them on the board so as they form poker hands. The higher the hand, the greater the score. The poker hands interlock in the same way as the words on a scrabble board, so it`s possible to score for more than one hand on a turn. When a player scores, he/she takes score chips from the box. the player with the highest scoring number of chips when the cards run out is the winner.<br/>Simple, fast and fairly enjoyable; but very lightweight. An opener/closer.<br/><br/>The bits: One board, comprising an 11x11 grid. most of the spaces are blank, but some have representations of playing cards on them; these are bonus squares, a la scrabble.<br/><br/>56 &quot;playing cards&quot;. These are actually good quality cardboard tiles.<br/><br/>30 No Entry tiles.<br/><br/>4 playing racks<br/><br/>Poker chips in various denominations<br/><br/>Each player starts with chips worth 150 and 7 tiles. These are placed in the playing rack.<br/>the four joker tiles are laid on the Joker squres on the board.<br/><br/>Players must, on their turn lay at least one card on the board to form a legitimate poker hand, or failing that change one or more tiles at a cost of 10 per tile.<br/><br/>Tiles laid must extend hands already played, again in the same way as scrabble. <br/>Players do not have to lay five cards at a time. For example, a player could form four of a kind simply by laying three tiles of the same denomination next to a previous tile with that denomination.<br/><br/>bonuses are scored by laying tiles on the special bonus squares on the board. Again, these squares have representations of playing cards on them and in order to score, you must lay the tile of the same denomination as the bonus square in order to score.<br/>When a five card poker hand has been formed on the board, it can no longer be extended, so a No Entry tile must be laid at either end of the hand to stop any further tiles from being added.<br/>If a hand is played so it covers a Joker tile, this tile is taken up and added to the players` hand.<br/>If a Joker is laid as part of a hand, it may be replaced with the correct tile which it represents on a later turn.<br/>When a player lays a hand down, he/she takes poker chips to the value of the hand. This varies from 10 for a pair, to 1000 for a royal flush.<br/>When the cards run out, scores are totted up and the player with the highest value in chips is declared the winner.<br/><br/><br/>",

The dice represent tribal spirits that must be restored in an ancient ritual to save the tribe and determine the new chieftain.  A spirit is fully restored when it shows the highest number, and when it shows that number, each one grants the player a different special power that can be invoked one time to influence the other dice in the game.  Players can also re-roll matching dice.<br/><br/>Victory is predicated on strategic planning for which dice to re-roll, when and what order to invoke special powers, and some luck.  The solitaire game provides a score, whether won or lost, that a player can attempt to improve over successive games.  The multiplayer game has an adjustible game length and a high level of interaction.<br/><br/>Although current electronic implementations of the game allow only solitaire and three player multiplayer, it is possible to play with any number of players, and a special &quot;chaos rule&quot; allows for large groups to play the game without any downtime, as they can invoke their special powers out of turn order.<br/><br/>",

Is there a clue hidden in the letters? Could there be more to discover in the fog-bound alleys of London town? This ingenious new series is a spin on the current urban craze for &lsquo;Escape Rooms&rsquo;, in which participants are locked in rooms, and must solve the puzzles they find there to make good their escape. Here, the book becomes the locked room, the pages become the path, and the reader can take on a challenge every bit as brain-teasing from the comfort of their own home. Visual clues are hidden among the intriguing illustrations; fiendish riddles, logic puzzles, and timed challenges unlock hidden doors and reveal the direction of travel; and mathematical problems provide the codes required to follow the correct path. There are maps and mazes to explore; references to the original Sherlock Holmes adventures to unravel; and a code-wheel that holds the key to unlocking the next page. Solve the puzzles correctly to escape. Get them wrong, and you will find yourself further and further along the path to your own demise.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The successor to XTR's classic NATO, Nukes, and Nazis, this new version is a &quot;What If&quot; two-map mini-monster wargame set during the late-1980s in an alternative universe in which the Nazi regime survived World War II and is set to start World War III.<br/><br/>Each turn of play equals half a week of real time. Each hexagon on both maps represents 20 miles (32.5 km) from side to opposite side. The system is based around the central idea that large First World armies (as well as those from elsewhere that have been trained and equipped to try to perform like First World armies) almost always begin major wars seemingly well prepared. Unfortunately for those in their front-line units, both the training and equipment usually only make them ready for the previous war, not the one they're about to fight. Beyond that, the initial period of such wars is characterized by only a partially abandoned peacetime psychology among the officers and enlisted. That is, no one as yet appreciates what it means operatively to be in an all-out war. All that comes together to give overall performance high-risk, volatile and fragile qualities: no one as yet really knows what's actually possible or wise to try to accomplish. Seemingly powerful units therefore easily become &quot;disrupted&quot;--especially as gauged in relation to similar units' performances later, after everyone's been thoroughly schooled in the art of war as it exists in the present. The system therefore doesn't play--when looked at on a step by step basis--in a way common to division-level simulations. The whole thing has a &quot;Go&quot; like quality to it. The commander will succeed best who--rather than reacting to or launching operations opportunistically one at a time--plans his campaign and then campaigns on that plan. Of course, we all know it's also true &quot;no plan survives first contact with the enemy.&quot; So, even as you plan, you must do so while leaving within your overall scheme at least some capacity for opportunism. Strategy is not simple; it is complex.<br/><br/>The initiating change to history behind this game is as follows. Early in the spring of 1943, one of the historically failed assassination plots attempted against Hitler during that period actually succeeded. In short, that allowed the German high command to go over to a fully rationalized defense at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. Long story short: the Third Reich survived WW2 in truncated form (see the maps). The new rulers in Berlin soon thereafter set in place their own &quot;Warsaw Pact,&quot; an alliance among Germany, the Baltic republics, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Balkan countries north of Greece. The Allies reacted by creating NATO, which rump-Russia eagerly joined. By 1980, the same kind of rot that afflicted the USSR in our timeline began to set in within the Third Reich. Here, though, instead of initiating a German version of Perestroika and Glasnost, those ruling in Berlin decided to roll the dice on one all-out and final war for global domination. This game presents that war (or at least the two main theaters within it).<br/><br/>The components to a complete boxed game of NNN2 include rules, two map-sheets, and three sheets of die-cut counters (also called &quot;units&quot; and &quot;unit counters&quot;). Dice and charts and tables are also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The thematic setting of the game is the North American prairie as it was first being settled in the late 1800's and early 1900's.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to build the most profitable farming operation.  Each player starts with a cash loan and one of 57 available sections of land, and may buy more land on any turn.  On each section of land, players may plant one of four crops or raise one of four kinds of livestock. <br/> Each turn represents one of the four seasons.  The game consists of 20 turns (five &quot;years&quot; or full crop cycles).  Each turn or season is divided into 3 phases which are played simultaneously by all players.  In the &quot;Purchase&quot; phase players may buy land and animals and (if in season) plant crops.  The &quot;Event&quot; phase consists of drawing cards which introduce events or conditions which may or may not affect players.  For example, when a Tornado or Oil Strike event is drawn, a die roll mechanism is used to select specific land sections which are affected. In the &quot;Harvest&quot; phase, players sell any mature crops or livestock at the market price listed on a master Harvest card drawn for that turn.<br/><br/>Players may pay off their initial loan at any time.  The amount due (representing combined principal and interest) grows substantially each &quot;year&quot;.  After the final turn, the player with the most cash left after paying off the loan is the winner.  Land and other permanent farming assets may not be sold to raise cash.  This simulates the practice of the first generation retiring and handing the farming operation intact to the next generation.<br/><br/>The game mechanism allows for solitaire play, in which the object would be to record a personal best amount of cash at the end.  The primary effect of introducing more players is the competition for prime farmland.  The length of play is not affected greatly since each phase is played simultaneously by all.  Game testing showed a substantial increase in speed of play after players had played 2-3 times.  For a game in which most or all players are novices, allow 4 hours.<br/><br/>Although the game includes a substantial amount of luck (farmers cannot control weather or market prices) it cannot be won by luck alone.  Successful players will learn how to best farm different types of land (it is not all equal), manage risk, and select appropriate crop or livestock strategies (the various options include a wide range of risk/reward trade offs).<br/><br/>The game could be used in an educational setting either to illustrate the historical settling of the prairies or to demonstrate the basics of investing in any context (managing risk, balancing a portfolio, using leverage, etc.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Faro, Pharaoh, or Farobank, is a late 17th-century French gambling card game descendant of basset, and belongs to the lansquenet and Monte Bank family of games, in that it is played between a banker and several players winning or losing according to the cards turned up matching those already exposed or not.<br/><br/>Although not a direct relative of poker, faro was played by the masses alongside its other popular counterpart, due to its fast action, easy-to-learn rules, and better odds than most games of chance. The game of faro is played with only one deck of cards and allows for any number of players.<br/><br/>A game of faro was often called a faro bank. It was played with an entire deck of playing cards. One person was designated the &quot;banker&quot; and an indeterminate number of players, known as &quot;punters&quot;, could be admitted. Chips (called &quot;checks&quot;) were purchased by the punter from the banker (or house) from which the game originated. Bet values and limits were set by the house. Usual check values were 50 cents to $10 each.<br/><br/>The faro table was typically oval, covered with green baize, and had a cutout for the banker. A board with a standardized betting layout consisting of all cards of one suit pasted to it in numerical order, called the &quot;layout&quot;, was placed on top of the table. Traditionally, the suit of spades was used for the layout. Each player laid his stake on one of the 13 cards on the layout. Players could place multiple bets and could bet on multiple cards simultaneously by placing their bet between cards or on specific card edges. Players also had the choice of betting on the &ldquo;high card&rdquo; bar located at the top of the layout.<br/><br/>Faro was popular in eighteenth century Europe and nineteenth century America, particularly on the frontier. It was also often rigged since it did not offer the house a substantial advantage. Once gambling houses became more regulated and cheating was less tolerated, Faro declined. By 1985 it was no longer played in any of the Nevada casinos. It is remembered today mostly by historians and associated with some of its most famous players and dealers, including Casanova, Charles James Fox, Wyatt Earp, and John &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday.<br/><br/>",

Hopefully, a tiny excess of matter survived, about 1 particle per billion, providing the building blocks of the Universe we live in. Find your antiplayer and re-fight that clash between matter and antimatter. Physics is the only rule!<br/><br/>Big*Bang is an abstract game with a strong theme, the first minutes of our Universe. On an elongated hexagonal grid, one player tries to fuse protons and neutrons in order to form Hydrogen and Helium, while the other fuses antiprotons and antineutrons in order to form antiHydrogen and antiHelium. However, every turn they will have the choice: fuse their own nuclei, or annihilate the opponent's?<br/><br/>The three victory conditions (produce the most light through annihilation, form the most Helium, and form the most massive star) force players to find an equilibrium between the different options, that quickly shrink with the board as nuclei fuse and annihilate. The rules are simple, the playtime short, and you might learn some Physics!<br/><br/>NB: The turn sequence has been streamlined in March 2018, please download the new rulebook from the publisher page if you bought the game before! Also note that now there are several puzzles that allow solitaire play.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>",

He should command the explorers on a failed mission, trying to save their lives. Or become the mind-control mind of genetically modified humanoids who instinctively try to get free.<br/><br/>During the game, the players move the figures around the board in an effort to bring all three of their figures from one end of the board to the other side before the opponent. Note that there is no room to spare at The Base. It is very likely that over time there will be a fierce battle for every step. As time passes inexorably, The Base gets closer to its destruction every moment!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get all three figures to the other side of The Base first. The figure is in the goal when it reaches any of the opponent's starting fields. Time is limited to twenty rounds. After that time, The Base will explode. If by the time of the explosion, neither player has managed to save all the figures, the one with the most saved figures wins.<br/><br/>The player combines during his move two actions - moving the figures on the game plan and uncovering and rotating the plan tiles. Each plan tile has several entrances or full walls, depending on its orientation.<br/>The strategy for rotating tiles is to try to open the easiest way possible to the target while closing the path of the opponent. By effectively rotating tiles, we create obstacles that will slow your opponent down on his or her way or make it impossible for a while!<br/><br/>",

Build the strongest ship, stock it with ammunition, a fearless crew, and a fast engine. Then engage in a do or die dogfight to see who will have supremacy over the Federation of Air Pirates.<br/><br/>An Aether Captains Pirate Skirmish Game <br/>for 2 to 4 players<br/><br/>What's Needed to Play<br/>the set of components in the downloadable PDF (ship tiles, 3 ship building dice)<br/>10d6 per player<br/>1 damage marker per player<br/>1d12 (optional)<br/><br/>There are 2 phases: Build and Battle<br/><br/>1. Build Phase<br/><br/>Players take turns throwing the 3 ship building dice trying to make combinations of 2 and 3 colors. You are allowed up to 2 rolls for each throw and may re-roll 0, 1, 2, or 3 dice, as you choose, on your second roll. Each player will make 10 throws to build and stock their ships. Make your throw and pass the dice to the next player until everyone has had their 10 throws.<br/><br/>Different color dice combinations will allow you to activate a section of your ship (you only activate a ship section once) and then stock it with resources for the battle phase. Each activated ship section is also worth one damage rating point towards your total ship so it is advised that during the build phase to try and activate as many sections of your ship as possible. The black die icon counts as a wildcard and can be applied to any ship section or resource.<br/><br/>Rules include a players aid chart for resource combination.<br/><br/>2. Battle Phase<br/><br/>Once everyone has built their ships it is time to battle in a set of skirmishes between players. Each player should roll the 1d12 once at the start of the battle. Reroll any ties. Whoever rolls highest has initiative to begin the battle skirmishes and goes first.<br/><br/>This person is the Attacker. They must pick one person to attack who will be the Defender. Both then roll their 3d6 battle dice simultaneously, hiding one and revealing the other two.<br/><br/>Players may use as many resources (from the resource dice on your ship sections) as they like to get the highest possible total for the two dice showing (be strategic however, there are many battles to come and you may not want to use all of your resources at one time). If you use a resource, rotate the resource die face down one number (i.e. 3 to 2) on that ship section. If you use the last resource, remove the die from the ship section.<br/><br/>Then the hidden dice of both players are revealed. Whoever has the highest total is the winner of that skirmish. The loser should move their damage rating marker down one skull icon to the left on their ship. The loser then becomes the next Attacker. In the event of a tie, neither player loses any damage rating points and the Defender becomes the next Attacker.<br/><br/>If your damage rating marker ever is moved to the Tail Section, your ship has been disabled and you are out of the battle.<br/><br/>Play until one person is victorious.<br/><br/>",

But Frido the fox knows about the picnic too and he's lying in wait! As soon as the alarm call sounds, all the rabbits run off. Will you be the one who is best at calculating the fox risk and manages to collect four rabbits and four carrots on your picnic blanket first?<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Collect four rabbit and four carrot tiles to earn a candy token. Earn two candy tokens to win the game.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>The tiles (16 rabbits, 19 carrots, 7 foxes) are put in the tile bag. 3 tiles are removed from the game, without anyone knowing what they are (there is a variant with no tiles being removed). Each player gets a board showing a picnic blanket with designated spaces for four rabbits and four carrots. Players take turns. On your turn, you draw a tile from the bag. <br/>If it is a carrot or rabbit, place it next to your board. Then you may keep drawing tiles as long as they show either a carrot or rabbit. You can stop drawing tiles at any point. When you decided to stop, you first place the carrots on your board. For each carrot, you may also place a rabbit. Tiles for which you don't have enough space on your board, or rabbits for which there are no carrots, go back to the bag.<br/>If you draw a fox, the rabbits flee and you have to put all the rabbits and carrots drawn during this turn back into the bag. The fox tile is put into the fox den (i.e. it doesn't go back to the bag). Then the next player's turn starts.<br/><br/>The round ends when a player has collected four carrots and four rabbits on his/her board. The player gets a candy token. All carrots, rabbits and foxes are returned to the bag and a new round starts.<br/>The game ends when a player has collected two candy tokens. He/she wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There is one role of sheriff and other players are split evenly to gangsters and deputies. After role assigning players are split in two different rooms. In each room players have some time (until they're ready) to vote for a room leader. The room leader chooses two (depending on the number of players) hostages which he will change for other two hostages from another room.<br/><br/>Additionally each player has a gun with 4 bullets. A player may anytime shoot to anyone. If a player gets shot 7 times he/she's dead and eliminated from the game. The sheriff may not be eliminated, he's got a bulletproof vest. When he gets shot 7 times he shows his card and now everyone in that room knows who the sheriff is.<br/><br/>A player may anytime freely negotiate with others and also show his role card to anyone. But the players may not show their cards at the same time. They may consult to do it one after the other but no agreement is valid at anytime.<br/><br/>The goal of the sheriff is to have in his room at the end of the game more deputies than gangsters. In that case he wins and every other alive deputy also wins. If the sheriff does not meet his goal, every gangster who's alive wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of Shacru is to acquire as many squares of your color on the board as possible before the game is over.  The board is a 9 by 9 grid divided into 9 borderlands of 3 by 3 squares (could now be mistaken for Sudoku!), and at the start of the game all of the squares are neutral (not colored).<br/><br/>With 2 players there are four pieces (aka chevrons) each, with 3 or 4 players three pieces each.<br/><br/>Each time you move a piece the square you move onto becomes your color.  You can move onto neutral squares, or squares of your own color, but not onto squares of a different color.  So the game focuses on blocking the pieces of other players, and avoiding your pieces becoming blocked.<br/><br/>Pieces move only forwards (forwards directly or forwards to left or right).  When a piece crosses a border the player can twist the piece 45 degrees to the left or right.<br/><br/>The game ends when no player can gain any more squares of their color (either because none of their pieces can move, or because they can only move around onto squares that are already their colour).<br/><br/>Shacru was first published as part of the Pacru 101 game, and again with the Pacru 302 game.  It can also be played with crayons and paper with the addition of some colored chevron/arrow shaped pieces to move around the paper.  Free software exists at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.pacru.com/shacru.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.pacru.com/shacru.html</a>.<br/><br/>The game is suitable for anyone aged five years or over.<br/><br/>Separate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru &amp; Azacru as opinions vary widely on the 3 games.<br/><br/>",

It's quite possible that even the murderer him or herself is not aware of what happened last night, since barely anyone remembers anything. Unfortunately, according to the ancient laws of Labamba, the one that kills the Archmage may become a powerful Darchmage, bringing Darkness onto the land. And if there is one thing that Darkness hates, it's fun, techno, lasers and glitter &ndash; which is all that is dear to the magical folk.<br/>Thus, it's time to pull yourselves together, put your holo detective hats on your aching heads and catch the killer, before he grows too powerful!<br/><br/>RAVEHARD: Magiczna Gra Karciana is a party game that mixes elements of classic card battle games, games of deduction and deception, as well as more cooperative titles. It's meant to be played by 2-5 players aged 12 and more.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, which lasts three rounds, the players will have to work together in order to discover who killed the Archmage during the magical rave party yesternight. To achieve this goal, they'll have to overcome dangerous obstacles, including boss fights (each boss capable of summoning powerful minions) and unpredictable events. After each round the players gain a new clue which sheds some light on the last night's incident and points towards a possible murder weapon.<br/>If the players manage to survive all three rounds, they reach the Archmage's Chamber. There they may incapacitate one of them, should they be certain that he's the killer. If they are correct &ndash; they win the game; if they are wrong &ndash; the murderer steps out of the shadows and attacks the rest of the players. The side that emerges victorious from this final confrontation wins the game.<br/><br/>Do not trust anyone &ndash; not even yourself! Each player starts the game with two different objects which may turn out to be the murder weapons &ndash; or they may prove your innocence. During your turn you may switch the objects with those belonging to other players in order to frame them and clear your name. However, not until the very end will it be possible to tell which object is really the murder weapon. Thus, during the game you'll have to bluff, form alliances, deceive and distract, both openly &ndash; and secretly, using the Flirt Cards that let you pass private messages, scheme and conspire (and flirt).<br/><br/>This game is for you if you enjoy playing such titles as Magic: The Gathering, Munchkin, Hero Realms, Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards, Love Letter, Mascarade, Coup, Not Alone, PENNY DREADFUN: Duchy, Demony, Dickensy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Źle się dzieje w magicznym świecie Labamba&hellip;<br/><br/>Doroczna techno-impreza, na kt&oacute;rej musi pojawić się każdy<br/>szanujący się mag i czarodziejka, była tak epicka, że o poranku<br/>skacowani i zmęczeni goście odkryli, że ktoś zamordował<br/>Arcymaga!<br/>Nie wiadomo jak, nie wiadomo kiedy. Prawdopodobnie nawet sam<br/>morderca nie wie, co zrobił, bo mało kto pamięta wydarzenia<br/>wspomnianej nocy. Niestety, według odwiecznych praw Labamby,<br/>zab&oacute;jca Arcymaga może stać się potężnym Darkcymagiem,<br/>sprowadzając tym samym Ciemność na całą krainę! A jeśli jest coś, czego Ciemność nienawidzi, to dobra zabawa, techno, lasery i brokat &ndash; wszystko to, co jest bliskie czarodziejskiemu światu.<br/>Pora zatem wziąć się w garść, przywdziać na obolałe głowy odblaskowe czapeczki detektyw&oacute;w, rozwiązać zagadkę śmierci Arcymaga i złapać mordercę, nim ten urośnie w siłę.<br/><br/>Ravehard: Magiczna Gra Karciana to gra dla 3-5 graczy w wieku 12+ łącząca elementy klasycznej gry karcianej, gry blefu i dedukcji oraz gry kooperacyjnej.<br/><br/>W czasie rozgrywki, trwającej trzy rundy, gracze będą wsp&oacute;łpracować, aby pokonać wiele niebezpieczeństw: boss&oacute;w i ich poplecznik&oacute;w oraz przetrwać nieprzewidziane zdarzenia. Po każdej rundzie gracze zdobywają dowody, kt&oacute;re pozwolą im ustalić jakie było narzędzie zbrodni oraz co naprawdę się wydarzyło.<br/>Jeżeli uda im się przetrwać trzy rundy, gracze dotrą do komnaty Arcymaga. Jeżeli są pewni, kto spośr&oacute;d nich jest mordercą, mogą go wytypować i obezwładnić &ndash; wtedy gracze wygrywają. Jeżeli nie &ndash; morderca ujawni się i zapoluje na graczy: drużyna, kt&oacute;ra wygra ostateczne starcie, wygrywa grę.<br/><br/>Nie ufaj nikomu, nawet sobie! Każdy z graczy rozpoczyna grę z pewnymi przedmiotami, kt&oacute;re świadczyć mogą o ich winie lub stanowić alibi. W czasie swojej tury gracze mogą podrzucać innym te przedmioty, pr&oacute;bując zwalić winę na nich i oczyścić się z zarzut&oacute;w. Jednak do samego końca nie będzie wiadomo, kt&oacute;ry przedmiot naprawdę okaże się narzędziem zbrodni. Przez całą rozgrywkę gracze będą blefować, zwierać sojusze, oszukiwać<br/>się nawzajem i mącić &ndash; jawnie oraz niejawnie &ndash; przy wykorzystaniu specjalnych kart Flirtu, służących do przekazywania sobie informacji i knucia.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (Polish)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kalabalik is a Bridget Jones-tier hot mess of a game that straddles the boundaries between card game, board game and party game, then does something funny in each of them. At its core, it's a short and extremely sweet trip round a playing area made up of cards, where you get ahead through your ability &ndash; and your willingness &ndash; to complete the challenge that your token lands on. Sounds straightforward, right? Haha.<br/><br/>If you've ever been frustrated by your inability to remember the Presidents of the United States, but really like the idea of creating a recognizable melody by blowing raspberries on a willing collaborator's tummy, it's perfect for you. If you can fold a paper airplane that will go further than everyone else's, and stand up and chuck it with your shoelaces tied together, that's fine. If your knowledge of sitcom characters is better than your knowledge of what you do for a living, you need this game. By the end of it, someone else might be wearing your bra. That's just the way it is.<br/><br/>Kalabalik is a Swedish word meaning &quot;uproar&quot; or &quot;hoo-ha&quot; and this game stemmed from an idea to create a board game where the rules are: there are no rules. Except rules help control the fun, don't they? So the few rules you'll have to follow are awkward ones. They're joined by a lot of different challenges, refreshed constantly as the game progresses, that are the either the kinds of things you don't really want to do in polite company, or the kinds of things you've been waiting for an excuse to do in polite company. Throw in a bunch of questions that make you think &quot;how the f... oh actually I do know that lol,&quot; and a few confessions for good measure. (You don't actually have to do any of them, of course. This is the 21st century. But if you don't, you're probably going to lose.)<br/><br/>What emerges is the lovingly-designed equivalent of that one party you went to in your youth that everyone still talks about, for all the right reasons, twenty years later. What's more, the amount of time it takes to set up, learn and play is far shorter than the intense period of soul-searching you'll get when you sit bolt upright in bed in 3am, drenched in cold sweat, having remembered that you won by texting the word &quot;MILF&quot; to your boss.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

At the start of a round, each player receives a hand of six cards. In the first round, each player simultaneously reveals a card and places it in the center of play. For rounds #2-4, players then do the following: Simultaneously reveal one card from their hand, take turns claiming one card from the center of play in food chain order (tigers, wolves, raccoons, snakes, frogs, butterflies, with more animals of the same type beating fewer), then they all place their cards in the center of the table.<br/><br/>After each has claimed three cards, they use their final two cards in hand to try to make poker combinations using either animal type, number of animals, or card color. Players score 1 point for a single pair up to 15 points for a five-of-a-kind. The best combination earns 3 bonus points, and each butterfly card is worth 1 extra point. If someone has reached fifty points, the game ends and this player wins; otherwise shuffle the deck for a new round.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a horse and tries to either capture their opponent or make their opponent's piece unmovable.  The horses move just like in chess.  The twist is that each time a piece is moved the prior spot it occupied is marked.  Marked spots can no longer be moved into, so eventually somebody gets stuck (or captured).<br/><br/>",

The game is set in the ancient land of Goria, which is fought over by powerful heroes and potent mages, wizards and shamans, and their warbands of warriors. Five races battle for dominion over Goria: the Fir Bolg-the accursed living dead hosts of Anwyn, the Sidhe-the immortal elven rulers of the elements, the Fomorians-demonic orc and goblin spawn of Chaos and Old Night, the Gaels-warrior men and women, the favored children of the All Mother and the Vanir-dwarven raiders of the frozen wasteland.<br/><br/>Celtos contains all the information you need to play games with your Celtos miniatures, including army lists to get you started. There are army book supplements available for each race that introduce new rules and contain many more troop types for your armies, allowing you to play more advanced games<br/><br/>",

In each round, four events occur at the four wall sections of the castle, for the solution of which cards must be submitted secretly, and the success of the defense depends on their results. If you succeed in handing in the cards corresponding to the prescribed task together, the defenders will receive a reward, otherwise the Turkish armies will approach the inner castle, the will to fight will deteriorate, or the players will suffer dangerous injuries.<br/><br/>",

Whoever has the most valuable collection of playgrounds at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Most of the game is made up of simple otters numbered 1, 2 or 3. Players must decide which 2 of their cards in hand to play, and which playgrounds to play them to.<br/><br/>There are also special otters in the deck, which players can use to try to win playgrounds quickly, plus alligator cards to keep opponents away from playgrounds.<br/><br/>The playgrounds themselves range in value from 2 to 10, making some easy to win with a card or two, but less valuable to your final score. Others are hard to win but worth lots of points! And if you collect all three playgrounds of the same color, you get bonus points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Otters is simple enough for kids to play, helping them to learn basic addition. But it's also designed to be interesting for adults, requiring strategic decision making.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Otters is a game about playing with adorable otters with your friends and family.<br/><br/>",

Quorsum is unique, however, in that the board is never the same from game to game; rather, the 16 board tiles are picked at random before the game, so that players must constantly react to an unexpected setup.  Not only that, but the board continues to change throughout the game, as players try to flip key tiles from light to dark or vice versa.<br/><br/>Luck is minimal: even the dice require skill, since players may decide how many of their dice to use for each important move.  The result is a fast-paced game in which players must constantly calculate the best path to take and the best way to hinder the opponent's tokens.  Although the experienced player will usually win, still there is often a chance for both players right up until the last move.<br/><br/>Quorsum avoids both the predictable setup of most strategy games, and the swings of luck in most dice games.  The players' fate, therefore, is always in their own hands.<br/><br/>",

The guardian of the seventh Enki-Des, Enko-Rochimga, cannot be defeated in physical combat. Instead, the Ukri must present his or her Enko-ori, or essence pearl, to prove him- or herself worthy of entering Furrma, or paradise.<br/><br/>In Enki-Des, you play a young Ukri warrior who dies on the battlefield.  You find yourself at the first Soul Gate and must fight the first six different guardians while searching for your Enko-ori in order to reach Enko-Rochimga and win the game.<br/><br/>The game utilizes a 6x6 &quot;action chart&quot; and a dice-rolling mechanic to determine your action each turn.  You roll three dice, then select two of them and use them to select an action from the action chart.  Alternatively, you can select just one die and lock it into place for use next turn.  Choose your action carefully, though; the guardian will not let up attacking until you are dead.  And don't forget to search for your Enko-ori!  You'll need it to win the game!<br/><br/>",

Utilizing die-roll and random-chit mechanics, it is designed for solitaire play but has rules for 2 players.<br/><br/>The game consists of two parts. In Part 1, &quot;Assassination,&quot; the player tries to prevent the assassination or wounding of the royal couple by members of the Black Hand Serbian separatist group. In the 2-player version, one player takes the role of the Black Hand.<br/><br/>In Part 2, &quot;July Crisis,&quot; the solitaire player tries to prevent the incident from starting a war; in the 2-player, one player is the peace faction, the other the war faction. The odds for peace are improved if the royal couple survived in Part 1, but that does not guarantee the &quot;powder keg of Europe&quot; won't explode.<br/><br/>This game originally appeared in World War One Illustrated magazine No. 2 and does not include the 13 six-sided dice necessary for play.

This is a situation in which our convoy, bound from Halifax in Canada to Liverpool, steams into the middle of a U-Boat formation.<br/><br/>One of several titles released by Tabletop Games which were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a map) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used un-cut cardstock counters.

As a world of constant warfare and adventure, it is naturally of special interest to the wargamer. In this area we are quite fortunate in the amount of information on military organization provided by Burroughs . . . The basic scale is decimal in nature. This means that each figure can represent ten men, one hundred men, or even one thousand men. This enables the same system of rules to deal with military operations that vary in size from small actions to the huge wars of survival often waged between major cities of Barsoom in which hundreds of thousands of fighting men are under arms on each side.&quot;<br/><br/>A separate set of rules is included for air-to-air actions between the &quot;navies&quot; of Barsoom which can be fought out on a hex grid.<br/><br/>The companion book John Carter: Warlord of Mars – Adventure Gaming Handbook was also released by Heritage. That booklet included a figure painting guide, descriptions of the various ethnic groups of Mars, and the Man-to-man Action Rules which provided for roleplaying and single combat.<br/><br/>",

Across the globe war clouds gather. The Japanese have invaded China. The Italians are in Ethiopia. Adolf Hitler is planning to build an empire while Stalin butchers millions of his own people. Spain is engulfed in civil war. Britain, France, and America are too weak to stop the gathering tide of blood. In these chaotic times Dr. Henry Jones Jr., known by his nickname &ldquo;Indiana,&rdquo; quests after lost artifacts. In doing so he must battle gangsters, cultists, thugs, and worst of all Nazis, who are fanning out across the globe looking for items that will allow them to found a 1,000 year Reich.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The return of the great adventure.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In Indiana Jones: Fortune and Glory you play either as Indiana Jones or his adversaries, battling across Africa, Asia, and Europe as you try to recover some of the greatest artifacts of human history. As Indy you rely upon your wits, your weapons, and a small cadre of allies, including Marion, Sallah, Short Round, and Henry Jones Sr. The Villains rely more upon brute force, utilizing a host of henchmen. More importantly, they must use an asortment of talented and morally dubious individuals, including Belloq, Toht, Lao Che, Mola Ram, Elsa, and Vogel.<br/><br/>&ldquo;You call this archaeology?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Each player deploys some cards to locations, battling for either artifacts or an advantage. Some locations have a puzzle rating, which must also be overcome in order to gain artifacts, with each item being worth victory points. Special cards handle the events. While some cards are free, most are deployed by discarding cards from your hand. Each deck is asymmetrical. The Villains rely upon brute force, while Indy must often use event cards to get out of a jam. The game is meant to be played quickly. And of course, some of the greatest lines in the series will have cards&hellip;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Indiana Jones.

Each player has three places in front of themselves where they'll cook sausages on the grill.<br/><br/>With everyone playing at the same time, you continually draw the top card from your deck and play it either on your grill or on someone else's. Once a type of sausage is in a grill slot, only more of that type of sausage &mdash; or mustard, which is wild _ can be played there. Once you (or someone else) places a bun on a sausage on your grill, you move it to your plate, making room for a new type of sausage on the grill. If your hand is empty, you can choose to trash all of the cards in one of your grill slots. Once someone plays their &quot;last bun&quot; card, the game ends.<br/><br/>Each type of sausage has a number on it, and if your bunned sausage has exactly that many cards (not counting the bun), then you score points equal to twice that number. If you have fewer cards, you score as many points as non-bun cards; if you have more cards, you score zero points for that sausage. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Daydream Dungeon is a single-player dungeon crawl played entirely with a single piece of paper, a 6-sided die, and a pencil. A key feature is that the game requires no erasing, so once an adventure is completed, the player can see every action they took on the page.<br/><br/>Players begin by designing a character using the games five skills, Dexterity, Ranged, Endurance, Accumen and Melee. Purchase equipment, and then set off to fight or outwit a dungeon full of monsters, finally clashing with the boss.<br/><br/>Players track their movement through the dungeon on a 5x6 grid. Upon entering a room, roll a die, add your depth, and look up the resulting number in the Bestiary. This can reveal anything from a chest full of loot, to a deadly trap, to a terrifying monster. Once they know what they're dealing with, players can choose how they want to deal with the situation. A roguish character may want to sneak past, or even risk pickpocketing a monster. A stronger character might simply choose a direct attack. A magically attuned character might try casting a charm spell. Each of these actions are performed using a single die roll, and players get a bonus based on thier character's statistics.<br/><br/>Sometimes a player might not be able to play to their strengths, such as an archer running out of arrows, or a swordsman fighting a flying enemy. Fortunately they can use a variety of magical potions to help even the odds, though it's probably best to try them before you need them, since the first time you try a potion of a given colour, you don't know what it will do.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Board wargame 1831 For our freedom and yours: Battle of Grochow represents one of the most famous battles in the history of the Polish army. Players have historical forces and must act, given the historical advantages and limitations of their armies. Also important are factors such as terrain and weather conditions. Of course you can not skip the random factor.<br/><br/>All these aspects are described in rules which are not complicated.<br/><br/>Among the four scenarios it is introductory scenario - attack of Rosen&rsquo;s IV corps on alder grove. This is the perfect introduction to a large battle. Players have limited forces and learn basic<br/>rules and characteristics of the terrain. Thanks to this, the experience gained can be used in the course of the scenario for the entire battle.<br/><br/>Game mechanics based on random activations. However, the proper marker set reflects a better command structure of the army of Field Marshal Dybicz. Moreover, this solution provides an exciting game in which each side can take the initiative to surprise the enemy.<br/><br/>Three types of weapons: infantry, cavalry and artillery act according to the common rules, but each of them has its own characteristics. Success on the battlefield provides the appropriate use of the advantages of all kinds of weapons at the right moment. This is obviously the goal pursued by both players. Coordination of their own troops, and respond to your opponent moves makes Battle of Grochow a challenging game, even for experienced players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "High quality hinged lid box in cool design made by DENKRIESEN.<br/><br/>The principle is as simple as it is ingenious. Whoever thinks that Stadt-Land-Vollpfosten can't work well as a card game will soon be proven wrong.<br/><br/>The game is explained in no time and the fun can begin. There are no open questions and the game rounds are entertaining and exciting. Due to the 200 different categories, there is always enough variety.<br/><br/>The child-friendly card game from STADT LAND VOLLPFOSTEN with 120 playing cards for an unforgettable gaming experience among friends.<br/><br/>200 creative and funny categories make every hobby thinker sweat. Fun guaranteed!<br/><br/>Due to the 3 different editions, a huge variety is offered. In addition to the family-friendly Classic Edition, the child-friendly Junior and the naughty Red Light Edition bring a certain variety to the game night!<br/><br/>How to play: Each player is randomly dealt 8 letter cards. Now each player must place a word matching one of his letter cards as quickly as possible. Important: The first letter of the word counts and you do NOT have to form a term from the letter cards, as is sometimes the case in other games, e.g. Scrabble.<br/><br/>So it gets exciting: The 60 category cards contain a total of 200 different and funny categories:<br/><br/>Who can put down a &quot;profession&quot; first? Or a &quot;reason for separation&quot;? What about a &quot;city abroad&quot;? Can you quickly think of a &quot;Famous Dead Person&quot; or a &quot;Famous Actor&quot; for your letter cards?<br/><br/>Important now: The FASTEST player wins each round and at the end the player who first got rid of all letter cards wins the game. The 10 additional action cards make the game especially exciting.<br/><br/>Of course, there are also FULL FIX cards in the game that either act as jokers or are used as tricky counters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Hochwertige Klappdeckel-Schachtel in coolem Design made by DENKRIESEN.<br/><br/>Das Prinzip ist so einfach wie genial. Wer glaubt, dass Stadt-Land-Vollpfosten als Kartenspiel doch nicht gut funktionieren kann wird schnell eines besseren belehrt werden.<br/><br/>Das Spiel ist im nu erkl&auml;rt und der Spielspa&szlig; kann beginnen. Es bleiben keine offenen Fragen und die Spielrunden sind kurzweilig und spannend. Durch die 200 verschiedenen Kategorien ist immer f&uuml;r genug Abwechslung gesorgt.<br/><br/>Das kinderfreundliche Kartenspiel von STADT LAND VOLLPFOSTEN mit 120 Spielkarten f&uuml;r ein unvergessliches Spielerlebnis unter Freunden.<br/><br/>200 kreative und lustige Kategorien bringen jeden Hobbydenker ins Schwitzen. Spa&szlig; Garantiert!<br/><br/>Durch die 3 verschiedenen Editionen, ist eine riesige Vielfalt geboten. Neben der familienfreundlichen Classic Edition bringen die kinderfreundliche Junior und die unanst&auml;ndige Rotlicht Edition die gewisse Abwechslung in den Spieleabend!<br/><br/>Spielablauf:<br/>So wird gespielt: Jeder Spieler bekommt per Zufallsprinzip 8 Buchstaben-Karten ausgeh&auml;ndigt. Nun muss jeder Spieler m&ouml;glichst schnell einen Begriff passend zu einer seiner Buchstaben-Karten ablegen. Wichtig: Es z&auml;hlt jeweils der Anfangsbuchstabe des Wortes und man muss NICHT aus den Buchstaben-Karten einen Begriff bilden, wie es in anderen Spielen z.B: Scrabble manchmal der Fall ist.<br/>Es wird also spannend: Die 60 Kategorie-Karten enthalten insgesamt 200 verschiedene und lustige Kategorien:<br/>Wer kann zuerst einen &ldquo;Beruf&rdquo; ablegen? Oder einen &ldquo;Trennungsgrund&rdquo;? Was ist mit einer &ldquo;Stadt im Ausland&rdquo;? F&auml;llt dir zu deinen Buchstaben-Karten schnell ein &ldquo;Ber&uuml;hmter Toter&rdquo; ein bzw. kommt Dir sofort ein &ldquo;bekannter Schauspieler&rdquo; in den Sinn?<br/>Wichtig nun: Der SCHNELLSTE Spieler gewinnt jeweils die Runde und am Ende gewinnt der Spieler das Spiel, der zuerst alle Buchstaben-Karten losgeworden ist. Durch die 10 zus&auml;tzlichen Aktionskarten wird das Spiel besonders spannend.<br/>Nat&uuml;rlich gibt es auch VOLLPFOSTEN-Karten im Spiel die entweder als Joker wirken oder als kniffliger Konter genutzt werden.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All AWE games will require bases preparation with magnetic sheets and steel paper. It is driven by a unike engine, directed for the few wargaming people that seek to play miniatures games not centered in dice rolling /card drawing.<br/>The mini game will require just 90 cm x 90 cm and the big novelty is that it will include built in mechanisms for solo playing.

Each player receives a bunch of little plastic pieces and 2 large ones (gnome crystals) with an irregular shape.<br/><br/>The object is to score the most points by the time the game ends, which happens immediately when someone runs out of pieces to play. A point is scored by having a straight or diagonal arrangement of three crystals of the same color, and a large crystal as part of such an arrangement scores 2 points instead of 1. A line of 4 crystals scores twice, once for each &quot;end&quot; of the row.<br/><br/>The game is played by rolling two dice, one for each side of the grid (rows and columns). After rolling the dice, the player places them on the appropriate row and column that matches the die face. Then the player can place a crystal in any empty location on either the row or column indicated. They can also choose to &quot;combat&quot; another player's crystal on the specific intersection of the rolled dice. Combat involves a simple die-off, defender wins ties, with a large crystal providing a +1 bonus to the roll.<br/><br/>Finally, if a player rolls doubles and is able to place a crystal on the intersection (say row 3 and column 3), then they get to roll again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dead Meat: Quarantine Zone America Dead Meat is an action-packed tabletop skirmish game, where human factions compete in the ruined wasteland of the zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>Dead Meat is a 28mm, tabletop skirmish game set 4 years after a massive pandemic has toppled society and set man against man. While zombies are an ever-present threat, other groups of survivors pose a much greater danger &ndash; you&rsquo;ll soon learn that the dead are the least of your problems.<br/><br/>This focus on battles between groups of survivors is one of the things that sets Dead Meat apart from many of the current offerings in the zombie game genre. While zombie-bashing is a lot of fun, the real horror of the genre comes from the lengths people are willing to go to in order to survive. Dead Meat brings this terrifying struggle to the tabletop.<br/><br/>The theme of personal horror goes beyond the game&rsquo;s look and feel. The rules set has been crafted as a zombie survival game from the ground up, ensuring that each game has elements of drama, tension, and action that you have come to expect from the zombie genre.<br/><br/>",

Because you are often stealing and battling other players for resources there is hardly a dull moment.<br/><br/>~ Game Play ~<br/>The deck symbolizes the various paths in which one can take through the apocalyptic world. While on this path your prime objective will be to build a team of survivors. This team of survivors will be called your clan. You can find water, food, equipment, and fellow survivors along the way to enhance your clan. Your clan members will display many skills while on your journey and these events are represented through clan member abilities. There are many strategies to this game through all the different types of cards and there are countless number of ways you can arrange your clan. In order for your clan to reign supreme they must be nourished with food and water. Nourished clan members may battle opposing clans for valuable resources. In the end, the first clan to have three clan members fully nourished at the same time wins the game. These elements make up the basis of the game. You can use any combination of cards but one thing must happen, you must survive!<br/><br/>",

Curiously, the inception of this love triangle also marks the genesis of much paranormal activity in Sleepy Hollow. Tales of a mysterious &quot;Headless Horseman&quot; have rattled the community, and the whispers imply that he seeks to head off any engagement to Katrina,,, literally. The object of the game is to successfully marry Katrina to one of her suitors, or to thwart the impending marriage by reuniting the Horseman to his Head.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Shuffle cards and deal 2-4 players one card each. After each turn player keeps only 1 card in-hand. During a turn, player draws a card and does one of the following:<br/><br/>Makes no play and discards one of their two cards face-down in the discard pile.<br/><br/>Plays a Character Card by placing it in front of them. (Players are only allowed 2 Character Cards in front of them unless they have an Innkeeper played, see Special Situations.*)<br/><br/>Plays a Townsfolk Card by reading it aloud and following the instructions.<br/><br/>A player wins the round when they have Katrina and either Brom or Ichabod played in front of them, and the minister card is played (barring the subsequent play of the Bishop). Alternately, any player who holds both the Head and the Horseman in their hand may play them at any time for an instant win (barring the subsequent play of the Blacksmith).

Groups of 2-4 players will attempt to defend the lab's shared pool of health from increasingly difficult waves of Enemies.  Allowing too many Enemies or any one of three bosses to break through your defenses will end the game.  Defeat three bosses, however, and you will be able to call in your drop ship and escape with your lives.<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>Advance Phase<br/>Every turn begins with enemy movement. Be cautious, as not all of the creatures move at the same pace! In this phase, any enemies advancing past the first row will cause damage to the players before being discarded.<br/><br/>Spawn Phase<br/>In the second phase, enemies that were beyond the battlefield now become visible! Similar to their varied movements, not all enemies will spawn into the fight at the same distance from the heroes. Additionally, these monstrosities can crowd spaces, stacking their damage and moving as a group, changing player priorities in a single phase.<br/><br/>Action Phase<br/>It&rsquo;s time to deal some damage. Emulating the limited access to and repurposing of supplies that would occur during the ambush, player action begins by drawing a small number of cards from the supply deck. Supplies range from energy sources and offensive weapons to traps and support items. A lucky draw in Dreadbound may not directly benefit you, but it could be just what your teammates need. Following the resupply, players may then make one of two combinations of actions: Attack (deal direct damage to the enemy) and Support (repurpose or gift supplies to teammates), or two Support actions. Plan carefully with the rest of the crew to make the most effective play.<br/><br/>Boss Phase<br/>Take caution with your kills in Dreadbound, as destroying specific enemies eventually leads to the appearance of one of the game&rsquo;s six boss creatures. Each of these sports one or more abilities unique to their card, with a variety of effects that can damage players, as well as disrupt their plans and reset their priorities.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "XOBrainer is advanced type of five-in-a-row that can be played by two persons or two teams in which the object of the game is to get five-in-a-row in either shape (Xs or Os) or color (green or red), using both your pieces and those of your opponents.<br/><br/>One team has 24 green Xs and 8 pink Xs, while the other team has the reverse: 24 pink Os and 8 green Os. Each team places four of their pieces in the line-up area: three of their main color and one in the opponent's color. Each team then takes turns playing the pieces from their line-up area in numbered order (1-4); when the line-up area is empty, the team refills it as before.<br/> When you achieve five-in-a-row, you earn points based on the placement of the row on the game board. In each square are dots, as on a die, that indicate how many points you score from that square. When a team reaches 20 points, they win a set. The game is won when a team has won three sets. Alternatively a team can win instantly by building a five-in-a-row that passes through one of four &quot;knock out&quot; squares on the game board. Only pieces that both teams can benefit from &mdash; pinkXs and green Os &mdash; can be played in a knock out square.<br/> XOBrainer comes with four game variations that can be added and combined freely;<br/><br/><br/>    Random: Instead of playing with the standard color order, play with randomly selected pieces, either by drawing four pieces randomly from the X- or O-bags or using a free WebApp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Map: Start the game from a new starting point; each team draws a card and places four pieces as depicted on the card &ndash; this way there is a new starting point in each round.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    TimeBomb: Set a time limit for each move with the free WebApp.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mission: Using the map/mission cards, each player has a secret mission to place pieces as depicted on the card. Each piece a player succeeds in placing gives the player extra points (if they also achieve five-in-a-row).<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player gets a pawn and numbered game tokens of the same color. The pawn is placed on the corner starting space of the matching color, and the number tokens are placed on their corresponding spaces near the player&rsquo;s start space. Six yellow tokens&mdash;numbered 1 to 6&mdash;are shuffled and placed face-down on the black circles in the middle of the board. All but the middle one are then covered with caps.<br/><br/> Object:  Players try to collect the numbered tokens of their own color and to assemble them into the highest possible number (i.e., 4321). As the first token is collected, it the must be placed on the ones column, the second on the tens, the third on the hundreds, and the last on the thousands column.<br/><br/> Play:  Chose a start player and play clockwise. The active player takes one cap of his choice and places it over the one yellow token that lies free (for the first player, this will be the one in the middle of the board). The number token just freed is turned face up (if not already face-up). The number on it determines how many spaces the player moves his pawn. If he lands on a yellow space, he repeats the procedure (i.e., transfer a cap, reveal a number, move pawn). If he does not land on a yellow space, his turn ends and it is the next player's turn.<br/><br/>Obviously, a player who remembers which number is under which cap may plan his moves accordingly. He cannot, however, use the same movement number in two successive moves because the cap must always be placed on the free token. If a player lands on a yellow space three times in succession, he reshuffles the yellow tokens, places them face down, and covers them as was done at the start of the game.<br/><br/> Winning:  The first player to complete a 4-digit number wins and ends the game. If additional rounds are played, a running tally should be kept of each player&rsquo;s numbers, which are totaled at the end of the game. The player with the highest total is the overall winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost Treasures is a &quot;Print &amp; Play&quot; game where each player must hire a party of adventurers to retrieve the treasure from a forgotten dungeon. One player recruits his adventurers from the noble worthy races, the other from the dregs and evil denizens. Unfortunately, due to the rush to try to get to the treasure first, sometimes the parties are not as well equipped as they could be. . . .<br/><br/>Adventure Party Recruitment is done via a simple card system, and the Dungeon board is created randomly, using room tiles.<br/>Combat, magic, and other actions are resolved by dice.<br/><br/>All the pieces required to play (except for the dice) are available from the following website:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://lost-treasures.tripod.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://lost-treasures.tripod.com/</a><br/><br/>",

Each player chooses one card and places it face down in front of him. The first player calls out either &quot;Tall bird!&quot; or &quot;Short bird!&quot; That sets the criterion for the round. Each player then places the card he chose on the board, and the players determine who has the tallest or shortest bird, depending on which was called. The winning player gets an &quot;egg,&quot; one of the cardboard counters used to keep score. Each player then draws a new card.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in the same way to the next player to the left, and cards are played on top of each player's existing cards on the board.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last card is drawn.

Influencing from interstellar distances, you must rely on sympathetic Senators to convert their comrades. Through cunning manipulation and the occasional political sacrifice, you can win the Solar Senate!<br/><br/>Solar Senate is a 2-player abstract game of spatial strategy and conversion. Each player has their own deck of Senators, whose influence is ranked from 1 to 5 with 1s being most common and 5s most rare.<br/><br/>On your turn, you play one of the two Senators from your hand onto the play area. This represents your Senator entering the Senate chambers. If you flank a line with one or more of your opponent's senators with two of your senators, those opposing senators might be converted to you under two conditions:<br/><br/>PRESSURE: Your flanking senators' total influence is greater than the opposing senators' total influence.<br/>CONSPIRE: Your flanking senators each have identical influence, regardless of the opposing senators total influence. If conspiring, the most recently played senator is removed from the game. (He or she has resigned in disgrace.)<br/><br/>The game continues until all but one Senator from each deck has entered the chambers. Earn 1 point for each senator aligned to you. You also earn bonus points if you achieve certain endgame agendas.<br/><br/>",

Seems to be the way, that once a town starts gittin' big it starts attracting the wrong sort. That's why I'm here talking to you now. The last town I was in turned bad once some mean critters started calling the shots. I knew it was time to move on when the mayor appointed the town drunk as marshal. We're way out in the middle of nowhere here, so hopefully the bad seeds will fall short.&quot;<br/><br/>In A Town Called Nowhere, you take the role of a pioneer settling a new town in the Old West. There'll be business opportunities aplenty for folks with an eye on the main chance and pitfalls too for those who don't cover their tracks. As you'd expect, there&rsquo;ll be saloons, gambling, and gunfights. There'll be a jail, a bank, and a gunsmith. There'll be a marshal, a schoolteacher, and a lady called Ruby; the bank will get robbed, the corral will burn down, and some big shot will run you out of business so he can build a grand hotel where your wash house stands. Once the dust settles, that same big shot will paint his name on the town sign and say, &quot;If anyone has any objections, they should speak up now&quot;. Will you say anything? Course not, you'll head back to your washboard and eke out a meagre existence scrubbing miner's socks. Of course, it doesn't have to turn out that way. I mean, no one's even driven a stake yet.<br/><br/>The game takes place on the grid map of the Town of Nowhere, which is empty at the start of the game. As players take their turns and the game progresses the map will become populated with all the buildings and businesses you'd expect in the Old West.  Each player controls the movements and actions of their gang of associates as they move about town taking care of business and business can be anything from manning the counter at the dry goods store to gunning down the marshal.<br/><br/>The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game wins and gets to name the town after themselves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The UNO card game everyone loves gets a powerful look with He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Featuring dynamic graphics of MOTU characters from powerful heroes to deadly sorcerers, it also includes a unique rule -- the Power of Greyskull Card. To use it, the player must hold it above their head and say, &quot;By the power of Greyskull, I have the power!!&quot; All other players then draw 3 cards.<br/><br/>Game play is like classic UNO: players match cards by color or number in a race to get rid of all the cards in their hand. When down to one card, they must shout triumphantly like He-Man &quot;UNO!&quot;<br/><br/>",

Every round a Headline card is revealed as a new crisis strikes the American public. Each headline builds on the last - creating more and more bad luck for everyone. The only way to stop them&hellip; toilet paper, of course. Player turns are comprised of three phases: Escape, Hoard, and Quarantine.<br/><br/>Players begin their turns by drawing from the Escape Draw Pile to &ldquo;escape&rdquo; the active Headline cards. <br/>Players next must hoard as much as they can by drawing from the Hoard Draw Pile. Hoard cards include all the stereotypical American essentials needed to survive like toilet paper, frozen dinners, cbd gummies, essential oils, coffee, chocolate, wine, gloves, tv, computers, puppies, guns, masks, and much more.  Finally, players end their turn as they are forced into quarantine by drawing from the Quarantine Draw Pile. Inspired by the countless 2020 memes, players read out-loud the embarrassing and awkward scenarios while their opponents enjoy a good laugh at their expense.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, bad Luck is stored in a player&rsquo;s Crazy Stash or Sick Stash. The Crazy Stash represents a player&rsquo;s declining mental state while the Sick stash represents their failing health. The player with the most bad luck points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of two phases, a placement phase followed by a movement phase.  The two players White and Black each have twelve pieces.<br/><br/>PLACEMENT PHASE:<br/>Beginning with White, the players alternate placing one of  their twelve pieces on one of the 37 crossing points on the board.<br/>Once all pieces have been placed, the movement phase begins.  A piece can be captured during this phase (see below).<br/><br/>MOVEMENT PHASE:<br/>The players alternate moving one of their pieces to an adjacent and empty crossing point.  A piece can be captured during this phase (see below).  If a player has only 4 remaining pieces, they are allowed to move their piece to any empty crossing point.<br/><br/>QUADRATES:<br/>A quadrate occurs when a piece is placed such that the 4 corners of a square are occupied by that player's pieces.  Quadrates come in 6 different sizes.  To form a quadrate, a player must have their pieces on all 4 corners of a square composed of either 2,4,8,16,18, or 32 triangles.<br/><br/>The table below indicates the number of possible quadrates composed of a given number of triangles:<br/><br/>No. of Triangles/No. of Quadrates<br/>2 - 24<br/>4 - 12<br/>8 - 13<br/>16 - 5<br/>18 - 4<br/>32 - 1<br/><br/>For any of the larger quadrates (8,16,18,32), the quadrate is invalid if there is an opposing piece on any position along the side.Only friendly or empty positions are allowed along the edges (sides) of a quadrate.<br/><br/>CAPTURE:<br/>If after placing a piece, a quadrate is formed, the player can remove an opponent piece which does not itself form a quadrate with 3 other pieces.<br/><br/>Once a player has only 3 remaining pieces, they lose the game.  If the same position occurs 3 times, then the game is declared a draw.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>o In rare cases, all of a player's pieces may be trapped thus requiring the player to pass.<br/>o Danish Quarto has some similiarities to the Morris family of European board games, but also shares important features of a Chinese game named `Fang`<br/><br/>",

Those cards can be pulled by any player once per round, and in any order, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to be their turn to pull the card. It can really change the dynamic of a game and make for some pretty hilarious and fun moments. The game can be measured and tactical or chaotic and crazy, it all depends on the player.<br/><br/>",

Cutie has been in the care of her grandmother while her archeologist parents are on a dangerous expedition. However, after their being gone for six months, Cutie and the residents of Kodiak Harbor fear the worst. Join Cutie as she travels into the forest with Amelia, one of the visitors, to discover the truth of her parents' whereabouts.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players take a secret Citizen card and three path cards, then they randomly assemble the Alaskan shore visitor cards in a row of ten and place the corresponding Visitor pieces on their card.<br/><br/>Players then take turns playing a path card each turn. Path cards can be used in multiple ways: build the growing map, help visitors collect sprite gems, or spend those sprite gems to advance visitors along the built map. When building the map, players can connect only to the existing path to create a pyramid shape, ever tightening the forest path!<br/><br/>The end of the game is triggered when one visitor reaches the top. To determine a winner, players reveal their secret roles, each detailing specific sprite gems for which they earn points. Players tally points based on the location of visitors holding their designated sprite gems. The person with the most sprite gem points wins!<br/><br/>When Cutie Met Patootie is the first game of The Entanglement Series by The Daniel Zayas Company. This game ships with a mini-expansion titled The Man Who Moves the Water, which allows for solo play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Weather Wars, you recruit wacky animals to your cause. Once you reach one hundred power worth of animals, or your team reaches 150 power in team play, you take control of the weather machine and win the game. Early on, only small power creatures can be played, but as the game progresses, larger, more powerful creatures come online. Each creature has an ability that triggers when it comes into play, helping your cause or causing mayhem for other players. The season card indicates what season the weather machine has forced on the world. Gather more summer creatures in summer, or more winter creatures in winter, and you'll earn a big season bonus &ndash; but watch out! At any time a Season Change Card can flip the season and ruin all your careful planning.<br/><br/>Weather Wars features an unusual hand mechanic - rather than drawing a card each turn, cards are played until a player only has two left in hand. These last two are then discarded and replaced with a 5-card hand. This creates subtle strategic depth - which cards should be played now, which later, and which not at all? It also gives additional meaning to any card ability that allows you to draw extra cards.<br/><br/>Other game features include a catchup mechanic in the form of the Season Change card, game acceleration via prerequisites for playing larger animals, and opportunities for collaboration in team play. The game plays quickly, to allow for frequent replays.<br/><br/>Weather Wars is a family-friendly card game for 2-4 players ages 8 and up, and takes about 20 minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

The object is to acquire certain combinations of board properties or to break your opponent(s) either with your skillful play at the Two Card Poker table or by charging outrageous rents when they visit your gambling establishments.  But watch your play--you may end up in Judge Roy Bean's Court where you will be fined for such things as &quot;relieving yourself on his horse's leg&quot; or &quot;not sharing your chickie at the Texas Chicken Ranch.&quot;<br/><br/>Texas Showdown uses original statistical combinations that make each Wild West Showdown different from the last and provide a never-ending source of entertainment for two to five players, aged twelve to adult.  Average game time is thirty minutes.<br/><br/>The properties of Texas Showdown represent infamously crooked gambling houses of the Nineteenth Century, where the only sure bet was the loss of your money.

The aim of the game is to use these stones to capture your opponent's all important Guard-stone, or to occupy the starting position of this stone with your own Guard.<br/><br/>Each turn a player can move one stone, or one stack of stones. How far (forwards, backwards or sideways, but never diagonal) is determined by the height of the stack. It is possible to move only a part of a stack if you don't want to move the full possible distance, but it is not allowed to jump over any other stones in this path. A move can end on a friendly Tower-stone or -stack, but Guard-stones can never become part of a stack.<br/><br/>It is possible to capture enemy stones by landing on them, under certain conditions. Guard-stones can always land on any enemy stone or stack and likewise, anything can land on the enemy Guard-stone. A tower-stone or stack can capture enemy stones or stacks only when it at least matches the height of the opposing stack. All Tower-stones that are captured are removed from play and as stated before, taking the enemy Guard-stone is one way of two ways to win the game.<br/><br/>",

Your cries of &quot;Come back!&quot; are answered only with laughter, and heavy footfalls receding down the long corridor.<br/><br/>As your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness, you realize you are not alone. &quot;We have to escape,&quot; the prisoner says, &quot;Now.&quot;<br/><br/>In Twin Stars: Escape the Brig, two of you are locked up together and need to break free.

        "description": "During the summer of 1863, in the aftermath of the Gettysburg and Vicksburg campaigns, battles on land and sea were fought over control of the birthplace of the Confederacy, Charleston, South Carolina. A Union victory here would send an unmistakable signal to the states in rebellion as well as the rest of the world that the Confederacy&rsquo;s cause was lost and further fighting a waste of lives and effort.<br/><br/>A Confederate victory in the face of the tremendous Union host, that included every Union Ironclad on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, as well as some of the most seasoned regiments that numbered among them the first formations of all Black soldiers (free US citizens as well as former slaves), would signify the war would go on and that two nations, not one, could be the result of this &ldquo;second&rdquo; American Revolution.<br/><br/>Players in A Gate of Hell: The Campaign for Charleston, July-September 1863 are cast in the roles of the historical commanders of the campaign; Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard for the Confederate defenders of Charleston, or Admiral Dahlgren and General Quincy Adams Gillmore of the Union. Can you do as well or better than they?<br/><br/>A Gate of Hell uses an interactive design to portray this decisive battle of the American Civil War. Players use &ldquo;military support points&rdquo; (MSPs), representing the logistical and political support for the campaign, to mobilize and support their forces (ground and naval) on one of the most inhospitable battlegrounds of the war. Both sides have a variety of military assets to deploy, but the planning and effective use of MSPs throughout the game will determine in large measure who is the victor. Units represent mostly regiments for the ground units, and each ironclad for the naval units. All of the famous batteries and forts, including Sumter and Wagner, are portrayed.<br/><br/>Rules cover Assault and Bombardment combats, multiple activations, the effects of battles elsewhere that can influence the actions at Charleston, the Union&rsquo;s &ldquo;Swamp Angel&rdquo;, as well as the early completions of the Confederate ironclad Charleston and submarine Hunley.<br/><br/>Three scenarios are in included. One is on the April 1863 naval offensive by all of the Union ironclads that sought to defeat the rebels' fortresses and is an excellent single-turn introduction to the game&rsquo;s naval combat rules. A second is another single-turn scenario on the initial Union assault on Morris Island and Battery Wagner. These single-turn scenarios take under an hour to game, and are well-suited for tournament play. The third covers the entire campaign and that takes about 6 hours to complete.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Berg, is a unique type of railroad game. Players operate the historical railways of the Confederate States of America during one of the &quot;hottest wars&quot; of the 19th Century &ndash; the American Civil War - which ends up turning it into a kind of an &quot;anti-railroad&quot; game. Not only do players have to deliver goods, supplies and military loads during a difficult time, but they have to adjust to a dwindling rail network.<br/><br/>Yes, paradoxically each player's rolling stock and rail net are at their absolute finest on the first turn. From there on in the players (representing the South's various railroad companies) battle Union military advances, each other, Confederate government decrees (and neglects), the rapidly inflating and worthless money, plus wear and tear on irreplaceable equipment.<br/><br/>The system also contains far more &ldquo;outside events&rdquo; than most rail games... thanks to the war. As the tagline on the cover suggests, it becomes an increasingly against the odds situation to stave off hunger and defeat among the South's armies.<br/><br/>Maps - One full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet<br/>Counters - 280 full color die-cut counters<br/>Cards - 24 full color cards<br/>Rules length - Around 12 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2<br/>Complexity - Low<br/>How challenging is it solitaire? - Poor<br/>Playing time - Up to 3 to 4 hours for each game<br/><br/>Designer - Richard Berg<br/>Development - Lembit Tohver<br/>Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Boer War is the first entry in this new series from Joseph Miranda and Canvas Temple Publishing. Boer War is based on the conflict between the British Empire and the Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, which started in 1899 (generally known as the Second Boer War). The game covers the first year of the war; the conventional phase when the Boers could have gained a conventional victory. The latter part of the war was primarily a guerrilla conflict that did not officially end until 1902 and by which point a British victory was pretty much inevitable. In the game, each player is trying to seize an early victory: the British, in order to forestall the aforementioned guerrilla war, the Boers to gain sufficient support in Europe for their claims to full independence.<br/><br/>The game has three scenarios. Two of them begin with the commencement of hostilities in October 1899 and the initial Boer successes. The third begins with Lord Roberts taking command of British forces and launching the counteroffensive which took the major Boer towns.<br/><br/>Boer War Game Scale. One hexagon = approximately 90 kilometers. Each turn represents one month of operations. A corps represents two or three divisions plus corps echelon troops. A field force (division group) represents one or two reinforced divisions. A commando, brigade, or group represents 1-4000 fighting men.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme: The game has a fairy tale background story in which the young queen of the prosperous and happy &quot;Sonnenland&quot; (&quot;Sunvale&quot; in the English description) was flattered and seduced by her shadow via her dreams to tear apart her necklace of sun pearls. As she did so, the shadow became independent and ruled over the land, drainig life and colors from it. An old bard's song tells her that she needs to cross the country, aided by some companions (the players). So, it is a heroic prophesy fairy tale of saving a cursed land.<br/><br/>Goal: The game is semi - co - operative as the players share the goal of moving the queen from one corner of the board to the opposite corner. And all players lose if the shadow lands on the same tile as any other piece or if a player can't pay sun pearls when required by the game. However, players can give each other pearls at any time If the queen reaches the corner, all players are considered winners, but the player with the most pearls is considered the most successful.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is played on a modular board made up of 5 x 5 tiles which are turned upside down and upside up during play. Players take turns. During a turn, two special dice are thrown to determine the movement of pieces on the board: depending on the result, either the player moves their figure and the shadow in opposing directions or the players get a chance to move the queen one tile towards the goal. In order to move the queen, players draw a task card asking them for some kind of word (e.g. &quot;name a tool&quot;) the letters of which are restricted by the current state of the tiles on the board using an hour glass as a time limit. The task cards come in three levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>The game has a strong element of luck as an unfortunate die roll can easily cause the players to lose with no means of direct protection against it. Player decision/influence is limited to the word game and deciding the path the queen figure takes (although that is also restricted so as to forbid detours).<br/><br/>Important: While the game comes with a 4 - language rules booklet, the task cards are monolingual in German, so at least one person needs to be able to understand that language. In addition, the background story is simplified in the translations and the element of the player with the most sun pearls at the end of the game being the most successful is missing.<br/><br/>",

As the captains of Viking boats, the players sail from island to island and load barrels - either from the island or from an opponent's boat that happens to be moored there. The goal is to be the first player to bring a certain number of barrels back to his home island. On a player's turn, he rolls three coloured dice. They decide how many islands further his boat may sail - but it's different than what many players are used to. If the player's own colour is rolled, then his movement is reduced by one. If he has barrels on board, then none of those colours may be rolled either. The more colourful the load, the greater the chance of not moving very far and losing the load instead. An innovative idea.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the vast world of Materia, two factions are fighting to seize power over the people who wish to live peacefully in their cities. The Pirate Syndicate is a business-driven corporation that vies to gain as much power by exploiting the &quot;honest&quot; merchants. Their Queen Pirate loves to use the fastest vessel in all of Materia, The Dreadnought, to dominate the sea of clouds. The Great British Empire is a monarch regime that controls most of the known city-islands. The king's hand, the Governor of the seven seas, is the most dominant person who loves to enforce his laws by lashing out his fearsome Flying Fortress after contraband dealing pirates.<br/><br/>In Steam Pirates, each player builds their own trading network of piracy by dealing in four types of goods: coal, rum, firearms, and automatons. Your goal is to capitalize the &quot;open&quot; market by selling your goods while maneuvering your frigate to explore new markets and new resourceful allies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Careful is a dexterity game similar to Villa Paletti and Jenga.  In the set-up, players build a bell tower five levels high using the plastic colored support posts and floors provided, as dictated by the color dots on the floor levels.  Supports are not placed on the top floor; a heavy plastic-enclosed bell structure is placed in the centre of this level, which sounds when the tower becomes unstable.  Then comes the deconstruction.<br/><br/>A turn consists of spinning the spinner and removing a pillar of the color spun from any floor of the tower. The floor levels have channels cut in them that makes the movement and removal of the support posts a challenge.  Players may manipulate the tower as necessary to remove the pillar, but all pillars removed on a turn that are not the spun color must be replaced before removing the objective support post.  Play continues until the tower falls; the player causing this to occur receives no points for the round whilst all other players receive points based on the color and number of supports taken on their turns.<br/><br/>Players play a number of rounds equal to the number of players playing.  The player who accumulates the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Welcome to Brighton - a place where individuality is a competition, self- consciousness is an art form and nobody can hear the real world over the hum of cafetieres.  In short, the perfect setting for a day out.&quot;<br/><br/>You and up to four friends must travel the length and breadth of the city looking for interesting things to do and see. And adventure can be found in the most unlikely places.<br/><br/>From the South Downs to Black Rock,the day is yours to spend as you please. You could explore the obvious sights or uncover hidden corners. You could stalk local celebrities or stumble upon resident legends. You could go busking or shopping, gambling or picnicking. You could be mugged in broad daylight or handed a flyer for the best party ever.<br/><br/>But you won&rsquo;t know till you dive in, so what are you waiting for?<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Starting at Brighton train station, each player takes a coloured pawn and their first Destination card. This is where they're supposed to visit first to score the associated points, but there's nothing to say they can't just explore off the beaten track and find adventure that way as well. Either approach will score Anecdote Points, which are the currency and aim of the game - score 50 Anecdote Points and get back to Brighton station, and you've won.<br/><br/>Moving around the board either on foot or using public transport such as trains, buses and taxis, players can discover local characters, eccentrics, celebrities and city events - some of these are activated immediately, others act as subquests for the players to compete for. As well as these encounters, players can also go shopping for a variety of items that will help them or protect them from the dastardly tricks that'll be played on them through the course of the game via the Sneak cards deck players can accrue.<br/><br/>For instance, if you meet a local celebrity there's every chance another player will play a Lookalike card on you, so that celebrity was just a close likeness and therefore worth no points. If you trawl across the city to a destination miles away, a player may decide it's been closed for repairs. You might get a taxi only to be at the mercy of someone who doesn't know north from south, and end up streets away from where you intended.<br/><br/>Combining the skills of maze orientation, inventory and money management, player interaction and risk assessment, BN1 also relies on a healthy dose of luck. And with over 100 different encounters, 40 odd unique destinations, a brace of shop items and a couple of dozen different Sneak cards, it's an expansive adventure with a high replay value.<br/><br/><br/>The first edition of BN1, released at the start of November 2012, was a limited run of 500 hand-numbered copies. It's available from shops around Brighton, and also the Bedsit Games website). It is now in its 3rd edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher (edited):<br/><br/>Snake Oil - The medicine show card game! Step right up, ladies &amp; gents! Make fantastic medical claims for your bottled elixir. Slander your opponents and steal their secrets! Avoid angry mobs and law enforcement while weaseling the highest price possible for your Snake-Oil!<br/><br/>3-4 players is ideal, but can be played by 2-8.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>The Setting: In the latter part of the 19th Century and well into the 20th, an industry boomed across the American Midwest. That industry was the Medicine Show, where any entrepreneur with a questionable recipe and plenty of business savvy could pull his wagon up to the center of town and hawk his medicinal wares for a few cents per bottle. You and your opponents are these peddlers of &ldquo;Snake-Oil&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The Object: In Snake-Oil, the object is to achieve the highest per bottle price for your elixir. To do this, you may have to hire thugs, slander your opponents and plant ringers in the crowd. But it&rsquo;s all in good fun and, hey, you always have the next town for your opponents to get revenge.<br/><br/>Game Length: A game of Snake-Oil can last is little as 5 minutes or as long as an hour, depending on how many towns you and your opponents decide to hit. Each hand of Snake-Oil constitutes a town. The game includes a score sheet with room for the name of your product and a running tally for three towns. When you&rsquo;ve played the number of hands you&rsquo;ve agreed upon, add up the totals for each town and the winner is the player with the highest total value.<br/><br/>Setup: Each player is dealt 7 cards face down (if there are more than 4 players, deal 5 cards each). This constitutes his hand at the start of the game. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the table, and the discard pile will go next to it. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left goes first.<br/><br/>Play: A player must first play a Cure if he has one. This goes directly in front of him in his playing area. He may then play any other card (except for another Cure). If he doesn&rsquo;t have a Cure to play first, he may go directly to playing his second card. [Cards that are not Cures modify the value of the Cures or may cause Cures to be switched or discarded, etc.] He may opt not to play a second card. At the end of the player&rsquo;s turn, he may draw as many cards from the deck as necessary to ensure he ends the turn with 7 cards in his hand. A player may opt to discard his entire hand and draw an equal amount of cards from the deck in lieu of playing any cards on his turn. This simply indicates his wagon has burned down and he&rsquo;s buying new ingredients.<br/><br/>Ending the Hand: The hand ends when the player who draws the last card from the deck finishes his turn, or when a hand-ending card is played successfully. There are 2 such cards: Rain! and Bust!. There is also a counter (or negating card) for each of them. A player may not end the hand by this method unless he has a value of at least 20&cent; in front of him. Ending a hand by this method does not affect any cards already in play.<br/><br/>Added Hype: There is a quick table included to randomly determine the name of your product (handy if you&rsquo;re playing a four town Medicine Show). Snake-Oil is fun to play, but it&rsquo;s a lot MORE fun when players start getting into the spirit of the game and hyping their products with zeal. Loosen up, have fun and enjoy your game of Snake-Oil!<br/><br/>",

Bull Market is a bidding game designed by James Ernest, Greg Parsons and Mick Sullivan in which secret information can make or break your day's excursion to the trading floor. Bear Market, designed by James Ernest, is a fast-playing drafting game in which making the best of what comes your way is key. Inside Traders, designed by Jeff Horger, is a trick-taking variant using the same basic concepts.<br/><br/>All of the games rely on a Panic! stage where there is a flurry of dumped commodities when players begin to see what direction the current hand is going.<br/><br/>The box includes ninety commodity suit cards, a value tracking board, and nine commodity tokens.<br/><br/>",

Cards represent prows and poops, and everything in between --missile launchers, laser turrets, shuttles...Special &quot;prizes&quot; appear as pairs of cards; should you be lucky enough to draw both halves and play them side by side, it is worth more. Each of these prizes is worth even more if played in the same starship as a specific accompanying card.<br/><br/>At any point, you have to choose between closing a starship (and scoring) or building it up some more. In addition, complete starships can attack the other player's starships...<br/><br/>There is little control in this game, as the players simply draw then place cards - but there's still some reasonable amount of strategy in the placements. The simplicity makes it accessible to children, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults as a light, quick game.<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt Passport and Travel cards at the beginning of the game and pay the Customs Fund (bank) the value of those cards.  Players then take turns moving their pawns around the board.  If they land on a city space, they pay the indicated amount to the owner(s) of the passport(s) for that city.  Landing on other types of spaces results in various actions like drawing a Customs card, spinning the world spinner, and moving off-course.<br/><br/>The winner is the person with the most money when the game ends.  The game ends when a player completes both legs of the course and lands on the &quot;home&quot; space.  Triggering the end of the game is optional: if a player doesn't think he/she has enough money to win the game, they can pass the home space and continue along the second half of the course.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game the players (2 or 4 playing as partners) are trying to connect two opposite corners of the board with a road.  Unlike in many connection games, the players' roads may cross each other and even run contiguously.  In addition to the roads, there are rivers and railroad tracks which interfere with placement.  Players score based on the length of their roads (shorter is better) and the number of rivers and railroads crossed over (fewer is better).  There are a number of rules which together can cause significant numbers of forced placements in a way vaguely reminiscent of Fresh Fish.<br/><br/>The game won l'Oscar du Jouet 1974 in the Jeux Senior category.<br/><br/>",
