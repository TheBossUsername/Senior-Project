Turn up one card, and if that is its favourite food, you can take it and feed the animal. If it's not, sorry, put the card face down again.<br/><br/>As they have eaten, the animals will take a poop, and your place will become filled with poop cards. Find as much of the animals' favourite foods as you can and take care of the poop!<br/><br/>A game for children mainly, with bright attractive graphic design.<br/><br/>The second edition has only technical changes: a better rulebook, Furigana added the Kanji names on the cards, bigger cards and a bigger box, the game is now for 2-6 or more players, a game variant is included in the rules.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>うんちに気をつけながら動物の大好物を順番に見つけていく記憶ゲームです。<br/><br/>裏向きでバラバラに並べられた食べものカードの中から、お題となっている動物の大好物を探します。1枚めくって、もしそれが大好物だったら動物に食べものをあげることができます。大好物ではなかったら、残念。裏向きに戻します。大好物を食べた動物はうんちをするので、場にどんどんうんちカードが増えていきます。うんちに気をつけながら、なるべくたくさんの動物の大好物を見つけましょう。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Murder at Devil Pines is 90's era federal agent vs. the supernatural inspired board game, with a twist!   It comes from the mind of Zzarchov Kowolski (Pioneers of Mars, NeoClassical Geek Revival).<br/><br/>Players take a number of actions, ordering gear, managing their investigation, or collecting clues but only have a limited number of turns to do so. The Heat is on! There's a monster on the loose, the press is closing in, and your bureau chief is demanding answers.<br/><br/>When we first sat down to play the prototype of Murder at Devil Pines, we need we had something unique.  It's a semi-cooperative game, where agents need to race around investigating who killed the local politician, how the sacrifice was made, and ultimately, stopping whichever monster has been let loose on this poor unsuspecting town.<br/><br/>Murder at Devil Pines is a unique cooperative social deduction game with a combination of engaging mechanics unlike anything you've ever seen.  While working with your fellow agents to solve a murder may be nothing new, the introduction of a conspiracy card means that you have a chance to be part of the summoning of a monster. While investigating, if you figure that out, it is your solemn duty to aid the monster. Will the Fallen Angel call on you for redemption, or are you already a pawn of the Vampire? Each player has six turns, shown by the heat die, to figure this out.<br/><br/>Gameplay is straightforward.  You take an action and then move, or move and then take an action.  Actions consist of investigating, meaning picking up a green, red or blue skill die, rolling however many you've collected of that color, and then checking the reference card.  &quot;Calling it in&quot; where you help or hinder your fellow agents by announcing how, who, or what, or making a raid on a cult compound, or monster lair.<br/><br/>Because of how easy setup is, and how quick gameplay is, this is the perfect game to share with friends.  Its an excellent game to introduce non-board game players to.  The rules are simple and clean. Action move, move action.  You pick!<br/><br/>With the twist, there's nothing more satisfying than looking around at the other players at the board, watching their stunned faces as they realize you've pulled the wool over their eyes.  &quot;Josh, you mean, the monster was the Wendigo, and you just let it eat you so we wouldn't figure it out?&quot; Self-Sacrifice!<br/><br/>Lastly, you can own your own crazy wall!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player has five pieces, which begin on the spaces of two of the longest available parallel lines of intersections.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player moves one piece between two intersections along any connecting lines, or jumps over one adjacent piece belonging to either player to the empty intersection immediately beyond the jumped piece. If a jumped piece belongs to the opponent, the player then moves that piece to any other unoccupied intersection on the board.<br/><br/>Win by either getting one of your opponent's pieces in the very central intersection of the board while none of the opposing pieces occupy any of the immediately surrounding intersections, or by getting three (or more) of your opponents pieces in an unbroken line spanning the central intersection of the board.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

If a player is the first to land on one of the numbered spaces, he draws the card from the deck of 30 cards and reads out the information on the pink side of the card. Then he turns the card over to see what instructions he has to follow. This are fairly predictable; Miss a turn perhaps, roll the die and move backwards, and so on. The player then takes the card and keeps it in front of him where all the players can see it. The card will have a value ranging from 5 to 30, with the value being commensurate with the penalty value of the instruction on it. If a subsequent player lands on a numbered field that has already been taken, then he treats the space as a normal space without number.<br/><br/>When the numbered space 30 has been reached, that player has finished. The others play on. When all the players have reached the 30 space, the 'won' cards are added up and the winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

Each player plays cards to win tricks against the others over multiple rounds.<br/><br/>Players score points by winning tricks (or turns), correctly betting how many tricks they will win per round, and successfully executing certain abilities. The game lasts, at a minimum, long enough for each player to be dealer. For longer games, each player may be dealer multiple times. After the final round, the player with the most accumulated points is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is composed of 46 game cards. These cards are divided into three suits: HUMAN, DWARF, and DARK ELF, and one wildcard. Each suit is made up of fifteen different cards, each card having a distinct value, indicated by both the number in the top left and bottom right corners of the card. A card&rsquo;s value is akin to its strength or power. If two cards share the same suit, the card with a higher value will beat the card with a lower value, thus winning the trick (or turn).<br/><br/>Each round consists of a series of 7 turns for each player, called tricks. Every trick, each player will play one card from their hand face up into the middle. One player will lead (that is, play the first card of the trick), and the others will follow in clockwise order. Based on the cards played, one player will be said to win the trick.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Two guys swindle him into believing they can weave an exceptionally beautiful attire that only the smartest can see. In reality there are no clothes but reluctant to admit he isn't smart, he parades through town until a boy yells out: &quot;but he isn't wearing any clothes!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cards of Сonflict (1 Edition) is a very controversial, if not &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; game. In it, participants will select the most successful answers to strange questions. Uncensored. Without political correctness. No brakes. Cards of Сonflict raises a wide variety of topics, often going far beyond the generally accepted norms of decency and etiquette. But if your company prefers black humor, banter over everything, and undisguised sarcasm, then this game is just what you need. Here you can plunge into the world of toilet jokes about orgies, people of non-standard sexual orientation, racism, and of course, laugh heartily at other charms of modern civilization.<br/><br/>Table of Contents Cards Board Game Content:<br/><br/>     30 cards with questions<br/>     150 cards with answers<br/>     rules of the game<br/><br/><br/>The game begins with the fact that each player receives 10 white cards. In the first round, 1 player is selected - &quot;Card Bro&quot; of this round. &quot;Card bro&quot; takes 1 black card from the deck (black cards lie in one deck with the inscription down) and read out the text loudly. Each of the participants (except for &quot;Card bro&quot;) chooses one of his white cards that seems to him the most suitable.<br/><br/>White cards are transferred to Card Bro, which in turn reads each option separately. We recommend that you reread the black card completely before reading out a new white card. &quot;Card bro&quot; is chosen by the winner, in his opinion, the option. The player whose white card wins this round receives a black card as a &ldquo;ball.&quot;<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player draws a new white card from the deck, so that at the beginning of the next round everyone has 10 white cards. White cards used in this round can be put down the white deck so that after a while they will return to them again. In each subsequent round, a new Card Bro is selected so that each player receives this role in turn. You yourself can choose the principle of changing &ldquo;bro&rdquo;: clockwise / counterclockwise, by height, age, leg size, or another sign that is understandable to all participants.<br/><br/>There are black cards in the deck, labeled &ldquo;take 2&rdquo;. In this case, each player must choose 2 white cards to form a winning combination. It is important to read the white cards in the correct order. Therefore, the card, the text of which you want to read first, you always need to put under the second card and so transmit &quot;bro.&quot;<br/><br/>If you wish, you can modify the rules, for example, play without a &ldquo;Card Bro&rdquo;. In this case, each player votes for the option that he liked and gets the most votes with the score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First game of the Button Shy Big Box series<br/><br/><br/>Is a zebra black with white stripes? Or black with white stripes?<br/><br/>Players fit shapes within a grid, adding striped patterns which not only affect their score but also define where additional shapes may go. If a player can&rsquo;t fit a shape, they must instead add circles which deduct points during scoring<br/><br/><br/>Did you know that you can theoretically color in any map using at most 4 colors, no matter how complicated the borders are? Well you&rsquo;re going to put the 4-color theory to the ultimate test. Try to fill in your player sheet with as few patterns as possible, all while being efficient in your polyomino placement.<br/><br/>Each turn, you&rsquo;ll flip over a single card that has a polyomino shape on it. You&rsquo;ll either draw it, pause, or pass.<br/><br/>When you draw a shape, you have to draw it next to a shape already on your sheet. You then fill it with 1 of 4 different striped patterns. The shape you draw can&rsquo;t have the same pattern as any of the other shapes it touches. You want to use as few patterns as possible,since the first pattern is worth the most points and other patterns go down in value.<br/><br/>If you don&rsquo;t want to draw the shape, you can pause. Fill in all of the empty spaces in an enclosed area with circles. This way, you can try and wait for the perfect piece to pop up. But be careful, circles are worth negative points at the end of the game, so use this power wisely.<br/><br/>If you can&rsquo;t fit the shape AND you can&rsquo;t pause, you have to pass. Fill in a single space on your sheet with a circle. Once you have fewer than 4 empty spaces together anywhere on your sheet, your game is over. Fill in all remaining spaces with circles.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, total up your points. These shapes are worth 4 points each, these ones are worth 2 points each, and these ones are worth 1 point each. These ones aren&rsquo;t worth anything, but you&rsquo;ll get a bonus 5 points if you don&rsquo;t have ANY shapes with this pattern. Very efficient of you!<br/><br/>Zebra has players think differently about how polyominoes are placed, not just how tightly packed they are. It&rsquo;s not just black and white! Zebra is quick, easy to teach, and gives you a player sheet you&rsquo;d be proud to hang on your wall once you&rsquo;re done playing. Thanks for watching!<br/><br/>",

You are one of two Masters commanding the Children of the Sun, an organization of famous supernatural warriors with the power to handle the dangerous menace. When it comes to securing your legacy, however, you have some tough competition. Aim for greater achievements than the other Master and establish your reputation as the city&rsquo;s most skilled ghost fighter!<br/><br/>In 太陽の子供たち (&quot;Children of the Sun&quot;), two players build a grid of cards around the ghost. When the siege is complete, each placed card determines the direction the ghost will move, and the previously occupied card is removed from the grid. If the player catches the ghost in a line of matching colored cards, they may acquire the removed card for their reserve or secretly check the cards making up the ghost's shield.<br/><br/>Once both players have played all their cards, they use any cards they &quot;rescued&quot; to attack the ghost. Players score points based on their ability to match the ghost's weaknesses over several rounds of attacks. The player who damages the ghost the most and receives the most points will win.<br/><br/>Solo rules are also available. When playing alone, the player manipulates two hands of cards to achieve the highest score possible.<br/><br/>",

The player aims to get rich by digging for the most valuable resources and panning for gold.<br/><br/>Each turn, the player rolls three dice and uses them to explore a new area. The dice values are also used to build up the value of key resources &ndash; copper, silver, and gems &ndash; which can maximize the output of each dig. In addition, the player acquires rumors of gold, which can yield valuable riches when exploring the right river areas.<br/><br/>The player uses the dice values, and modifiers gained through the game, to choose the best times and locations to collect resources. When the player can no longer explore a new area, they add up their gold and the value of their completed digs to get their final score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players roll dice to collect Gift Cards worth different values; at the end of five rounds the player with the highest total value Gift Cards is the winner.<br/><br/>The game includes its own dice tower and specialty dice. Each of the dice has six different holiday symbols on them: gift, holly, candy cane, snowflake, star, and coal. Players are each dealt three Gift cards, which have different quantities of the symbols on them -- the more symbols, the higher the value. The active player drops the six dice down the tower, then tries to match the rolled symbols to the cards in their hand. If there is a match with a card, those dice are set aside and the remainder re-rolled. Also, the card that matched is set aside for later scoring. Each player may roll the dice up to three times on their turn. If a coal symbol is rolled, that die remains on the table, and if the player accumulates three coal symbols, their turn is over and they may not score any cards.<br/><br/>After the third roll, all other player may attempt to match the symbols on the set-aside dice to those on their Gift cards, and those Gift cards are kept by that player, so everyone is potentially accumulating points. If three coal symbols are rolled, no player scores any points that turn. If the active player rolls three of a kind of any symbol (except coal) they may decide to take an Action card, which must be played immediately. The Actions are 'Nice' (take an extra roll of all six dice), 'Naughty' (next player loses their next turn), and 'Gift Exchange' (the active player may swap one of their Gift cards with a higher-value Gift card of another player, or from the Gift card deck).<br/><br/>When the active player's turn ends, play passes clockwise to the next player. Once all players have had five turns (five rounds), the game ends and each player's collected Gift cards are totaled. The player with the highest total wins.<br/><br/>This game is a tie-in to the publisher's &quot;Elf on a Shelf&quot; system.<br/><br/>",

Inside each is a small piece of card with eight counters to cut out and use with the game. It&rsquo;s a two player game which takes around five minutes to play.<br/><br/>The card shows ski slopes, down which snowballs can run. Half the funds go to Camp Stripe and half to Camp Spots, which are both at the bottom of the card. The slopes are interrupted by cogs, which can send snowballs down one of two slopes, depends which way they are tilted &mdash; or can be horizontal and stop the snowball! The aim of the game is to get as many snowballs as possible into your camp. One player is aiming for Camp Stripe, the other Camp Spots.  Players take turns at rolling two dice, and then use the results to move cogs or release snowballs. The snowball rolls down the slopes until it gets to a horizontal cog &mdash; or until it arrives in one of the two camps!<br/><br/>This is published as an A5 greetings card and is played using cut out counters included in the envelope. All you (or the lucky people to whom you send the card) need to find is some scissors and two standard six-side dice. It is also available as a print-and-play.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Das Kleinhorn vom Riesenwald, suitably played color cards let four giants rush through the forest to guard unicorns. There are an amazing number of them: little unicorns, no unicorns, piecemeal unicorns, and of course pig unicorns, slime unicorns and sunshine unicorns.<br/><br/>The giant of a played card color always moves through the forest. It runs to a unicorn of the type that can also be seen on the card that has just been played. The unicorn can be collected and guarded immediately. Usually another animal appears on the spot. If you also have a matching card in your hand, you can add that animal to your hoard, too. If you don't find a unicorn of the card you played in the forest, you can steal one from the other players.<br/><br/>When the day and the game end, whoever has the largest collection of small unicorns, no unicorns, piecemeal unicorns, and so on wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Setup: Choose a player to be the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck, then deals five cards face down to each player. The dealer places the remaining deck face down to form the draw pile. The discard pile: During the game, a discard pile will form next to the draw pile. Player cannot draw cards from the discard pile.  The non-dealing player takes the first turn. Player then alternate turns.<br/><br/>On Your Turn: Place an offensive card (or combination of cards) from your hand face down in front of you, either to set up a shot or take one.<br/><br/>Setting up a shot: In order to play a SHOT card to try to score a goal, you must first play 3, 4, or 5 offensive cards to get close enough to do so. The number of setup plays you need is shown at the top of each SHOT card. The Cards that set up a SHOT are PASS cards, HEADER cards, and the FLOP card.<br/><br/>Taking a shot: Once you've made enough plays to take a certain goal shot, you may play that SHOT card on your next turn. Before playing the card, say &quot;SHOT!&quot; Then hold your SHOT card face down in the center of the playing area. If your opponent has a SAVE card, he/she holds it face down near your SHOT card.  On the count of three, you and your opponent flip your cards face up, checking out the cards to see if your shot is blocked or not. If  your goal shot is blocked, place your possession, the SHOT card and the SAVE card face down into the discard pile. Both player replenish their hands to five cards. This ends your turn. If you score a goal, place your possession beside you with the SHOT card face up on top, to remind you that you scored a goal, This also end your turn.<br/><br/>Ending a Half: When the draw pile runs out, keep taking turns to play as many of your cards as you can. If one player runs out of plays, the other player can keep making plays until no more plays are possible.  Remember how many goal you scored in the first half. Then shuffle the entire deck and begin the second half, with the player who did not deal in the first half dealing. The second half plays and the ends the same as the first half.<br/><br/>How to win: When the second half ends, the player with the most goals wins. In case of a tie, play again. The player who score the first goal wins<br/><br/>",

During the mining phase, players take turns drawing gems from the gembag, pulling 1-3 at a time. If they draw more than the specified amounts shown on that round's king card, then the player must give up that color of cubes along with extras as a penalty. Players can stop drawing gems at any time, and players score points based on the number of gems they draw in a round.<br/><br/>Players then build mini-pyramids of four gems, with more points being scored when the pyramids have fewer colors in them. You must use all of your gems each round, whether to complete pyramids started by others or to leave half-finished pyramids of your own.<br/><br/>After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

In both games, the core rules are largely the same: You are a champion who must fight for your nation and defeat all of your opponents. Each champion has three attributes: a class, an element, and a type of arms, all imbued with incredible power. When one champion is attacked by another, the damage they take exposes the nature of their attributes, revealing the weakened champion's true form to the other players. However, once these attributes have been revealed, the champion who wields them can start to benefit from their abilities.<br/><br/>In order to win, you have to reveal the right card at the right time while not giving your opponents the opportunity to do the same. In the team match you also have to figure out who your allies are before the other teams do. Be the last one standing &mdash; or the only team still in the game &mdash; to win.<br/><br/>",

These will represent the procession.<br/><br/>Depending on the layout of the cards, you may have to tap certain piles. If you succeed to be the first, you win the cards in the pile. The player who collects the most cards before the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The game is accompanied by a booklet that provides keys to understanding police practices in France. It was written by two associations fighting for the freedom to demonstrate and denouncing police violence: ACAT-France (Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture) and LDH (Ligue des droits de l'Homme).<br/><br/>",

The other side pulls out into a tri-fold board which unfolds to 6&quot; x 3.5&quot; (15 cm x 9 cm), remaining attached to the plastic case.

        "description": "You are an astrophysicist. There is an Alien Life Form roaming about the galaxy and it can only be captured by creating a special serum composed of samples from each of the six planetary bodies. Your mission is to soar around the galaxy and collect samples from each of the six planets and bring them back home in order to convert them into concentrate to create the serum, which will ultimately draw ALF to you. Your respect and possible future missions rely on this, so you must succeed before the other scientists do! But beware, as there is a black hole that will mysteriously spiral your work into the vortex, and Space Hubs that will intercept your journey...for better or for worse!<br/><br/>In Pulsar, outer space is the limit. Playability is endless as 24 Galaxy cards (including Stars, Planets, and Space Hubs) are randomly laid out in 5 x 5 grid to create the board around the central Black Hole. Sample/Concentrate cards are stacked on their respective Planets, and Hub cards are divided and placed on the Space Hubs, triggered when a scientist must stop at one. Rockets soar around space in movement patterns designated by a Vector Die roll, building warp speed, and by manipulation if in another rocket&rsquo;s path. The goal is to land on the Planets, initiating the serum-development process. Each scientist also has his/her own special forte, determined by the random dealing of Character cards at the start of each game.<br/><br/>Space can be an awfully big place! A team-play variant allows scientists to work together, combining their character powers and using the bump-and-go rocket system to propel each other around the galaxy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Arab Israeli Wars is an 3rd party expansion for Axis & Allies and is a territorial strategy board game covering the 1967 and 1973 wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors. It is an Empires of History game, which utilizes a D10 variant of the Axis & Allies gaming system. The Arab Israeli Wars includes 2 game scenarios; one for the 1967 War and one for the 1973 War.<br/> In the 1967 war, Israel must strike out quickly to wrestle the Sinai region away from Egypt and deal deadly blows against Syria and Jordan before the weight of the superior Arab numbers can fully be mobilized, and before Iraq joins in the war against them. Israel's ready reserves gives them an edge in calling up their armies and they have to leverage that for everything it is worth.<br/><br/>In the 1973 war, Israel begins play in control of the Sinai, Palestine, and the Golan Heights. The Arab powers must hit Israel hard and fast, trying to overrun Israel's border armies before Israel can mobilize its then-superior military might.<br/><br/>The Arab Israeli Wars is a fast paced game (some games can be concluded in as little as a hour) historically portraying these two middle east conflicts. Optional rules for land mines and the use of the nuclear weapons adds additional game play variety.<br/><br/>Contents: <br/><br/>    17&quot; x 22&quot; four piece Cardstock Game Map (four 8.5&quot;x11&quot; sheets) <br/>    270 Plastic Playing Tokens. <br/>    270 Plastic Playing Tokens Stickers. <br/>    Game Rule Booklet. <br/>    1D10 <br/>    Cardstock cut out Mines, Nukes, and National Markers<br/><br/><br/>Expansion For:<br/><br/>    Axis & Allies<br/><br/><br/>",

On the first night after the crash, the survivors realize that there were werewolves on the plane with them. These fiends organized the whole crash so that they could hunt down some humans in the moonlight. There is only one way to survive until the rescue crew arrives &ndash; find out who the werewolves are and lynch them.<br/><br/>The Island of Fear is probably the most advanced version of the world-renowned Mafia game. First of all, in addition to the normal tourists and werewolves, there is a sexual predator, a clairvoyant, a nurse, a witch, an untouchable, a nightwalker, a half-blood werewolf and even a were-hamster. All sorts of nasty surprises can be expected from this colorful group of people.  Second, the game contains a set of event cards that create specific events as the game progresses. Third, there are object cards that can both help or hinder the owner. Finally, the game comes with a DVD with mood-setting backgrounds and a timer for day-time voting. Also included are a chart and voting tokens to help manage the game.<br/><br/>",

Whoever gets back to their homeland first with their fleet and who purchases and sells their goods the most cleverly is the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>~from the back of the box (via Google Translate)<br/><br/>Another game in the &quot;Bestseller Autoren&quot; series from Schmidt.

        "description": "Throwing Stones was released as both an RPG and a &quot;board&quot; game.  The board game is a dice-based arena combat game between two contestants.  It can result in some tense, close combats.  There are many different dice and many combinations of dice available, so choosing your dice before the combat is an important part of the game.<br/><br/>Each contestant has four dice that define him.  Four dice of the same type can be used, but that limits the player's abilities. The dice were collectible: there were quite a few different types made, some more powerful than others.  All dice are six-sided and have special glyphs on them.<br/><br/>To fight, players each roll all four of their dice and count up symbols for initiative.  Low initiative has to state his action first, then the higher initiative character can respond.<br/><br/>Attacks are resolved by announcing the type of attack attempted and throw the dice again.  This time the player is looking for Strike and Special glyphs.  The opponent declares his action and rolls and hopes to get defensive, counterstrike, and special glyphs.  Players record damage, and continue until only one fighter is conscious.<br/><br/>Some of the glyphs include: Unarmed combat, various magic spells, knockdown, bypass armor, poison, luck (reroll some dice!), roll with the blow, strike again, counterstrike, disarm, berserk, centered, zealous, sword, stun, skill+, and many others.  All are described in detail in the 96-page book.  (Only about a quarter of the book is pertinent to the arena combat game; the rest is for the RPG.)<br/><br/>",

You each will have 13 days to HUNT and bring back as many animals as you can. Do you have what it takes to unseat the current World Champion?<br/><br/>HUNT is a solo card game that combines familiar elements of deckbuilding along with hand-management. It features multi-use cards that can be used in 3 different ways. The theme is integrated into the game in a very realistic way and hunters will appreciate that and non-hunters will learn a thing or two about the sport all while appreciating the cohesive mechanics.<br/><br/>Gary is controlled by an AI deck and presents a very consistent and challenging experience every game. There is an element of memory to the game but many ways for the player to make choices to limit that by the cards they buy and in the starting deck itself. Those already familiar with Tournament Fishing will enjoy the familiar mechanics and find something new and unique as well. For those that have not, HUNT is also a great starting point to see if you like the system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Alemannen-Skat, played with a 7 through ace from a standard deck of cards, the two players simultaneously each select a card from their hand, then reveal it; then they do that again.  Next, the highest card &quot;grabs&quot; the second-highest card, and the lowest card &quot;grabs&quot; the second-lowest card.  The players now place their winnings on one of three fields they have, color-coded like a traffic light:<br/><br/><br/>     green: the value of the cards on it are multiplied by +2<br/>     yellow: the value of the cards on it are multiplied by +1<br/>     red: the value of the cards on it are multiplied by -1<br/><br/><br/>The cards and suits all have specific relative values, so every card can be ranked uniquely, and some card score more than others.  Additionally, the positive discard fields have a limit of how many of the 32 cards in the deck they can receive.<br/><br/>Published in spielbox Number 4 of 2007.<br/><br/>",

The mouse would attempt to capture as many pieces of the cheese placed throughout the house as he could without being caught. However, if the kitty manages to catch him, he'll have to give up one of his six shiny trinkets for the kitty to wear. Let the competition begin!<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Play starts with the first player turning over the top card of his face-down Draw Pile and placing the card face up in the center of the table. This card starts the Play Pile for the game. The type of card that is played will determine the sequence of actions that takes place next. As soon as all 6 Kitty Pawns are awarded, the game ends. Each player then counts up his or her combined cards and Kitty Pawns. The player with the most combined cards and Kitty Pawns is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Three red-backed &quot;mime&quot; cards are shuffled with the 26 red-backed scene cards to form a deck.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player draws the top card from the deck, then acts out a scene, complete with whatever thoughts, cries, declarations, etc. best fit the word bubble or thought bubble on the card. The other players race to identify which beige card matches the scene being acted out. Each player can choose only one card, and no card can be chosen more than once. If the correct card is chosen, the guesser scores the beige card and the actor keeps the red card; otherwise both scene cards are removed from the game and the actor takes the &quot;Malus&quot; card (whether from the table or another player).<br/><br/>If a player draws a Mime card, he discards it, draws the next card, and acts out the scene but without any dialogue or sounds.<br/><br/>The game ends when either two beige cards remain on the table or after the third Mime card has been resolved. Players scores one point per card collected, with the holder of the Malus card losing one point. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1982 two Italian journalists and historians, Indro Montanelli and Mario Cervi, published a 10-volumes encyclopedia about the history of the modern wars: from American Revolution to latest conflicts (Korea and Vietnam). The name of the work has been Due Secoli di Guerre: &ldquo;Two Centuries of Wars&rdquo;<br/><br/>Emilio Ceretti, chief of the Editrice Giochi, asked to Alex Randolph to invent a boardgame inspired to the encyclopedia.<br/><br/>Being impossible to simulate battles in a period of time from gunpowder to jet fighters, the result is a sort of an abstract wargame which tries to contain some fixed elements of war: strength vs. mobility, random factor, and bluff.<br/><br/>The game components are:<br/>-a board with an irregular tessellation<br/>-60 grey pieces with 3 holes each<br/>-120 flags, 30 for every color (red, green, yellow, blue)<br/>-the &ldquo;bluffing bell&rdquo;<br/><br/>Every player gets 30 flags of his color, and places them on 15 grey pieces. A piece with 3 flags has strength 3 and can move one space. A piece with 2 flags has strength 2 and can move up to two spaces&hellip; and I think the readers can guess the features of a piece with one flag on it&hellip;<br/><br/>Every player enters his units in the map from one side, and tries to win being the first to reach the opposite side with one of his units.<br/><br/>The combat system is quite original, and uses the &ldquo;bluffing bell&rdquo;. This is a little device similar to an hand-bell, containing two little 6-sided dices. Shaking the device makes the dices roll, and pressing the device on the table causes the dices to be blocked on their result. After the pressing of the &ldquo;bell&rdquo;, the player who is using it can pull it up and see the result, without showing it to other players. The player can repeat the shaking a number of times equal to the number of his flags involved in the combat, until he is satisfied (or wants to feign to be satisfied) by the result: at this point he can declare a result (obviously he can declare a number different from the real one!)<br/>The opponent can now accept the declared result, and then try to get and declare an higher number; elsewhere he can try to see the bluff&hellip;<br/><br/>Entering the central red square allows the player to aim an &ldquo;artillery shot&rdquo; to an enemy unit.<br/><br/>According to Alex Randolph&rsquo;s ludography compiled by Philippe Evrard, &ldquo;Due Secoli di Guerre&rdquo; has been published only in Italy by Editrice Giochi, and there is no report about editions in other countries.<br/><br/>",

Upon touching the stone, elephants turn into dragons and this fills the animals with fear.  Two rival elephantine tribes, each controlled by a player, decide to dump the stone onto their rival's territory and make it their concern instead.<br/><br/>The players are free to move their pieces around on the board, even into squares with their own pieces or opponent's.  They take control of the Drumlin when their piece moves onto it.  In a square with several pieces, the player with a majority of pieces takes control.  The player in control can then pass the Drumlin to another square, depending on the formation of his or her pieces.  The passing elephant then turns into a dragon, which cannot pass or catch the Drumlin.<br/><br/>The first player to pass the Drumlin onto his or her opponent's edge of the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The animal in question this game is Franquin's marsupilami &ndash; the spotted leopardy dog with the incredibly lengthy tail. Each player has his own marsupilami, with the tail being a piece of string.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls three dice &ndash; white, black and yellow &ndash; and depending on the roll of the white die, players consult the black or yellow die (or possibly still the white) to see what they have to do. In some cases the active player tries to slam a cage on the marsupilamis, taking a food token from the owner of each animal he captures; in other cases the goal is the same, but the active player must pay everyone he doesn't capture. Sometimes the active player can fake a capture, taking food from anyone who feverishly yanks his marsupilami out of range.<br/><br/>Players start the game with a number of food tokens, and the game ends as soon as one (or more) players has 15 tokens or 0 tokens. In either case, the player with the most tokens wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zombie Shuffle is a game for 2 to 4 players that lasts about 5 to 10 minutes by Blaise Sewell and Feels Right Design. Just like in any zombie story the object of the game is to survive the zombie apocalypse. Before you begin, you set up the Zombie Cards in this nifty &quot;Z&quot; shape and pick your Survivor Card to represent you in the game.<br/><br/>Everyone is dealt 5 cards that are a random set of weapons, some of which offer a utility function, but ALL of them can be used to Attack Zombies and other Survivors.<br/>Zombie Shuffle cycles between a Night Phase, where you must defeat incoming zombies, and a Day Phase that offers the opportunity to prepare for the next zombie attack. The game begins when the first zombie in the &quot;Z&quot; is flipped. Survivors must Attack the zombie with ANY 2 through 10 card corresponding with that zombie's suit.<br/><br/>The winner keeps the Zombie card to track their number of kills. If a player does not lay down a card corresponding with that zombie's suit then they are considered Attacked and either lose equipped armor or become a zombie!Before the next zombie card is flipped, Survivors can use the Zombie Cure, Equip Armor (which protects from Attacks), Steal another Survivor's Weapons/Supplies or may instead decide to Attack another Survivor.<br/><br/>Just like Attacking a Zombie, the Attack Card must correspond with the Survivor you're Attacking. If a Survivor is a Zombie and loses one of these battles then they are Dead for the remainder of the game. The other Survivor gets to keep their card, again to track their number of kills, and scavenge the dead player's cards.<br/><br/>The Day Phase ends when  everyone has had a chance to play a Utility or Attack Card and everyone has drawn enough cards to have 5 cards in their hand again.<br/><br/>The winner is the Survivor with the most kills at the end of the game. This has been a quick rundown of the game play and there are a few more awesome quirks to Zombie Shuffle not listed above. (For example, each Survivor has a unique Melee Weapon that can give them a Power-Up when equipped.<br/><br/>",

They reveal and resolve these ability cards simultaneously, then see who wins the round and claims the egg card.<br/><br/>A player can pass on bidding in a round by discarding one of the egg cards they've previously collected.<br/><br/>",

Strategically strengthen your armies on the districts of the city under your control, attack the neighboring districts to expand your dominion. Try to reach your goal and defeat your opponents to remain the only ones left on the board and win!<br/><br/>In this game we find ourselves playing the opponents of the superhero. The title includes up to a maximum of four players, who can however choose from the most iconic villains of Gotham City: Bane, Joker, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler and Harley Quinn.<br/><br/>This is a first new element compared to the classic version of RisiKo! In fact, each villain will have a Criminal Plan to carry out, developed in different missions (such as taking control of specific territories or making certain results with the dice). Achieving a certain number of objectives will activate the character's special powers, giving the player various advantages during the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Clearly while the villains compete for the districts of Gotham City (following the traditional RisiKo! dice-rolling mechanic!) Our hero is not standing idle. When five 1's are rolled during a turn, Batman goes into action, clearing one or more territories on the board and wreaking havoc in the fight for control of the metropolis. Especially in the initial stages it will not be easy to watch, but it will always be a great emotion to swoop into our opponents. It will be less pleasant when it's our turn to face the Dark Knight, but that's part of the challenge too.<br/><br/>In addition to conquering all of Gotham, you can take home the game by completing one of three objectives, common to all participants. However, every time a criminal empire is definitively defeated, the player who accomplished the feat can choose to eliminate one of the conditions.<br/><br/><br/>RisiKo! Il Gioco di strategia pi&ugrave; amato in una edizione speciale ambientata nel mondo DC! Nei panni di uno dei Supercriminali di Gotham City scenderete in citt&agrave; per conquistarla! Rinforzate strategicamente le vostre armate sui distretti della citt&agrave; sotto il vostro controllo, attaccate i distretti confinanti per ampliare il vostro dominio.

But pro basketball is a player's game, and sometimes the play that the coach designs doesn't work, so here comes a 20-foot jumper from the least likely shooter on the court as the clock is about to reach triple zeroes. The shot is true, tickling the net as the home crowd groans!<br/><br/>Is this a scene from any given night in the pro game? Absolutely &ndash; and it's also a scene that can happen with the same frequency when you play Basketball Bones, PT Games' new tabletop simulation of pro basketball using four dice (&quot;bones&quot;) and player cards for a remarkably compact, efficient game engine in which very few charts are consulted and almost every possession is resolved by the dice and cards. Rebounding beasts, three point specialists, needle-threading passers and ham-handed, foul-prone defenders are all here, ready to perform for you on your tabletop as if it was made of hardwood. From the league's MVP to the 12th man on the worst team in the league, Basketball Bones rates every pro player in shooting percentage, field goal attempt frequency, rebounding, passing and more. The Rare Play charts introduce intangibles such as momentum swings, injuries, boneheaded decisions, and more!<br/><br/>",

When player grids are full after 25 cards, grids are scored.<br/>  <br/>Scoring:  The 5-card hand of each grid row and column is scored according to a point system.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Poker Squares Hand Scoring Systems<br/><br/>    <br/>         Poker Hand <br/>         American Points <br/>         English Points<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Royal Flush <br/>         100 <br/>         30<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Straight Flush <br/>         75 <br/>         30<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Four of a Kind <br/>         50 <br/>         16<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Full House <br/>         25 <br/>         10<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Flush <br/>         20 <br/>         5<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Straight <br/>         15 <br/>         12<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Three of a Kind <br/>         10 <br/>         6<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Two Pair <br/>         5 <br/>         2<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         One Pair <br/>         2 <br/>         1<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         High Card <br/>         0 <br/>         0<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>A player's total score is the sum of the hand scores for each of the 10 row and column hands.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Canopea is a cooperative game that cleverly combines dexterity, memory and strategical thinking. Within the same game, each player can adapt the difficulty according to their age, so the entire family can take part in the adventure. Board together your puck aircraft and fly towards 3D Tree Cities to recover birds in need of protection from poachers.<br/><br/>A game of Canopea consists of 5 trips to bring as many birds as possible to safety before they are captured by poachers. You begin each trip with a new mission that targets a species of bird to recover. You then must navigate between the 6 Tree Cities to find endangered birds.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, you have three chances to move the puck aircraft, hit a Tree City and make as many piled up Bird tokens fall from the city. Recover all tokens that match your mission but if you cannot find any, then poachers attack and can damage the aircraft or steal your birds. Whenever you want to, head back to Canopea to definitively bring all recovered birds to safety. Then, start a new trip with a new mission.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the aircraft and the Tree Cities will move on the table and will not come back to their initial position. Distances between cities will grow, increasing the difficulty of moves and missions.<br/><br/>Canopea is an entirely intergenerational game and its varied mechanical elements allow all players to capitalise on their strengths: memory for the youngest, dexterity for teenagers, strategical thinking for adults. What is more, it is possible to adapt the difficulty to each adventurer within the same game: adults can increase the challenge by only using one or two moves per turn while younger children (from age 4) can simply move the Aircraft without the propeller.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you roll 3-5 dice (depending on your current top slice) and the chance die. After your roll, if any single die or the sum of any number of dice matches your top slice, you remove it; keep removing slices as long as the numbers add up. If, for example, you rolled 1, 2, 5 at the start of the game, you could remove the 1, 2 &amp; 3 slices.<br/><br/>You now either end your turn or roll again. If you roll again and fail to remove a slice, you must place slice cards back on your deck as a penalty.<br/><br/>The chance die may give you the opportunity to swap decks with another player &mdash; or force you to swap with whoever has the largest deck! Alternatively, you might gain the Nope! token and use it to block a deck, whether to keep an opponent from removing cards from it or to protect your deck from being stolen.<br/><br/>Countalope can also be played as a multi-round game, with players scoring 1 point per card removed, with a game ending when someone has 16 points. Whoever reaches 100 points first wins.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a board representing thirty-six countries, passports, passport stamps, travel tickets, country cards, pawns, dice, and money. There are four travel tickets: plane, boat, train, and car. Tickets are purchased randomly and then used to travel around the board. Each country has certain forms of travel going to different countries. Moves must be mapped out to make sure you get the best use out of your tickets. Money is obtained by rolling the dice. Each roll means something different, just don't roll a seven or you'll have to draw a country card and have to visit that country as well before you can win. For each country you visit you get a stamp for your passport. Once all your countries have been stamped, head home to win the game.<br/><br/>This is a unique but very fun game.

Each card gives four clues: 1) A syllable clue--for instance &quot;Think Link&quot; indicates two one-syllable words,Thinkit Linkitindicates two two-syllable words, etc. 2) A link clue--synonyms for each word in the answer are given, &quot;Enormous Toupee&quot; for &quot;Big Wig&quot; for instance. 3) A letter clue, which gives the first letter of each word in the answer. And 4) A phrase clue, &quot;Covers a bald spot&quot; for &quot;Big Wig&quot; for example.  On a player's turn, another player chooses a card and reads the syllable and link clues aloud.  If they guess the answer correctly, they score the points printed on the card (either 5 or 10--cards are double-sided with easier 5 point links printed in blue on one side and harder 10 point links printed in orange on the other.)  For each additional clue given, one point is subtracted, with the player losing a point from their score if they fail to guess it after all four clues have been given.  It is suggested in the rules that participants play to a score of 100.<br/><br/>This game was published in two editions: a pocket edition with 50 cards, and a deluxe edition with 500 cards.  The pocket edition also includes a small pad of paper and a pencil for keeping score.<br/><br/>In 2005, a new deluxe edition was released with 1000 cards, and new pocket editions: Classic, Junior, Sports, Genius, Food &amp; Cooking, and Science, Animals &amp; Nature.<br/><br/>",

Play continues to the next player.<br/><br/>When the stack collapses, the faulting player gains points from the sum of the top face of the dice touching the table. The game continues until one player earns 100 points, ending the game and making the player with the fewest points the winner.<br/><br/>Dicey comes with 22 dice and 13 cards.<br/><br/>",

The player with 21 or that the closest wins the gold coin. The player with over 21 lose one gold this round.<br/><br/>If 2 or more players have tied having 21 they each won a gold coin taken from the treasure, unless a player has two cards with only 21, he has a &quot;Blackjack&quot; and then won 2 pieces of gold.<br/>If 2 or more player have tied having less than 21, nobody takes the gold but one more gold piece are taken into play for the next round.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who has won the most gold coins when the treasure is empty or there are no more cards in the deck.<br/><br/>",

If you recall, the industrialists gather and manage resources (Hydrogen, Oxygen, Water and Stone) in order to provide for their families and keep the city in the clouds afloat.<br/><br/>But now...<br/><br/>Empacta, the planet beneath the cloud city, is in bad shape - which is rough news for everyone. After an eternity of exploiting the Empacta's resources, it is dried up and the ecosystem is exhausted.<br/><br/>As an industrialist, you will use your resources to help re-shape the planet. By gathering and forming collections of assigned resources you will terraform Empacta back to its prime. After all, a city in the clouds is nothing without the planet below.<br/><br/>In Feat on the Ground, each player will take their turn by playing a card to the map, adding resources or removing them. Together you will be working on a defined area, but players will assume different roles once an area is completed. If a player completes the area on their turn, they will get credit and score points. If it&rsquo;s completed on their opponent&rsquo;s turn, they will stash resources to bring back with them. At the end of the game, players score points if they stashed the most of a resource type. In the end, the player that manages to do these the best is declared winner.<br/><br/>NOTE: Feat On The Ground requires 9 coins/cubes/tokens for tracking scores.<br/><br/>",

A group of different families are stuck in the restroom and have to escape from this vengeful ghost called Kayoko. <br/>Each player will have 3 of the same colored play figures which represents a family to control. The players need to cooperate to escape the restroom, avoid the vengeful ghost Kayoko by rolling a die and moving to different toilet stalls and opening them by flipping cards either finding items or hiding in the toilet stalls to avoid danger. Be careful though you might encounter Kayoko or other vengeful ghosts on your search. If you find Kayoko the player needs to roll the die to escape from her which is represented by a meeple. If you roll any of the bloody marks on the die Kayoko will move that many spaces counterclockwise only around the restroom. If Kayoko lands where a play figure is that play figure is dead and sent to the depths of hell. The goal of the game is to find a key to open a door card and escape.  Only one play figure needs to escape for all players to win.  The players will lose if all play figures are dead or if the time hits 2AM.

The other players, in any order, try to say &quot;First (werewolf howl)&quot;, &quot;Second (werewolf howl)&quot;, etc., but they can't say something at the same time as another player; if they do, or if someone says that wrong thing, then the round ends and those magicians receive a curse token worth -1 point.<br/><br/>As magicians answer correctly, they throw their magic spell cards into the box in the center of the table. Once the round ends, in the order that they threw their cards in the box they claim one ingredient from a stack, revealing the next ingredient if they took a face-up tile. If someone reveals a curse tile, then she must take that, too.<br/><br/>When two stacks are empty or all of the curse tokens have been taken, the game ends. Players then score 3, 7 or 10 points for their completed potions (which take 3-5 ingredients), 1 point for each magic potion, and -1 for each curse (with an additional -4 points for whoever has the most).

It uses unique selection of MahJong cards, and each card is added a color code (blue, green, red, white or black) for special scoring. With exceptional game play and color code, White Dragon brings you more fun and strategy than the traditional MahJong. All you need is 5 cards on hand and little or no MahJong knowledge to play. The first player collects 30 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Goal / Winning the Game:<br/>After creating a Set, player chooses to keep one of the cards for end of the Round scoring. When one player completes five Sets, he calls MahJong and wins the Round immediately. He then uses the one card from each Set to calculate the score point. Player&rsquo;s score points are accumulated after every winning round, and the player who accumulates 30 or more points wins the game.<br/><br/>Player: 2<br/>Time: 24.7 Min<br/>Age: Ages 8 and up<br/><br/>Components: 54 cards<br/><br/>Three Dragon Expansions: TZQ Red Dragon, TZQ White Dragon, and TZQ Green Dragon.

Each player controls two cue balls; in addition, there are 10 neutral balls, moved by the cue balls.  The object is to maneuver five neutral balls into the pockets (once there, they are removed for score).<br/><br/>On your turn, you pick a cue ball and launch it in one of eight possible directions.  Your cue ball may travel any distance in a straight line before hitting a neutral (or another cue ball); at that moment, its momentum is transferred and the ball hit moves the same distance.  Should you hit a row of balls, only the farthest one moves (as in a Newton's Cradle).  All balls bounce off the play area's walls, either straight back when hitting head on, or reflected when hitting at 45 degrees.  Note that a move that doesn't hit any balls is illegal.<br/><br/>Includes solitaire problems where the object is to find the least number of moves required.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The zombie apocalypse happened and the zombies won. Now what? There aren't any more people to eat and the rotting eternity is down-right boring. So, the zombies came up with the idea (if that's even possible) that foot-races would be neat. They certainly can be exciting &ndash; especially when pieces of the contestants fall off along the way!<br/><br/>Zombie Shamble is a fast-paced card game where players take on the roles of zombies trying to do their best to get across the finish line. It's not all that far away, but remember that you're an animated rotting corpse and all kind of craziness can happen in just a few steps.<br/><br/>First to 25 steps wins. Deal out 6 cards each, then draw a card, play a card. The cards are Steps (move towards finish line), Calamities (eg a leg falls off; fixed by Duct Tape card), Fortune (usually cancels a Calamity), a Trump card (eg Steely Eyed, so cannot be distracted). Oh, and that's exactly 25 steps, not more. Else the Zombie Judges won't be happy. But might be hungry.<br/><br/>",

The planning is done simultaneously with a time limit. Players can choose between different actions such as gathering information about the museum or Fluffy's whereabouts, moving to another room of the museum, or searching for the hidden objects or keys. Most actions can be chosen multiple times, also by the same player, but  the overall number of actions is limited depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>In the action resolution phase players then take the planned actions. The App controls all steps and announces whose turn it is and what to do.<br/><br/>But beware not to be too loud - sometimes someone awakes and they have to run using keys they found.<br/><br/>They all win if they manage to fulfill their tasks before the time is up.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sulkydrom is Trap racing round a circuit, basically modern 'chariot' racing, popular in continental Europe and the southern US, but unseen in Britain. The eight horses are named from Atletico to Happy Days and you play either Horse or Position cards to allow each to move, with the leading horse going first. The cards show the lengths they may move from 0 to 4 including half lengths, e.g. 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 etc. Shifting lanes costs 1 length, but the Sulky only moves forward a half length. As with many such games, the inside lane has fewer spaces on the bend than the outside lanes. But if you are blocked in and cannot move, you miss your go completely. Taking the inside line therefore is quicker, but makes it easier for others to block you. Each player also has a Joker and Gallop card to help themselves and hinder others once in the game. The races are meant to be quick and the designer encourages betting on them, but doesn't give a method. A solid, colorful production with a jigsaw board, the game comes packaged in a large wooden box with sliding card lid.<br/><br/>",

(Instead of moving two pieces, a player may move one of his two queens a distance equal to the sum of the dice.) A player may capture an opponent's piece which is not in a &quot;home space&quot; or in a &quot;safe space&quot;, by landing on it, which earns a point.<br/><br/>The goal is to occupy the opponent's home spaces. Each such occupied space gives a player one point. Occupying all three yields an additional two-point bonus and ends the round.

        "description": "From the Playing Guide: &quot;The goal is to reverse the Communist monopoly &amp; transfer properties to private ownership. Play of game continues until the Old Commie Bank goes broke &amp; all properties have been transferred to Private Ownership. The richest capitalist wins the game&quot;.<br/><br/>Similar to monopoly, players roll dice to move an auctioneer token (airplane) to a property. The player who is the auctioneer rotates counterclockwise each turn. Depending on the property, it is either taken outright by the auctioneer, sold to the highest bidder in a free auction, or sold to the bidder whose bid is closest to a hidden die roll. Landing on an owned property requires paying the owner a fee based on a die roll. Multiple properties of a given color multiply the fee. The player to the right of the auctioneer is the KGB (red car) and attempts to get to the property that the auctioneer is at (using die roll) to steal any proceeds or fees.<br/><br/>Players can also obtain escape cards to foil the KGB, or black market cards that provide special benefits.<br/><br/>",

Vote cards are drawn until a player decides to stand, but beware drawing the &quot;Loser&quot; card that puts you out of the contest immediately.

Each player chooses a horse. There are 11 cards in the deck for each colour/horse: 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each player has 7 cards in his hand and each turn he draws a new card, places a card on the table (if possible) and finally discards a card.<br/><br/>Placing cards on the table is only possible with cards of the own color. The first player, who manages to lay down all 8 cards (from 1-8) in the correct order, wins the race.<br/><br/>",

That tile 'falls' down the column until it reaches the bottom or lands on another tile.<br/><br/>Look for words that can be formed that use the tile you just played. Words can read up, down, left. or right, but must be in a straight line. Score one point for every letter in each word you find; palindromes count twice. If your tile set has blank or 'wild' tiles, declare what letter the blank represents when you play it. That tile continues to represent that letter for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>When you feel that you've found all the words you can, draw a tile and end your turn.

Regardless of the number of players, one player (the best player) must be the &quot;Australian Master Player.&quot;<br/><br/>Your aim is to take over Australia by buying up its riches and portfolios such as Iron &amp; Steel, Major Banks and Government. Once you have accumulated enough wealth, you can pay the Grand Takeover Price to financially rule Australia.<br/><br/>The game comes with toy money in various million and billion dollar denominations. There are Stake counters (small shares) for each nation, and Supergrabs (giant shares). The board is mounted and represents the various portfolios you are trying to take over.Movement is controlled through the roll of 2 dice.

They become players 'North' and 'South'. All other players act individually to try and stop them.<br/><br/>A convoy is a running sequence of 4 'Merchantmen' cards and the 'Home' card. The merchantmen are numbered from 1-6 so there are 3 ways of making a convoy. The convoy has to be in North's hands to score, so North and South work together to realign their cards. When they have a convoy North calls 'Convoy' and the round ends.<br/><br/>Any other player (not North) can halt a round by declaring their hand when they have collected certain configurations. Other cards<br/>include 'torpedoes', 'mines', 'cruisers', 'destroyers' and 'submarines'.<br/><br/>After adding up the points the winner is the first to 1000 points.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 4 playing pieces, 4 speed cards (numbered 3, 5, 6, and 8), and 3 chips.<br/><br/>The game is played over one round. It simulates a real bike race which includes effects like slipstreaming and blocking. Movement is handled with the 4 speed cards, where all 4 cards must be assigned to one of the 4 playing pieces. The speed can be increased by slipstreaming or by sacrificing chips. In the middle and end of the race, chips are won by the first three arrivals.

To set up the game, shuffle the ice cream order deck, then reveal four cards. Shuffle the ingredient deck, and deal each player five cards, which they place behind their screens. On a turn, a player can:<br/><br/><br/>    Draw one card from the ingredient deck.<br/>    Take one ice cream order and play ingredients on it.<br/>    Add one or more ingredient cards to an order already in front of you.<br/><br/><br/>When you play ingredients on an order, you must play exactly as many as are on the card and in the order listed, from top to bottom. When you play the final ingredient on an order, place that card aside as you'll score its point value at the end of the game. Banana split orders can't be built upon turn by turn, but must be claimed all in one go, either by playing all four ingredients at the same time or discarding one wild card ingredient. Special ingredient cards let you steal an ice cream order in progress or take an extra turn.<br/><br/>Once all the ice cream orders have been fulfilled, players tally their scores to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

All in one box!<br/><br/>In the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, the Harrow deck has long been a sacred tool of Varisian fortunetellers. In skilled hands, the Harrow deck can predict crop results, divine the gender of your unborn child, or give hints about your immediate future. In unskilled hands, the Harrow deck is a sacrilegious gambling game&mdash;a cutthroat diversion for ruffians in every port to lose their hard-earned fortunes.<br/><br/>Harrow will be featured throughout the second Pathfinder Adventure Path, Curse of the Crimson Throne. At least once in each installment, players may divine their futures with the Harrow deck, and Pathfinder #7 contains an in-depth article about the history of Harrow and its in-game use.<br/><br/>Harrow is also a standalone card game designed by Jason Bulmahn, Mike Selinker, and Teeuwynn Woodruff for use inside or outside the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting. Harrow is lavishly illustrated by Kyle Hunter, the artist behind Downer: Wandering Monster and Downer: Fool's Errand, the Paizo Comics compilations of Kyle's original Downer comics from Dungeon magazine.<br/><br/>This item also has an entry on RPGG: Harrow Deck<br/><br/>",

And he's about to launch a deadly attack on the real world. Only you can stop him!<br/><br/>You and your friends must transform into VR Troopers and enter the mysterious world of virtual reality - just like on the exciting TV show! Toss the battle dice top smash the sinister Skugs. Your powers increase as you defeat them. Then fight the fiendish robot mutant General Ivar! But watch out! He'll stop at nothing to destroy you!<br/><br/>Only the bravest VR Troupers can defeat Grimlord's evil army and win the game. Will it be you?&quot;<br/><br/>Unlike most other games, the three VR warriors in the game are shared by the players.  Each turn, the active player throws a die to decide which (red, yellow or green) trooper he controls this time, and then battle a Skug on their way to the penultimate battle, General Ivar.<br/><br/>Battles are done by tossing dice into a battle arena.  Someone plays the Skug and tosses one die, hoping for a hit (50% chance), and then the active player tosses a die to get a hit as well.  Play continues with 2 more dice on each side , one at a time. The dexterity comes in that you can try to hit your opponent's 'hit' die or your own 'miss' die to switch the result.  Ties go to the active player.<br/><br/>There is some skill in tossing the dice to change results, but because you cannot control which VR warrior you will assumer on your turn, the game comes down mainly to luck.  Winning battlers earns you a power chip (with a VR glasses wearing dog on it), which will allow you a reroll in the final battle (which is a toss of 4 dice at once, so dexterity plays no role here), while losing a battle loses you the same number of accumulated power chips.<br/><br/>There's no doubt this is a kid's game for fans of the TV show.  Still, the components are fairly nice and the battle arena mechanic is well done.<br/><br/>",

Two armies of Alexander the Great and Darius of Persia met. The Macedonial cavalry and phalanx crossed the river under Persian arrows and made the Persian king and all his army flee.<br/><br/>This game is for 2-6 players. The enemy armies led by the players meet near the bay of Issa, in the valley of the Pinar river. Battle characteristics of the armies are close to the reality.Tactic maneuvering are very important in the game. Under a skillful leader a smaller army can defeat numerous enemies. You can either recreate the historic battle or change the course of the fight. Anyway you should rely not only on the number of your army but also on your leadership and war skills.<br/><br/>Zvezda 8205<br/><br/>",

It was the Magic The Gathering of its day.<br/><br/>The game is played solitaire but can be played by any number &quot;For Progressive Parties&quot;, so says the publisher.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 5 x 5 grid. The dealer deals himself 25 playing cards, face-down. If it is being played by more than one, then everyone must have their own pack of cards but they do not deal themselves 25 cards from it. The dealer takes the first card from his stack and announces it to the other players. They then find the declared card in their deck. Now all players simultaneously add it to their own grid. Once one card has been played there are limitations on where the next card can go. The second card must be placed adjacent to the one card already in the grid, vertically, horizentally or diagonall. The third card must be so placed but this will have a little more choice because there is a block of two cards which you can adjoin. And so the game goes on until everyone has a block of 5 x 5 cards, 25 in total.<br/><br/>The scoring is now counted. Remember, everyone had the same cards, but it is very unlikely that more than one player will have the same grid. The object is to score points by building up Poker hands, 10 in total, 5 across and 5 down.<br/>The scores are;<br/>One Pair 1 point<br/>Two Pairs 3 pts.<br/>Flush 5 pts.<br/>Three of a king 6 pts.<br/>Full Hand 10 pts (Nowadays we would call this a Full House)<br/>Straight 12 pts.<br/>Four of a Kind 16 pts.<br/>Straight Flush 30 pts.<br/><br/>",

Players keep this card until their turn to be the starting player. <br/>     Each player simultaneously places one Gift Card from their hand face-down in the center of the table as in the standard game. The starting player (the player who will select the first gift of this party) places his or her Mystery Box card face up on top of their own Gift Card. This gift is now the &quot;Mystery Box&quot; gift for this round. <br/>     The game continues as normal with the exception that when a player selects the Mystery Box gift they do not &ldquo;open&rdquo; it by turning it over. The gift may be selected and stolen like any other gift without being revealed. <br/>     When the round is over and each player has a gift, the player with the Mystery Box gift may now look at the Gift Card without revealing it to the other players. The player, the only one who knows the color and number of that card, tucks it face-down under his or her Gift List Card. The Mystery Box card used this round may now be discarded. <br/>     The next round resumes with the new starting player using his or her Mystery Box card. <br/><br/><br/>Rules Updates (12/09/2011)<br/><br/>When played as written in the current rules, the Mystery Boxes usually didn't hold very good presents. Therefore, the designer (Brian Kelley) suggests that you follow the current rules, except for these changes:<br/><br/><br/>     Before looking at their cards players randomly select one of the cards dealt to them to be their Mystery Box gift, keeping it face down.<br/>     Players place their Mystery Box card on top of this selected card without looking at it.<br/>     The Mystery Boxes are then kept close to each player until it is their turn to select a gift first, and then they are the ones who bring the Mystery Box to the &quot;party.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

The color tells from which category the question comes.<br/><br/>If the player on turn can answer the question, he gets another turn and, if he does not has it already, the corresponding colored pie piece which he puts in his playing piece. If he answers wrong, it's the next player's turn.<br/><br/>The first player to collect all colors wins the game.<br/><br/>The set is fully compatible with every other Trivial Pursuit game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Schoolmaster Kees is still an intern, and he doesn't yet know what a schoolmaster is supposed to do. Luckily, he has a class full of experts! In his class, everything is a little bit different: a dictation becomes telling jokes, geography becomes portraying countries, and during biology, the children watch Spiderman or Kung Fu Panda. He tries very hard, especially when the head of the school comes around to check if everything goes well.<br/><br/>In this game, the players score points by playing several mini-games. When it is a players turn, he rolls two dice and moves his pawn around the school. If he enters a classroom, a mini-game is started:<br/><br/>    Language class: The players have to come up with a word that matches a certain description (such as 'a country starting with the letter A'). The description is given by an assignment card combined with a spinner. The first player to shout a matching word wins the mini-game.<br/>    Math class: The player picks one opponent. He takes a regular die and a special die (which only rolls sixes). His opponents get two regular dice. Both players start rolling their dice. The first player to roll 7 wins the mini-game.<br/>    Geography class: The player is assigned a country that he has to depict. The other players have to guess the country. If someone guess correctly, both the guesser and the player score points, otherwise only the player scores.<br/>    Gym class: Each player receives a number of cards with the values 1 to 5. Then, the first player has to play one or two cards with the value '1' (facedown), the second player has to play one or two games with the value '2', etc. After the '5' has been played, the game continues again with the '1'. The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>You are allowed to play non-matching cards, but other players may accuse you of bluffing. If you are accused and were bluffing, the accuser wins the game. If you are accused and were not bluffing, you win the game.<br/><br/>    Schoolyard (playing hide-and-seek): The player picks an opponent. Both players receive a set of schoolyard cards. Each card has an picture of a schoolyard scene. Then, a random item is determined. The first player to find that item in the pictures wins the mini-game.<br/><br/><br/>The game is over when each mini-game has been played four times. Now, the scores for each player are added up. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

If both players played a card, each player performs a &quot;judgement&quot; by rolling a die (or using an app or Morpher toy) to determine what power level their card fights at. The higher Power value wins. The loser is dealt damage equal to the winning card's damage value.<br/>5. If the winner's card's rock/paper/scissors icon defeats the opponent's, the winner deals damage twice.<br/>6. Damage is represented by moving cards from the draw deck into the discard pile.<br/>7.

A Fistful of Cards or BANG! High Noon.<br/><br/>Thus, after the first round, the Sheriff flips over an O.K. Corral event card that stipulates a gameplay change for the round. At the beginning of the next round (the Sheriff's next turn), they flip over an O.K. Corral card that replaces the old one. The old gameplay condition is removed and the new one is in place. For those of you who liked A Fistful of Cards and High Noon, this expansion might work just right for you. For players not a fan of these, there is a gameplay variation that removes the randomness of these event cards (having them flipped out in order at the beginning of the game).<br/><br/>",

Collect the most and best characters (properties), and earn the most fuel (money) to win.<br/><br/>The board is 7 x 7, with 4 characters (properties) per side, two per color, plus the standard Go, Free Parking, Go to Jail and Jail corners, and finally 2 &quot;Race Challenges&quot; and 2 &quot;Prize Fund&quot; locations (where the railroads would be, but correspond to the Community Chest or Chance cards in the original game). Race Challenges will often have you contribute money to the Prize Fund, which then goes to the next person who lands on those locations.<br/><br/>When the game begins, each location has a corresponding card placed on it. As each player lands on those locations and &quot;buys&quot; them, they take the card and mark the location on the board with one of their 10 hangars (houses/hotels, sort of, but that simply mark ownership of locations on the board). Then like in classic Monopoly, other players must pay the fuel cost for that location if they land there.<br/><br/>Variants on the basic game allow for monopoly pricing, scoring per the fuel cost on each card (property) instead of simply 1 point per card, and card (property) swaps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Enigma is a micro board game for two, which is played on a small battle map and uses playing cards to code and decode messages. Each player, using his own deck of playing cards, will code a single word using one of two ciphers available to them. Once both players have coded a message they will then exchange the cards and start to decode their opponent&rsquo;s password. The first to crack the code will have several strategical maneuvers available at his disposal while the person who fails to crack the code will be given only one move. The key objective is to control as much of your enemy&rsquo;s territory as possible before the game ends after ten rounds of code cracking.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Place the map between you and your opponent. In addition to the map, each player has a card shield to place upright in front of them. This not only keeps your code making secret but also is used to show the two ciphers available for coding. To begin, each player should have 5 pennies placed on opposite sides of the map (on the edge closest to you). At this point, you should be ready to start creating codes.<br/><br/>Play<br/>Each turn begins with both players creating a code using one of two ciphers available. The secret code must be at least three letters long and not have the same letter repeating more than twice. Once both players have cards selected to spell out their coded word, exchange cards. At this point, the person who can correctly decode their opponent&rsquo;s message first will be awarded the next move on the map.The player who successfully decoded the message will have a list of maneuvers they can choose from while the other opponent (who failed) is only allowed one single move.<br/><br/>Game end<br/>The game ends when all ten rounds of code cracking have been completed and all final moves have been made. The game play length can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the amount of rounds to be played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fun and exciting drawing game for kids! It's a chicken will provide hours of hilarious fun for kids of all ages and also encourages them to interact and to use their imaginations. Can the other players guess what you are drawing? In this 'easy to play' game the sheets are pre-printed with circles to make starting the picture even easier! Each word card contains four options to draw, one with a picture to copy to help younger children play. The 'chicken' timer 'clucks' to let the drawer know they are running out of time and if the word is guessed within the time limit the timer announces the number of points won for both the drawer and the person who guessed correctly. The player with the most points when each player has draw 5 cards wins! This game provides a sheet of printed circle layouts, which can be photocopied to give you more sheets and a lot more hours of fun. This educational game will help children express themselves through a variety of different drawing skills and at the same time the electronic timer adds to the tension and the fun! Whatever age you are, this game is great fun for the whole family. This game is for 3 or more players and suitable for ages 5 years and up.<br/><br/>",

You take one dice and 8 counters.<br/><br/>All players roll in real time and when someone throws a 6 they win the pot.<br/><br/>As you roll the following numbers<br/><br/>1 - Add a counter to the pot<br/>2 - If someone spots you roll this, they can take a counter from you<br/>3 - no action<br/>4 - no action<br/>5 - Must stop rolling for 5 seconds<br/>6 - Win the pot<br/><br/>The second option is a two player game named Double Trouble with the objective of winning all counters.<br/><br/>You each take 10 counters and two dice.<br/><br/>You both ante one token the pot and make a single roll in turn<br/><br/>If you roll<br/><br/>A single 1 - place 1 token into the pot<br/>A double 1 - place 2 tokens into the pot<br/>Double 2,3,4,5 - You lose the round and the pot goes to the other player<br/>A single 6 - You win the pot<br/>A double 6 - You win the game automatically.<br/><br/>The third game is for 3-6 players named Last Man Standing, with the objective of not being the player to put the last token into the pot.<br/><br/>You start with an agreed number of counters each, three for a quick game or more for a longer game.<br/><br/>Each player in turn rolls 3 dice<br/><br/>1 - Put a counter into the pot<br/>2 - Give a counter to the person on the left<br/>3 - Give a counter to the person on the right<br/><br/>If you have no tokens you are not out as you may get some back.<br/><br/>When only 1 token not in the pot  the dice actions change<br/><br/>2 - move a counter left<br/>3 - move a counter right<br/>6 - place a counter in the pot and lose the game!<br/><br/>The fourth and last way to play is named The solo challenge and is for a single player.

The game box includes a light frame which the player constructs. This holds the player's phone, a clear plastic screen and a small board onto which players' cards are placed.<br/><br/>Before playing, the player must download the free app onto their phone, and then set it so the screen does not go to sleep while playing.<br/><br/>The cards show different parts of the dark forest, and the players try to make their way home without being caught by a ghost. A player takes turns to place a card from their hand onto the board, so the image faces the phone. Each card includes a QR code, which the phone's camera reads. Then a ghost might be projected by the phone screen and appears hovering in the forest.<br/><br/>In fact, the image is on the clear plastic screen in front of the forest card, an illusion similar to the theatrical trick Pepper's Ghost.<br/><br/>If the player sees a ghost, they must take all the cards that have been placed in the stand. If there is no ghost, they leave their card on the stand. In ths way, cards build up for the player who gets caught.<br/><br/>Some cards have extra effects which cause the app to increase the odds of a ghost appearing. Or a player can swap their cards with another player and so on.<br/><br/>The game was produced in 2015 and sold out its initial print run. The app was made for iPhones 5 and 6, and later for Android. After 2016, there appears to be a break in development. Although published in Japanese, gameplay is language free and English rules are online.<br/><br/>",

Those pesky cards force you to discard your whole hand to the discard pile. Boosters, on the other hand, make for a great surprise to your opponent. Play them at the beginning of your turn to throw off your opponents and get an advantage over the gameplay.<br/><br/>The design of the cards is slick, with hand-drawn icons on each card.

Your objective: Survive until dawn.<br/>Drop Bears is a cooperative game where the Campers have to carefully choose actions every turn to stay alive, while the whole Australian Bush is on a hunt for them. The group can choose of several different options such as:<br/>Explore and Run, allowing the Campers to place new map tiles and attempt to keep the lurking hunger beasts at arm's length (at bay, a distance).<br/>Definitely they will need to Rest and Heal, which will give them a chance to patch up and recoup their most essential resources.<br/>Finally Search and Endeavour will hopefully lead them to find much needed survival resources.<br/>All these are tools to ensure as many campers as possible survive until dawn. While doing so, the game drops the hideous creatures right on them, attacking and terrorising the Campers in every turn.<br/><br/>Even the very landscape and environment will batter the poor Campers &ndash; They can become severely wounded; this will surely hamper their chance for survival. <br/>Each time a camper is eaten, that player will select another camper from those available, but every death brings the Drop Bears closer to victory, so don't let your humans die in vain.

But, amongst the deck of cards you have snag cards, global cards and special power cards, all valued in cost and carbon that could speed or slow your path to victory. Balancing the need to generate income with reducing carbon, you can follow numerous paths to victory, but collaboration is key.<br/><br/>You'll need to bring together governments, industries, and the public. It&rsquo;s a conversation making game, where you will have to discuss tactics with your teammates.<br/><br/>You win by getting the carbon level to 0 before you reach &rsquo;Time&rsquo;s Up&rsquo; and run out of time. And if you can't bring carbon levels to zero before it's too late, everybody loses. The stakes couldn't be higher.<br/><br/>The game can also be played competitively by each player taking a mayor to race down the carbon tracker, or solo by taking two draw decks to play from.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

All players can play their Drawer Cards, adding a twist to the outcome. Will you help yourself or hinder your opponents? The choice is yours!<br/>Once Finished, Reveal the Dice and Calculate Stretch Value: The moment of truth has arrived. Lift the box and reveal the dice result. Add the result to your Stretch Value, taking into account any modifiers caused by the Drawer Cards in play. Will your stretching skills measure up to the challenge?<br/>Sit Success: If your dice result is equal to or higher than the Dickficulty, rejoice! Your Sit is successful, and greatness awaits. Gain 1 Stretch Value, score a point, and bask in the glory of sitting on that victorious dick!<br/>Sit Failure: If the total result is lower than the Dickficulty, your Sit is deemed unsuccessful. Lose 1 Stretch Value, as your stretching skills take a temporary setback. The Dick remains, ready to taunt the next player who dares to sit upon it.

Two teams of gods struggle for the dominance of the Olympus - its current occupiers, lead by Zeus, against the Chthonians, entities of the Underworld lead by Hades.<br/><br/>Both players choose a team of 9 out of 12 units. As in Stratego, their pieces identities are hidden from the opponent before they enter combat. Besides their pieces, each side has two important assets, Honor and Energy, which are crucial in their mobility and combat power.<br/><br/>Both sides have different victory conditions: the Chthonians win by moving one of their leaders (Hades or his wife Persephone) into the Olympus top, while the Olympians must simply avoid the Chothonian success by eliminating their leadership from the game.

Your opponent says &quot;Brian&quot; and flips the &quot;B&quot; down. Teams or players race back and forth in 10 second increments as they eliminate the available Letters until someone can't answer.

One player (the sorcerer player) hides the wand in his realm and defends it with a group of evil sorcerers who can summon the aid of demons, orcs, and ghouls. The other player (the wizard player) invades with a force of good wizards, barbarians, dwarves, and elves, seeking to locate the wand and escape with it.<br/><br/>Before the play of the game begins, both players secretly design their forces. The board portrays the valley of the evil sorcerers, and on it the sorcerer player places the counters representing haunts (temples, ruins, and crypts), secretly recording one of them as the haunt in which the wand is hidden. The counters representing the sorcerers and their minions are then placed on the board, and on the sorcerer player's first turn they can begin summoning other evil units. The wizard player brings in the wizard units and their allies through one or more hexes along the valley border, and the struggle begins.<br/><br/>Each side can attack with spells and by physical combat. The wizard player should usually try to strike quickly, before the sorcerer player can organize an effective resistance. Only the sorcerer player gets a steady stream of reinforcements, in the form of wandering-orc counters, but the wizard player has the advantage of special attacking bonuses. To win, the wizard player must locate the wand and remove it from the sorcerers' valley through an entry/exit hex.<br/><br/>",

The stack of 40 cards are loaded into the card dealer, which is placed in the center of the playing area (it is powered by 2 &quot;C&quot; batteries). The cards have different point values, some are negative. After the cards are loaded, the dealer is turned on and it starts spinning in a circle. Cards are shot out of the side if the dealer at random times. Each player is trying to get the cards by shlepping them with the suction cup at the end of their swatter. Any card that sticks to your paddle, you collect (even the negatives!). After the last card is swatted, the dealer is turned off and players add up their positive cards and subtract any negative cards. The highest point total is the winner.<br/> It is a quick game to play and children do seem to love to swat at cards!<br/><br/>",

Set up involves multi-directional double-sided 'maze cards' on which the mouse moves on and responds to during the game. The cards are arranged at random in a square and each game will have a differing arrangement which can also change during play. On a player's turn, the mouse is placed on the starting 'maze card', cheese is placed somewhere in the maze, an 'action card' is drawn and responded to - which involves movement of either the mouse or the maze cards - and if desired, a second action card is drawn and responded to. <br/>Just as in the original mouse trap, players must move the mouse to collect an amount of cheese and upon being 'trapped' all cheese acquired in that turn is lost.<br/><br/>",

In this game, you will take the role of a trader captain in a vast and dangerous galaxy. There are pirates, aliens, and enemies lurking behind every asteroid, waiting to strike when you least expect it. Meanwhile, there are vast riches to acquire, intriguing missions to run, and new technologies to discover.<br/><br/>This game intricately weaves adventure, trade, political conflict, military tactics, and strategy together to give you the best of Ambrosia's classic computer game and DG Associates Card Gaming Systems. There is almost nothing you can do in the computer game that is not represented in this card game, and yet, it is still simple enough for an 8 year old player to understand. Escape Velocity: Nova has fast action, political intrigue, immense variety of options, and an intense struggle for survival.<br/><br/>Components include a 20&quot; x 20&quot; board, 124 cards, 5 colored pawns and 16 hostility markers in the Boxed set. 40 different 15-card expansions are available to add to your experience. There are 600 total cards available to acquire, but the set is non-collectible, in that the expansion packs actually tell you what is in them on the back. You can browse the contents of each expansion pack online as well, if you prefer to make online purchases.<br/><br/>This game is no longer available for sale from the publisher's website but may still be available at many game stores around the US.<br/><br/>",

The three white knights try to force their way through the hall to reach the treasure.<br/><br/>Game contents: Playing board, 6 red knights, 3 white knights, 1 dice.<br/><br/>In play the knights are moved by the dice throw. They can only move orthogonally, must move the full number of spaces shown by the dice roll, and may not reverse direction.  White moves one knight on his turn, red moves two (both the full distance given by the dice roll). If a knight is moved adjacent to an enemy knight he attacks him. Combat is resolved using the dice, with white knights adding two to their dice roll. If two white knights reach the treasure then white wins.<br/><br/>",

Players take turn rolling the dice, allowing them to place/move their warriors onto the board.  Certain rolls provide special powers, but most involving adding warriors to one of the three regions.  After each turn, the player drops a CHI token into a column, where it randomly falls into one of the three regions.  When a player reaches 4 warriors in one region, they take all CHI from that region and remove all their warriors.  Other players who were present keep any warriors they had there.  When all 25 CHI tokens have been collected, the player with the most CHI tokens wins.<br/><br/>Dropping tokens into the tower at first appears random.  However, with some practice, it is possible to partially control which region will get the dropped CHI.<br/><br/>Like other LEGO games, the rulebook includes several variants and encourages players to develop their own rules.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/>A tribal conflict game to collect precious CHI.<br/>Plan where to send your warriors to capture the most CHI.<br/>Will the next CHI fall in the territory you control?<br/><br/>1 buildable LEGO Dice<br/>12 LEGO microfigures<br/>198 LEGO pieces<br/>Rule booklet<br/>Building instructions<br/><br/>Set # 50006<br/>Item # 6024935<br/><br/>",

This is the first game of its kind dedicated solely to food trivia. The game features 1,800 questions in the categories of Beverages, Geography and Culture, Ingredients, Recipes, Food People and Food Arts &amp; Science. Game play is not confined to a game board, players gather their game pieces and get comfortable wherever they want to play! Teams of chefs are challenged by opposing teams of guests with trivia questions all about food. Players start with full plates and the winners are the first ones to Clean his Plate.<br/><br/>1. The starting chefs roll a 6-colored die.<br/>2. The next team in line (the guests), draw a card and ask the question matching the color that the chefs have rolled on the die. The timekeeper starts the sand timer once the question has been read and understood.<br/>3. If the chefs answer the question correctly, and before the timer runs out, then the chefs remove the matching color food chip from their &quot;plate&quot;. That &quot;food&quot; (chip) is now considered &quot;eaten&quot; and the chefs roll again. &quot;Eaten&quot; chips should be returned to the game box or set-aside. Used cards are returned to the card boxes. Chefs must continue to answer questions matching the color they roll, even if they have already &quot;eaten&quot; the chip for that color category.<br/>4. If the chefs give a wrong answer, then their turn is over, and play progresses in a clockwise direction to the next chefs in line.<br/>5. The first chefs to &quot;Clean Your Plate by &quot;eating&quot; all of their chips are the winners of DINNERTIME!<br/><br/>Over 40 recipes and party ideas are included so that the game can be played with edible game pieces in the game options; Play With Your Food, Potlucky, The Diet Plate Special and The Blue Plate Special.<br/><br/>There are also variant rules (including &quot;Seconds Dice&quot;, which let you challenge other players), and suggestions for using real food instead of tokens (including recipes).<br/><br/>",

But will you have the ingredients needed to make a salsa bowl that suits a customer's order...<br/><br/>In Red Hot Silly Peppers, players have a hand of four pepper and fruit cards from a deck of 64. The pepper cards have varying degrees of heat depending on which pepper they feature (+5 to +30), while the fruit cards reduce the heat in a salsa (-5 to -20). Your goal is to create a &quot;salsa bowl&quot; by playing two or more cards from your hand that collectively match the &quot;heat&quot; of the current order, plus or minus five degrees. The target is determined with a spinner marked in increments from 10 to 100.<br/><br/>On a turn, you draw a card, then either use a special action card, discard a card, or try to make salsa by playing cards from your hand. When you make salsa, other players can trump your salsa by playing a &quot;salsa bowl&quot; with the correct value and at least one card more than you played. Whoever plays the best (i.e. largest) salsa claims all the cards played.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, players have one more chance to make salsa, then the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Each Monument is designed on the board and is attached to 3 different step. So, if your pawn manages to step on all of them, then you can collect that Monumnet Card. Again, if you think is easy, you are wrong. Your rivals will make everything to stop you.<br/><br/>In the second Zone all the players follow a faster course trying to collect more Monuments. But here is the key. Among all of them there are some that have higher value and these Monuments will give you the victory!  During your speed trip, you will find many blocks since there are cards which send your pawn either back at the beginning of the Zone or at the end. You don't want that because when the race overs, you will have the less Monuments.<br/><br/>In the last Zone things get nasty. There only few important cards, that if you manage to collect them, then you secure your victory. At the end of that Zone, all of you count the points that your Monument Cards provide to you and add them together. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

Life writes the craziest stories, but what can we believe and what is just a pack of lies?<br/><br/>One player (the News Anchor for that round) reads a News Card to the other players.  Each News Card contains the first part of a news story and 4 possible conclusions to the story.  One conclusion is correct and the true (Real News) answer, but the others are made-up (Fake News) falsehoods.  The News Anchor reads the Real News answer and picks one Fake News answer to read.  The other players then vote on which they believe to be the Real News.  Each player who votes for the Real News answer receives 1 point.  A different player takes on the role of the News Anchor each round.  The game ends after each player has had two turns as the News Anchor and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Chemical elements can be combined to form compounds that can be used in the game.<br/><br/>Homepage:  <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.elementeo.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.elementeo.com</a><br/><br/>Description from the Maker:<br/><br/>In the Elementeo Chemistry Card Game (v1), elements have their own personalities -- Oxygen becomes Oxygen Life-Giver, Sodium becomes Sodium Dragon, and Iodine becomes Iodine Mermaid. Players can create compounds and play with element in the game. Elementeo includes five different levels (element, reaction, compound, alchemy, and fusion) and has elements, compounds, and alchemy cards (which include black holes and nuclear fusion).  The goal of the game is to capture your opponent's electrons and reduce them to 0.<br/><br/>What People Have Said About The Elementeo Chemistry Card Game (v1):<br/><br/>&quot;This young inventor has stumbled upon something that will stimulate minds and make people more interested in science&rdquo; - Dr. Tom Lane, Past President, American Chemical Society.<br/><br/>&quot;Elementeo teaches kids to see elements and compounds not as boring things to be memorized but as interesting personalities and powerful agents at work in the world. Which is of course exactly how real chemists and scientists see them. If they come away from the game remembering a fun fact about an element, or understanding the basic notions of bonding and charge, they will have a powerful head start in understanding chemistry&quot; - Theodore Gray, co-founder of Wolfram Research (makers of Mathematica) and Popular Science columnist.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Elementeo builds on games like Magic: The Gathering and Pok&eacute;mon by appealing to kids with its fun factor, but also focusing on the education side. The world should take notice.&rdquo; - Peter Adkison, CEO of Hidden City Games, and former CEO of Wizards of the Coast (the makers of Magic: The Gathering and distributors of Pok&eacute;mon).<br/><br/>Update: The first version of Elementeo (v1) has sold out, the next version (v2) is expected to hit amazon.com in the beginning of summer 2012. Alchemist Empire, Inc also released an Elementeo App on the Apple App Store for students to explore the elements and create their own Elementeo elements.<br/><br/>",

Six Gun Showdown comes with six characters with their own unique dice and set of 15 cards. Players can play single 1-on-1 duel, or for more than 2 players it is suited to knockout tournament play or a series of duels in a round robin format.<br/><br/>In a duel, players choose six cards from their deck (15 at the start of the game) and lay them face down in front of themselves.<br/>Players then enter the staredown where they take alternate turns to choose then turn over a face down card, revealing either a Modifier card or a Draw card. The reveal of a Draw card indicates the player is entering the shooting phase by drawing their gun to shoot at their opponent, and can then prevent their opponent revealing their next card by touching one of their opponents cards before their opponent chooses their next card (which ought to be a Draw card if they want to shoot too!).<br/>The shooting phase is affected by whether one or both players get to resolve their shots (determined by reactions speeds to touching cards after  a Draw card is revealed). If both players managed to reveal a Draw card, they compare speed values(total from Draw and Modifier cards), with highest value shooting first. Players hit their opponent with a shot by rolling their dice and adding this to their accuracy value (total from Draw and Modifier cards), requiring a total of 6 and higher or &quot;hit&quot; symbol. <br/>Then, at the end of each round, players discard the cards they revealed in the round and can choose their next six cards from any of their remaining cards.<br/><br/>Players score 1 point for hitting their opponent, with a bonus 1 point if they revealed their Draw card second. Play lasts for 3 rounds (4 only to resolve any ties after 3) and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You want to plant in your garden seeds of various crops, then sit on the terrace and sip tea, waiting for the watered and fertilized earth to give birth to mountains of beets and carrots, cabbages and strawberries, cucumbers and turnips, tomatoes and zucchini. But alas, you have too many urgent things to do in the city and cultivating a garden is both time-consuming and physically hard, so all of your dreams remain mere dreams...<br/><br/>Kitchen Garden lets you fulfill these dreams of gardening without getting soil under your fingernails. Each player receives a task card at the start of the game that depicts four garden beds and the specific number of four types of plants that the owner of the task card must plant. What's more, the task card indicates whether a garden bed must include two or three cards. Each player starts with a hand of four cards &ndash; with the deck containing plant cards of four types (with 1-3 plants per card) and the action cards Weed, Worker and sluggard &ndash; and one of each special card: Bazaar, Crow and Holiday. Six cards start face up in the market.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can first discard a Worker card or special card (or both) to gain additional actions during the next phase; he can also play Sluggard on an opponent to make him lose his turn. Next, the player takes one action (and possibly up to three): draw a card, plant a card, swap a card in the market, or play or remove a Weed. He can also play special cards to refresh the market, force everyone to discard and draw, or draw from the discard pile; once all players have played the same special card, each player has access to that card once again. At the end of a turn, the player must discard to four cards.<br/><br/>Whoever first completes the four garden beds on his task card with the proper number of cards showing the proper number of plants wins!<br/><br/>",

Knot tying is a great skill to master at any age, and with the Knot So Fast Game from ThinkFun, younger players will also be improving their spatial reasoning and manual dexterity! Kids can practice their knots solo or play with 2 or more players, with the Knot So Fast Game!<br/><br/>This is a game about knots. Each player has a piece of rope. Each round, a knot is shown, and each player has to make that knot. When the first player finishes his knot, he announces this, and the other players receive 30 seconds to finish theirs. Then, the finished knots score points.<br/><br/>The first player to reach eight points wins the game. (Or, in the team game, the first team to achieve a sufficiently large lead wins.)<br/><br/>",

The spinners determine the goals scored. Managers also draw home and away cards before the match which may help or hinder. The home manager collects gate proceeds, and also rent from the visiting team if they build a stand (which is controlled by the cards).<br/><br/>The leaping player in the white shirt of Leeds United is Billy Bremner (9 December 1942 &ndash; 7 December 1997).<br/><br/>",

There are 5 suits (Bombs, Daggers, Hearts, Jesters, and Moneybags) with 14 cards in each suit. The number of suits used in the game is the same as the number of players (e.g.: only 3 suits are used in a 3-player game)<br/><br/>",

To get the fish, though, you need to first test your luck with the dice...<br/><br/>Each turn, the active player rolls three blue dice and two red dice. After the first roll, she can roll each die individually at most one more time. After doing this, she can either fish or poach depending on what she's rolled. If she has at least one hook, one worm and a wave, she can fish by rolling the white die &mdash; and she rolls it a number of times equal to the product of the hooks and waves that she has. The white die features 1-2 fish, a boot (which nets you nothing for that roll), and the sweet ZZZZZZs of someone who fell asleep; catch the Zs and your fishing time ends immediately. If you use one of your two espresso tokens prior to rolling, however, Zs become boots and you can keep rolling.<br/><br/>When you roll a full house or four- or five-of-a-kind, you can steal 1-3 fish from other players. With a special full house, you can reclaim an espresso chip or move one fish from the lake or another player's pile.<br/><br/>Once the lake is empty, whoever has the most fish wins. In a tie, the tied player holding the yellow fish wins &mdash; but if neither of them has the yellow fish, then they're out of the game and the player with the nextmost fish wins!<br/><br/>",

Whoever has the most cards at the end wins.<br/><br/>",

The cards provide and prevent opportunities to do this, or even cause nits to produce new lice.<br/><br/>Rid your kid's head of lice, and you win!<br/><br/>",

Players decide in advance how many rounds (turns around the board) they wish to play.<br/><br/>Players win money by playing different games of chance which are decided by the spaces on the board.  Players roll the dice on their turn, move, then decide if they want to play the game on the space where they landed.  There are eleven different games of chance.  Some are played against The house (the board), and some are played against other players.<br/><br/>Playing a game always costs money to play.  There is a flat fee to play the game, and some of the games allow you to bet more money to increase the payout.<br/><br/>The Games:<br/><br/>1)  Best of Five - Roll five dice to get two, three, four, five of a kind, a full house or a run.  You may roll five dice up to three times<br/><br/>2)  Bonus 21 - Played with another player.  Roll one die up to five times to get as close to 21 as you can without going over. Whoever comes closest wins all the money bet.<br/><br/>3)  Double Trouble - bet that you will or won't roll doubles with two dice.<br/><br/>4)  Pair-a-dice Derby - You may buy or win horses which you can race against other players.  There is a horse track in the center of the board.<br/><br/>5)  Three + Three - Try to rolls two threes with two dice in as few rolls as possible.<br/><br/>6)  Diamond Jim - Try to beat the total of two 6 sided dice with one 8 sided die.<br/><br/>7)  Unlucky One - Keep rolling the die and earning the number you roll, unless you roll a one, in which case you lose everything.<br/><br/>8)  Lottery Dice - Everyone chooses a number, then a die is rolled.  Whoever guessed the number wins the lottery.<br/><br/>9)  Even Odds - Win double your bet if you correctly guess that two dice will be odd or even.<br/><br/>10) Challenge - Played against another player.  Whoever rolls highest wins the bet.<br/><br/>11) Impossible 36 - Try to roll 36 by rolling two dice three times.  Huge payout if you succeed.<br/><br/>There is an open house space that lets you play the game of your choice.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last player completes the last circuit of the board.<br/><br/>",

There are two things in the world that matter to every eyeball: one is boxing; the other is making hotdogs. In the arena, all eyes are equal, hazel, green, brown, or even black and blue. But by either punching the lights out of the rest or building the perfect hotdog, only one eye can take home the prize.<br/><br/>Eyeball Boxing pits players in the ring as a group of scrappy, eyeball characters. Fists fly in a toe-to-toe punch-out brawl. But eyeball boxing has never been more dangerous; with illegal moves like hot sauce in the eye and stinging insect swarms, there is no telling who will be the last eye standing.<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/><br/>Players go into the ring as 4-armed eyeball boxers pitted against each other in an eye-for-an-eye grudge match. There are 2 ways to win; either be the last eyeball standing or the first to steal enough ingredients from under opponents' eyelids to make 3 hotdogs.<br/><br/>How to play - The Short Explanation<br/><br/>Players select from 5 different sets of eyeball character cards. Character eyeball cards are placed in front of players. These cards are used to determine eyeball damage.<br/><br/>Deal 7 cards to each player. Each turn consists of playing a card and drawing a card. Some cards may be played during other players turns.<br/><br/>Players can use legal moves, such as punch, block, and block and knock cards to damage opposing eyeballs.<br/><br/>Players may also use illegal moves such as Swarm, Eye-fry, Steal, and Nap-time cards on opponents. But by using illegal moves, players run the risk of being fouled by Referee Cards played by opponents.<br/><br/>Players win by either being the last eyeball standing or by building 3 complete hotdogs (a complete hotdog consists of 3 sets of Dawg, Bun, and Condiment cards). This is not a game of elimination, players continue to play even if both of their eyes are knocked out.<br/><br/>",

The first player to hit their paddle gets 2 points, the second player gets a point.  Anyone else gets a &quot;raspberry&quot;.<br/><br/>In round two, Maniac plays a series of random tones of varying speed and pitch.  The players nust count the tones.  When done, Maniac starts beeping... when the number of beeps equal the number of tones, players hit their paddles.  Again, if you get the correct number you gain 2 points, if you are one off you get a point, otherwise you get the &quot;raspberry&quot;.<br/><br/>Third round... Maniac displays beeps and lights in a seeming random patern, then displays three more patterns (one of which may or may not match the original).  If the original pattern is repeated... hit that paddle.  The 2 points, one point, zero points are awarded as before.<br/><br/>Last round.  Maniac plays a constant high pitched tone for a length of time.  When the tone stops, players must hold down their paddle for the same length of time... whoever is closest gets the 2 points... etc.<br/><br/>Each of the above rounds are repeated three times before moving on to the next.  If nobody has won the game, it repeats the rounds in order.<br/><br/>When one player has obtained 25 points he wins.<br/><br/>",

Players are responsible for upgrading their trains to be able to develop better abilities and make their travel easier and more profitable.

Therefore 80 big playing-cards with pictures of the artist are the main part of the components.<br/><br/>Publisher of the game is a company named Belser, but looking at the box it's quite obvious that this company seems to be just a branch of Kosmos (and the author Fritz Kruber is a Kosmos editor).<br/><br/>Players try to build exhibitions with the paintings of the master. All players work at the same exhibition by placing cards towards it following special rules. The exhibition is closed (and points are awarded) once a certain amount of pictures have been added - then a new exhibition starts until the deck runs out.<br/><br/>Game feels a bit like Rummy meets Scrabble (without words...) with a few twists.<br/><br/>",

Just turn over the cups to see if you can make a match of Spider-Man or his superhero pals!<br/><br/>A version of 'Memory' notably different in that it contains no cards and players are not matching 'identical' pieces; instead, players match the top half of a painted miniature to the bottom half, all hidden under plastic cups. The game comes with a fold-out showing what the complete miniatures look like (mostly unnecessary once you discover, for instance, that Spider-man has bulbous 'manly' feet, and Spider-girl has petite 'girly' feet).<br/><br/>The 'carrying case', when opened, serves as the game board, impressed with spaces to place the half-miniatures and cups.<br/><br/>The rules also list a 'more challenging game' variation: after a 'full' miniature is found it is still removed, but the now empty cups remain on the board to throw off players: this variation is dependent on the plastic cups and therefore unplayable with other Memory-type games that use only cards.<br/><br/>",

For this, they need to rotate the cards to change the paths.<br/><br/>The maze consists of 7x7 cards with routes (including a start card, two keys, and an exit). On his turn, a player first moves the (shared) player token along existing paths. Then he can rotate a path card; to do this, he must first take one of the task cards, and correctly solve the task on it. A task has also to be solved when reaching a set of keys, or the exit.<br/><br/>There are 5 different types of tasks; for example, finding a specific illustration in the maze, counting how often a symbol appears in a maze, or recognize the correct shadow image for an item. The back of the task card shows the correct solution.<br/><br/>The players win the game if they get out of the maze with at most two wrong tasks. Three wrong answers, and the game is lost.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rightgames LLC and Snowbird studio have released Eador: Masters of the Broken World board game based on &quot;Eador&quot; strategy computer games series. Action takes place in a fantasy world of Eador which is broken into pieces of a past holistic world, surfing across the Astral. Players take roles of the Masters, mighty demigods, trying to subordinate as many Eador shards as possible. They forward armies to conquer new territories, cast spells and perform powerful rituals.<br/><br/>The board game suits for 2-6 players but it&rsquo;s mostly comfortable to play for at least 4 players. All players get their Master cards at the game start &ndash; such cards exist not only for the atmosphere, they also help to settle some controversies. 12-18 shard cards (amount depends on the number of players) are mixed up to a separate pile and the game is over when this pile flows out. There are always two shard cards on the table, the one for the current round and another for the next &ndash; it helps players to plan their moves concentrating on the shards which are easier to get. Shard conquering is performed by playing action cards; there are more then 100 of them &ndash; armies, spells and rituals. At the game beginning everyone gets 7 action cards to the hand. Usually it&rsquo;s possible to add only one more card during the turn so using them should be careful. Rituals are the cards with especially strong features letting, for example, to take more action cards, take someone else&rsquo;s action or shard cards, to gain more winning points. Player can&rsquo;t fight for the chard during the turn if he performs a ritual but these cards give him further advantage.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the round each player decides if he will fight for the current shard or not. You need to play an army or a spell card to join a battle. The most important feature of the army is its power. Also there are the type of the army on the card (Light, Chaos or neutral), its class (warrior, monster, magician or undead) and nature of the ground (hills, swamps, plains, forests). Armies and some spells stay in the battle to the end of the round, some spells work only for the round they were played at. The result of the battle round is counted when all players interested in the shard have made their moves. The owner of the strongest army gets authority points counters according to his advantage above the second contender. Players can give up from the second turn and leave the battle. In this case they can&rsquo;t play armies or spells anymore for the current battle but still have a chance to win if nobody acquires more authority points. When all players pass the battle ends and the shard goes to the player who gained maximum authority points.<br/><br/>Each battle has some pieces of subtleties. Firstly, it&rsquo;s impossible to play Light and Chaos armies without a special card. Secondly, all the shards are different: some of them give advantages to defined type or class of armies or restrict using them, others allow to play two armies in a round. Thirdly, all armies fighting for the shard at the &ldquo;native&rdquo; land get extra strength. Attentive player will get a big profit considering all these features. When battle for the last shard is over players count their winning points on their conquered shards and performed rituals. That sum shows the winner.<br/><br/>The game for two or three players differs &ndash; they get 3 or 2 Master cards and make more actions during the round &ndash; to play a ritual and take part in the battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late 1950's this game was sold in ads in comic books.  You could order a copy for $1.25, complete with 2 boards, rules, and over 80 plastic pieces.<br/><br/>This game is very similar to Battleship, with a few additional rules.  Each player has a gameboard (printed on cardstock-paper), later boards from the late 70's were printed on plastic with no backing at all, with 3 islands on it.  Players place all of their units on their board (secretly; you can't see your opponent's board) at the beginning of the game.  Units consist of Head Quarters, Tanks, Pill Boxes, Battleships, Destroyers, Landing barges, Aircraft Carriers, and Planes.<br/><br/>The objective is to locate which island the enemy HQ is on (when you sink the enemy Battleship, they must tell you if their HQ is on the North or South half of the board), destroy all enemy installations in that island, and send a landing barge to occupy it.  You can also win the game by destroying both enemy barges (so they have no way to land on your HQ island anymore) or by destroying all enemy planes and ships (they can no longer attack).<br/><br/>Jean Shepherd (best known for the movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;) mentioned an ad for Task Force on his June 18, 1963 radio show. It's not clear if he is discussing game 2982, 13059 or another version of this game.<br/><br/>",

On the one side are the holy/heilige points, on the other side the horny/geilige pionts. The oldest player begins.  He takes a card and chooses one of the three hints from the card and reads it to his neighbour his leftside.  When the player guesses the object with this one hint he may move up to 4 places.  If a second hint is needed he moves up 3 places.  After a third hint he can move up 2 places.  But if passes after the 3 hint he has to move back 1 place.  When he guessed wrong he has to move back 2 spaces.

Will it be you?<br/><br/>Mega Monster City Smash is a remote controlled monster city smashing game. In phase one, players build their city buildings using strategy to pick their build sites. Then, in phase two, they send their giant monsters into the city and smash their opponent's buildings before their own buildings meet the same fate. Fight off the opposing monster and keep your buildings from being reduced to rubble to achieve victory!<br/><br/>",

It is similar in some ways to Settlers of Catan; here too cities sit at the vertices of hexes, which produce resources.  However, the cities move, and the resources aren't renewable.<br/><br/>Each player buys a single box containg his colour components; when multiple players meet, the use their combined components.  Most of the tiles make up Earth, but some may be used for the Moon and even Mars.  Cities begin at Tech Level 1, Stone Age; as you explore surrounding hexes to recover the resources, you'll eventually be able to advance in technology to Iron, Coal, Oil, Uranium and Deuterium.  Gold is money.  Advance enough in tech, and your cities can go into orbit and eventually reach the other planets.  Tech also gives you an advantage in city-to-city combat.<br/><br/>The game is very dynamic, since it is over by the time the last resources are harvested.<br/><br/>",

One of the greenhorns accompanying the current expedition?<br/><br/>To find out which of these greenhorns might be best for the job, McTrucker gives each of them a mission on the final day of the expedition &ndash; and to make sure he finds out how they fare against one another, the missions all bring them into competition with one another. Only the one who can enforce his will best over the others and best deal with unexpected situations will merit being appointed expedition leader.<br/><br/>To set up Westw&auml;rts, twenty wagon cards &ndash; along with settlers, gold mines and even a scout, barber, preacher, teacher, cook and gravedigger &ndash; are placed beside a munitions wagon. Five cards each are randomly distributed on four area cards (pastureland, desert, Indian country and mountain country). Thirty job cards can be completed, four of which are laid out face-up with a reward of 1-3 gold nuggets for each when completed.<br/><br/>The progress of the wagon train is controlled by cards, with each player holding three in hand. While game flow is simple, fulfilling demands is not always so. Each player places a movement card face down. The current player reveals his own and that of another. With these two cards, he then resolves the wagon train movements and tries to fulfill jobs. The game ends when a player has earned 15 nuggets or fewer than four incomplete jobs remain. Some jobs are simple with small payoffs while a more difficult one would require, for example, equipping one area with three settlers and two gold diggers or placing the preacher between a settler and a gold digger. In such cases, often the second card is of no help unless players make special arrangements with one another: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Special cards do things like eliminate or paralyze certain wagons due to fire or broken axles.<br/><br/>",

One stone will give you faith in hard times and can give you the ability to glimpse into the future, while another will give you true power should you listen to your intuition. Fate awaits your roll. After your character is divined, you must battle to either control or destroy the One Ring. Once found, you must take the One Ring to Mount Doom and fulfill your destiny.

Luck plays no part at all.  There  is no dice, there are no question cards and you never lose any of your pieces.  It is up to you, right to the very end.  An opponent may be just a couple of moves away from an apparent win, but you may still be able to turn the tables and COUNTERSTRIKE.<br/><br/>COUNTERSTRIKE is tremendously addictive.  No two games are alike and the more you play it the more you will discover how tactics can be all important.<br/><br/>Almost anyone can play from 8 upwards and will enjoy the challenge it presents.<br/><br/>COUNTERSTRIKE has a wide variety of game patterns which can be played, and learned in just a few minutes.  The rules are very simple.  Play it once and you will never need to look at the rules again.  That's a promise!&quot;<br/><br/>Each player has 24 pieces which are placed in one line of 4 and two lines of 10 on the 10x16 grid that forms the gameboard.  The center two spaces of the line of four are coloured and represent the player's defence area.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move your pieces so as to occupy your opponent's defence area.  The game is won by the first player to succeed in occupying and holding both the spaces of his opponent's defence position.<br/><br/>There are three types of move allowed:<br/>- A single piece can move one position in any direction (forwards, sideways, backwards or diagonally).<br/>- A straight line of pieces can be moved one space in any direction.<br/>- A piece may be moved from either end, or from anywhere within a line of pieces to the opposite end of the line.  If the position is occupied by an opponent's piece then that piece may be removed and placed at the opposite end of its line, provided that the player's line of pieces is greater in number than his opponent's.<br/><br/>",

The players draw 5 cards each from the stack of 56 cards. On these cards are pictures of other shapes, created by the 5 cubes. If the player on turn thinks, he can rebuild the existing shape into one shape of the cards on his hand by moving only a single cube, he plays a card and tries it without turning the board and in a single trial. If he is not able to rebuild the shape, he has to draw one more card from the stack.<br/><br/>The player who first gets rid of all his card, wins.<br/><br/>There are different rules in the box, so you can vary from lighter gaming to more heavier: Without building over the border of the board, with penalty cards for mirror-shapes etc.<br/><br/>Potzklotz is for children up from 7, but also for grown-ups. It is pretty difficult to think three-dimensional and turning the shapes in your imagination.

        "description": "&quot;Myth&quot; is an interactive video card game.  There are two levels at which the game may be played - for the Beginner level, players, via battles, must be the first to collect a set of 5 different warriors (Human, Elf, Goblin, Dwarf and Troll) of any number ('1', '2', or '3'), whilst in the Standard level players must battle to collect a set of 5 different warriors of the same number.<br/><br/>Battles are resolved by players simultaneously playing numbered Warrior and Weapon cards and consulting a battle grid (player with the top total score wins the battle).  Depending on the result, Warriors and/or Weapons are then exchanged between the players or the deck.<br/><br/>The main feature of the game is an accompanying video (played during the game) which features the &quot;Battlemaster&quot; who dictates changes to the gameplay which will 'make certain only the best warriors (players) will prevail'.  This includes penalizing the current leader (by removing a Warrior card from their hand), helping the current loser, swapping/taking cards from another players hand, and other such winner-influencing actions.<br/><br/>The game was produced in Western Australia by a now apparently defunct games publisher.<br/><br/>",

The game won a prize: the 'Medaille d'argent au concours Lepine Paris 1949'.<br/><br/>The game was an ever-present on the French market under the same name since then, undergoing several editional faceliftings design-wise. The 1949 edition contained 6 small cars in lead, each car for a player. The goal of the game is to take your car to a wedding, to pick up family members and get a present on the way to the wedding. But first U have to get your driving license. This is done by moving on the track on the board and learning/respecting the road code (speed limit, unique direction). Several things can happen on the board: an accident, blown tire,... There also is a garage, a gangster, a d&eacute;panneur (troubleshooter) and a gangster that can be met on the board. Vintage game for collectors.<br/><br/>",

In funny small dialog , which originate partially from the feather/spring from Bully Herbig, a search term is replaced in the text by the word &ldquo;Bully&rdquo;. While a player reads out the texts, the others must try to guess the term. This guessing takes place into four steps, trying to encircle the term a bit in each round. Amazing what (wrong) associations some first references may lead to.<br/>While this first part of the game is strictly played in sequence, as soon as someone says the correct answer the game changes into chaotic action.<br/>The so-called riddle master must try to catch with a cup the figures of the others, which stand in the center of the game board. They try to pull fast enough the cord and thus theirs figures of the board, otherwise point loss.<br/>This odd mixture of knowledge and dexterity, has even something from the parodic humor of the Bully films.<br/>Two long-proved mechanisms are connected here in new and unusual way to an entertaining game.<br/><br/>",

After all atoms are placed they form one large molecule, which may split into several smaller molecules during the game.<br/><br/>Each atom has a valence, which is the number of atoms (of either color) adjacent to it (include diagonal). Players must now move one of their atoms to any adjacent empty cell provided that its valence in the new position is exactly the same as its valence in the old position.<br/><br/>Any atom which is not adjacent to an enemy atom is unstable. Immediately after each move, the players remove all unstable atoms from the board. This also occurs after Black makes his last drop.<br/><br/>A player wins by stalemating his opponent, (leaving him with no legal moves). A player also wins by leaving an empty board (after the removal operation); in fact this is a special case of stalemate since his opponent would have no moves at all.<br/><br/>R.

While designed for 25mm figures on an 8'x5' table, the game can be played with 15mm or smaller scales and adjusting movement and firing distances.<br/><br/>Units in the game are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries.  Typical organizations require 6-9 stands of infantry, which include command stands and stands of grenadiers and/or light infantry.  Light infantry and grenadiers can be converged into their own organizations if desired.  Units are rated A-F depending on training and morale.  This affects movement as well, in that lower grades of troops require multiple actions to carry out formation changes.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is as follows:<br/><br/>1. Active player determines number of actions available (2-4)<br/>2. If Active player has 3-4 actions, he may use these actions to move and/or fire units as desired.  If he rolls only 2 actions, the Reactive player is allowed to Preempt or react (e.g., evading).<br/>3. Melee phase.<br/>4. Brigade morale phase.<br/><br/>",

They are mingled with some explorer counters and then put face down in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>The players take turns in rolling the die. When one of the colors turns up, the player throws a cardboard lasso, trying to catch one or more counters. Those are turned faced up and the ones matching the color of the die roll are considered rescued and taken out of the game. Explorer counters are simply taken out of the game. Non matching counters are turned face down again.<br/><br/>When a vulcano is thrown, one of five vulcano pieces is turned over. When all five pieces are turned over the game is lost. If players succeed in rescueing all dinosaurs before that happens, they win the game jointly.<br/><br/>WARNING: the Playmobil theme is a loose one and although the cover art suggests that you might expect to find some real dinosaur playing pieces in the box, this is a plain cardboard game.<br/><br/>",

Life Grids consist of four different tracks, or suits: Relationships, Wealth, Knowledge, and Experience. Each player must build the best Life Grid possible by balancing the development of all four suits with the hope of playing the Legend card and multiplying their points. Of course, the crowning achievement for any suit is for the player to achieve knighthood in one of their suits by playing all four cards in one suit without having any Hard Knocks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Part of Mayfair Games Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #4, the Elk Fest: Log Jam! Expansion adds 4 log jam tiles to Elk Fest.<br/><br/>Set Up: Set up Elk Fest normally.  Temporarily put one of the riverbank pieces roughly at the half-way point between the two starting riverbanks.  Mix up the Log Jam tiles and place them, log side up, by the corners of the riverbank.  Return the riverbank piece to its starting position, leaving the tiles in place in the middle of the play area.  You are now ready to begin normally.<br/><br/>Rules: When a log is hit by a stone the log remains where it lands (just like when a stone hits another stone).  Your moose can use a log to cross over the water just like a stone.  However, before moving the moose onto the log you must immediately &quot;roll&quot; the log over and place it roughly where it was positioned.  There are three possible results of a rolled log:<br/><br/>    Logs (2 tiles): If you move onto a log, you must move your front feet to a stone by the end of your turn otherwise your &quot;elk gets wet&quot;.  You may not use the stone that you came from for your front hooves.  If you start your turn on a log, you must be off the log entirely before the end of your turn, otherwise your &quot;elk gets wet&quot;.<br/>    Shaky Stones (1 tile): You may treat this like any stone, but as soon as you have left the tile, the stones are washed away and the tile is removed from the game.<br/>    Bear (1 tile): You can't enter this tile.  This tile remains in play bear side up and may be flicked instead of a stone as a blocker.  If it falls off the table the bear goes into hibernation until the next game.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mix! is a game of secret goals and tactical color theory, in which players compete to influence which of six paint colors will be applied to canvases in order to meet their own goals. This requires thoughtful play, as the control each player has over which colors are painted is indirect.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is assigned a goal with two colors -- one color that will grant them points, and another that will cause them to lose points. A player's positive goal is public, while their negative goal is private. Players must work to influence the painting process so as to maximize their positive goal color, and minimize their negative goal color.<br/><br/>Of course, this is easier said than done. Players can only affect the colors that are painted by controlling the location of a shared set of tokens on a color palette. These tokens are moved between sections of the palette by mixing together color cards from a communal pile that all players must play cards into. Players can also play action cards to affect the location of tokens, and the availability of color cards to mix.<br/><br/>Timing is a critical aspect of Mix!, as players can only take one of three possible actions each turn -- either combining color cards to influence the palette, taking on new bonus objectives, or painting. Painting results in all players gaining and losing points based on the state of the palette, and also allows players to complete their bonus objectives. As a result, players must choose carefully when to work to influence the palette versus when to paint, in order to maximize their own gains while minimizing those of their opponents.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, private goals are revealed, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Using the cards at their disposal, players build a deck in any way they choose consisting of exactly twenty unique cards. Having built their twenty card decks, players shuffle their cards and draw the top ten cards and now, using those cards, the goal is to have the most points when both players have chosen to not play any further cards.<br/><br/>When you play a card it must be in the correct placement on your grid and all cards after your first must be touching the edge of a card in play, diagonals don't count.<br/><br/>Playing a card scores you the points written on it, both in the top left and anything you would gain through the ability text. Players keep track of this either on paper or with dice, or whatever you have available.<br/><br/>Players have two options on their turn, play and resolve one card from their hand or pass, but if you pass you can no longer play cards for the rest of the round. When the round ends the player with the higher points is the winner.<br/><br/>This is then repeated until one player wins twice.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to get rid of all your cards as fast as possible.<br/><br/>When a player has discarded all cards, the remaining players count the points in their hand. When a player reaches the maximum score (recommended max score: 73), the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Let the youngest start, or choose yourself (perhaps the one who needs the most help?) If you can&rsquo;t, or don&rsquo;t want to, play a card, you have to draw a card from the deck, and let the turn pass over to the next player. Beware of the T-rex! When the deck has no more cards, simply shuffle all the played cards and keep on going!<br/><br/>If the draw-deck is completely out of cards, no more cards are drawn! The T-rex card is worth 36 points! That can only happen with event cards, or by sabotaging a rival with for example the card &ldquo;Give away 2 cards from your hand to another player&rdquo;, or hope that someone else will draw the T-rex from your hand when they are playing the card &ldquo;draw a card from another player&rdquo;, and try to keep a poker face!<br/><br/>When you only have three cards left on your hand you have to scream out &rdquo;Dinomania&rdquo;, your greatest Dino-roar, or just any sound to indicate your amount of cards. If you don&rsquo;t - you get 10 points even if you win that gameplay.<br/><br/>",

The game was indeed conceived in the Middle Ages by a group of aspiring artists. In those days, it was customary to throw excrements out the balcony to the square, once the work had ended. One day, an artist was hit by it and his friends slammed their hands on the table and called out &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo;. The unlucky artist decided to use it to develop a game that had immediate success since then.<br/><br/>First, two decks of cards are to be prepared. One of the two decks only include characters cards to be dealt to players, the other one includes all the other cards, representing the points, or so called tons of shit!<br/><br/>The second deck has to be positioned at the center of the table so that it is possible for players to easily reach it with their hands.<br/><br/>The game begins with the counter-clockwise cards dealing, 4 cards each player. Players must quickly choose one of the cards in their hand and pass it to the opponent to the right while picking up at the same time the card that the opponent to the left is handing over.<br/><br/>When a player has a four of a kind (poker) hand must immediately pound the hand firmly on the center deck on the table, while shouting: Shit! All the other players must pound their hands on top of the one who pounded the deck first and called Shit!<br/><br/>The last player pounding the deck has to draw a card from it, which value represents the &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; (tons) of Shit picked up.<br/><br/>Watch out! The same rules applies if a player accidentally touches the central deck and subsequently has to draw a Shit! card right away. For this reason, it is possible to bluff by shouting Shit! or by pretending to pound the deck, in order to induce opponents to pound the deck too, by mistake, and therefore be forced to drawing the Shit! card. The winner is the Player summing up less &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; (tons) of Shit, once the cards central deck is depleted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Urgent recruitment! Now that efficient space development has become possible, Japan has decided to support companies participating in space development. Please contact the ministry office for the company you want.<br/><br/>You are the president of a space development company. Thousands of years after humans began to fly, humans finally made their way into space. Space development has accelerated at a stretch by creating stars in outer space and recovering resources from them, and it is now a major business of the entire industry. Stay on top of this big wave, outsmart your rivals, and win lots of resources!<br/><br/>Mezame No Sora (目覚めの宇宙) is a set collection game. Each turn, you play three out of four cards to move or turn your rocket, and pick up a card from the color of the planet you end up on (if the planet is still unexplored). At the start of your turn you discard down to four cards into your personal score pile. If you push someone out of the universe map, you get to steal cards from their score pile.<br/>At the end of the game, each card is worth 1 point, with 1, 2 or 3 bonus points for the majority in the three available colors.<br/><br/>In this game, you have five cards in your hand, each of which corresponds to a specific movement of the rocket (for example, two squares forward). You are required to select the most suitable action from the limited options and operate your own rocket. At the end of each turn, each player's position becomes a star and acquires resources. The rocket will become more and more difficult to move because it will be an &quot;out zone&quot; where you will be penalized if you enter.<br/><br/>You can even crash your opponent by pushing them out of the field or to a position with a star! By doing so, you can steal resources from the opponent and get points, so it is often advantageous.<br/><br/>Rules Summary:<br/><br/>Use your hand to move the rockets in order. Since the number of cards you can use is small, let's move systematically. On the contrary, it is also possible to advance the game in an advantageous way by predicting the opponent's hand and action.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, explore the planet and win cards. This will be a means of transporting rockets as a hand. The effect obtained for each color of the reclamation area is fixed. Be aware of the cards you want and collect them.<br/><br/>It is an out zone where you cannot enter the planets and the outside of the cultivated planet. Let alone self-destruction, you need to be careful not to be dropped by the other party. If you drop your opponent, you can steal a lot of cards from your opponent, so let's aim aggressively.<br/><br/>The person with the most cards in the end wins! Bonus points will be given to the player with the highest number of cards for each color, so it may be the secret of victory not to give up until the end.<br/><br/>",

That's why you need to take photos of them.<br/><br/>Explore the island, take many photos but beware, dinosaurs are not used to visitors. Some will flee but other may find you tasty! You will not be able to show your photos when you're eaten. Also remember that it's not the quantity of photos that count but quality. Big and dangerous dinosaurs are worth more points than small, easier to find ones.<br/><br/>Let the Dino Safari begin!<br/><br/>During setup players are required to create the &quot;island&quot; using tiles with hexagonal spaces starting with &quot;camp&quot; tile. Once it's done 12 randomly chosen dinosaur tokens are randomly placed on &quot;nest&quot; spaces facing down. Then each player choose their character and place him/her in the camp. Players take their turns clockwise. During player's turn you have three movement points and one &quot;take a picture&quot; action. You can spend those in any order you want. Characters can move in any direction they want, &quot;plains&quot; space costs 1 movement point while &quot;forest&quot; space costs 2. You cannot enter &quot;crags&quot; or &quot;lake&quot; spaces. To take a photo move to a space adjacent to dinosaur token and uncover it then take the card with species you've uncovered. On each species card you can see how much points it's worth and its skills like movement points and special rules. Players can also take pictures of already uncovered dinos to get their cards but you can score only once for each species. Starting with round two after you're done with your character's actions you can move 1 uncovered dinosaur token (you must be in possession of that species card). You can use that to run away from other players, scare off another uncovered dinosaur to remove its token so nobody can take a picture of it anymore or, if it's a carnivore, attack other players. Attacked player loses one life and is forced to return to camp. If a character is attacked third time (losing last remaining life) he/she is considered &quot;eaten&quot; and eliminated from game (his/her score is 0 no matter how many cards were in his/her possession). From now on during eliminated player's turn he/she can only move dinosaurs. Game ends when all 12 tokens are uncovered. The sum of points on cards in your possession is your score. Highest score wins. There is also a chance that all players are eaten. In that rare case game ends and nobody wins.<br/><br/>",

This is a crisis like no other.<br/><br/>Climate Crisis, the game, is a collaborative board game where you and your friends (maybe even your enemies) can sit down together and try and save not only the planet but humankind.<br/><br/>General game play description:<br/>Players must work collaboratively to save the world from climate change. There is a tricky balance between moving to renewable energy, recycling, population, staying alive and keeping enough energy to keep going.<br/><br/>The goal is to optimise world population, stay alive and achieve environmental sustainability!<br/><br/>The players work together as they search for scientific discoveries that will solve our climate crisis. This needs to be done all the while the population and pollution across the planet grows and the level of Greenhouse Gases rises. Take too long and the planet dies from too much pollution or the Greenhouse Gases get to the point of no return.  As the greenhouse gases rise the impacts from climate change increase and become more common!<br/><br/>Balance the needs for energy production from fossil fuels and environmentally sustainable sources. Keep the population with enough Food and Water. Players are faced with numerous challenges &ndash; you need energy to function but fossil fuels create pollution and damage the environment. Moving to clean energy costs time and money, and is not as efficient. Feeding the population with Dairy products can be effective but comes at the cost of energy and pollution.  All the while the climate crisis clock keeps ticking!<br/><br/>Each player has special skills that they can use to work together to save the planet. A highly collaborative game where players need to coordinate their actions and devise plans and strategies to solve the crisis.<br/><br/>Sustainable Qualities:<br/>This game is all about educating people about the trade offs around sustainability. The complex interaction between population, energy production and consumption, food production, water use, economic advancement. It also shows the impact of pollution and waste and the dramatic effects of climate change &hellip; whilst still giving people hope that if we collaborate and work together we can build a solution to escape the mess that we have made!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If the player is NOT the stand-in, the actual stand-in reveals their identity and collects 2 scoring tokens. Also, any player that did point to that player scores 1 token. If the player is the stand-in, then any player pointing to them scores 1 token. The stand-in still has one chance to score by guessing the sketch everyone was in. If they are correct, they score 1 token. The first player to collect 5 scoring tokens wins!<br/><br/>It takes timing, deduction, bluffing, and acting skills to win! The game features 30 different all-time favorite sketches including More Cowbell, The Roxbury Guys, The Ladies Man, and more!<br/><br/>Game includes 210 Sketch Cards of 30 Sketches, 7 Stand-In Cards, 30 Sketch Envelopes, 1 Stand-In Envelope, 36 Scoring Tokens, 8 SNL Reference Boards, 60 Second Sand Timer, Game Instructions<br/><br/>",

The player with the most rounds after that time wins the game.<br/>     You choose a number of rounds in advance that you will complete. The player who completes all the rounds first wins.<br/><br/><br/>Rounds are recorded on paper.<br/><br/>Optional rule<br/>If you complete a turn and are 5 spaces behind another car (not sideways/diagonally) you will end up in the slipstream. This allows you to move forward another 4 places.<br/><br/>Tips!<br/>There is a 'racing line' - so the inside of the corners are often shorter in spaces, allowing you to gain speed! It is possible to block the shortest route, forcing other drivers to overtake outside! Watch out for the chicane as the track narrows to 1 square wide and cars can get blocked here. If it is blocked, you lose your remaining moves and you can only pass when there the space is free.<br/><br/>Start your engines!<br/><br/>",

Play against others to control the deck as you flip and slap your way to victory. Win cards by battling weapon wielding Ninja Cats, but be ready to steal the deck as you beat your opponents by slapping card combos first.<br/><br/>Players take turns flipping cards into a pile at the center of the table. If a player flips a number card, game continues to the next player. If a Ninja Cat card is flipped, the battle begins! The following player then has the number of chances indicated on the card to flip over their own Ninja Cat card. If they do, play continues to the next player, and the battle begins again. If they don't, the player who initially flipped the Ninja Cat card wins the pile!<br/><br/>Keep an eye out for card sequences which can be slapped at any time during the game, as the first person to slap them gets to collect the pile. But watch out for that sneaky CUCUMBER, because when it's flipped you must ATTACK! First person to slap the cucumber wins the pile! Special action cards make the game more intense by forcing players to shuffle or swap their whole deck. Collect the whole deck to win the game!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Deal each player 10 cards. Set the remaining cards aside. The player to the dealer's left has first turn and begins the hand's first trick.<br/><br/>Each trick consists of every player placing 1 card into the center of the playing surface, in clockwise order. The first card played determines the trick's dominant color. The next cards played must be the same color, unless a player doesn't have one (in which case any card must be used). The player with the largest gummy bear of the dominant color takes the trick. Players score 1 point for every card taken, as well as bonus and penalty points listed on special cards. The trick taker choses the first card to play for the next trick. Special cards may not be played first in a trick. If a player beginning a trick has only a special card left to play, the trick is void and he or she is assessed a -5 point penalty.<br/><br/>When all tricks for the hand have been played, the points scored by each player should be tallied and recorded on paper. Several hands are to be played to allow points to accumulate.<br/><br/>The first player to score 100 points, wins!<br/><br/>",

The boats are each painted in four different colors (yellow, blue, green and red).<br/><br/>Players have three rolls of the dice to try to collect as many flags of one color, so they can get a boat or both boats of that color. If the boat already belongs to another player, you take the boat from him. The game ends when all the boats have been captured. The big boat scores 2 points, and the small boat scores 1 point. The player with the most points win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wolf im Schafspelz is a fast-paced dice game in which you must quickly evaluate the roll of the dice and toss the right card in the right box. The faster you are, the more points you score &ndash; assuming you're correct, of course.<br/><br/>In the basic game, each player holds a wool card and the two halves of the box are laid face-up on the table, one showing a sheep in the bottom and the other a wolf. Players roll five or seven animal dice, depending on the number of players, then they try to scan the dice quickly to see which animal group &ndash; the sheep or wolves &ndash; are in the majority so that they can through their wool card in that box. Players who do so score 0-3 chips, depending on the number of players and how quickly they threw in their card; anyone tossing in the wrong box loses one chip. The first player to collect ten chips wins.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, a spice/wool die is rolled with the animal dice, and players need to throw the appropriate card &ndash; spice or wool &ndash; into the appropriate box. In the elite game, a blue animal die comes into play. If the blue animal die is part of the sheep/wolf majority, then game play is identical to the advanced game for that round; if not, then players must throw the symbol not showing on the spice/wool die into the right box.<br/><br/>One final variant can be used with all three levels of play: When the sheep are in the majority, those who score in the round receive a sheep chip; when the wolves are ascendant, they receive a wolf chip. The winner is the first player to collect both five sheep chips and five wolf chips.<br/><br/>",

The first player takes a cookie half from the cookie jar. If the shape matches one of their brown cookie halves, they can put the pieces together to make a whole Oreo and place them in their stack. If they do not match, the player must return the cream half to the jar and the next player takes their turn. Play continues until the cookie jar is empty and the player with the highest stack of cookies wins.<br/><br/>For more advanced players: Place all of the cookie halves face down on the table. The first player turns two halves over. If they match to form a cookie, that player gets to add that cookie to their stack. If they don't match, both halves are turned back over and the next player goes. The game continues until all cookies have been matched and again, the player with the highest stack of cookies wins.<br/><br/>",

This clever new game has players frantically collecting all the ingredients for their own recipe of mild, medium or spicy guacamole! Be the first player to match 5 ingredients cards to the recipe card, and you get to keep that recipe card. Collect one of each type - mild, medium and spicy - and you win! Ole!<br/><br/>Game Overview:<br/><br/>Players are dealt five ingredient cards, which are laid face up in front of them.  The top recipe card is turned over and then players draw cards to improve their ingredients to match the recipe.  If a card is kept, another card is discarded, so that players only have five cards at a time.  Players may draw from the discard pile as well.  The first player to match the exact number of ingredients to the recipe shouts &quot;Guacamole!&quot; and then wins that recipe card.  The game continues until one player has won one each of the Mild, Medium and Spicy recipe cards.  The game can either be played by turns or by &quot;scramble&quot; (where all players draw and discard as fast as they can at the same time).<br/><br/>There are three special cards to spice things up: Limes - all players pass a card to their left; Salsa Bowl - all players pass a card to their right; Sombrero - all players get up and move one chair to the left, taking over another player's hand.<br/><br/>",

Some of the A zone lots are offshore.<br/><br/>What you can do during your turn is driven by the outer track.  Eventually, you'll buy permits, conduct seismic exploration, drill (also a form of exploration), place reservoir markers for oil or gas.  Random events intervene, and nationalization occurs now and then.<br/><br/>The game has a definite educational bent to it.<br/><br/>",

There are two different levels of play, one for young children and a more advanced game for those who want more depth.<br/><br/>Each player starts by taking one Blade card and placing it face up in front of him/her. Each Blade has its own &quot;spin strength&quot;. You count that number of cards from the top of your deck and place them face down in a &quot;spin pile&quot; under the Blade card. The spin pile is very important, since the object of the game is to run your opponent out of spin by removing all the cards in his/her spin pile.<br/><br/>Players take turns initiating battles which go back and forth until one player cannot make a play.  Then players determine how many cards will be lost from the losing player's spin pile using symbols that match up on the tops of the cards.  The advanced version uses card text to take the game to a deeper level.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The Story<br/><br/>Thornhill Mansion holds many secrets. Just before the turn into the 20th century Irwin Biddle purchased the house and turned it into what he called an orphanage care facility. But his severe governorship of the orphanage made the home for lost children anything but a haven. A fire in 1939 nearly destroyed the Thornhill Mansion. All but 13 children escaped the blaze. It wasn't until 1956 that Arthur Holland, a mining tycoon, purchased the Thornhill and footed the bill for a full renovation. However, it became clear within weeks of moving his family into the Thornhill that the Victorian mansion was far from settled. Holland's personal account of his family's stay in the Thornhill tells of unexplained children's voices, the sounds of little feet running through the night, of moaning heard inside the walls, even of parts of the house shifting. After leaving the Thornhill, Holland declared, &quot;The place is a house of the dead. No sane person can live well within its walls.&quot;<br/><br/>13 ghosts live in the Thornhill, victims of the devastating fire that happened so long ago. As a ghost hunter, you welcome the chance to stay in the ghostly orphanage. Will you be the one to finally put the children to rest? Or will the malevolent child spirits drive you insane?<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>In Children the game, you wander around the Thornhill Mansion trying to trap ghosts.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, you deal the 13 Ghosts deck face down off to the side on the table. You then deal the 13 Toys cards face up over the 13 Ghosts cards, creating 13 2-card stacks. Each player gets 5 cards (the hand limit at the beginning of the game) from the Children deck.<br/><br/>Players collectively build the Thornhill Mansion during their turns by placing room cards face up on the table in a grid pattern. The mansion is built in 4 levels--basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor, and 3rd floor. Each room card indicates on which floor it must be placed.<br/><br/>You search for toys and helpful devices by moving your pawn from room to room throughout the mansion. Each time you enter a room, you draw a card and add it to your hand. With a 5-card hand limit, players are forced to leave cards in rooms by placing them facedown beneath room cards. Players may also leave traps beneath room cards. You look at left-behind cards when you enter rooms. Left-behind traps spring immediately. You may add other left-behind cards to your hand.<br/><br/>You place ghost cards into the mansion when they appear at the top of the draw pile. Ghost cards are placed face up beneath room cards so players can read ghosts' names and see the toy icons on the tops of the cards.<br/><br/>To trap ghosts you must have Toy cards. Each ghost card is marked with a toy icon. If you are in a room with a ghost and you have its corresponding toy in your hand, you immediately trap the ghost and put it, along with the toy card, in front of you to keep score.<br/><br/>When you trap a ghost, you must see if another ghost in the house becomes enraged. To do this, flip over the 2-card stack you made at the beginning of the game that corresponds with the toy you used to trap the ghost. If the revealed ghost is in the mansion, flip its card over to its enraged (red) side. Every enraged ghost in the house reduces the hand limit by 1 card. If the hand limit reaches 0 cards, no players win. The ghosts take the game.<br/><br/>",

Separate the white and black cards into two piles and shuffle. The first player draws a white card, reads it aloud, does what it says, then the next player does the same until someone picks up a white &quot;DRAW&quot; card. Once this happens then that player must draw a black from the other pile, read it aloud, and do what it says or drink. If the challenge on the card is completed successfully, the card can be kept by the player and counted as points. Some cards are far more challenging than others and therefore are worth more but also have greater consequences for failing to successfully perform the challenge. In the end, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

Movement is governed by dice roll, but you only get the roll from one of them, unless you roll doubles.<br/><br/>For example: If you Roll a 3 and 5, you choose whether you move 3 or 5 spaces. If you roll a 6 and 6, you MUST move 12.<br/><br/>You may also 'steal' Agents from other players to keep them from winning by landing on them by exact count.  Once you've found your assignment you have to try to keep it a secret before you 'make your run for home base' as your opponents will be out to get you.<br/><br/>",

The square can be any size and any orientation (in other words, the square can be &quot;tilted&quot;).<br/><br/>In addition, each player has a small number of pieces, called quasars, that are used purely for blocking.<br/><br/>Quod was invented by G.

The blue balls count for 1 and the yellow ball counts for 5 points. Balls lying on top of the stack of sticks may be manipulated when in the process of retreiving a stick, thereby forcing of preventing them from falling through.<br/><br/>It's a fun little game played by 2 to 4 players.

        "description": "Enter the Passage is a party game based on The Passage trilogy by Justin Cronin. In this game, players are assigned the role of Humans, Virals or Amy, with the Humans trying to destroy the Virals, the Virals conspiring to attack the Humans, and Amy using her unique powers to help the humans determine who among them is a Viral and who is safe. Gameplay is based on the award-winning Ultimate Werewolf series of games by Ted Alspach.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, one person is designated the moderator. That person creates a deck with one card per person in it, with at least one Viral and Amy. The cards are dealt face down, and each player secretly views her role. From that point forward, there are two teams: Virals and humans, with Amy on the Human team. The Virals are trying to attack the humans, and the humans are trying to destroy the Virals. The game continues until one of the two teams has been eliminated.<br/><br/>",

To place a new card on an existing card, whatever the color, the numbers must match. <br/>3) The cards stay on the table once played and gameplay continues until the decided number of tokens is obtained. <br/>4) Finally, there are a handful of cards that allow you to remove one card position or a whole row of cards.<br/><br/>",

Set at Lake Nomby amusement park, everyone was having a wonderful time until the sun began to set and an ominous crash is heard at the center of the park. From within the dark and creepy park maintenance shed, a moaning sound emerges. The owner of that sound quickly becomes clear as the Zombie Janitor appears and begins his search for brains! In a panic, the park guests and security flee the park and lock the gate behind them to keep the zombie trapped inside. The problem is the janitor isn&rsquo;t the only one left behind! YOU&rsquo;RE trapped too!<br/><br/>Players roll two Dice. Move your Character the number of spaces shown on the white die, then move the Janitor Zombie the number of spaces shown on the green die. Your goal is to find a flashlight by landing on and flipping the item tiles. Once you have found a Flashlight, go to the maintenance shed, grab a Key, and proceed to any exit to escape the park!<br/><br/>Watch out for Zombies though. If you end up on the same space as a Zombie, flip your pawn over, and now you become a Zombie and your strategy changes. Now your goal is to chase the other Human Characters and turn them into Zombies!<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s two ways to win Zombie Chase! Find a flashlight, grab a key from the maintenance shed, and be the first to escape through one of the gates or you can win by being the one to infect the final human player as a Zombie. With two ways to win, everyone has a shot at coming out the winner and every playthrough is a new adventure. One thing is for sure: to win at Lake Nomby amusement park, alive or undead, you&rsquo;ll be needing plenty of brains!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Then this is your game, but don't expect to find as many games as in this auction.<br/><br/>A &quot;family&quot; of 2-6 players is visiting a round-shaped fleamarket. Each player starts with 20 money and 2 items. There's a total of 15 items in 5 different colours in the game, the fleamarket stalls have space for 1-3 items, and a rotating disc under the game board keeps the prices for the various stalls constantly changing; the idea is to be in the right place at the right time to buy cheap and sell dear. Hand limit is 3 items, but a player may buy/sell 2 at a time if they are of the same colour, and if there's space in the stall they happen to be at. A stall may be out of use due to a coffee break (the &quot;coffee cup&quot; symbol) and two special squares force players either to give or take money from an opponent. For movement, players can choose between roll-and-move or fixed movement rules.<br/><br/>Winner is the player who first gets 250 money.<br/><br/>",

Passive watching / reading of a detective story turns into a dynamic boardgame, in which the players engage in searching out the evidence and investigating the complexity of the murderer's motives.  <br/>Each session is a contest of skill between the detectives and the Master of the Game in the role of the Prime Suspect. Exactly what happened and how? Who is the murderer and what was the motive of the crime? The choice is far from easy. Among the twenty suspects are respected citizens of Vileburg. Step by step the detectives follow the murderer's trail, carefully checking each trace, searching out anyone in any way connected with the case. The witnesses (once identified) are ready to testify. Their statements may help or further complicate the process of investigation. In this game everything depends on the deductive skills of the players: no one else will put together all the pieces of the puzzle into one coherent and logical picture.  And even when (and if) the criminal is finally caught (after the exciting chase phase of the game), it&rsquo;s not over yet: the detectives try to deduct the motive of the crime, reconstruct the entire story from the scraps of data they have managed to collect.<br/><br/>",

Then he looks at the text lines (&quot;tasks&quot;) with this number and chooses a task from one of those cards. Next, he chooses an action how to explain the task to other players: to speak, to draw, or to perform. (The method of explanation becomes unavailable for this player till he uses all three methods in his text turns.)<br/><br/>All other players tries to guess the task. The game master and the player who gives the correct answer both score 1 victory point, keeping one of the two task cards drawn by the game master. After that the next player becomes a game master, and so on.

        "description": "BULLSHIP! is a brand new spinoff of Liar's Dice born in Canada in which each player steps into the role of a famous notorious pirate and battle for the title of Pirate King and the legendary Black Lagoon.<br/><br/>Player's are given five dice, two gold coins, a random character card and one barrel dice shaker. To stay alive in BULLSHIP!, you must bluff or be bluffed and use your unique character abilities to increase the odds of winning. Player's keep their dice concealed from others and make 'wages' of how many dice there are of a certain numeric value in total amongst all players. <br/>e.g &quot;There are 6 dice with fives in total&quot; In a clockwise rotation, the next player must then increase the number of dice by at least one to continue the wager for the match. If a player believes the other player is bluffing, someone can always call &quot;BULLSHIP!&quot; on that active wager. When that happens, all players reveal their dice and the player who called &quot;BULLSHIP!&quot; either the wins the booty or loses their own booty. Once a player runs out of booty, they are eliminated and the player who defeated them steals their unique ability(s) permanently.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Categories test your knowledge of carols, movies, the North Pole, traditions and stocking stuffers.&quot;<br/><br/>In Christmas Trivia Game, each player tries to correctly answer two questions in each of five categories (or one of each, for a quicker game).

The card is then replaced at the bottom of the card stack.  Play continues until one player has answered the designated number of questions.<br/><br/>",

You will need Tongs or Slotted Ladle to cook ingredients, and Bowls to contain the cooked ingredients. You get to roll the dice for each bowl card played in front of you. If you manage to roll a matching colour with an ingredient in the cooked area, dip it into a sauce before you eat by picking a Sauce Card, and yum!<br/><br/>The game is designed to accommodate players of different levels:<br/><br/>Simple (with young children)<br/>- Bowl cards are separated into another drawing pile. <br/>- King of the Pot is removed from the deck.<br/>- Orange Sauce removed from Sauce deck<br/><br/>Normal (general game)<br/>- Bowl cards are shuffled into the action deck.<br/>- King of the Pot is added to the deck.<br/>- All Sauce cards in use.<br/><br/>Advanced (familiar players of the game)<br/>- Cooked ingredients are only shown to all players once before being placed in the pot.<br/>- Advancement to Frenzy Phase (swapping of ingredients).<br/>- Longer gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game features the excellent art and intriguing characters from the amazing animated series, Angel Wars.<br/><br/>The game begins with the game tiles set up in checkerboard design.  You control the 6 guardian angels.  Your opponent controls the 6 demons (or the 6 messenger angels if your opponent prefers not to play the demons).  Players take turns moving, following the rules of movement, until one player has successfully moved all of his/her pieces to the opposite sides of the board.<br/><br/>However, it&rsquo;s not that simple.  You can only move your piece on a tile of matching color.  Players flip tiles to match their piece.  You must find a way to clear a path for both your blue pieces and your orange pieces while trying to block your opponent&rsquo;s pieces in the process.<br/><br/>Offering two styles of play, this game is sure to become a favorite among game players of all ages and skill levels.<br/><br/>",

Dice are used to determine damage depending upon your distance away (with a couple of &quot;auto-result&quot; cards that can be used.)  You have limited ammo and need to reload at specific squares. There's a minor card bluffing element (you can shield yourself for a turn but you might be bluffing.)  There is a single sheet ruleset which explains what all the bits do but leaves you to infer how the game itself works.<br/>The production values are reasonably high, but all the cards and the board are in monochrome.<br/>Basically, it's like Frag but without the interesting weapons or objects or slight role-playing element.<br/><br/>",

They will try to invest this money and the profit goes back to Red Cross. This year (2003) the money has been given to Peter Aalb&aelig;k, manager of the film company, Zentropa.

Game components consist of: a colorful mounted mapboard with various &quot;Space&quot; properties; a long single-side printed Rules Sheet; thick cardboard &quot;Properties&quot; cards; a set of Money denominations; translucent &quot;Space Stations&quot; chips; 2 8-sided DICE; a set of &quot;Discovery&quot; cards; 5 Cardboard money holders; 6 LEAD tokens-a Space Shuttle, Soyuz Space Station, Apollo Spacecraft, Lunar Rover, Astro/Cosmo-naut, and Lunar Lander. I HIGHLY recommend painting/coating the tokens to prevent unhealthy LEAD effects for those folks so concerned. Dipping or Spray coating with a &quot;plastic&quot; type product is best and 3 coats should be sufficient.<br/>Play is similar to games of this ilk and the game ends once the FIRST player to lose all their money and be forced into Stellar Bankruptcy is declared. The winner is the remaining player with the most money. It has some special effects such as allowing players to move where they like when landing on a Space Shuttle space and paying the TRANSPORT fee. Other special spots include: Astro Bonus; Black Hole; Fuel Base; Halley's Comet; Meteor Storm; Mission Control; Solar Roller; Space Lotto; &amp; Space Sickness. There are special rules for just 2 players including receiving extra money &amp; 3 &quot;Claim&quot; cards prior to commencement of play. Nice and different approach from all the Terran bound versions of games like this.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from Spielbox:<br/><br/>A new Bremen-based publisher without a website as of yet. They will be releasing a game that apparently has been making the rounds of insiders for the past 10 years. The title: Paaren / Couples. It's a card-playing game. Each player plays cards. In one spot, one man can be matched with a suitable woman. Matches are determined by having at least two matching characteristics with both the location and the partner. These can be different, though. Players always have four characteristics, locations have two to six. There are influence cards which can break up matches as well as destroy them. Thankfully there are also other cards which offer protection against jealousy. The first player to reach a pre-set number of matches wins the game.<br/><br/>The game will be bilingual (German / English) and come with 120 individually illustrated cards. Since most will recognize the characters, it will be great fun to match those who might not seem to be such a good match to start.<br/><br/>",

If the cards tie, you go to war: place 3 more cards face down and turn over the 4th card, which decides the winner of the trick. Wild cards beat numbers and weapons.

Each player receives a Route Planner card which determines start and finish points, which may be on the same track or different ones.<br/><br/>Players roll a d8 for movement and must travel along one of six tracks, each of which represents a different style of puzzle or problem. Where different tracks cross a player may change routes by successfully answering a question from any of the tracks that intersect there. Players have to change tracks at least three times during the game, even if their given route both starts and finishes on the same track.<br/><br/>The six tracks or Lines correspond to different types of puzzles or problems, the idea behind the game being to develop and test different thought processes. The six lines are as follows:<br/><br/>The Sequence Line - the puzzle here is to identify the missing part of a sequence.<br/><br/>The Code line - here one has to break a code or cipher.<br/><br/>The Process line - the aim here is to take in the information at speed and to deduce the correct answer.<br/><br/>The Memory line - here a player is given a look at a card with a variety of information on it, and is then quizzed on a particular aspect of it.<br/><br/>The Perception line - similar to the memory line, problems here relate to observational skill.<br/><br/>The Lateral line - an exercise in lateral thinking regarding the subject detailed on the card. A player has to identify a series of objects that are related to the card's subject.<br/><br/>All these puzzles and problems are subject to a time limit -  a sand timer with a 30s limit is included in the box.<br/><br/>The box contains a board, six decks of 40 cards, one for each line, 15 Route Planner cards, 25 Risk It cards (which may be played when landing on a Risk It board space and have both beneficial and unhelpful effects), and six sets of playing pieces and counters to mark when a player has changed lines.<br/><br/>",

Enjoy!&quot;<br/><br/>After this history lesson from the box, a little about the game itself is in order.<br/><br/>Piracy is a two player abstract game with a pirate theme.<br/><br/>The board is composed of two ships, one Spanish and one pirate, between the two is a rope net consisting of six by five spaces. The rope net also has 4 broken rope spaces which will drop a player's piece to the sea (out of game) if they land on it.<br/><br/>Players have two options a turn, they may either launch as many as up to 5 game pieces from their ship's cannon doors towards the enemy. Or, move all their pieces on the net forward one space, either forward or diagonally up/down. Player pieces that land on the opponent's pieces remove the enemy pieces from the game.<br/><br/>If a player's pieces reach the other ship, they will destroy the opponent's cannon door and any pieces behind it. The player's piece is also returned to the player's ship to again enter the net.<br/><br/>The optimal game end is when one player removes all the other player's pieces from the board.<br/><br/>An added complication is that pieces moving up or down off the net return on the opposite top or bottom, depending on movement.<br/><br/>",

On turn each player (out of home) throws a die to move their animal-shaped marker around the board and has to answer questions in one of the five categories depending on the color of the board tile landed upon. A players may change direction on the board after each turn.<br/><br/>The four main categories are:<br/>Lilac: Soft and close (domestic animals) - in Danish: 'Bl&oslash;d &amp; N&aelig;r (husdyr og landburgsdyr)' <br/>Blue: Beaks and fins (birds, fishes, and sea mammals) - in Danish: 'N&aelig;b &amp; Finner (fugle, fisk og havpattedyr)'<br/>Light brown: Vild and warm (wild life mammals) - in Danish: 'Vild &amp; Varm (vildtlevende pattedyr)'<br/>Green: Creeping and crawling (insects, frogs, amphibians and reptiles) - in Danish: 'Kryb &amp; Kravl (insekter, f&oslash;er, padder og krybdyr)'<br/><br/>The fifth additional joker category is:<br/>White: Fun and crazy (problems and challenges) - in Danish: 'Fis &amp; Ballade (opgaver og udfordringer)'<br/><br/>The players collect paws (plastic chips with a paw imprint) in the four main colors by correctly answering questions of the respective colors. The white category cover a variety of challenges to be fulfilled in a certain time (such as naming a certain number of animals starting with a particular letter, or drawing or acting a particular animal) or simply an order to transfer a certain number of paws to or from another player or the stock.<br/><br/>If a player land on a tile occupied by another player, the other players is returned to home and have to start out again (keeping the paws collected so far).<br/><br/>The winner is the player or team who first collect three paws of each color and get back home.<br/><br/>Content:<br/>Game board<br/>Rules<br/>4 animal-shaped game pieces<br/>48 paws - 12 in each main color<br/>1 die<br/>2 boxes with a total of 300 cards with 1500 questions and challenges<br/>4 pads of drawing paper<br/>4 pencils<br/>1 30-seconds hourglass<br/><br/>",

Each player has six cards at the start of the game; the goal is to get rid of one's cards first.<br/>The first player plays a card on the table; this card will be the first letter of a word that s/he thinks about (but doesn't say out loud). The next player adds a second letter to the word, etc. There are many jokers, so there are also many possibilities for what a word might be. When a player doubts that the last player can still think of a word starting with the letters on the table, s/he can call the bluff. If the previous players cannot produce a word, the bluffing player must pick up the cards from the table, if s/he can, the accusing player picks them up. Instead of playing a card, a player can also choose to draw a new card from the stack, but still takes responsibility for the word on the table (i.e., if called, must produce a word with these letters).<br/>By placing a facedown card on the table, any player (out of turn order), can announce that a word is complete. The letters are then discarded and a new word is started.<br/><br/>There are various special cards with which players can be forced to say a word with the current letters, cards can be passed to other players, etc.<br/><br/>When a player plays his or her last card, the other players count the points printed on their remaining cards. These are their negative scores.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>ウォッチャ (WOCHA) is a word game based on the traditional Japanese word game for children called しりとり (Shiritori) which literally means 尻 (buttock) 取り (grabbing). Essentially, you must make a new word (nouns only) using the last character of the previous. For example:  ねこ &gt; こま &gt; まほう &gt; うきよえ &gt; えかき and so on. The game has some other simple rules to keep it controlled.<br/><br/>Wocha follows the pattern of Shiritori with picture cards. Each card has a complex picture that can be interpreted many ways, much as Dixit does. Players arrange ten image cards so that everyone can see them easily. Reveal one new image card from the deck to start the chain, then race to decide which one of the ten images can join the first revealed card, explaining how the two cards link together.<br/><br/>Each time a card is moved from the common area to link to the chain, a replacement card is drawn. Each player has four coloured cubes, and drops a cube onto a card when they make a successful link. It is allowed to revise the explanation of the chain by re-intepreting  or re-using earlier cards. If a player can make a convincing argument, they can replace the previous player's cube with their own. The first player to dispose of their four cubes is the winner.<br/><br/>If a player makes a rather dubious interpretation on a card image, the game pauses and the players vote thumbs up or down whether to allow it. It is important to follow the rules of the word game. So in the example shown on the blog linked below, the start card was considered as たいよう (太陽 taiyou / sun) and the next card as うま (馬 uma / horse (there is a horse in the car!)), thus chaining with う. Now the current key letter would be ま from うま.<br/><br/>The new card drawn from the deck is a Matryoshka (マトリョーシカ). That would form a chain from うま. Then マトリョーシカ is linked by カッパ (kappa / a Yo-kai, folklore monster). Now that the key letter is パ, when you look back at that first &quot;horse&quot; card, that vehicle might be a パトカー (police car). This lets the player bump the blue cube off and place their own.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/><br/>&quot;Now that you mentioned it, it sure does look so.&quot; Associative skills and attentiveness is the key to this new picto-Shiritori game. The rules are simple.<br/><br/>Open 10 cards to form the community cards area, and give each player 4 colored tokens. Then draw 1 card from the deck, and open as the starting key card. Now, let the picture Shiritori begin!<br/><br/>From the 10 community cards, find a picture that can form a Shiritori-chain from the starting card. Found a good card? Call &quot;WOCHA!&quot;<br/><br/>The caller places the card next to the first card to form a chain, and places their token on the placed card. This newly placed card would be the new key. Now the players have to find a community card that can form a new Shiritori chain from the new key. Continue this procedure, and the one who gets rid of all of their tokens is the winner. But beware! The previously used cards may be reused to form a new chain. When done, the color token that was on the card would be removed and returned to the original player. So act quickly, and get rid of all your tokens before anyone attempts to return them back to you!<br/><br/>「言われてみれば、たしかに見える。」<br/>連想力と発見力。新感覚の絵しりとりゲーム。<br/>ウォッチャのルールはとってもカンタン。<br/><br/>全員が共通で使用する10枚のカードを机に並べ、各プレイヤーには4つのカラーコマが渡されます。<br/>あとは、絵でしりとりをします。<br/>山札から１枚カードをめくり、そのカードにチェーン（繋がり）出来そうなカードを場に並んだ10枚から探します。<br/>見つけた人は「WOCHA!（ウォッチャ！）」と叫びましょう。<br/>その人は先ほどのカードの右隣に、自分がキーワードを見つけたカードを置き、さらにその上に自分のカラーコマを置きます。<br/>ゲームは先ほどチェーンされたカードの続きで引き続き行います。<br/>これを繰り返し、手持ちのカラーコマ4つを誰よりも早くなくした人が勝利です。<br/>ただし！すでに誰かが先ほどチェーンしたカードは本人以外が再度使用でき、もしそのカードを誰かが使用すると、先ほどカラーコマをせっかく置いていたのに使用された瞬間、元のプレイヤーのもとに戻ってきてしまうのです。<br/>他のプレイヤーにカラーコマを戻される前に早く４つを手放してしまいましょう。<br/><br/>",

Each body at your feet and every turn around the arena is another vote in your pocket. Get rid of the opposing Presidents by killing them, corrupting them, or having them dragged away kicking and screaming. Survive the carnage by dodging, bribing, and making treaties with your opponents. Your own President may be lost in the fight, but another will always rise up to take their place.<br/><br/>Presidential Knife Fight brings long-dead Presidents back to life for ruthless combat and historical satire in a card game for 3-6 players. The first 43 Presidents- George Washington through George W. Bush, are all represented in card form, each with a unique ability based on their time in office.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with 3 President cards and gets to choose which order to play them. Maybe George Washington to go first, then Bill Clinton to escape every danger, and clean up with Teddy Roosevelt, the unstoppable killing machine. Gain votes by killing opposing Presidents, surviving a full turn around the table, or through special abilities. Get 5 votes to win the game and become Supreme President of These United States!<br/><br/>Each turn, a player gets 3 actions which they can spend on stabbing their enemies, drawing cards, playing cards, or using their presidential ability; allowing them to build their turn as offensively or defensively as they'd like. Presidents can die from wounds or be thrown out of office from corruption, but dead players re-enter the fight with a new President at the start of their next turn, ensuring no one is out for too long. Players use a shared deck of Action cards, filled with Attacks to kill your enemies, Reactions to keep you alive, and Executive Actions to change up the game. Steal someone's cards with the Patriot Act, have your Scapegoat take the fall for you, or rig the re-election to make sure you never lose!<br/><br/>",

This makes ronin invaluable assets for every team, regardless of clan, since they may be used to supplement a team&rsquo;s weaknesses in battle or further augment their strengths.<br/>Of the many magical creatures and peoples that inhabit Kagejima, the Tengu are among the most enigmatic. For centuries, these strange creatures would barter or trade their magical and martial skills to the competing clans or war bands. Sometimes they did so for gold or shiny baubles, and sometimes for whispers of love from a beautiful woman, the first wail of a newborn, or thirty stems of saffron. Since the start of the Moonlight Tournament, more tengu have offered their services more often, and increasingly for stranger payments.

        "description": "There are many cards, each card has 6 words written on it. Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &quot;Silver Medal&quot;). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>So, players play 2 vs.2. Each team gets a figure representing it on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take a card and not show it to other team member. After that a sand clock (also included) is set. The Player must get the other team member to say the word that is written on card by using sentences to describe the word. For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsmen wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team looses a turn.<br/><br/>This Alias is weird and crazy. The words doesn't make any sense, but you still need to explain these. Can you do it?<br/><br/>",

Once a player has achieved a sequence of five cards (including the starter card), they receive a coin, discard the sequence, and start again. A Shark card is wild, and may be played anywhere in a sequence. Playing a Shark also rewards the player with an additional coin. Advanced play includes Octopus cards to steal from another player&rsquo;s sequence and Dolphin cards to block the steal. First player to receive five coins wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is a completely new breed of Detective Card Game that is based on realistic detective processes, characters and storylines, all set in London during the first half of 2015.<br/><br/>Crime scenes are real London locations and historical facts are blended with fiction. 125 different murder scenarios are waiting to be solved. The game encourages the use of &quot;deductive and abductive reasoning&quot; to assist in reducing the suspect list from 37 to 10 prime suspects, to ultimately identify the only possible killer. The objective of the game has two parts, concerned with discovering the identity of the culprit and having the incriminating evidence to hand!<br/><br/>The game has 3 play formats - OPENplay (2-6), COVERTplay (2-5) or SOLOplay - and has Career, Group and Co-Op variants that provide ample choice in the way the game is played.<br/><br/>The game set comes complete with; 5 Evidence Packs (labelled, ABCDE) a total of 300 cards; &quot;How to be a Deadcert Detective Guide&quot;; a Detective Checklist Pad (with 30 double sided sheets) and 25 Evidence Bags. Each Evidence Pack contains 3 &quot;evidence types&quot; - Victim; Crime Scene and Time of Death - that are used to define murder cases and provide details of the suspects. When the game set is initially opened, the Evidence Packs are each split into 3 Evidence type Packets and kept securely in their individual evidence bags. This will use 15 of 25 bags provided - more about the remaining bags later...<br/><br/>At the start of a game - or &quot;murder episode&quot; as it is referred to - one of each type of Evidence Packet is selected in order to define the murder mystery to be solved. With 5 Evidence Packs this means there are 5x5x5=125 possible episodes that can be played out. With the crime defined, the 18 suspect cards for each evidence type are shuffled together to form the 54 cards in play. 48 of the cards hold information about the suspects - why they had motive, means or the opportunity to carry out the murder. The other 6 are the Snoop cards which play a slightly different role depending on the format being played, but in essence are used to mix up the game play and enable the transfer of suspect evidence between players (or detectives if you wish to fully embrace the experience).<br/><br/>So what about the extra 10 evidence bags? Well 1 is a genuine spare, the other 9 however (and the extra compartment with the game set tray) enable you to safely store up to 3 expansion packs (labelled, FGH) sold separately. These Expansion Packs provide extra victims, crime scenes and times of death to the London mix and interlink with the existing packs. Not only do they increase the number of murder episodes possible, they do so exponentially. If all 3 Expansion Packs are added, 125 episodes expand to a potential 512.<br/><br/>The structure of the game is unique, and is the first of it's kind to provide multiple realistic crime mysteries with a pure card game format - no solution book is required, the murderer is simply the only suspect to have had motive, means and opportunity.<br/><br/>Unlike many card games, it does not lean heavily on the graphics. This, although potentially unpopular with many, is a deliberate move to help focus on the evidence, the textual content of the suspect cards. Font sizing, colouring and new sentences starting on new lines, has all been done to make the reading of the cards as comfortable as possible, to the widest audience as possible. Graphics play an important role in distinguishing the 3 card types, but that is their key role.<br/><br/>The final aspect of the game, that is only set to emerge after playing a few episodes, is the detail and integrity of all the characters that are woven together through the multiple storylines. Any information gathered about a victim or suspect may come in use in future investigations and nothing learnt will be contradicted later by another card. In short, the interwoven stories, events and relationships have as much integrity as the knowledge that you have identified the killer correctly. There are no miscarriages of justice with Deadcert.<br/><br/>Please note: The 15+ age advisory is for reason of content in the detail of the crimes committed, and is not associated with the difficulty of the game play.<br/><br/>",

Capturing does not begin until all twenty-four counters have been placed on the board.<br/>If a player cannot move because her counters are blocked, the other player must continue moving until the blockade is raised. Then the blocked player takes her turn and play goes on as before. This rule also applies to the first move of the game.<br/>The player who succeeds in reducing her opponent to one counter wins the game, the single counter left on the board becoming the &quot;Man in the Moon&quot;.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/><br/><br/>",

The face, however, is slightly different on each card and there are eight sets of different expressions with six cards of each expression.  The cards are dealt to all players face down to make a deck.  Each turn all players simultaneously reveal the top card of their deck.  If a player notices three identical faces he yells out &quot;Flip Flap Flop&quot;.  If correct, that player takes the three identical cards. Unclaimed cards are left on the table. A player who makes an incorrect call may not call on the following round but must play a card as usual.  When one player has six sets of FLIP FLAP FLOP cards, the game ends.  Players count their cards and the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Pac-Man has a magnet on his head which he uses to grab fruit as he passes under them on the board.  The metal gates that hold the fruit may be placed in different positions on the board, providing variety in each game.  Two ghosts rove about the board, moving as Pac-Man does, with the tilt of the plane.  Each of the three characters has a steel ball bearing in its &quot;foot&quot; to permit it to travel freely about the maze.  The ghosts and Pac-Man have opposite-polarity magnets for &quot;ears&quot;, which permits the ghosts to capture Pac-Man.  A timer sets the pace, and with the clock ever ticking, the player must try to snag all three fruits without allowing the ghosts to catch Pac-Man.<br/><br/>",

Caliber .45 serves great for party board gaming. It can be played against each other, or divided into teams.<br/><br/>The essence of the game<br/><br/>Each player receives a cowboy card, then the cowboys take turns arming themselves, collecting cards from a common deck with weapons. One of the players, realizing that he is ready to go into the business, notifies other players and they can decide either to join the raid or refuse. Cowboys-robbers draw out a card of their target - it can be a stagecoach, train, bank or other card that brings money - then they will need to get rid of security, by spending their weapons. After that cowboys begin to divide the loot, which most often leads to a shootout, the winner receives the whole jackpot. In the loot deck there are not only trains and stagecoaches, there are also indians, a sheriff and other misfortunes that can ruin a robbery, send robbers to prison, or even kill an entire gang at once.<br/><br/>The cowboy's task is to earn his million. The one whose extraction brought this money becomes the winner.<br/><br/>You can play the game alone against all or teams, teaming up in pairs, in which case you will need to collect a million for two.<br/><br/>Who is this game for?<br/><br/>The board game is suitable for parties, table feasts in canyons and deserts, behind the bar of the saloon or family evenings on the farm.

Each player chooses how to use the rolls of two dice. Other players may make other decisions. One die shows the location (row or column) for the construction. Choose from any of the available squares in the row and column. The other die shows the type of construction (road, park, house, library cafe or shop) that can be built in one square. Each player draws their chosen construction type within their chosen location. When all players have used the dice roll, re-roll for the next turn.<br/><br/>The pad comes with 50 scoresheets.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

If they cannot come up with a letter the card goes to the next player on the left, who now has to think of a proper word. If the player finds a suitable word, he moves to the next letter.

The twist comes in that players must lay a hand on top of the card they most recently played, and they can't use that hand again until they lay a card on another stack &ndash; thereby imprisoning that second hand until the first hand plays again. What's more, no other player can lay down cards on a covered stack, so everyone will be fighting to slap stacks first. Finally, unlike other Ligretto games, these cards have only colors &ndash; no numbers.<br/><br/>When a player plays the final card in his personal stack, the round ends and all other players score one point for each card remaining in their stack.

The jumping piece must continue jumping until no more jumps are possible. After each jump, the opponent's pieces are captured and removed from the board. If you capture the same number of pieces that your opponent just captured from you on the preceding turn, the pieces are returned to the opponent and not placed in your captured pile.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player cannot make any legal move. Each player gets one point for each captured opponent's piece, plus one point for each opponent's piece on the outside border of the board. Most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players admire the pyramids on the Mokattam Plateau in Egypt. When entering the great pyramid of Giza, a scary thing happens. The stone slab blocking the entrance to the pyramid closes with a huge bang. Whoever wants to get out of the captivity of the pyramid must answer the questions correctly. The cards feature questions from players on a variety of topics: science, technology, flora and fauna, literature, cinema, and the fine arts. Whoever answers the question correctly can move with his piece as many squares on the pyramid fields as the question card gives. Within the pyramid, you can move in any direction through the corridors, but you must not cross the walls and doors. The doors can only be crossed by answering a door opener card, but it is by no means certain that the door will be open and allow the adventurer to pass. When a player gives a correct answer to a door opener question, the door is revealed and you will know whether that door is open in any direction or if it has been blocked for a long time by a stone collapse. With the Szabadulj kv&iacute;z game, everyone can have fun, gain new knowledge, test their knowledge and learn many interesting things!<br/><br/>",

This &quot;cue card&quot; contains an unfinished joke. Each Comedian (player) must devise and write down a completed version of the joke. The players pass their completed jokes to the emcee, who then reads them in a random order. Each player then votes for his/her favorite (beside their own, of course). The player with the most votes gets to keep the cue card. The first player to receive a certain number of cue cards (based on the number of players), wins.<br/><br/>The categories are as follows:<br/><br/>Punchline<br/>The Cue Card gives the punchline to a joke. The Comedian (player) must write the setup (beginning) of the joke.<br/><br/>Missing Pieces<br/>The Cue Card gives a one liner with some pieces missing. The <br/>Comedian must finish writing the one liner by filling each blank <br/>with one or more words.<br/><br/>What's So Funny?<br/>The Cue Card gives the setup to a joke. The Comedian must <br/>write the punchline.<br/><br/>Bright Idea<br/>The Cue Card gives the setup to the ever-popular &ldquo;light bulb&rdquo; <br/>joke.

The <br/>Comedian must write the fifth line.<br/><br/>Tie-breaker<br/>In the case that two or more comedians receive an equal number of votes, a tie-breaker round must be played. The emcee draws a card from the top of the tie-breaker photo card pile and shows it to all comedians. Each tying comedian writes a humorous caption for the photo. When all captions have been completed, each competing comedian reads his/her caption aloud. The non-competing players then vote for the funniest caption. The comedian who receives the most votes receives the original cue card.<br/><br/>There are several booster packs.<br/><br/>",
