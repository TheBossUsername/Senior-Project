Starting with a hand of three cards, each turn you play a card, and based on the orientation you play it in the next player has to play either a higher or lower number. If you play two consecutive numbers you can decide which orientation the next player has to use. If it's your turn and you can't play a card you get one point, and at two points you win the game.<br/><br/>There are also three &quot;Stair Lover&quot; cards with special powers. Each player gets one randomly at the start of the game. The Dark Stairs can always be played, which means you can't win while you're holding them, but the Ghost Story Teller card allows you to give the Dark Stairs to your opponent. The Glico Man lets you swap the most recently played stairs with the first ones played in the round. Finally, the Old Person card lets you ignore the effects of a pair of consecutive cards if one of them is a &quot;slope&quot; card with a red border.<br/><br/>Can you outwit your opponent on the stairs?<br/><br/>The game also includes a Stair Encyclopedia with details of the stairs photographed for the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>From the rear of the box:<br/>MONOPOLY, the great property trading board game, finds its home in the historical town of Huddersfield: from award-winning Victorian architecture to Iron Age monuments. Journey around the gameboard with Huddersfield Cabs and explore landmarks including: Lindley Clock Tower, the Town Hall and Huddersfield Golf Club. Don't forget to stop off for some refreshments en route at Dixons Milk Ices or Beaumont Park. You can further relax while watching the Huddersfield Giants play rugby, or take in some culture at the Choral Society. Take a spin around this beautiful market town and perhaps you'll own your favourite location, or discover a hidden gem in &quot;God's Own County&quot;!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trolls eat Moles uses the &lsquo;Rock-Paper-Scissors&rsquo; concept and made it into a board game. Three people play this game. It is a game that requires strategy, diplomatic maneuvering, and luck.<br/><br/>Object of the game: To be the last of three players with pieces on the board.<br/><br/>Pieces: There are 3 sets of pieces, each set having: 6 Trolls, 6 Moles, 6 Holes and 1 Skull.<br/><br/>Trolls: Trolls eat Moles and can ONLY capture Moles. Each player has 6 Trolls.<br/><br/>Moles: Moles dig Holes and can ONLY capture Holes. Each player has 6 Moles.<br/><br/>Holes: Holes bury Trolls and can ONLY capture Trolls. Each player has 6 Holes.<br/><br/>Skulls: Skulls go boom and eliminate ALL pieces whose squares shares an adjacent side with the Skull square. The Skull is also removed. Each player has one Skull each.<br/><br/>Set up: Players take all their pieces and place them face down to mix them up. The red player selects 14 of their red pieces and slides 5 pieces to the side, not to be looked at. The green player selects 16 of their green pieces and slides 3 pieces to the side, not to be looked at. The blue player selects 18 of their blue pieces and slides 1 piece to the side, not to be looked at.  Players take turns placing one piece at a time face down on the board starting with red, then green, then blue until all the pieces are placed. Figure 1 gives an example of what the board would look like when setting up the pieces. The pieces are flipped over after all the squares are filled up.. Any pieces sharing an adjacent side with a Skull is removed along with the Skull. Players then start moving, starting with red, then green, then blue, and continuing in that order.<br/><br/>Moving: Players move one space at a time in any direction; horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, either onto an empty space, or an occupied space that will allow a capture. Pieces can move multiple spaces in one turn if they are capturing.<br/><br/>Capturing: Pieces can only move onto an occupied square if it can be captured by the incoming piece. Trolls can move onto squares occupied by Moles, Moles can move onto squares occupied by Holes and Holes can move onto squares occupied by Trolls. A piece can capture as many pieces in one turn if they are joined together either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Captured pieces are placed under the captor to form a stack.<br/><br/>Rounds: A round is when pieces have to be shuffled and placed on the board. This can happen if there are remaining pieces on the board from two or more players that cannot be captured. The player with the most pieces combined in their stacks after a round will have the advantage in the next round. That player will be the first player to move after all the pieces are set up and their pieces will be immune to any Skulls. The remaining players take all of their pieces that have not been captured and reshuffle them. Players then place their pieces any where on the board where there is not an occupied piece starting with the one who had the most pieces in their stacks.Players take turns filling the squares until either the spaces are all filled up, or there are no more pieces to place on the board. There is no limit to the number of rounds, though it would be rare to go more than three rounds.<br/><br/>Winning: Winning happens when there is only one player left with pieces on the board.<br/><br/>",

Bid to score points or to drive your opponent's price down -- whatever your strategy, leave your dignity at the door and get ready to commit some random acts of nonsense! Pull a challenge card and read it to the group, then start the bidding war. You can bid zero to 10 points on each dare, but whoever bids the lowest performs the challenge -- and gets the points! Before you perform your challenge, spin the spinner -- depending on where it lands, you could earn extra points or force another player to do the dare. Whether you're the one performing the dare or the one watching, the results are seriously funny. The first player to reach 10 points wins. So, how low will you go to reach the top? Bring laugh-out-loud fun to game nights and get-togethers with this party game for adults and teens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rugby Champion is a Fast-paced tactical card game based on the Rugby theme. This game was designed to be enjoyed with the whole family. It is a simple, tactical and very dynamic game. It will immerse you in a rugby match as if you were there. An essential card game, designed for those oval ball passionate fans as well as for beginners that you should own by the end of the year.<br/>The game offers 3 different play modes for 1 to 4 players, with short rounds.<br/><br/>The game is divided by rounds called &quot;challenges &quot;. These challenges represent the phases of a classic rugby match. Each player therefore tries to win these challenges to be able to score tries, by playing the action cards based either on the power (Physical game), on the dexterity (Hand game), or on the technicality (foot game). But beware, the strongest cards are also the most risky and in case of a risky play the referee can intervene at any time and whistle to mark penalties! And that way, we chain actions and challenges. The player with the most points after 2 halves is declared the winner!<br/><br/>The game takes the form of a series of challenges:<br/><br/>     Physical and powerful challenge: simulates actions like rucks, scrums, etc.<br/>     Hand Challenge: simulates skilful actions such as passes, interceptions, etc.<br/>     Foot challenge: simulates tactical actions such as kicks, penalties, etc.<br/><br/><br/>Despite the small size of our game, the dozens of card and tactical game combinations in 3 game modes (Solo, Duel or Conquest for 4 players) offer very good replay ability. In addition, because the game is played very fast, it is particularly suitable to play small tournaments or championships in less than one hour.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be alert, lie wisely, read between the lines!<br/><br/>Everyone used to lie sometimes, and this is also true for this game. Because of the statements you have to make, you have to decide what is true and what is not. Someone will always lie, and sometime you have to lie and then guess.

Players choose a direction of travel and can only change that direction when they reach the sea, or cliffs, or if they roll a starfish symbol on the custom dice. Play ends when all possible glass is collected or an agreed time period has elapsed. Sea Glass finds are totalled, and the value of the rubbish is assessed by one last roll of the starfish dice.

        "description": "The solar system is erupting into chaos. The dying sun is releasing intense bursts of solar radiation that&rsquo;s destroying the planets around it, making it an invitation for death for anyone who enters the system. However due to the extreme solar activity, brand new elements are being formed and are worth billions of units. You&rsquo;re one of a few brave mercenaries trying to make your way through the system gathering as many resources as you can before the sun goes supernova. You&rsquo;ll find higher valued resources as you get closer to the sun, but it&rsquo;ll be hard on your shields. Will you get the resources you need to set yourself up for life, or will you fly too close to the sun and be destroyed?<br/><br/>Built into the game is the Supernova tracker. This keeps track of how close the sun is to going supernova. The tracker advances after each round (after each player takes their turn) and whenever a supernova event card is drawn from the drill deck. The amount of supernova event cards put into the deck depends on how many players are in the game.<br/><br/>In Project Icarus, players take turns moving around the board, drilling resources off of planets, and visit space station to repair and upgrade their ship. Players need to manage their resource space, engine power, drill integrity, and shield levels in order to survive and win the game. Each player is working on getting the resources shown on the selected goal card and be the first to return to their hyperspace vector before their shield runs out and before the sun goes supernova.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Animals from Langland meet again in Langland Domino, a classic game with the Langland twist: no numbers, but cute animals. In the game 2 to 4 players aged 4 an up try to get rid of all their animal tiles first. To do so, they have to continue or complete animals on the table. If they complete an animal, they get to lie another tile immediately. The special corner pieces not only have the ever-growing line of animals stay on the table, but also grant an extra turn. As soon as a player got rid of all tiles or cannot lay out any of their tiles anymore, the game ends and the player with the least tiles left, wins.<br/><br/>As all games in the Langland line of games, Langland Domino takes a classic and makes it accessible fun for kids. An appealing display of long animals, and simple tactical decisions are the highlights of this visit to Langland.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The outcome is a more player friendly product. Blood sweat and tears have gone into the making of it and its&rsquo; expansions, and on the battle field your forces will fight blood sweat and tears in grasping a victory.<br/><br/>OSC is not just a modern war game, this is a system for you (the player) to have fun with.<br/><br/>Part one is to get you into action on a skirmish level and learn the nuts and bolts of the basic game.<br/><br/>OSC is designed for friendly rather than competitive play.<br/><br/>With OSC you can experience some fun games with, what feels like realistic forces, using the points to balance out the numbers.<br/><br/>If players wish to form killer forces to win games, then they have missed the main point of this game. The challenge in this game is making the right choices on what actions you take, in what order and how you do them.<br/><br/>OSC is a game of cunning tactics, for those still wanting to create a competitive scene.<br/><br/>Oscar Sierra Charlie puts you straight in the front line of gripping battles. <br/>This is combat at the cutting edge; individual and squad-level action, desperate missions to capture key objectives, with victory going to best tactical mind.<br/><br/>OSC&rsquo;s mechanics are deliberately streamlined for fast-paced tactical play. <br/>Straightforward stat lines are augmented by a plethora of skills, options and tactics. <br/>At its heart a player-driven rules system, no two games of OSC will be the same. Your troops will stand and fight at your command &ndash; their fate and that of the mission is wholly in your hands!<br/><br/>The game world of Oscar Sierra Charlie is one of gritty modern warfare at its core. But it is also far more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After all, powerful diesel engines propel them as fast, if not faster, than many escort ships in a convoy when surfaced.<br/><br/>The bonus for a submarine is, of course, being able to vanish by diving, hiding from escorts to ambush the merchantmen at will.<br/><br/>The disadvantage of being submerged is the slow speed and the fact you are often blind to what is going on at the surface, that&rsquo;s when the game of cat and mouse begins!<br/><br/>Run Silent, Run Deep is an unofficial expansion to Cruel Seas that expands upon the submarine rules presented in the core book. Track the depth and position of your submarine with a series of easy to read markers. Send your opponent off on a wild goose chase, haring after shadows and transients while your submarine slips through his defensive line to attack lumbering merchantmen.<br/><br/>While games on the surface are a breakneck affair with chattering cannons and exploding shells, Run Silent, Run Deep is a game of stealth and patience - building to a nail-biting finale when escort and submarine clash one-on-one.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

How to play &ndash; Each card is worth a certain number of points which accumulate as you play them onto the table. At the start of your turn take a card from the draw pile or discard pile (your choice), if you can make a set or runs then play them onto the table in front of you.<br/>A set is three or four cards showing the same career or house but in different colours. A run is three or more consecutively numbered cards of the same colour. If you can add cards to another players set or run on the table during your turn. <br/>You need to play all the cards from you hand as quickly as possible to score life points, that&rsquo;s why it is worth adding to other players sets and runs.

The game includes almost 100 cards designed by Diego Flower Boscolo. Each player impersonates one of the rappers of the Machete crew: SALMO, NITRO, DJ SLAIT, JACK THE SMOKER, RASTY KILO, KILL MAURI and HELL RATON. Between albums to produce, scandals and hits, build the Pyramid of the Machete Empire, block the climbs of your opponents and become the King of the music world. Your goal in the game is to become a successful rapper, expanding your empire. The first to complete his Empire pyramid, placing the tenth card on top of the pyramid, wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>     Create a draw deck shuffling together the Empire and Performance cards.<br/>     Every player chooses/gets a member of the Machete crew and collect the respective starting money and resources.<br/>     Every player as starting hand draws 4 cards (the order does not matter)<br/><br/><br/>Round 4-phases:<br/><br/>     Every player draws a cards from the draw deck.<br/>     Everyone chooses a card to reveal at the same time, then players can take their turn in order, based on the card's initiative value.

This is determined by 6 castle pieces being drawn from the stack. When the last one is drawn the game ends.<br/><br/>Dragons can be good or bad. An awake dragon takes one of your complete knights away. Whereas if you draw a sleepy dragon then you can claim all the knights that have been taken away previously.<br/><br/>",

There may or may not be a real Grue out there, so it&rsquo;s best to shore up your defences and keep it at bay. A true tale of childhood and cowardice, presented as a dice-rolling geometric puzzle with various scenarios.<br/><br/>A pen/pencil and four six-sided dice are required. This solo game is played on one printed-out page that presents an 11x11 grid and trackers for Fear, Flashlight, Time, Structures, and Re-Rolls.<br/><br/>Each hour of the Night represents one round where you will take two build actions. The four dice are rolled and separated strategically to target co-ordinates between (2,2) and (12,12). By putting up blankets, cushions, cords and clothespins between the furniture, you try to protect yourself from winds arriving from different directions each round. If the chill wind has any path to reach your character, it creeps up your spine and raises your fear level. If you make it to 6am without letting your fear build up, you have outwitted the Grue and can tally your score.<br/><br/>You are encouraged to play each scenario and aim to achieve the highest medal scores. There are 5 Nights that take place in different rooms. Some rooms have special rules such as the flashlight batteries hidden in the office or the collapsing old furniture in the basement.<br/><br/>",

Played on an off set square grid (you can use hexes if you prefer) the game has an original combat system that uses both luck, skill and bluff. Players each have a set of 5 dice, and the innovative combat system uses concealed dice rolls as the players attempt to outscore their opponents using holds and re-rolls based on the gladiator&rsquo;s skill level. The game covers all the known gladiator types who fought each other from the simple secutor with a shield to gladiators with whips and lassos. Record keeping is simple and kept to a minimum. The rules include a straight forward career progression system for both individual gladiators or training schools. Ideal for a quick game in an evening or a prolonged campaign over several meetings. As with all &quot;Wargaming for Grown Ups&quot; rules they include a comprehensive Quick Reference Sheet on the back cover.<br/><br/>Includes full list of gladiator types and details, player records sheets and proforma arena grids.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kreigspeil (sic) is a game played with miniatures, but not using a standard type of miniatures rules. It is played on a board with a square grid; a board layout is provided (which needs to be replicated on a 3'x5' surface), but others could be devised. There are always two sides; with more than two players each side is controlled by a team.<br/><br/>Players choose their forces using a points system and set up in secret. After that players alternate turns; on a turn a player may move all of their units according to their movement allowances and then may play a bonus card for additional movement. Firing is conducted afterwards. Players have five minutes to complete each turn.<br/><br/>Bonus cards are drawn from a standard 52-card deck; players start with a hand of these, get a new one each turn, and get more for things such as having remaining time on their turns, capturing certain regions, etc. Most of the cards are used for additional movement but aces are used for additional cannon shots.<br/><br/>Combat is conducted using dice.<br/><br/>Victory is assessed by points: points are awarded for capturing sectors of the board (the 6x6 squares) and specific board features, with additional points awarded for killed enemy units.<br/><br/>Optional rules are provided for hospitals and corpsmen, and a set of &quot;Junior Battle&quot; rules is provided for younger players.<br/><br/>",

Explore uncharted space, board derelict freighters, land on ringworlds and other amazing locations &mdash; all while being hunted by an alien dreadnought intent on your destruction. The fate of your ship and her crew lies in your hands!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you name your ship, choose its loadout, and pick the bridge crew. They will encounter awesome galactic horrors and fight battles in space as well as on the surfaces of strange alien planets. The game features a negotiation system so that you can attempt to talk your way out of sticky situations using translator tech, rather than always relying on your fusion pistol sidearm, although it's nice to have a backup plan.<br/><br/>The game includes more than thirty maps of derelict starships, ringworlds, and exoplanet surfaces, and while primarily a solitaire game, Where Humans Don't Belong also provides rules for a two-player co-operative experience.<br/><br/>",

In this game, the player helms the Tritus and sails across a treacherous ocean to find treasure, combat fearsome monsters of the deep, and protect (or plunder!) towns that dot the seascape. With multiple maps and starting conditions, each game offers a unique adventuring experience. And to play again, simply erase the board (or print out a new one) and start sailing!<br/><br/>In each turn, the player rolls dice and, using a unique movement mechanic, plots a course across the map. When that course encounters a monster, island, or another ship, the player resolves a combat, discovers treasure, or perhaps repairs damage. The captain's log allows the player to track resources and encounters as well as the current level of Danger. By carefully managing damage to the ship and keeping the cannons fully stocked, the player just may survive until the end of the game.<br/><br/>After the final turn, the player scores victory points based on both the resolved encounters but also on the Motivation chosen at the start of the game. Each Motivation scores encounters differently and also offers a unique bonus. As an Adventurer, Protector, or Plunderer, the total score will determine whether Zemo gains the glory he quests for. Or will he end up in a forgotten watery grave?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Magic: The Gathering - The Precursors is a cooperative board game and card variant of the classic, competitive card game that has players work together in an epic campaign that can span several gaming sessions. It utilizes a slightly altered Commander (EDH) format of MTG.<br/><br/>Similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a Dungeon Master &mdash; or a Game Master (GM), in this case &mdash; guides up to four other players on a series of six quests, each of which takes about two to three hours to complete.<br/><br/>The players start in one of the zones. If it&rsquo;s the Red zone, they&rsquo;ll be facing a Red or Multicoloured commander; the Blue zone, they&rsquo;ll be facing a Blue or Multicoloured commander; etc. Each quest features a new enemy deck, so no two quests are ever the same.<br/><br/>The GM is given certain card and life advantages over the Precursor heroes, and it is the goal of the Precursors to defeat the GM while working together. Also of note is that the game allows the GM to also play as one of the heroes if they&rsquo;re up to it. This means that the game supports up to five players.<br/><br/>The game is quite affordable as it allows cards from every single MTG set. The players make their decks with whatever cards they want to use, a single commander (Legendary Creature) overseeing the army of cards.<br/><br/>The board game consists of five different phases, two of which are almost identical to traditional duels. The game&rsquo;s pretty simple to learn for veteran Magic players, and not much more difficult than the card game itself for new Magic players.<br/><br/>NOTE: This game is unofficial, of course.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When answering the question, a player needs to think of an answer that goes beyond a simple yes or no.  For example, a contestant may be asked &quot;Do you like ice hockey?&quot;  An appropriate response could be &quot;More than baseball&quot;.

The tile revealed will then either have the player draw and resolve an event card, or draw a dinosaur from a threat level bag of the same level.<br/><br/>Five dice are then rolled to determine successes at events and capture attempts.

        "description": "Can you spell faster than your opponents by grabbing the correct vowel piece? Can you lay down correct vowel cards or spot matching vowels faster than your opponents? Or maybe the only way to win is by yelling&hellip;AIEOU! (pronounced as AY-YO)<br/><br/>AIEOU is an educational spelling game that incorporates multisensory elements. Playable in 4 different ways, AIEOU offers 4 different games catered to children from as young as 7 years of age to adults. Each game stimulates different faculties such as hand &amp; eye coordination, mental &amp; physical reflexes, analytics and memory. The 4 games are as listed below:<br/><br/>i) Grab It!<br/>It&rsquo;s helter-skelter in Grab It!  Players rush to be the first to grab a specific missing vowel in the word of a played card. But beware! If that missing vowel matches the top vowel card on the deck, yell AIEOU (pronounced as AY-YO) instead! Player with the most cards wins. Grab It! sharpens a player&rsquo;s eye, hand and mental coordination as it combines picture-word recognition and spelling with logic deduction and motor reflexes.<br/><br/>ii) Speed Spells<br/>Picture playing musical chairs&hellip;but through spelling! In Speed Spells, players race to lay down correct vowel cards to spell out the word of a played card before grabbing any vowel piece for themselves. However, the last player to do this is left without a vowel piece to grab and is penalised with the card instead. Player with the least cards wins. Speed Spells combines picture-word recognition and spelling with fast physical reflexes in an exciting and fun manner.<br/><br/>iii) Match&rsquo;em!<br/>What do you get when you combine the classic game of Snap with spelling? Out comes Match&rsquo;em! In this game, players try to identify matching vowels in played out cards. When a match occurs, players rush to grab a centre vowel piece. The player who manages this wins the pile of cards that have the matching sets of cards on top of them. Player with the most cards wins. Match&rsquo;em! stimulates players to quickly observe and analyse played out words.<br/><br/>iv) Memory Buzz<br/>Can your mind stop buzzing around and focus on memorising? In Memory Buzz, players attempt to memorise not only the objects of the played cards, but also the number and sequence of each object. A player can be challenged by shouting out AIEOU if he or she is caught recalling objects wrongly. Player with the least cards wins. This game trains players to focus and memorise in a fun-filled way!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a rare game of advertising that was apparently released by an advertising agency.<br/>Each player represents an ad agency of which there are 3 types (market oriented, heavy service and creative). The type can impact the ability to get certain types of accounts.<br/><br/>The board is a layout of Manhattan with players starting at Grand Central Station. Each city block is a square (actually a rectangle as it represents the short and long blocks in Manhattan from 42nd to 56th and from York to 5th Ave). The blocks contain the name of prospective advertising accounts with an entrance on one street or a Fluke. Movement is in any direction but must follow the one way streets.<br/><br/>When landing on Fluke you draw a card. When landing on an account you may solicit the account by drawing a card based on whether the account already has an ad agency. The odds of getting the account are 50/50 if it has no agency and 1/3 of stealing an account. You can protect your accounts from being stolen by adding a &quot;creative team&quot; (Spend more money when winning the account and make less when getting commission since you have to pay the team).<br/><br/>Accounts have names based on real companies such as Croke, Hineykins Beer, Sunka Coffee and you can never have 2 accounts for similar products at the same time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Whether you&rsquo;re Democrat, Republican or somewhere in the middle, Deplorables The Game is a bipartisan election game we can all play together. To win, players will have to buy Democrat, Republican and Bipartisan political cards to accumulate 270 electoral votes. But beware, this game is fraught with dangers like Drain The Swamp and FBI Investigations!<br/><br/>Here's how the game works:<br/><br/>&bull;Players start the game choosing either a Democrat or Republican candidate with a matching Endorsement Card and $1,200 to fund their campaign.<br/><br/>&bull;The first political twist comes in the player&rsquo;s choice to purchase Obamacare or not, which affects game play down the road, because players that opt out can be penalized. Players must then roll dice, land on a space, and buy the matching political card worth 20 electoral votes. The bipartisan spaces, like the CIA or Women&rsquo;s March space, are worth more electoral votes &ndash; so try to buy those first!<br/><br/><br/>&bull;The spinner allows players to move the voter token around the wheel in the center of the board for extra goodies. Players can get cash, bonus points or are empowered to &ldquo;Drain The Swamp,&rdquo; stealing two political cards from an opponent.<br/><br/>&bull;Players can also receive Kremlin Cash to help fund their campaign, but might find themselves the subject of an FBI investigation down the road, losing $500 and two political cards.<br/><br/>&bull;The October Surprise Win: The final stage of the game is the October Surprise. This occurs when all the political spaces are owned, and there is nothing left to buy. Whenever a &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; is triggered on the board, the two players with the least number of electoral votes are forced to roll off against each. The player with the lowest roll is eliminated from in the game. This continues until one player has enough votes to win or is the last player standing.<br/><br/>",

A 9x9 grid is laid out for players to take a minute (literally, it's in the rules) to memorize the location of all similar icons.<br/><br/>A community rainbow deck is then drawn one by one for players to lay the drawn card in front of the row they recall that icon being in. This community deck also has switch cards allowing players to manipulate the location of cards in the grid.<br/><br/>After the community deck is depleted, players have a personal deck they use to play the drawn card directly on top of the card int he grid they believe shares the same icon.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players will earn points for their correct placements and can lose points for incorrect placements.

For the individual participant, it is important to guess the correct answer with as few clues as possible. The fewer clues you use, the more fields you can  move. For each correct answer, you can either move your own piece forward on the game board, or perhaps choose to move your opponent back. The one who gets around the record the fastest has won.<br/><br/>",

Use multiple boxes when playing with more than 2 players.<br/><br/>Deal 10 Kosmos (starter) cards to each player. This is their draw pile, placed in their play area.<br/><br/>Give each player a Dominance card and place it with the Cortadoo logo facing up.<br/><br/>Shuffle all Sins cards together face-down, from the box sets of your choice. Place the cards in the center of the table to form the Realm.<br/><br/>Each player draws a card from the top of the Realm. The highest card-number is the active player (repeat if there is a tie). Destroy these cards. Destroyed cards are placed back in the box.<br/><br/>Then, draw 5 cards from the top of the Realm, into the center of the table, face-up.<br/><br/>All players draw 5 starting cards into their hand from their draw pile (this is their hand limit).<br/><br/>The active player starts the game and takes their first turn.<br/>How to win<br/>When a player reaches two dominance, that player wins the game and the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>You get dominance by resolving opposing despair in the Status phase, and you give despair by attacking your opponents in the Attack phase.<br/><br/>The Dominance card in front of each player has numbers from zero to three. If you&rsquo;d like to play a longer game, you can optionally play until a player reaches three dominance. For a short (coffee break) game, play for one dominance.<br/><br/>",

Then, you must turn the roulette wheel. If the pointer stops at of the colored boxes, the player with the card reads the question with the corresponding color on the card and, at the end of the statement read, asks: &ldquo;Fact or fake? &rdquo;.<br/><br/>If the player gets it right, he gets the card. If he misses, the card goes to a lot of discard.<br/><br/>Attention: If the pointer stops over the &ldquo;CHALLENGE&rdquo; box, the player must point any player, according to his strategy, to respond.<br/>If the chosen player gets it right, he keeps the card; if he misses, the player who challenged him stays with her.<br/>But wait! Do you think it's easy? If the roulette stops on the &ldquo;AZAR&rdquo; box, the player must answer 2 questions to keep the card. For example: If he hits the first and misses the second, he will be forced to hit the third to keep the card. If you miss 2 questions, the letter goes to lot of disposal.<br/><br/>The next one on the left removes a card from the pile on the board, advances one square and repeats the process.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player reaches the final square. At that point, all players count their cards. Win that one that got it right and, consequently, has more cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How would you have fared as one Napoleon's marshals, or in command of a division of redoutable British redcoats under Wellington? Grand Battery offers you the chance to find out. This book includes all the rules you need to play miniature wargames set in the Napoleonic Wars, plus plenty of useful background information you need to get started.<br/><br/>There is a concise historical overview of the events and battles of the period, as well as sections on the weapons and tactics of the various armies. The buyer's guide gives an up-to-date survey of the wealth of ranges of miniatures available and advice on which are compatible with which. Organizational tables give a breakdown of typical formations for all the major combatants and most of the minor ones (any one for a Wurttemburg infantry division?), allowing you to structure your collection and also to organize hypothetical games quickly with 'off the peg' orders of battle. Three historical scenarios are also included, each with their own specific orders of battle, maps, objectives and victory conditions.<br/><br/>The rules themselves, which utilize an innovative card-driven turn sequence to simulate the unpredictable ebb and flow of battle, are designed for playability, while still giving 'realistic' results and rewarding sound tactics. Though designed primarily for division level games with 25 or 15mm figures, the command and control sysyem takes account of corps or even the largest army level games and they are easily adaptable to any figure scale.<br/><br/>Get ready to march to the sound of the guns!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is available free as a Print 'n' Play game to download.<br/><br/>Two Samurais duel, using basic movement cards and two special attacks each round. The duel continues, round after round, until one of the Samurai succumbs to their wounds.<br/><br/>The players take a basic deck of six cards, and two special cards from a set of five. Players set up the duelling positions, with the Samurai initially being two steps apart, and then each secretly chooses a hand card face-down. When they are ready, the cards are turned up.<br/><br/>The basic cards involve the Samurai advancing or retreating, and adopting different stances. If the Samurai move close enough together, and onto the same spot, then a strike might happen. But the Samurai switch between being in a Standing stance, and a Ready stance. So an attack can only be made when the Samurai is Ready, otherwise the player falls back to Standing.<br/><br/>Basic attacks can be made repeatedly, the card goes back to the player's hand when used. But the Special card attacks are used only once a round, and then discarded.<br/><br/>A round ends when a successful strike is made, and damage is shown on the attacking card. The player struck loses hit points. The decks are re-sorted and the players gain two Special cards again.<br/><br/>The first player to lose all their health loses the duel.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Migong is a two-player territory game played on the 126 brown spaces (cells) of the initially empty hexagonal board shown above.<br/><br/>The two players are called Blue and Yellow. Each player has access to 63 cell-sized hexagonal pieces made of six equilateral triangles each. Each player's set of pieces includes all combinations of at least one triangle of their color and at most five triangles of the opponent's color. Pieces have a fixed orientation and are never rotated or flipped during play. Any pattern of triangles that would result from rotating or flipping a piece is represented by another piece.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA wedge is one of the six triangular portions of a piece.<br/><br/>A group is a wedge along with all other wedges one could reach from it through a series of steps between like-colored wedges sharing an edge with one another. Thus, all wedges in a group are the same color, and a group may include wedges from different pieces.<br/><br/>A group's extent is the number of pieces that contribute wedges to it.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlue plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, place a piece from your set on an empty cell. Wedges from different pieces sharing an edge must be the same color. Likewise, a wedge must be the same color as any board edge sharing an edge with it, including the cell-like border in the center.<br/><br/>If you have no moves available, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. Your score is the biggest group extent in which you have the greater number of groups. If there is no such size, your score is zero. If both players are tied at zero points, whoever made the last move loses.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means Yellow will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

Players build three numerical sequences from their hand - the archer&rsquo;s bow, archer&rsquo;s arrow and archer&rsquo;s heart - laying them down on the table as they are achieved. Sequences of all one color or without wild cards are more valuable. Players can disrupt one another&rsquo;s sequences with thieves - stealing cards right out from underneath their opponents. Players need good judgement to weigh the odds, strategic cunning to go for speed or purity, and bit of luck to see them through.

Each player is a different pet lizard which has got free from its tank in the game designer's home (the game title means 'escape master'). They run around the rooms and try to catch insects. The first lizard to get a set of insects is the winner.<br/><br/>The game designer (who breeds pet lizards) describes the game as a mix of roll &amp; move and Old Maid, in that the lizards follow paths around, and steal cards off each other akin to Old Maid.<br/><br/>However, the game does not use dice. Instead, players choose a numbered card from their hand in secret, reveal it and advance as far as they wish up to the number. The lowest numbers go first.<br/><br/>Players follow paths around the different rooms in the home, and try to catch insects in the rooms or collect useful objects (by drawing cards). If a player gets into a room with another lizard, they can steal a card from the other player's hand. But some cards are also traps.<br/><br/>The pet owner is also moving about, and if a player ends up in the same room, they cannot move or they will be caught.

        "description": "In this fast moving 2-4 player tile game you compete to complete large triangular 'frames' using four smaller triangular tiles to score.<br/><br/>Each triangular tile has a number in each corner (1, 2 or 3). The corners of the four tiles must match each other when they go into the large frame.<br/><br/>A players turn consists of two parts: completing frame(s) and scoring.<br/><br/>To complete their frames, a player either 'draws' two facedown tiles from the tilepile or 'swipes' one faceup tile from another players uncompleted frames. A swiped tile gets a 'swipe token' put on it to keep it from being swiped by another player. Each player only has two swipe tokens to work with, so be judicious on the swiping.<br/><br/>Scoring is done once a frame has all four tiles placed in it. That makes it 'complete', and the tiles become un-swipe-able. The player moves their completed frame to the center of the table to corner match with other frames already in the center. The numbers in the center of the matched edge do not need to match, but there is a bonus if they do. Once a frame is moved to the center, any swipe pawns are retrieved by the player to be used again later.<br/><br/>The game is over at the end of the turn when the tilepile is emptied. Each player subtracts one point for every tile infront of them in uncompleted frames. High score wins.<br/><br/>Strategy hints:<br/>Generally it is better to draw than swipe unless you are completing a frame.<br/><br/>If you are way ahead on points, it is better to draw down the tilepile to bring the game to an end.<br/><br/>Frames are scored on the corner numbers, so when possible put your higher numbers in the corner of the frame.<br/><br/>Always be building your frames with an eye on the frames in the center of the table. It does you no good to complete a frame if there is no place to put it and score.<br/><br/>There are six of each of the eleven unique tiles. Towards the end of the game you can look around to see whether the tile you really need is still in the tilepile, or whether you need to swipe it from another player.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wizards of Mickey Gioco di Carte Collezionabili is a brand new Collectible Card Game licensed by Disney. It has been published in italian only in February 2008.<br/>Inspired by Disney comic books &quot;Wizards of Mickey&quot;, in this game all-time popular Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, but also popular villains like Pet-Leg-Pete, Magica De Spell, the Beagle Boys (for the first time-ever with names!), and the arch-villain Phantom Blot are all there, but with many new twist (an &quot;evil&quot; Mickey Mouse? a real self-determined Minnie or Daisy that will save the day? Pluto as a were-dog?).<br/>The game is an easy to learn collectible game, very fast (10-15 minutes for a single match), Teams of three wizards will challenge each other in magical castles, to obtain &quot;diamagics&quot; (magical gems that can also activate mage powers sometime). First team to grab 6 diamagics wins. Sounds easy? It is, but the game is deeper than it seems at a first glance!<br/>Beautiful Disney artworks illustrate a set of over 150 cards.<br/><br/>",

You must lay low for a week and guard your take; there's no honor amongst thieves here, and everyone wants the most they can get. Plus, rumors are there's a snake in your midst that might be out to get the prize jewel for themselves, and a rat could be trying to foil the whole operation.Each player will be dealt a random crew card to tell you what your part in this band of thieves is. These are not hidden from other players, since teamwork is dreamwork, after all. Each person brings their own unique talent, or specialty, to the crew, usable throughout the game. You will also be given a random role card, possibly giving you a secret double agent part to play. These should not be shared and will affect how you can win the game. There are four regular crew member cards, one snake card, and one rat card. As with any squad, the more people you bring in, the likelier it is to have defectors.<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of seven rounds, or days. Every day will begin with players taking turns to choose their actions for the day by placing a token on the box next to the action of their choice. For morning actions, you will use the numbers on your crew cards to determine turn order. After that, turn order is based on the last round's actions going from top to bottom on the action card in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Your goal, as the thief you are, is to hoodwink your way through the week, exchanging loot with players and the score to end up with the best take for yourself. Don't get too greedy, though! If you end up with more than the score, your zealousness will be shown, and the crew will take you out. The prized diamond is also supposed to be shared, so any crew member holding it at the end will mark you for an early demise, as well. Additionally, the bank loaded a tracker into the loot that will get you caught and disqualified if you're holding it at the end.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The small geographic location and the addition of subsidiaries, operating costs, and the looming shadow of the LPTB are some of the main features that set it apart.<br/><br/>Each turn players can open new, or buy/sell shares in existing companies. These companies expand their underground network by laying track and running trains to generate revenue. This can be paid as dividends to share holders or retained to purchase new trains and cover expenses.<br/><br/>The end of the game occurs when either the last train is purchased or only one company remains. At this point the player with the highest personal wealth in cash and assets wins. With no luck involved, success is found through careful planning, shrewd decisions and ruthless actions.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On November 19, 1942, while the main force of the German Army Group B was concentrated in Stalingrad, three Soviet armies launched an offensive against the Romanian units that were defending both flanks. This was the launch of Operation Uranus, aimed at encircling and destroying the German 6th Army. In response, the next day Hitler sent Erich von Manstein of the 11th Army, which was preparing to attack Leningrad, south to lead the rescue of Stalingrad. On the 21st Paulus of the 6th Army was ordered to defend Stalingrad &mdash; because Goering had assured that the Luftwaffe would provide the necessary supplies, and he waited for Manstein to come to the rescue.<br/><br/>The rescue operation, dubbed the &quot;Unternehmen Wintergewitter&quot;, began on December 12. Although the advance was brisk immediately after the start of the offensive, the speed of the advance slowed down due to the reinforcements from the Soviet forces that kept coming. The Soviet forces diverted the troops that were to be used in Operation Saturn in an attempt to prevent Manstein from breaking the siege. Still in the lead, the 6th Armored Division came within 50 km of friendly forces in Stalingrad on the 19th.<br/><br/>If the 6th Army had broken through the siege at that time, it might have been able to escape the siege by attacking from outside and inside. However, Hitler did not allow the 6th Army to conduct Operation &quot;Thunderclap&quot;. In the end, Manstein's relief force, which had reached the limit of its strength, was repulsed by the Soviet forces, and it was routed to the starting line of the offensive by the end of December.<br/><br/>On to Stalingrad: Unternehmen Wintergewitter is a two-player wargame based on Operation Winter Thunderclap. One player is in charge of the Axis armies (German and Romanian) and the other player is in charge of the Soviet army.<br/><br/><br/>Issue game of Banzai Magazine EX #5.<br/><br/>",

With the information of the drawn cards drawn by each other, I wonder how to deal with the hand. It solves the problem that if you are completely lucky, it is just gambling, and if it is abstract, the one who is accustomed to the game tends to be unilaterally beaten / beaten.<br/><br/>二人用。中身一緒の相手プレイヤーの手札から1枚を引き、自分の手札から一枚を追加して合計数の大きさ比べをしますが、4が混じった場合のみ、大小の強弱が逆転、というシンプルなルールです。<br/><br/>　読み合いゲームのお手本。読み合いはこういうのでいいんだよこういうので！　カウンティング出来ると強いけど、引き運の部分もほどほどにある。お互いに引いた引かれたカードの情報がある中で、手札とどうやりくりするかを悩む。完全に運だとただのギャンブルだし、アブストラクトだとどちらかゲーム慣れしている方が一方的に殴る/殴られるゲームになりがちなのをうまく解決しています。<br/><br/>",

In japan, Jitsumeihodo means 'real name reporting' and is the somewhat controversial practise of identify people in news coverage by their real names.<br/><br/>The game has a deck of 60 cards, 30 being the real names of people, and 30 showing a colour photo of the person. On the back of the photos is the same photo min B&amp;W and a short text explaining what crime they were arrested for. For example, a popular comedian caught with cocaine, or a hit-and-run driver.<br/><br/>The 30 photo cards are shuffled and laid out randomly on the table, showing only the colour photo side. The deck of names is shuffled up and placed in the middle, so the first name can be read out.<br/><br/>Players try to match up the correct name to the face. However, this is difficult since the people are generally known by a public name, not by their real name.<br/><br/>The game can be played solitaire.<br/><br/>Like many Loserdogs games, the game is sold in a large ziplocked bag with minimal production. The cardstock is thin but playable.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "マーブル (MABR) is a word game from Japan. The 70 card deck has English letters on one side, and corresponding Hiragana on the other. With all the hiragana (including the dakuon and semi-voiced sounds) and the first letter of the romanised form (a for a, k for ki) written on both sides.<br/><br/>There are three different ways to play with the cards.<br/><br/>1) ガサゴソアルファベット Rustle Alphabet<br/>Players put the cards spread out on the table, with the side with the roman alphabet facing up. Players choose a theme and have a limited amount of time to collect cards to make up words in Japanese that are associated with the theme. Players take up cards to make a word, seeing the Hiragana side.<br/><br/>For example, if the theme is 'summer', then players could make japanese words like すいか (watermelon), ひまわり (sunflower), ぼんおどり (bon odori), うちわ (uchiwa) and so on. But players can only see the roman letters on the table and there is only one card for each Hiragana. So if a player uses the R card for the Hiragana り (ri) in sunflower, then another player will not be able to complete 'bon odori'.<br/><br/>2) スリーレターズ Three Letters<br/>The deck is shuffled and players are dealt three hand cards. Players hold their cards with the roman alphabet facing out to the other players.<br/><br/>In turn, players draw one card from the deck, and discard one card from their hand. A player is trying to get to a Japanese word using the Hiragana that they see. Once they have a word, they declare, and other players have 20 seconds to guess the word they've made from seeing the roman letters.<br/><br/>For example, if the player is showing KNK as their three cards, is their word きのこ (mushroom), or きんこ (Kinko), or こんき (Konki)?<br/><br/>3) もやもやメモリーズ Misty Memories<br/>This is a team game played in 2 v 2 or 3 v 3.<br/><br/>Players are at a reunion, having a nice conversation. However, it's been a long time, and memories are hazy. Try to get through it with a reasonable answer!<br/><br/>Players use the cards they have been dealt to compose word using all the vowel sounds, AEIOU. The theme is decided by the letters on top of the deck, such as N &rarr; &quot;The moment I wanted to cry&quot;. Then one team asks the other team to tell a story, using the roman letters to make a word key to the story. For example &quot;Tell us about that time when you really wanted to cry. It was about... TKS!&quot; The challenged team has to reach into their memories, and recount a story using a Japanese word formed from TKS and vowels. If they can make up a good story, they get awarded points.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The youngest player draws an inspiration card and, immediately after, a letter card. He places them in the center of the table, clearly visible to all players. Then turn the hourglass: each player has the task, in the time of the hourglass, to write on his blackboard a meaningful sentence containing at least one subject represented in the inspiration card. One point is counted for each word in the sentence that begins with the letter drawn. One point is subtracted from this sum for each word that does not have the required initial. If, while composing a sentence, you come to a net of 5 words with the same initial, the score doubles. The game continues with another round of play (the player to the right of the last one draws the inspiration card and the letter card, and so on...). The winner is the one who reaches, first, the score of 35 points (or more, as chosen by the players before starting the game).<br/><br/>",

Lost more than 300 years ago to a powerful convergence storm, Aldarra was left uninhabitable. Centuries later, the chaotic magical energies began to finally subside. Now, Aldarra is being claimed by those seeking wealth, land, and power. Suddenly, nations from all over Sordane&rsquo;s largest continent, Bordair, are sending fleets out. The first to stake their claim will reap the benefits; the power, the advancement, the riches, but who will emerge victorious?<br/><br/>In Aldarra, you play as one of four mighty factions, warring for control of this long lost nation. Each Faction has its strengths, and its history, within the lore of Bordair. 3-4 players will select their faction and take as many paths as they can to emerge the new rulers of Aldarra. <br/>Use your fleets to exterminate your opponents. Complete secondary objectives and build up victory points as you venture forth from your stronghold to explore new territories, expand your control. Manage and extract the resources and Sordalite crystals you need to grow, replenish, and upgrade your forces. Strategically use the unique abilities of your faction to out maneuver your opponents, and gain control of this magical land.<br/><br/>Aldarra will feature over 150 massive and finely detailed minis,randomly generated hex tile maps and variable starting positions that demand dynamic tactics from turn one and ensure no two games are the same.<br/><br/>",

On their turn, players chose whether to cast a ghost from either their own area or a shared area space. Ghosts can be casted in any diagonal direction.<br/><br/>When casting, a player will pick up all ghosts currently on that area space. The player then choses a direction and puts one ghost marker on each space proceeding straight in that direction until they have used up all the ghost markers.<br/><br/>If a player finishes casting and the last ghost marker lands in his or her own Safe Area, the player may take this single ghost marker and place it off the board to be used for Reincarnation.<br/><br/>After finishing this Capture step, the player may then choose whether to use Reincarnation or Store. By using Reincarnation, the player will draw a card with a bonus written on it. Reincarnation rewards the player with a bonus but if the player Stores their captured ghosts, they can trigger an even bigger Reincarnation bonus later in the game.<br/><br/>The bonus enables the player to cast again and chase away more ghosts from their area. However, players should be careful not to chase away too many ghosts which could result in limited choices. Instead, they should strategize to chain the bonus events together so that they can win in one fell swoop. At the end of a round, remove any ghosts that remain in either player&rsquo;s Safe Area.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.<br/><br/>To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.<br/><br/>Jungle Speed Electronique keeps the familiar game play elements from Jungle Speed: Players reveal cards from their individual stacks one at a time, and whenever two players have identical cards face-up in front of themselves, they race to grab the totem first. Whoever does so gives his cards to the slowpoke. The first player to rid himself of cards wins.<br/><br/>What's new in the electronic version of this game is the totem will give you directions from time to time that change the nature of game play &ndash; some of which might lead you into doing the wrong thing! Jungle Speed Electronique includes three levels of game play with a dozen special actions programmed into the totem.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Creative Kids&quot; is a collection of simple educational games in a 'Print and Play' format for use at school/daycare/home. The set consists of:<br/>-Tetrigo- stacking blocks based on the rules of the game tetris.Each player places blocks (which are determined by a dice roll) on their board in such a way as to cover the scoring fields. The player with the highest sum of points wins<br/><br/>-Seal- guide a seal through a section of the ocean.The player chooses what kind of movement the seal has to make on the board (which are disposable), along the way it has to avoid dangers and collect points in the form of fish. The player who earns the most points wins<br/><br/>-Hello Autumn- collecting leaves in autumn<br/>Players assign dice values to a puzzle that must meet certain values. They receive points for meeting the condition (e.g., an even sum of dice, greater than a given number, etc.). The player with the highest point total wins<br/><br/>-Bee home- a puzzle about creating a bee route to the hive.<br/>The player arranges a travel route for 3 bees of different colors from random pieces. The player who arranges the route first wins<br/><br/>-Block Craft - extracting resources from a mine.Players draw a pit shape which they then draw on their choice of 6 pit maps. This way they extract treasures while avoiding weak points that can collapse the mine. The player who has the highest treasure score at the end of the game wins<br/><br/>-Just Run- a dog race on an obstacle course<br/>Players roll two D6 dice. They choose one of the results and move their character by that many spaces on the map. In this way they earn points and collect sets. Getting to the finish line first also gives a big point bonus. The player with the highest amount of points at the end of the game wins the game<br/><br/>-Impostor- find hidden on the map space traitors.One player secretly marks the position of the 3 astronauts. The other players use 10 questions to try to guess the position of each astronaut. Players who guess correctly are awarded points. Then they switch roles. The player who gets the most points wins the game<br/><br/>-Bowling snap- Players draw the path of the bowling ball. Then they cut it out and put it on the board scoring bonus points and penalties. After 5 courses, the player with the highest sum of points wins<br/><br/>-Pixel People- Players draw a task then arrange the human elements (heads, torso, legs, shoes) into a whole human. Each element has a point value, the goal is to create a man who will have the same value as the task. We arrange 3 people as quickly as possible, the player who does it first wins the game<br/><br/>-My farm- Each turn, players roll a pool of 6 D6 dice. These resources serve as currency with which they buy and improve animals living on the farm, build fences. Some animals can only live in an enclosure with certain others. Each animal gives a certain number of points. The player who has the highest point total at the end wins<br/><br/>-Seeker - Each player gets a board with 100 drawings labeled with numbers. One player chooses a picture and describes it, the rest of the players have to give the number of the picture as quickly as possible, the first one who does that gets a point. After 10 turns we count the points and the player who scored the highest amount wins<br/><br/>The games form a coherent set, outside of which they are not accessible in any way. Each of them contains some educational element and they are designed for children 5+<br/><br/>",

Players take turns selecting an epsilon card from a display and asking another player whether their function produces the result true or false for that card. The object is to be the first to deduce another player's function.<br/><br/>There are also two &quot;pregames&quot; to get players used to Boolean functions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the Jihad, Inner Sphere border worlds were no longer easy pickings for Periphery pirate bands. Instead, they returned their attention to the Periphery&rsquo;s weaker nations. The nascent military and non-existent intelligence assets of the Fronc Reaches made the young nation a particularly tempting target. Opposing them were the Colonial Marshals, who risked everything to permanently drive the pirates from their worlds, but faced vastly superior numbers. Would the campaign be the dawn of a new nation, or the twilight of the Marshals?<br/><br/>Operational Turning Points: Fronc Reaches gives players the chance to recreate this desperate struggle for the very survival of a young nation. This campaign uses the Chaos Campaign and Alpha Strike rules in concert to allow players to fight individual Missions and Touchpoints, follow a campaign arc, or inserting the Marshals&rsquo; bold plan into their own campaigns. Included are detailed information on the worlds involved, full details of the units which took part in the campaign, an overview of the historical campaign, and several tools players can use to run historical characters and battles from this time period. The only limits are the players&rsquo; imagination!<br/><br/>",

The rules of the game allow for different situational games in which the target, the size of the field, and the size of the armies can vary.<br/><br/>There are only three rules in Warsemble (movement, rest, and battle), which reflect principles of actual military action:<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. With each turn, the player can move or update all figures.<br/><br/><br/>     Movement: Figures can move in four directions (forward, backward, left, and right) to adjacent accessible squares. Each time a figure enters a new square, its strength is reduced by points equal to the effort value of the square. Within each turn, the figure can be moved to as many positions as its strength allows.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Rest: Each figure that stays in place and is not attacked increases its strength by one point each turn, until it reaches a maximum strength of six.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Attack: The attacking figure must enter the square of the opponent figure, following the rules of movement (i.e., it must expend the strength needed to enter the opponent's square). After moving, the strengths of the two figures are compared and the stronger of the two survives.<br/><br/><br/>The game is won by the player who first brings the crown to the base.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With multiple ways to play, help kids learn image-based memory and matching skills, letter recognition, and the alphabet. Players start by spreading out the cards face down, and on their turn, they will flip over 2 cards. If the cards are a match, they set the pair aside. If the cards do not match, players will have to remember where they were and find the other matching pieces on their next turn! The player who creates the most matching pairs wins!<br/><br/>The colorful cards are a fun way to learn the alphabet and can help toddlers develop new skills. Kids can play on their own, against their friends, or cooperatively to match all the dinosaurs together!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players also receive three cards representing a shopping list, with three food items on each. On your turn, you roll a single die (d6) and move that amount around the board. If a space has a face-down token it is revealed, and if it is an item you need you can pick it up and put it on your list (it stays on the space if not). There are also a few &quot;wild&quot; tokens that can used for any item. Other spaces let you draw from a deck of cards with a variety of actions, including stealing tokens from an opponent's list. Complete a list and you get another, and the first player to complete three lists wins. Any token from a completed list is put in the center and can be collected if a player lands on an empty space; as such, the game picks up pace as it goes on as more items are readily available.<br/><br/>",

All cronies, besides the foreign allies, can be elected as president or vice-president. Other positions such as Finance, Justice, Service Delivery and Communications, can only be filled by specialists.<br/><br/>Two decks of cards are placed on the table: the main deck and the tactics deck. The main deck consists of influence, corruption and crony cards and the tactics deck contains only tactics cards. Players start with seven cards from the main deck and two tactic cards each. Any cronies or foreign ally in the initial hand must be placed in the cabinet immediately (and any crony or ally that can not be placed is discarded).<br/><br/>In each round of House of Cronies, five cards are drawn from the main deck and placed face up in the middle of the table. In turn order, players can either pick up an influence / corruption card OR bid influence, corruption or a combination of both for a crony. Players can only gain one card per round, so any player who outbids another forfeits their turn. Players that are outbid, get their turn and their influence / corruption bid card back.<br/><br/>The end of the game occurs when there are no cards left in the deck or fewer cards than needed to draw for a new round. A final round is played for players to buy and used tactics before the election takes place and the player with the most votes wins!<br/><br/>",

Each round consists of accounting for income, building improvements in their kingdom, training combat units, and exploring the countryside with the player's heroes. The heroes can amass an army of various combat units available to each player in their kingdom according to their faction. They can explore the areas surrounding their kingdom, defeat rogue warbands guarding resources, buildings, mines, and artifacts. Experience is gained from defeating rogue warbands and another player's armies. Those guarded treasures can be used to grow the player's kingdom and armies.<br/><br/>The game takes place over a series of Weeks (turns) and Months (4 consecutive turns). Each week players collect gold for from their kingdom. Each month players collect resources from their mines and controlled buildings. Each player's turn consists of actions they can perform. Collect gold. Move their hero up to their movement speed. Engage with any space along their moved path. Spend gold on an improvement in their kingdom. Spend experience to level their hero up. Learn spells and abilities to aid their fighting armies. Fight rogue warbands or other players to take control of valuable spaces. Dice, from the d4 up to the d20, will be used to fight and perform abilities. Each player controls a faction with a set list of units with various combat characteristics and prompts for which dice to use.<br/><br/>The player that conquers all other players or the objectives set out in the chosen scenario wins the game. Conquering a player happens when a player no longer has a kingdom or a hero. They are then removed from the game. Specific scenarios will outline additional game mechanics and win conditions. There is no set number of turns or time limit for the game.<br/><br/>",

Players roll the six dice, and can hold two and re-roll the rest.<br/><br/>The decks include Barrage cards for bullet hell, which can be used offensively or defensively. Players use their dice rolls to bring cards into play, and then activate them next turn.

To build a faculty, a player must collect the required cards and pay its cost.<br/><br/>In each game round, players take their turns consecutively. During single turn, the player first draws and resolves the effect of a Random Event card, and then performs one of the available actions:<br/>a) opening a faculty (if the player meets the requirements),<br/>b) exchange of up to 3 cards from hand,<br/>c) using a special card and resolving its effect,<br/>d) buying a card from the board.<br/>At the end of the round, players bid for new action cards and collect coins from the faculties that are already running.<br/><br/>",

A few friends arrive early in the afternoon to help with the preparations: Beer tables are dragged, tablecloths laid out and space made for the drinks. In one corner of the garden, however, a loud competition breaks out over who will hang the most beautiful string of lights. Who will hang the coolest fairy lights at your garden party?<br/><br/>All cards show three power lines with light bulbs and lanterns of different colors hanging from them. You place one of them in front of you as your own starting card. The rest of the cards are placed in the center of the table. Look at them carefully, because it's all about speed! Once you've all placed one hand flat on the table, you're ready to go.<br/><br/>You grab cards with only one hand at a time, as fast as you can, and place them on your string of lights. Also make sure that the power lines are not always straight. This can get lost in the heat of the moment. You can also flip cards, because maybe the back side will be more useful. But you have to put your hand flat on the table again before you can return to the action.<br/><br/>Whoever has laid the required length first, depending on the number of players, gives the signal to the others to come to the end. Now you can see who has really conjured up the best string of lights:<br/><br/>The more light bulbs and lanterns of the same color follow each other in a line, the more points the chain of lights earns you. The lanterns are particularly valuable because, unlike light bulbs, they also count individually and even double the point value if they are part of a row. When your arms are unknotted and your eyes are no longer spinning, you can immediately start the next round.<br/><br/>It's game 17 of the series &quot;Die Kleinen Feinen&quot;.<br/><br/>",

It is played on the space of a board, between two players: one will be the Tupi-Guarani aboriginal people, and the other the viceroy with his army. But, while the game is played, the competitors -due to the characteristics of entertainment- will be invited to walk the path of historical knowledge; they will be able to know the circumstances of the time; the rituals, legends and cosmogonies of the aborigines; They will be able to delve into the war iconography of the time, the weapons and ships of the conquerors, their war tactics, etc. And, also, some continental geography.<br/><br/>Two players or teams can play the Iwok&aacute; from the age of 9. One will be the Tupi-Guarani people, and the other will be the viceroy and his army. It is played with green and brown chips, in circular movements. On the board the most important place is the center called Arete (the promised land of the aboriginal people). The viceroy is occupying this sacred place: his objective will be to leave through four paths or exit points, from the center to the outside of the board, and flee by ship with the stolen riches. In the escape, he will be protected by his army.<br/><br/>The Tupi-Guarani, who are around the Arete, have the mission of preventing the viceroy and his army from escaping with his riches. How do they prevent the flight of the conquerors? Enclosing them with tokens. The army can be &quot;eaten&quot; with the tokens and eliminated, but the viceroy must be locked up with the tokens.<br/><br/>The invaders win if the viceroy reaches any of the four starting squares, and flee with the riches. The natives win if the viceroy is trapped between tiles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For many centuries there was peace in the four great kingdoms and life in the lands was simple and carefree. One day, however, unfriendly and warlike tribes appeared from the lands beyond the horizon and brought danger to the four kingdoms. The four rulers decided together to protect the people from the evil invaders and bring them into the cities. However, because the cities were too small and unsafe, they were first to be enlarged and expanded. Defensive towers, churches and a city wall were to be built around the stately palace, which was also to be newly erected. And so the great builders of the world were commissioned to plan and implement the buildings for the kingdom of the mountain lands in the north, the kingdom of the sun in the east, the desert kingdom in the south and the kingdom of the forest peoples in the west. In order to get all this done in time before a possible attack by the enemy tribes, the builders gather people from all walks of life - from peasants to princes - to help and cooperate from the lands. Each person is given his or her task, which must be completed exactly according to plan and order.<br/><br/>You and your fellow players slip into the role of these master builders. Everyone tries to place all their cards with the helping citizens on the building sites before all the other players. Act wisely and strategically as a master builder and you may become the greatest master builder of the four kingdoms...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

Instead of explaining, as is usual in most activity variants besides drawing and pantomime, plasticine is used here.<br/><br/>Two teams of the same size compete against each other. Each team member grabs his own card and starts to represent the term - all at the same time, of course. While you are representing yourself, you try to guess the terms of the other team members at the same time in order to score as many points as possible. You have exactly 60 seconds to do this.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you can draw a domino from the boneyard (i.e., the supply of dominoes) or place a domino at the end of an active line as long as you can match the number at the end of the line; the starting station can have two lines built off of the starting domino. If you place a double domino, take another turn immediately.<br/><br/>The starting station indicates that five dominoes must be placed in a line before a new station is opened. If you place the fifth domino in a line, draw a random station from the deck, then place it at the end of the line and mark it with one of your tokens. Each station has two lines off of it, with a starting domino half on each line and a length the line must reach before a new station is built on that line.<br/><br/>Players continue to take turns until either one player has emptied their hand of dominoes or the fifth station has been put into play. At the time, players score, earning 1 point for each station they started and losing 1 point for each domino still in hand.<br/><br/>Each city edition of Metro Domino appears to have identical gameplay, but with differing station lengths and values.<br/><br/>",

You must use your stone to defeat the Cursed Dwarves and save the kingdoms of Overwyrld from the evil Wymer.<br/><br/>As the villain, you set traps and locks for the heroes to battle. Also, you will control the Cursed Dwarves as you attempt to defeat the heroes and doom Overwyrld to destruction by the Wymer.<br/><br/>DIFFERENT OUTCOMES<br/>Encounters have two outcomes. If the hero wins, the thumbs up side of the card is read. If the hero loses, the thumbs down portion is read. Even the game itself has outcomes based on if the heroes are victorious or not.<br/><br/>SIMPLE SCORING<br/>Encounters are decided by one die for the hero and one die for the villain. They roll against each other, and any bonuses are added to the roll to see who wins the encounter. The math never gets bigger than adding up to twelve, which is good, because math is terrible.<br/><br/>THE BOARD GAME WE ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY<br/>When we designed this game, we made it for players like us. We wanted it to be easy to learn, simple to play and challenging enough that we would want to play again.<br/><br/>With a lot of effort and fine-tuning, we arrived at a game that we would have loved if it had existed when we were 14. Does that mean you'll love it? We hope so. If you're looking for a complicated, intricate and punishing game, this probably isn't the game you're looking for.

When 4 Nations are eliminated - the game ends and the remaining 3 Nations share the victory.<br/><br/>Note: While this game may seem similar to the Alliace from Columbia Games, it has different mechanics, counties, and background.<br/><br/>",

On the ground level, you have a game board with plastic ridges that create barriers for movement. As you improve at the game, you can add hedges to the game board to create additional barriers. One player will move the young magician Linus across this board.<br/><br/>But Linus must travel with a star overhead so that he can find these objects in the dark. The second level of play is a plastic sheet that forms the sky. Another player will control a &quot;magic button&quot; that magnetically holds the star, which is attached to Linus, in the sky and keeps it from falling.<br/><br/>On a turn, reveal a route card; three spaces have targets on them, and the other three spaces will be filled with revealed target chips. After discussing how they want to move and starting the electronic timer, two players move Linus and the star (via the magic button) to one target after another until either they've visited all six targets or time has run out. If the star ever falls due to players moving in different directions, the players must first elevate the star again before moving.<br/><br/>Place each chip you've reached in slots in the timer and return unreached target chips face down to the supply. If you claim all thirteen targets by the end of twelve rounds of play, you win!<br/><br/>",

Players will have to place a card that says the color of the previous card. If a player cannot place any card from his hand, he must pass his turn. Each player can place as many cards as he can on his turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Trident: The goal is to get as many trios as possible. Players can put the cards together if they all have the same color or the same word is written on them. The players must always have 6 cards in their turn, so they will have to take as many cards from the central deck as they have used.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Duel: The goal is to be the first to run out of cards. Six cards are dealt to each player and the rest are placed, face down, forming a deck on the table. Players will take cards from the central deck at the same time and place them face up on the table. Then, they can put their hand on top of one of them if they can match it with a card from their hand. Every time a player gets a pair, he will discard those cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pairs: The goal is to get as many pairs as possible. 6 cards are dealt to each player and 9 will be placed face down, forming a grid on the table. The rest of the cards are placed face down in a deck. Each player will pick up 3 cards in turn to memorize their content and quickly turn them over again. He will then search his hand for a card whose text matches one of the cards he had picked up. Only if a match is made will he continue to play. Each player can make up to 5 matches on their turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Stairs: The goal is to be the first to run out of cards. 6 cards are dealt to each player and the rest are placed face down in a central deck. The person who has one of the double cards will start playing, since each stair is formed starting from them. Each player will put a card in their turn and they will be completed according to the order of the colors of CocoLocoColor.

You can also gain Hide or Hunt. With Hide, you can re-roll an alert die (which is an extra die, not a die on an alert symbol), and Hunt allows you to try for an extra star.<br/><br/><br/>Scenario: Catch the Slayer<br/><br/>An aristocratic named Peire reaches out in dire need of help. There has bee a string of deaths in Pahyrstm and every Friday morning a body has been found. The killer's identity is known, but they leave a note next to each body. At first the notes were vague, but they've slowly started to paint a picture. The evidence is showing thatyou have been the killers all along. Capture the killer before more victims are killed, and before you are blamed for the death.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>     Rallyed Thilve<br/>     Nereayne<br/><br/><br/>",

Colin has the other PARACHUTE and also SHOOTs at Ady. Deb has a FLUKE card, so she could save Ady with that, but she also has a SURVIVOR card so expects to walk away from the inevitable plane crash, should the pilot die, so she withholds that for later. Beth reveals her PARACHUTE card and jumps out of the plane. But Colin then plays PROPELLOR, which makes a gruesome mess of Beth. He then jumps out of the plane as well, surviving the crash with a total of $7m in CASH cards. Deb is the last player on the plane, so plays her SURVIVOR card to walk away with $9m CASH and wins the round.<br/><br/>",

Players roll a die to (a) select their uniquely-powered character, then (b) move along the 109 numbered spaces on the winding board, and (c) resolve the effects of the various encounters described on the board spaces.  Finally, both (d) the combat system (between players &amp; against the creatures on the board) and (e) actually moving onto the winning space at the end of the trail are both resolved through rolling the same die.<br/><br/>The Candyland-style board experience has several unique features.<br/>The first 22 spaces are inside the castle, where you are in the &quot;safe zone&quot;.  But even there you are not safe, due to things like space #3 (&quot;Encounter a bandit, you lose the battle return to start&quot;) and #7 (&quot;Encounter a tornado Go back 2 blocks&quot;) and #12 (&quot;Feel unwell, take a rest and skip a turn&quot;).  Finally, right before you exit the castle, you may get lucky and land on #20 which says: &quot;Spin the wheel to draw a weapon&quot;.  This spinner has 16 spaces which award adventurers with a free weapon, such as an &quot;Algae Machete&quot; or a &quot;Fire Whip&quot; or a &quot;Sword of Ice&quot;...unless you get 1 of the 4 &quot;Better luck next time!&quot; spaces.<br/>Space #29 is a &quot;Detour&quot; right before the encounter with the Fire Dragon.  The detour all takes place within space #29, but it is a 10-space run around the terminates right at the Fire Dragon encounter space anyway&mdash;so, no avoiding this fight!<br/>Lastly, space #109 is where the namesake 5-piece plastic dragon throne sits.  Players will lose their turns until they manage to roll the exact number necessary to reach this space.<br/><br/>Beyond the castle walls, combat becomes part of the game.  Combat losses force players to lose HP (which are represented by AWESOME wooden tokens), and when any player is reduced to 0 HP he must retreat back to space #22&mdash;with 109 spaces in all, and no control over where you land on a turn, this is a LONG way to fall!  You will have access to item cards, but your choices are limited here, because you can hold only 1 card at a time&mdash;the one you have may not be what you need most.<br/><br/>Other spaces offer opportunities to earn coins from die rolls, or sacrifice your next turn to acquire coins or HP.  Plot cards are encountered every few spaces, and if you land on them, they add both positive &amp; negative effects (along with some thematic flavor text) just like you'd find in Monopoly's &quot;Chance&quot; or &quot;Community Chest&quot; decks.<br/><br/>",

But only those who behave in an exemplary and virtuous manner are in the favor of the king. Those who go too far are threatened with banishment. So the players are busy trying to cover up their deeds as quickly as possible before someone tells the king. Those who are lucky may even get help from the court magician.<br/>The game is played with 54 playing cards, including 52 &quot;sin cards&quot; and two &quot;court magicians&quot;. All players try to discard their sin cards from their hand. The higher the point value of the card, the more serious the deed in the eyes of the King. Players with 7 or fewer points in their hand may choose to report the other players to the King. The betrayed players then receive sin points for each card in their hand. If you successfully betray the others, you will get off scot-free and will not receive any sin points yourself. But be careful! If another player has the same number of points or less, you will receive an additional 30 points for the failed snitching.

The core of this game builds on the classic &ldquo;war&rdquo; card game that most kids already know how to play.<br/><br/>Design features added in this game include: 1) rolling a game-specific wooden die that will determine whether the highest or lowest stat wins the round, 2) players (usually) get to look at 2 cards each round and choose which to play, 3) a memory game element of needing to remember the cards looked at, and 4) the lead player choosing 1 of 4 stat categories for that round&rsquo;s comparison rather than the simple comparison in &ldquo;war&rdquo; of the traditional card rank value. The winner of a round is the lead player for the next round.<br/><br/>Another significant difference from &ldquo;war&rdquo; is that this game is &ldquo;once through the deck&rdquo; and see who has the most, rather than the &ldquo;win all the cards&rdquo; victory condition of traditional &ldquo;war&rdquo; card games. This significantly shortens the game play and allows for a predictable playing time. The publisher says 20 minutes, although that may be a bit optimistic when playing with younger kids.<br/><br/>There are 100 game cards with 4 factual statistic categories on each. Also on each card is a fun fact which is not used in play of the game. Initially the publisher is releasing two versions of this game of &ldquo;Amazing Animals&rdquo; and &ldquo;Countries of the World&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of the chief of a tribe of goblin miners under the rule of Zafrat, the Goblin King. During the game, you will make decisions on how to allocate your resources (ingots) by providing good working conditions for your miners, paying tolls to the Trolls of Tuuk for the use of their shifting tunnels and mountain passes, paying for mining reports, or buying items from the goblin merchants. This will be done in the face of uncertainty regarding mining conditions, the demands of the trolls, gem price fluctuations, and testing availability.<br/><br/>Each round, you will have the opportunity to dig from one of four mines and then sell gems that result from your dig. As you dig deeper into the mines, conditions will become more treacherous as the threat of a cave-in or the release of dangerous gasses increases. Your opportunities, however, will also increase. Word of the mines' riches will quickly attract Goblin Merchants with valuable wares to sell to your miners, and the Goblin Engineers will offer to sell you information about the likely bounty of your efforts before you dig.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the goblin chief with the most ingots is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

La Fleur is a strategy board game where you take on the role of a French Rococo garden enthusiast as you build your ch&acirc;teau, host garden parties, and gain prestige to hold the greatest of all garden gatherings, the Grande Soir&eacute;e. Each player begins the game as one of a multitude of characters with a ch&acirc;teau that is rather, well....plain and empty. How will you ever attract visitors to your ch&acirc;teau and build your reputation if there are no fountains to admire, no paths to wander, and, most importantly, no flowers!<br/><br/>Each round you will send your artisans to different parts of Paris to acquire floral beauties, hire additional help, earn coins, commission new garden features for your ch&acirc;teau, and do many other things that artisans generally do. But be quick! Resources each round are limited, and the first artisan to each location gets their pick of the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me. Each round ends with a garden party, where visitors from across the globe come to shower you with prestige and opportunity. Be wary of your neighbors, though! If their ch&acirc;teau is more attractive than yours, some visitors may be more enticed to attend your neighbor&rsquo;s garden party than yours. Sacrebleu! As word of the beauty of your competing ch&acirc;teaus spreads, more and more visitors will flock to your gardens. When one player gains enough Prestige, all players add their bonuses from their objectives and garden features, and the player with the most Prestige is declared the Host of the Grande Soir&eacute;e!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The usual penalty for disobedience: take another drink!<br/><br/>Everyone is Roman Senator.  There are eight divine laws that are set in stone.  Every Senator (player) must follow divine law. There are up to twelve Caesar's Commands put forth by the Senators (players).  Laws must either require some action, or prohibit some action.  A rule can include a penalty, within the limits agreed at the beginning of the game.  If no penalty is specified, the penalty is &quot;Take a drink.&quot;  Two special positions in the game are the Arbiter, and Fool.  The Arbiter's job: Keep the scroll, and fills in new laws (rules).  Advises on wording of new laws (rules).  Judges compliance with new laws (rules).<br/><br/>The Fool's job: Does not have to follow any of Caesar's commands, and may deliberately break them to lure others into error.  If they make someone laugh, that person drinks. The fool must still follow divine law. Everyone starts with a small amount of coins.  Coins can be used to pay fines and avoid drinking.<br/><br/>You win if: (1) You have twice as much money as the rest of the players put together (not counting what is in the pot), or (2) Everybody agrees that you win.<br/><br/>",

The effect of cards often depends on what cards neighbors have played.

By fulfilling additional conditions on the card, you can receive additional chips. The conditions are related to the type of cards that your opponents played this turn or you yourself played in the previous one - if they match, you get a bonus<br/>Research Cards &ndash; Research cards are applied in ascending order of numbers on the cards. Otherwise the principle remains the same. Research cards allow you to draw cards, but the maximum number of cards in your hand is limited to 9 cards<br/>Swarm Cards &ndash; Swarm cards are also played by number. First, players count their honey and experience tokens. The one with the highest total discards the honey tokens and takes a swarm token as a reward. If a player plays a swarm card but fails to obtain a swarm token, he can choose either 1 honey token or 1 card as compensation. The swarm card is always returned back to the player's hand<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1946, at the end of World War II. On this day, unlike the large-scale air raids on the German mainland that had been carried out every day, the Allied Forces aimed to show decisive &quot;power&quot; in the war, thereby weakening Germany's will to fight and forcing it to surrender. Bombers attempt to bring the war to a close by dropping multiple bombs on the German mainland, the first in history to have the power to blow up a city.<br/><br/>The German Air Force deploys the latest jet fighter Me262 to intercept them. What will be the outcome of this battle?<br/><br/>Goering&rsquo;s Jets is based on the premise that Hitler adopted a more rational force conservation policy in the latter half of World War II, that the war continued until 1946 and the Allied forces were unable to prepare for the final war. This is a battle-type simulation war game that recreates the strategic bombing of mainland Germany using &quot;city-destroying bombs&quot; in order to bring the curtain down.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated and adapted)<br/><br/>",

On their turn, they pick up a sixth card either from the face down ingredients deck, or from the top card of the face up discard pile of ingredients. If a player has the corresponding ingredients to make one or more potions, they discard the ingredients face up, take the potion card(s), and place them face up in their player area. The potions row is then replenished so five cards are face up. Players may negotiate and trade ingredient cards, one for one, with other players. At the end of a turn, players will draw or discard ingredients so that they have five cards in hand.

Place each of these values into a different, unfilled pea (circle).<br/><br/>To place a value, it must be exactly 1 higher or lower than each adjacent filled pea. Adjacent means directly left, right, up, or down and does not include diagonals. For the purposes of placing a new value, ignore the values of any smushed peas and any peas in pods that are adjacent to the intended placement. After placing both values, start a new turn.<br/><br/>If you cannot or choose not to place a die value, instead smush any pea (including a previously-filled pea) by crossing it out. These will count against your score.<br/><br/>Instead of placing the values rolled, you may instead create a pod. Circle any 3 peas (filled, unfilled, or smushed) that are continuously adjacent &mdash; in other words, A is adjacent to B, which is adjacent to C. Pods may not overlap. Filled peas within a pod must always have the same value. Any unfilled peas when the pod is created can only be filled by using that value; this is an exception to the normal placement requirements. Each pod&rsquo;s value is independent of each other pod. Peas in a pod may be smushed as normal. After creating a pod, start a new turn.<br/><br/>When all peas on the board have been either smushed or filled, the harvest is complete.<br/><br/>Count up the number of smushed peas to determine your score.

The boss and his army are going to have a tough time breaching the defenses.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of three phases:<br/>1.Manuever<br/>2.Shooting<br/>3.Battle<br/><br/>Manuever - a player rolls a die for how many actions they get.  A piece can move one space for one action and may do up to the total rolled in actions.  You can also split the total actions over several figures; if a five was rolled you could move two figures two spaces each and another figure one space.  Up to two figures can be in a space.<br/><br/>Shooting - The defender then shoots adjacently with his archers, needing a 6 to hit.  The arc of fire is front, back, left, right, but on a tower you can also shoot diagonally.<br/><br/>Battle - Figures that are adjacent (not diagonally) can fight.  Both roll a die and the high side wins and removes a figure.  If there are additional figures in the space, then roll again, until the space is cleared. There are some modifiers to this roll.  Archers are minus one to the roll and fight after any other knights in the space, and the boss is plus one.<br/><br/>If the attackers enter the treasure room they win.  If the boss is ever killed, the attacker lose.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/>-map<br/>-Attacker army with 15 figures (8 knights, 6 shooters, 1 master)<br/>-Defending army of 15 figures (8 knights, 7 shooters)<br/>-one die<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maligno Trip is a social deduction game set in the Philippines. A game of betrayal roles, suspicious actions, and deceptive talk. Players must work together to go home to Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. Amongst the players are Maligno, a shapeshifting monster that is trying to kill them all.<br/><br/>Going home with their car, a group of travelers will find themselves riddled by detours, wrong turns, and long routes which affects gas consumption. While the goal of the travelers is to go home, Maligno aims to consume all the gas in order to kill them before they go home.<br/><br/>The trip will involve hidden information. As the maligno may curse and kill during the night, humans must find out who are their ally and their enemies. They must use their social skills to convince other players that they are on the good team, even if they are actually on the bad team. Actions, body language, and behavior of every player must be considered.<br/><br/>Each day, a designated driver is elected by the group. During each turn, the driver and navigator will work together to decide which route to take. Every action is dictated by a random deck. Players must figure out if the actions of the driver are based on luck or based on deception.<br/><br/>The objective of the Human team is to make sure the car token reach Manila. The objective of the Maligno team is to consume all gas so that the car token will not reach Manila. The board map is divided into 4 blocks or days. Each day, a designated driver is elected by the group who will decide the final action of the car token. When the car token landed on a location that is found beyond or on the boundary of blocks/days, then the night phase is initiated. Players will sleep during the night phase.<br/><br/>The movement of the car token is dependent on turns. A navigator is assigned each turn to work with the driver. Navigators are automatically assigned counter-clockwise of the driver, starting on the right of the driver. Each turn, the navigator draws 3 action card from the deck and discards 1 action card. The navigator will pass the remaining 2 action card to the driver. The driver selects 1 action card and discards the other. A new turn will occur after the driver selects the final action card.<br/><br/>The driver has the choice to reject any card that is handed by the navigator. Navigation rejection may only be done if the driver has not yet seen the action cards. The navigation bar on the board describes how many rejection has been made. Each day, three rejections may be done by the driver. The navigation bar resets each day. Depending on the action card, the car token may move from one location to another. Only the driver may place the car token to its proper place.<br/><br/>Maligno, from the Filipino folklore, is a concept encompassing numerous malevolent creatures that embody misfortune, illness, and all things evil. The nature of these beings, who are often depicted as agents of chaos and suffering, are shapeshifters that are believed to inflict illness, possess individuals, manipulate dreams, and even cause death. Their presence is often associated with unusual occurrences, like inexplicable sounds, sudden illnesses, and unexplained misfortunes.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Recruit technicians, organize refreshments, security, set up the stage, handle communications and find funding. Avoid the hassle and enjoy the festival!<br/><br/>Rock festival: Crescendo is a cooperative game. Players start the game with 20 resources and a motivated team of 15 volunteers.<br/>Depending on the number of players, you have 8, 10 or 12 rounds to recruit 10 of the most popular artists from around the world.<br/>During his turn, each player must select a card from among 6 cards (the river, which will be reconstituted at the end of each turn), paying for the necessary resources or volunteers. Each type of card allows you to gain either fame (by recruiting artists), or additional resources or volunteers. Additionally, by collecting cards of the same type you'll get bonus points at the end of the game. But beware, some cards (galleys) will get in your way, and you'll have to spend your resources and volunteers to discard them as soon as possible: accumulating 4 galley cards in the river will make you lose the game.<br/><br/>The game is won if, at the end of your festival, you have at least as many Resources and Volunteers as at the start, i.e. 20 Resources and 15 Volunteers available to organize the next edition of the festival.<br/><br/>The artists you've recruited during your festival will determine your degree of victory.<br/><br/>",

The first player to gain two victories is the winner.<br/><br/>In each round players start with five sauce cards from which they choose one to keep and pass the rest to the player on their left and repeat this process five times. Then each player chooses three cards they wish to use and places them face down in front of them (the two cards remaining in their hand will be used for their special abilities later). Players in turn state higher and higher challenges (how much heat they can consume) or pass. The player with the highest challenge then has to turn over five face-down cards belonging to any players. If the total heat level of these cards matches or exceeds their challenge value, they take a victory card, otherwise they failed and gain a penalty card.<br/><br/>",

In order to be free again, you must pass different challenges ranging from singing or dancing to writing as many names as possible starting with the letter 'a'. Fore some of the challenges you'll use a 20 seconds timer.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw a random token to see if you'll get the possibility to walk 1, 2 or -1 steps towards the goal. Then you draw a card from the deck corresponding to the token. Lastly you roll a die to determine what challenge on the card to do.<br/><br/>From the Gamemaster's dungeon, the friends move from room to room by completing the challenges. Whoever reaches the rainbow on the green meadow first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

He gets paid if he provides juicy material courtesy of your gossip &mdash; but if the article is widely reported and your role in its creation comes out, the responsibility that awaits you is...being fired! You absolutely do not want to leave the political party and need to make somewhat unconventional arrangements, perhaps kicking down your colleagues instead.<br/><br/>Gossip Trip Trix is a trick-taking game in which you want to avoid points, that is, credit for the gossip being spread. The deck consists of four suits numbered 1-11. Lay the 8s in a vertical column on the table as pat of an imaginary grid, then shuffle and deal the remaining cards.<br/><br/>The lead player plays what they want, and each player must follow suit, if possible; otherwise, they play what they wish. The highest card of the lead suit wins the trick, then all played cards are placed into the grid in the appropriate places: 1-7 to the left of the 8 of the matching color, and 9-11 to the right. Whoever won the trick scores points equal to the longest run of consecutive numbers from 1-7 in the winning suit, then they lead the next trick. However, if the 9-10-11 of a color have been played, then tricks won in this color are worth 0 points.<br/><br/>Once the 9-10-11 of each color have been played, the round ends. Shuffle the cards, then start a new round. After each player has been start player once, the game ends, and whoever has the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, draft a card from the end of a column and add it to your collection. Each card depicts one or more symbols &mdash; ropes, crampons, etc. &mdash; while also showing what's on the back. If you draft a sherpa, discard it immediately, then optionally flip over one of your cards. If you draft a mountain climber carrying vodka, on a future turn you can empty the vodka to take another turn immediately.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been drafted, tally your score. Wool hats are worth 2 points each, empty vodka bottles are -3 points, and for each other symbol score 1 point per symbol, with a 4-point bonus for whoever has the most ropes, the most crampons, etc.<br/><br/>Ahead of the second round, flip half of the cards to their other side, shuffle the deck, lay out the cards in an inverted pyramid, then draft and score as described previously. For the third round, lay out the cards in three inverted pyramids. If a fourth round is necessary, choose one of the previous card arrangements or create your own.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cocktail Poison is a game from Japan with players trying to poison other players' drinks for fun and profit.<br/><br/>The game has a set of cards for 6 different shaped glasses for drinking (flutes, bowls, martini and so on), and tiles in 4 colour poisons (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green) and a white antidote tile. Each player is dealt one secret empty cocktail glass (the martini glass must be one as that decides the next start player), and gets a set of the five tiles. The start player is the last person to break a glass.<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of their five tiles in secret and places it face-down with their empty glass card face-down on top. This makes a combination of glass style and colour which is secretly poisoned.<br/><br/>The rest of the glasses cards show each style of glass with each colour of drink, making up 24 cards. The four colour cards for each style of empty glass being used are selected and shuffled to make a face-down deck. Three cards are dealt up (four with 5 or 6 players).<br/><br/>Players then take turns drawing a face-up card, and placing it up in front of themselves until each player has drawn four cards. Then the secret combos of glass and poison are revealed and players work out their scores for the round.<br/><br/>If a player has a combo of poison and glass style that another player has drawn, they gain +2 pts, and the poisoned player loses -1 pt. If a player has drawn no poisoned cards, they gain +1 pt.<br/><br/>The white antidote tile is used during the card draw turns. If a player has chosen to hide their antidote tile, they can play it onto one of glass cards at the time they select it. This neutralises the poison, meaning if another player then had that combo, they do not score 2 pts because the poison failed. And the victim gains +1 pt for successfully using the antidote, but did not have a poison combo in play.<br/><br/>Players cannot score less than zero on a round, and the game continues until a player scores at least 5 points. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>The second edition corrects the rule that whilst a player may rarely draw more than one poisoned glass, if they successfully apply an antidote to one, they still gain +1 pt for that and do not take -1 pt for the further poisons they did not cancel.<br/>--description by user<br/><br/>",

Those brave enough to traverse the freezing continent of Bjarl and weather the Everwinter's curse must still battle rival warbands to have any hope of claiming these riches. The Malevolent Masks lay long-forgotten in the depths of Bjarl. Lost for centuries, they have now been discovered in the glacial chasms of the Deathgorge. Donning them grants the bearer power, but often at a cost, as few truly realise the consequences of wearing such an item.<br/><br/>This deck contains a 32-card universal Rivals deck consisting of:<br/><br/>     12x objective cards<br/>     10x gambit cards<br/>     10x upgrade cards<br/>     1x background card that includes a deck list of the Malevolent Masks cards<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The one who fights his way to the top is the one God has chosen. His church will rule the Earth and followers of all the lying sects will be voluntarily executed as stinky heretics.<br/><br/>What an idea! And here is the best part of it: You are one of these champions!<br/><br/>Freak Cults Dungeon is a fast and simple dungeon crawler/boss-fight card game on just 12 business cards that fit in your wallet.<br/><br/>The replay value is not high and is based on the fact of needing repeated plays to beat the high level of difficulty. Box not included, as the whole game fits in a wallet perfectly, making a super compact travel game, needing just a one-sheet-size of space on a table (no dice needed either, just 3 coins or other small tokens).<br/><br/>A black background is recommended for the full visual experience. And you can burn incense or two while playing, listening to Valaam choirs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The lowest value card on suit wins the trick, but it is also is worth fewer points in the end.<br/><br/>You also have opportunity costs. Every sale makes you feel like going home, so you discard extra cards face down when you win a trick. You can quickly make small sales, but you&rsquo;ll go home before others, giving them the opportunity to make huge sales alone!

There are rumors that, thanks to this trick, the CIA exposed Soviet spies! The game trains reaction and memory, and also teaches you to concentrate on several things at the same time.<br/><br/>Basic rules:<br/><br/>Each player receives 6 different colored cards. In the center of the table is the main deck, from which the task card is opened:<br/><br/>     If the word &quot;color&quot; is on the card - each player searches among his cards for those that correspond to the color of the letters<br/>     If the word &quot;name&quot; is on the card - each player searches among his cards for those that correspond to the name of the color<br/>     If the name of the color is written in black letters - each player looks for cards with a similar background color<br/>     If a &quot;bRainbow&quot; card has fallen out - you need to quickly cover it with your palm<br/><br/><br/>Whoever fulfills the necessary condition first takes the card.

        "description": "Two players take turns placing stones on empty spaces of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons, one stone per turn. There must never be a stone adjacent to six other stones on the board. You win if, after your placement, there is an empty space whence the edge of the board cannot be reached through a series of steps onto adjacent empty spaces. The empty area including that space is then said to be looped.<br/><br/>If you play several rounds, note after each round the size of the looped area and add it to the winner's running score. Whoever reaches a predetermined score first wins the match. The loser of one round plays first in the next.<br/><br/>Like all impartial games, Luup is exquisitely boring. To make it partisan (if you must), fill a looped area with markers of the looper's color and keep playing until there are no more legal moves available. If you loop an area, you must make another move on the same turn. Whoever has more markers in the final position wins.<br/><br/>As an alternative to the standard placement restriction, one may forbid non-perimeter placements that complete minimal triangles of stones around a vertex of the grid. This is a bit less elegant but possibly more fun and accessible. Loops are guaranteed in both cases.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But be careful not to land on your back&mdash;that would be extremely embarrassing. The first player to earn 500 points is the winner and is crowned Top Tortoise Tumbler!<br/><br/>Perfect for friends, families, and lovers of tortoises, it's suitable for ages 8+, 1+ players, has an average 15-minute gameplay, and includes English instructions. Made using FSC paper and soy inks.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>To begin the game, you must first create the garden. Piece together the nine scene cards in any position you like. There are potential bonuses on each card, so think carefully about where you place the highest earners!<br/>The first player rolls the two rubber tortoise pals onto the garden and checks the scorecard to see how many points they&rsquo;ve won. For instance, landing on your shell side will earn more points than face-planting but landing on your back scores zero! Remember to check for bonuses on the card where you landed, too. Not happy with your score? You can re-roll twice per turn but remember: your score can decrease as well as increase. And if a tortoise misses the garden altogether, you score zero and cannot re-roll. When you&rsquo;ve done all you can, record your total score for that round on the scorepad and pass the tortoises to the next player. The garden layout stays the same throughout the game.

Monsters (on the board in large yellow squares) help the dragon capture the player. However, mysterious creatures help the player by giving him &quot;lucky stars&quot; (fields with a star), which allow him to summon a knight who will defeat the dragon. Dwarves (fields with dwarves) also help by giving items (sword, bow, invisibility hat) or revealing a spell that helps defeat monsters.<br/>Players take turns rolling the dice and moving their pieces by the number of points on the dice. When a player stands on a square with a star, he or she receives a card with a star. When the player stands on the field with the dwarf, he receives a magic item on a cardboard in the color of the dwarf's hat. When a player stands on a space with a creature, he draws a card with that creature. It then moves to the circular track in the center of the board. Now he moves on it. When he stands on a green space, he is saved by a sleeping knight and goes to the space of the color indicated by the arrow on the creature card. When he stands on the red square, he is eaten by the dragon and returns to the start. If a player who stands on a space with a creature has a star, he gives it up and moves to the track with stars, crosses it, is then saved by a knight and moves to the space in the color indicated by the arrow on the card with the creature. If a player who stands on a field with a creature has a magical item, he defeats it, puts the item in the box and continues.<br/><br/>",

In addition, each player has one pawn corresponding to one horse. Players roll the dice and move the horses. When the pawn (horse) hits the red square, the horse is relieved of its injury and is eliminated from the game. When the pawn hits the yellow point, the horse spooks and the player loses one turn. When a horse hits the green dot, it means the horse is in good condition and receives an additional throw. In addition to players moving horses, they can bet on which horse will win, and they can also bet on their own horse. You place bets by placing tokens symbolizing money on fields with pictures of horses. The money you have placed cannot be withdrawn, but you can add more until the horses pass the halfway point - the field with the letter P. The game ends when the first horse crosses the finish line. The player who predicts the winning horse wins all the money. If several players guess correctly, they share the winnings equally. Whoever has the most money at the end wins. The game can be finished after the first game or after each subsequent game. You can play as long as players have &quot;money&quot;.<br/>The game is intended for 6 people. If there are fewer people, you have to figure out how to handle all 6 horses running.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warning: This game explores issues of racial inequality and it is useful to read the context of the game design before playing. Some may find the method of exploration of these issues offensive.<br/><br/>Originally published as a free game insert (with paper board and unmounted cards that had to be cut out) in the March 1970 issue of Psychology Today magazine (which simultaneously advertised a version in a long cardboard box, with better components and play money, for $5.95), &ldquo;Blacks &amp; Whites&rdquo; was a socially-conscious game which not only reflected the signs of the times but was also meant to effect change. In a sense, it was something more akin to a social experiment and performance art in game form. On the bottom side of its box, the game description reads: &ldquo;Experience the ghetto. Live on Welfare. Try to buy a place in a white suburb. Your challenge: To keep the land-hungry majority type from winning the game cheaply and quickly.... If Black players turn the tide against white advantages, a kind of irrepressible excitement takes over the board.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Players were divided into Whites and Blacks and had to make economic progress while competing with each other. Based on &quot;Monopoly&quot;, the idea was to demonstrate how the odds were stacked against black people in society by having different rules for each race in the game. The difference between this and all the other roll-and-move go-around-the board-buying-property games is that before the game, each player assumes the role of either a Black or White person.<br/><br/>Whites start out as the majority with $1,000,000.00 to spend and are able to buy property anywhere. Blacks start out as the minority with only $10,000.00 to spend; are unable to buy certain properties; have to draw from a separate Chance deck; are banned from purchasing property in the 'Surburban Zone'; and collect less money for completing a lap around the gameboard. Blacks are limited to certain areas of the board until they had accumulated at least $100,000.00. Players are encouraged to change the rules when anyone lands on the People's Park space.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it turned out to be one of the most controversial board games of all time and even merited an article in Time magazine: &quot;The game, produced by Psychology Today Games (an off shoot of the magazine) now on sale ($5.95) at major department stores, was developed at the University of California at Davis by Psychology Department Chairman Robert Sommer. It was conceived as a painless way for middle-class whites to experience &mdash; and understand &mdash; the frustrations of blacks. In Sommer&rsquo;s version, however, the black player could not win; as a simulation of frustration, the game was too successful. Then David Popoff, a Psychology Today editor, redesigned the game, taking suggestions from militant black members of 'US' in San Diego. The new rules give black players an opportunity to use &mdash; and even to beat &mdash; the System.&quot;<br/><br/>Although turning &quot;Monopoly&quot; into an attempt to draw people&rsquo;s attention to social issues seems a little bit of a long shot, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the original version of 'Monopoly' itself, called &lsquo;The Landlord&rsquo;s Game&lsquo;, was designed to demonstrate how the current economic system led to inequality and bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Psychology Today&rsquo;s board game division seems to have been short-lived but other titles included 'The Cities Game' involving &lsquo;urban tension, corruption and the undercurrents of city politics'; and 'Woman and Man' where &lsquo;Each woman must accumulate enough Status Quo points (100) to prove her equality to Men. Each man must collect enough Status Quo points (100) to prove once and for all a Woman&rsquo;s place is beneath his.&rsquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the IndieGoGo campaign<br/><br/>The union of history, art, strategy, entertainment and passion, that&rsquo;s what M400 was born from. A game of conquest, which revolves around an important and defining historical period: the 1400.<br/><br/>But this century is so much more than just a bunch of years: it&rsquo;s one of the most magnificent periods in the history of Italy and the European culture. Because it&rsquo;s not a coincidence if the end of this century marks the beginning of the &ldquo;Modern Age&rdquo;.<br/>M400 comes from the idea to bring strategic board games to the next level; neither the name nor the historical references to the XV century are just a fortuity. The century that saw the fall of the last Eastern Roman Empire, the birth of the power of Spain and England, the ascent of the Russian Republics, and the achievements of the glorious Republic of Venice are the ideal background for the birth of this new way to have fun with history.<br/>M400 has a high level of playability with multiple players, and the cards allow an always different gameplay, helping the creation of new and different matches. Every time a player finds themselves in the late Medieval period of the game, they can rewrite important pages of history in new ways, through trades, battles, journeys and revolutions. The challenge and the strategy also allow to create with the opponents new dynamics of gameplay beyond the rules: deceptions, bluffs, silent and secret alliances. The almost total absence of chances and coincidences, linked to the dices, reduces the possibility of a player to win just by chance.<br/>M400 is a game which contains very different elements, elements that can mix, and give the player a unique and unpredictable kind of entertainment. This game is for everybody, and the choice of the Latin makes it reach a new level of universality, just like the one of the world of the XV century.<br/><br/>M400 is a card-driven Risk-like game. A player's turns consists of four phases: 1) draw cards, 2) trade cards with other players, 3) move army, 4) expand. Players use cards to resolve combats and score points by occupying a region (temporary points) and defeating opponents (permanent points). The game is won by the player who first achieve a determined number of points, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>",

Each checker shows a mouse: either boy or girl, and either red, green or blue. A three-in-a-row consists of three boys, three girls, or three mice in the same color. Each player has a hand of two checkers, and chooses which one to use each turn.<br/><br/>When a player creates a three-in-a-row, he gains a piece of cheese. Initially, these have one hole.

On each die there are different results (i.e. goal, pass, dribble, etc.).<br/><br/>The offensive player chooses one die from their red &quot;strategy&quot; dice (i.e. shot on goal, pass, dribble, kick deep) and places it in a cup (not supplied) with the 4 white &quot;play&quot; dice.<br/><br/>The defensive player also chooses one die from their green &quot;strategy&quot; dice (i.e. block, intercept, steal, tackle) and places it in the cup.<br/><br/>The dice are rolled and the common result of the dice is the result of the play.  There are 40 total plays per half and once 80 plays are completed the match is over.  There are additional offensive and defensive strategies the can affect the results of the plays as well as rules for breaking ties from the dice throws.<br/><br/>",

On the right is where you make your guesses, but when you make your guess, you push a Laser Missile Launcher - if you get a hit, some light misting water squirts the other player.  It also features sound effects to include explosions.<br/><br/>Like the classic Chinese checkers game board reconfigured as &quot;Canadian checkers&quot; for Canada's centennial in 1967, now there's Electronic Hydro Battle--an even more elaborate, tricked-out version of that other battleship-sinking game, which here shall remain nameless. Apparently it's no longer enough that an opponent calls out grid coordinates in an effort to find and sink the hidden fleet you've placed on your side of the board. With Electronic Hydro Battle, players guess the location of opponents' ships by inserting a wired &quot;torpedo launcher&quot; into the screen, switchboard-style. Missile sounds are heard; if you strike an opposing craft, you'll also hear a blast, followed by the spectacle of your victim getting sprayed with a squirt of water from the game's refillable tank! Whether this funky marriage of &quot;Mighty Mo&quot; and Gong Show represents a high-water mark of fun or a sign of low tide is up to you.<br/><br/>The object of Hydro Battle game is to be the first player to destroy all five of your opponent's ships. If the Launching Sound is followed by a Blast Sound that will also be followed with your opponent getting sprayed.<br/><br/>",

Then the player chooses one of the units belonging to this formation and can move and/or attack with it. Each unit type has specific movement and attack rules. First player to eliminate set number of enemy units is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Game was designed so it could be used as an introduction to abstract strategy games and to war games.<br/><br/>UPDATE: At the end of production process the name of the game was shortened to Bitwa pod Grunwaldem.<br/><br/>",

Each deck must contain at least 20 cards in the base game or 30 cards in the advanced game. The same card must not be included more than once per deck.<br/><br/>During the game, players alternately placing one character on a playing field containing 3x3 spaces (base game) or 4x4 spaces (advanced game). Character cards feature numerical values on each of the four card edges. After a character is placed next to at least one opponent's character, one or more duels are fought by comparing adjacent numerical values. The character with the higher value wins the duel, and the losing character is turned by 180&deg;, indicating a change of control. Action and vehicle cards provide boosts to character stats or have other effects. The game ends when all spaces of the playing field are filled with a character, and the player who controls the majority of characters wins.<br/><br/>Game is sold in booster packs containing 5 cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the game Flying Kung-Fu Frogs, players try to launch their colored frogs onto the game base's spinning platforms to score points. Each platform is worth a different point value from 10 to 40 points. If you land on a gray base or get stuck on a branch, you score no points. If your frog lands on the table or anywhere besides the game base, pick it up and try again. To launch a frog, press down on its rear to fling it forward. As your finger slips off, the frog should jump toward the platforms. Once all frogs are somewhere on the game base, the game ends. Count up your points, and the player with the most points wins. This game is for two to four players. It comes with a Kung Fu Training Center game base, 20 frogs (five of each color), and a sticker sheet.<br/><br/>",

Each turn the current player must throw two six-sided dice: a numerical one (10, 20, 30) and a colored one. The player on the left must open the booklet and ask a question of a certain type (10, true or false; 20, multiple choice; 30, direct question) about the category indicated by the colored dice. For instance, if the result of the dice are 20 and green, the player on the left must ask a multiple choice question about Brazil. If the current players gives the correct answer he must move his pawn 2 green spaces ahead. If the answer is incorrect the pawn is moved one space back. In the last part of the board the players must answer questions about all subjects and move their pawns only one space ahead for each correct answer.<br/><br/>The game ends when the one of the players reachs the final space on the board.<br/><br/>",

In moving, a player can change lines only by landing by exact count on a Transfer Station. A player my send another player's pawn back to start by landing on it by exact count. Ending movement on a star earns a player an Assist Card, which may offer a reward or penalty. Rolling doubles earns that player an extra turn.

They have to do this without setting off the hidden alarms.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player draws an assignment card which tells them the documents they must find. For example, one card may tell them to get the &quot;Radio Messages from Project seafarer&quot; and the &quot;Micro-film of laser beam patterns&quot;. They travel through the spy headquarters visiting the Map Room, Radio Room, Microfilm Room and File Room and must carry their documents to the Vault.<br/><br/>What makes the game difficult is that there are hidden &quot;alarms&quot; throughout the headquarters. Whenever a player lands on an alarmed space the bell rings. The player must then draw an alarm card and go to the &quot;safe spot&quot; in the room on the card. As players move around the headquarters they must remember where the alarms are.<br/><br/>Whenever a player lands on the name location of one of the rooms they search the documents in that room and retrieve the one they are looking for. The first player to get all of their documents to the vault is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Behind each dollar amount is a statement of trivia having to do with the category.

A player is rewarded with the amount associated with the statement if correct, and penalized the corresponding amount if incorrect.<br/><br/>When the board is cleared, the process is repeated for &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; with five new categories and double the stakes.<br/><br/>One statement in the first round and two statements in the second round are designated as &quot;Daily Double.&quot; Only the person who chose the statement may bet any or all of his or her winnings on giving the correct response.

To win, you want to collect the most complete Cat-egories before the game ends. However with Special Cards and Kooky Tokens thrown in the mix, things might not always go to plan.<br/><br/>As well as twelve Cat-egories, the game features seven stupendous Special Cards, twelve Kooky Tokens, and the game changing, face-shifting The Cat That Got The Cream Card. The Special Cards consist of Catnap, Back'cat You!, Cat's Got My Tongue, the Catfish, and of course the Dodgy Dog &ndash; each with the ability to turn the game upside down!<br/><br/>",

He was crowned as king in 1152, and Emperor in Rome in 1155.<br/><br/>The players take roles of medieval kings, trying to get rich by conquering cities and castles. Possession of cities and castles gives the right to claim taxes. Taxes are used to buy knights, squires and archers to protect the kings interests.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, the players agree on a playing time. Whoever is the richest (cash plus value of knights, squires and archers) by that time wins the game. In addition you can win by being the only player with a live king, or by having a certain numbers of cities and castles (2 players = 16, 3 players = 14, 4 players = 12).<br/><br/>There are rules for movement, which depends on the unit, and the terrain moving through. Combat, which depends on the units, and the defenders position. Tax collection, including the ability to bleed the peasants, and their possible revolt. Pillaging of cloisters, buying now units, and drawing a chance card at the end of each year.<br/><br/>Marketed as a family game, but rather complicated for that.<br/><br/>",

Return those tiles to the pool and mix them.<br/><br/>Playing<br/>On a turn, place a tile on one of the seven sides of the disk. Then take a tile from the pool so that you always have five tiles in your hand. Play continues to the second player who can place a tile after the tile just played, or on any of the other sides of the disk. Then he takes a tile from the pool. Players continue taking their turns until someone scores.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Players score by making various poker hands: 1 Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, Straight, etc. (see POKER HANDS). The hands are formed by combining the last or &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; tiles in any of the paths leading from the disk.<br/><br/>Blocking<br/>When you do not have a tile that you can lay down to score points, you may want to block the other players from scoring.<br/><br/>5 Tile Plays<br/>Any time a player scores by creating a 5 of a Kind, Full House, Straight, Flush, Straight Flush, Royal Flush after receiving his points for that round, ALL of those tiles that were used to score are turned face down so that they cannot be used again. Players can play tiles from their hands off of the turned down tiles, as if starting from the beginning (tiles placed before the turned-down tiles cannot be used to form hands).<br/><br/>Note: Do not turn the tiles over upon creating 2 pairs and 4 of a Kind. This allows for the creation of a Full House and 5 of a Kind.<br/><br/>Jokers<br/>A joker can be used as a &amp;quot;Wild Card&amp;quot; to represent a ny tile. (Color does not matter - a red joker can represent a spade or club, etc.) The player that places a joker determines what tile it represents; the joker will remain as that chosen tile for the rest of the game. If another player holds the tile that the joker represents, he can play that tile as well.<br/><br/>Points Chart<br/>Some of the scoring in Star Poker differs from the scoring in the standard poker game. This is due to the probabilities of creating different hands.<br/><br/>1 Pair = 5 pts.<br/>2 Pairs = 10 pts.<br/>3 of a Kind = 30 pts.<br/>4 of a Kind = 75 pts.<br/>5 of a Kind = 100 pts.<br/>Full House = 40 pts.<br/>Straight = 50 pts.<br/>Flush = 50 pts.<br/>Straight Flush = 100 pts.<br/>Royal Flush = 100 pts.<br/>Blue Chips = 5 pts.<br/>Red Chips = 10 pts.<br/>White Chips = 25 pts.<br/><br/>Ending and Winning the Game<br/>Players continue until there are no more tiles to draw from and all tiles in their hands have been placed. In a four player game, once a player draws the tile that leaves two tiles left, the game ends after that player takes his turn. In a five player game, play until there are four tiles left and in a seven player game, play until five tiles are left. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The first player places one large object on Milton &amp; their turn ends.  The next person to play places the relevant accessory object and then also another large object on Milton &amp; their turn ends.  Play continues in this manner until Milton topples out of his hammock; the player who causes this event to occur is eliminated from the game.

Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).<br/><br/>Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.<br/><br/>You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each &quot;Dip&quot; rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the &quot;cancel dip&quot; die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sunny and Stormy Day is a cooperative game that encourages discussion of feelings through the metaphor of &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;stormy&quot; experiences. The game has 3 separate activities, a variant on the classic tile matching game, and a draw bag with tokens that ask for the players to discuss a part of their day, and a book that tells the story illustrated on the tiles.<br/><br/>The book tells the story of a day in the life Max the Hedgehog. During the day he experiences &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;stormy&quot; events. The draw bag contains 3 tokens, a sun, a cloud, and a rainbow. They ask the participants to share part of their day that was sunny, stormy, or to share something they are looking forward to. The book and the tokens support the game in teaching about emotions but are not a part of the game.<br/><br/>Twenty sunny and stormy scenes from the book are paired together to create 10 matching sets (for example having fun splashing in puddles and being cold and scared in the rain). The goal of the game is to find all the pairs. The rules state three variants of increasing challenge. Variant 1 is a cooperative matching game in which tiles are placed face up. Variant 2 is a cooperative matching game in which tiles are placed face down. In variant 3, Max's day is almost over and he is remembering the sunny and stormy parts of the day. He must find all pairs before it is night and time for bed. This variant adds 4 nighttime tiles to the cooperative matching game that when revealed require the players to add a puzzle piece to a night puzzle. To win the players must find all matches before the puzzle is completed (6 puzzle pieces). Night tiles are not removed from the board when revealed. There are 4 tiles and 6 puzzle pieces so if players remember where the tiles are they will win.<br/><br/>",

Everyone who finishes a correct Lulatsch within the same trun, gets the number of cards of his figure.<br/><br/>The problem is to decide when to add which cards to your figure, as you have only one action per round deciding wether to draw a new card while discarding an old one (either from the drawpile or one of the discardpiles) or &quot;build&quot; your figure.

Once built you can't change the features and you have to build from bottom to top.<br/><br/>There is another round until the first player gets 50 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rokada is an abstract strategy game which reminds chess a bit. There are actually 3 different games depending on the size of the board (55, 77 and 99, 5 times 5 squares, 7 times 7 squares  and 9 times 9 squares). Additionally it can be played as a parlor game (when the dice are used) or as a skill game without dice. The game is either for 2 players or for 4 players in which case two teams are formed.<br/><br/>First players choose which type of game is played and then they set game pieces on the board depending on the size of the board used. There are round and square pieces with different heights. In the parlor game the dice is used to tell whether the player may move round or square piece or if the player misses his/her turn. The object of the game is to reach the other players end of board or to eat the other player's every piece.<br/><br/>In the skill game the dice is not used.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives a number of cards which they place face down in a row in front of them. Each turn, all players turn their leftmost card face up and then pass them on to their left neighbor who places them face down at the right end of their row. The active player then tries to find the shoe card that shows the same shoe as the current shoe token. The further the player is from the start of the rope, the more cards he/she has to find.

This is done by placing the card representing this runner face-down but in an open location. Runners are distinguished by the colours of their sombreros. Rolling the dice, the players move either their runners or hunters around the multiple paths on the board. Taking care of special board spaces and certain limitations on movement, each player will be moving runners towards the end goal while trying to capture an opponent's runners with his/her hunters. When a hunter captures a runner, the player that was attacked reveals the hidden runner card. If the favourite was captured, the game ends. If not, a new favourite is secretly selected and the hunter must return to the start.<br/><br/>The main goal is either to stop the opponent's favourite runner or to make it to the end with your own favourite.<br/><br/>",

These range from losing money to moving backwards on the track.

These can be used to balance the game if younger players are involved or handicap players if the 'yougster' questions are considered too easy.<br/><br/>A nice trivia game, but limited to only 30 questions per category.

We toss half the deck on the table, sit down, then while the hourglass runs try to create different card combinations that bring us victory points (VPs).<br/><br/>One side of a Confetti card shows three differently sized and colored circles; by collecting cards with a small, medium and large circle of the same color, the player receives 1 VP. The other side has different shapes, but the idea is the same; a small, medium and large shape of the same color is worth 1 VP.<br/><br/>What makes the game tough is that you can take cards from the table only by using the fingers on your right hand and sliding them across the table.  You'll also need to use your left hand to hang on to cards already taken or else other players can steal them from you. Finally, any cards you collect that aren't used in a combination with others cost you 1 VP at the end of the game. (Bear in mind that any shape on a card can be used in only one combo!)<br/><br/>Confetti lasts three rounds. During the first and second rounds you can collect and keep six cards in your play area; during the third round nine cards. In between rounds, you can keep some previously collected cards, specifically a number of cards equal to the number of VPs you scored in the previous round.<br/><br/>",

There are four piles (thrones/kingdoms) on which to place all the cards remaining in the deck, one by one. The basic rule of thumb is to place higher cards on lower cards.<br/><br/>The face cards are unique, though, in that they will accept lower cards of certain suits. The Jack accepts a lower card of any suit, the Queen accepts lower cards of hearts or diamonds (love or money, respectively), and the King accepts lower cards that are spades (a soldier's sword).<br/><br/>The game is based on the idea that the four thrones are kingdoms, and you are placing people in power to maintain balance.

A piece of valuable advice to succeed at this game is...if it doesn't say you can't, you can!<br/><br/>Challenges come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and levels of difficulty. Be prepared to brainstorm anything from secret codes, analogies, or missing components, to puzzles, wacky wordles, and creative problems. Some challenges require creative, off-the-wall thinking. Some are logical, requiring a right answer. Others have several possible solutions. As you begin to associate each color/element with a particular type of challenge you may wish to avoid certain elements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Periodyx is a card game based on the Periodic Table of Elements. The game can be played by 2-10 players. Each player is dealt 5 cards, the winner of the game is either: The first player to hold 10 cards, or if one player loses all their cards the player who, at that point, holds the most cards. Cards are gained or lost among players or from a central pile. A Game indicator card with the titles of 11 games is passed around the players the holder of this card being the &quot;lead player&quot; in each of the 11 rounds thus making each round of play random, and different. The prime purpose of the game is to become familiar with the elements, players with more familiarity will stand a higher chance of winning.<br/><br/>The rounds listed on the Periodyx Game Indicator Card are:<br/><br/>1) Atomic Power!<br/>The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER Atomic Number wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>2) A-2-Z!<br/>The new lead player picks any letter of the alphabet and then asks ONE player of their choice if they have an element beginning with the letter they have named. If the asked player DOES have an element that begins with the letter the lead player asked for, they must give the lead player the card (or cards if they have more than one that begins with the asked for letter). This ends the lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player. <br/>If the asked player DOES NOT have an element that begins with the letter, the lead player asked for, the ASKED player takes the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; and adds it to the cards in their hand. <br/>This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>3) Hot Stuff!<br/>The new lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER boiling point wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. <br/>This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>4) Hi-Lo!<br/>The new lead player takes any one card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. From this card the lead player chooses ANY ONE of the stats from in the Stat Section (except the date stat) and predicts whether the next card turned over from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; will have a higher or a lower number in the same stat. Once the prediction is made, the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; is turned over and the two cards are compared. <br/>If the lead player has predicted correctly, they take both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. If the lead player has predicted incorrectly, both cards are given to the player on their left. <br/>This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>5) Neutron Countdown!<br/>The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand, and to read out loud the name of the element (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud that element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER number of neutrons wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. <br/>This ends this player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>6) Add-it!<br/>The lead player takes the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile,&rdquo; and adds it to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>7) Big Freeze!<br/>The new lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand, and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the LOWER melting point wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>8) Element of Surprise!<br/>The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to hold out their cards fanned-out, facedown. The lead player then takes ANY ONE card from the asked player, and adds it to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player. <br/><br/>    SPECIAL NOTE: The lead player cannot take the LAST card from any player.<br/><br/><br/>9) Early Bird!<br/>The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. They then predict whether the next card turned over from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; will have an earlier or later date of discovery than their card. Once the prediction is made, the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; is turned over, and compared. If the lead player has predicted correctly, they take both cards and add them to the cards in their hand. If the lead player has predicted incorrectly, both cards are given to the player on their left. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>10) Match!<br/>The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. They then ask ONE OTHER player to do the same. <br/>Now ALL of the players play at the same time and try to be the first player to spot how the two cards match, or are the same in any way. Are they both metals? Both solids? Do both element names begin with the letter &lsquo;P&rsquo;, any similarity can be a correct match. The first player to spot the match keeps both the matched cards. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>11) Natural/Synthetic/Atomic<br/>The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it facedown in front of them. They then ask ONE OTHER player to do the same. Both cards are turned over, face up at the same time. Check the Natural/Synthetic/Atomic symbols at the bottom of the cards: <br/>&bull;    Natural beats synthetic/atomic, <br/>&bull;    Natural/atomic beats natural <br/>&bull;    Synthetic/atomic beats natural/atomic. <br/>The winner takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. If it is a tie, both players keep their own cards. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>The Mendeleev Card<br/>If on a player&rsquo;s turn (before taking their turn), they can place a card next to the Mendeleev Card so that the colored bars match (see example) they may play that card on the table and draw 2 cards from the &ldquo;draw pile.&rdquo; If there are 2 or more cards in play on the table (this begins to form the periodic table). Any cards that match any of the cards can be played in this manner, drawing two fresh cards for each card played.<br/>Winning!<br/><br/>Two ways to end the game:<br/><br/>1) The first player to collect TEN cards in their hand immediately stops and wins the game!<br/><br/>2) The first player to lose ALL the cards in their hand stops the game. The player who, when the game is stopped, has the highest number of cards in their hand is declared the winner. In the case of a tie, the player who has the card with the highest Atomic Number wins.<br/>Ties or N/A!<br/>If during any round of play the stats are tied, the round is void, this ends the lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player, and the next game on the Periodyx Game Indicator Card.<br/><br/>If there is a N/A (not applicable) on a card, this round is void. Players have the option to keep a card with a N/A or to exchange it by returning it to the bottom of the draw pile and taking the top card from the draw pile.<br/><br/>There is an expansion book available with rules for 10 further games.<br/><br/>",

Points are awarded for holding meetings where only certain persons score (e.g. only the female, only the grandparents etc.). Every player (family) that participates in the meeting scores a certain amount of points for each scoring member.<br/><br/>Winner is the player who reaches the temple first (which is in fact the end of the scoring track).<br/><br/>Quite interesting game about forming different types of groups and so influencing not only the personal score, but also the score of the other players.<br/><br/>",

Starting in the clockwise seat from the dealer, each player has a choice to take The Return card or pass to the next player. If everyone passes 2 times, the round is closed.<br/><br/>The player who chose to take The Return is called The Sender. The Sender's team are the attackers (Contractant), the other team is designated as defenders (Defendant).<br/><br/>During the first selection round, the Return's suit dictates the Trump suit for the round. During the second selection round, The Sender picks between the Trump suit, no Trump, or all Trumps.<br/><br/>Then each player receives 3 cards, except the Sender who only receives 2 cards (The Return counts as the 3rd card).<br/><br/>At the end of the Deal, each player has 8 cards in his/her hand.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlay PhaseThe Opener starts the 1rst Trick and puts at the center of the table a card from his/her hand face up. Then, when his/her turn comes, each player must play one card face up.<br/>The one who starts may play any card from his/her hand, the suit of this card is the &quot;requested&quot; suit.<br/>The other players follow the rules below:<br/><br/>     When you have the requested suit<br/>         You must play a card of the suit and if the Trump is requested, if possible, you must play a Trump card that beats all previous ones.<br/>    <br/>     When you don't have the requested suit and one of your partners is &quot;Master&quot;<br/>         You can play any card of your choice,<br/>         Or, in order to become &quot;Master&quot;, you can Trump (play a Trump card) or Over*trump if someone has already played a Trump card.<br/>    <br/>     When you don't have the required series and the opposing team is &quot;Master&quot;<br/>         If you can become &quot;Master&quot; you must Trump or Over*trump,<br/>         If you can't become &quot;Master&quot;, you can play any card of your choice.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>3 principles to determine the &quot;Master&quot; card:<br/><br/>     The Trump prevails against normal suits.<br/>     Among the suits of the same rank, the requested suit wins.<br/>     In the same suit, the card of higher rank wins.<br/><br/><br/>Normal suits<br/>Rank<br/>    A     10     H     K     Q     J     9     8     7     6     5     4<br/>Value<br/>    12 pts     10 pts     7 pts     5 pts     4 pts     3 pts     2 pts     1 pt     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt<br/>The Trump<br/>Rank<br/>    9     8     7     A     10     H     K     Q     J     6     5     4<br/>Value<br/>    27 pts     22 pts     14 pts     12 pts     10 pts     7 pts     5 pts     4 pts     3 pts     0 pt     0 pt     0 pt<br/>The sum of the points is (3 x 44 pts) + 104 pts = 236 pts.<br/>When a Trick is finished, the one who played the &quot;Master&quot; card wins, puts the trick with hidden face in front of him/her and begins the next trick.<br/>When the players have no cards left, it is the end of the round.<br/><br/>A Bonus is an event, announced or not, which corresponds to a number of points that a team will add to its tricks points: The Bonuses help to fulfill the Contract.<br/><br/>     The Ten additional: 10 pts which are always awarded to the team that wins the last trick.<br/>     The Capot: 154 pts awarded to a team which wins all the tricks.<br/>     The KQ: 20 pts for the team of the player who has announced &quot;KQ&quot; during the round. The bonus is confirmed if:<br/>         A player had the Trump cards King (K) and Queen (Q) in his/her hand,<br/>         These cards have been played in this order: the King then the Queen,<br/>         This player has said &quot;K&quot; playing the King and &quot;KQ&quot; playing the Queen.<br/>    <br/>     The KQJ: 50 pts for the team of the player who has announced &quot;KQJ&quot; during the round.

At least, one of the teams wins the Ten additional.<br/>The team with the highest points at that time, fulfills the contract and wins the round!<br/><br/>Only the team that fulfills the contract scores its points rounded to the nearest ten:<br/><br/>     The totals which end between 1 and 4 are rounded to the under nearest ten (154 becomes 150).<br/>     The totals which end between 5 and 9 are rounded to the upper nearest ten (155 becomes 160).<br/><br/><br/>Finally, scores are added to previous scores.<br/><br/>In the next round, Opener (left of the Dealer) becomes the new Dealer.<br/><br/>In general, a game of KQJ is played in 1000 pts.<br/>Once a team reaches or exceeds 1000 pts at the end of a round, the game is over: this team wins!<br/><br/>",

Note that the Pink Panther moves on each player's turn.  Whenever the Pink Panther lands on a &quot;Trapped?&quot; space, a die against die check is made, re-rolling ties; if red is higher than white, the Pink Panther escapes.  Otherwise the player gets a Pink Panther card.<br/><br/>The players can enter the inner track, triggering &quot;Trapped?&quot; checks as before.  The risk, however, is that by landing on an &quot;Escapes?&quot; space, the player may lose a Pink Panther card (this isn't as bad as it sounds, since the space gives a card as often as it takes one).  If both the Pink Panther and the player land on an &quot;Escapes?&quot;/&quot;Trapped?&quot; space simultaneously, this is considered an automatic Escape/Capture.<br/><br/>On an &quot;Escapes?&quot; space, if you have two or more Pink Panther cards, you may go for the &quot;Big Chance&quot;.  This is a die check as above, the stakes being all of your Pink Panther cards against instant victory.<br/><br/>",

The one with the most gained cards in the end wins.<br/>Each player gets twelve cards and two cards that are the beginning of the tunnels. Then each player choses one card and discards faced down. The player with the highest number wins and is the first to place his card. It is important to only place cards to rows and columns in the same color (red, yellow, green, blue) and to place cards in the right number series. To gain points, the player has to complete a tunnel of four cards, which lay down in a row, a column or as a stack. The game ends if all cards are discarded.

Counters of different colors may capture each other, while two or more counters of the same color may form a Barrier that cannot be captured or passed.<br/><br/>There are also seven Ladders set on the board to reach across rings of the spiral. A counter which lands at the base of a Ladder will shoot to the other end, capturing any opposing piece in the Ladder's path.<br/><br/>The game may be based on the older and more complex Willy's Walk to see Grandmamma, which features a similar layout.<br/><br/>",

This is the key difference from Monopoly. In the exchange, one invests money for a commodity. Dice is used to determine if profits are made or lost. Other aspects (rent, movement, bonuses for all in a color group) are similar to Monopoly.<br/><br/><br/>Wheeler Dealer is notable for its customized editions. Most of the editions (but not all) were editions themed after small US cities and usually sponsored by the local Rotary Club, Business Association, or other local organization.<br/><br/>Although the components changed over time, Wheeler Dealer editions produced at the same time often had exactly the same cards, rules, paper money, player aids, etc. Only the board would vary. So a card might reference space B2, but the player would have to look at the board to determine if space B2 was Bob's Plumbing in Metropolis or Main Street Deli in Townsville.<br/><br/>",

Setting off from the pier, Will and Frank head for the island in search of the sea monster&rsquo;s treasure. Spinning the pointer will show you how far you may sail during your turn. On the voyage, you collect things that Will and Frank need for their adventure. They need binoculars to see the island a club for fighting off the sea monster, and the treasure map. Once you have collected all the necessary items and land on the island, you may search for the treasure. Watch out for the sea monster, especially for his long tentacles. If he tries to grab you then you have to go all the way back to the starting point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Parody of Italian politics in the '80s.<br/>Each player leads a party: one is the only honest party (never gets money, but can denounce the politics of the other players; he wins if at least 12 are arrested), one is a party that doesn't care any more about shame, corruption, etc. (he wins if no other player wins within 12 turns) and each other party is &quot;normal&quot; (can do favors, get money from illicit sources, etc. but gains point on the &quot;shame-meter&quot;: higher the shame and more likely is that the voters will vote for another player during the next elections; besides if the shame becomes too high the player is eliminated. They win gaining enough votes OR enough money).<br/>During each turn the players draw 2 cards each (cards can give money, give votes, move a party on the &quot;shame-meter&quot;: scandals give points, distractions, e.g. the Soccer World Cup is held in Italy, reduce the shame, etc.), then players vote to elect the President, receive money, face scandals, etc.<br/>During all the game negotiations can be done and they're never binding (sometimes you can be VERY mean, if you want to).<br/>Actions are resolved by either voting (each player has an importance based on the number of electors he represents, of course) or with dice rolling.<br/><br/>",
