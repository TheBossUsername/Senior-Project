        "description": "Legio VI Constantiniani is a set of miniatures wargames rules aimed to allow large battles of Roman Late Imperial period (AD 250-600) to be resolved relatively quickly. It's meant for 6mm figures but could easily be adapted to larger (or smaller!) figures.<br/><br/>The rules are derived from the same designer's Comitatus set of Dark Ages rules, but slimmed down to allow larger battles to be fought in less time. Troops are classed a relatively small number of troop types with minimal differentiation based on equipment; the focus is on troop quality and, especially, generals' limited means of controlling their forces.<br/><br/>The rules are freely available from the designer's webpage, along with sister sets covering adjoining periods:<br/><br/>Legio VI Julia Augusta, for 100 BC to AD 250<br/>Legio VI Macedonica, for 400-100 BC<br/>Legio VI Diadochi, for Alexander and the Successors<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In IndieDev, players are independent video game developers trying to earn prestige in the game industry by creating and releasing critically acclaimed game projects.  Players will juggle the many aspects of running an independent video game company, including completing side jobs to gain extra income; taking courses to  improve abilities; figuring out how to afford marketing;  investing in marketing in order to increase market visibility. Did the game bomb on release?  Players should make the most of the situation, never giving up.  Did the game earn critical success and sell? Players must take that hard-earned cash and use it productively; otherwise players will end up struggling once again.<br/>Players that work through the multiple challenges effectively will triumph within one of the most challenging but rewarding industries.  The player that earned the most prestige will win this game and of course win at life (Mostly win, they still will devote most of their waking life to their next project).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take the roles of agents during a conflict between two fictional superpowers.<br/><br/>On each turn a global event card is flipped. Every global event card reveals a crisis which can tick the doomsday clock (represented by eight scoring cards) closer or further from humanity's destruction - these global events also affect the relationship between the two superpowers. Players vote to determine the outcome of each global event card.<br/><br/>With these votes players must balance two (sometimes conflicting) goals - players must both ensure humanity's survival and complete their own unique hidden agenda.<br/><br/>The game ends when the doomsday clock reads entirely red (signalling humanity's destruction) or entirely blue (signalling humanity's salvation). At this point each player reveals their hidden objective; players who have completed all their objectives win the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Play as Biff the scared wrestler, Spiff the rubber sword-wielding teen, his mom Ivanna and her charms, Randi the out-of-work model, Yodel the chef, or many others.<br/><br/>WAPLEworlds is similar to a dungeon crawler game in that players move their characters, members of the Waple Family, around an 8x8 tile, while encountering Bad Guys and exploring exotic locations such as Pepe's Motor Lodge and the Scam and Save Pawn Shop. Yes, it is comedy themed.<br/><br/>The starter box includes eight playable Waple figures and their Hero Cards, 25 Bad Guy Cards and their standees, over 40 item cards, over 20 Something Happened cards, Mission cards, 12 location tiles a WAPLEworld &quot;newsletter&quot; with rules and pre-made scenarios, 10 dice and money, damage and level tokens.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, he moves his character and can perform an action: search, confront a Bad Guy, use a card, or enter a building. Confronting a Bad Guy can mean to either fight him, bribe him, or run away like a chicken.<br/><br/>Confrontations with Bad Guys: Fighting, Bribing and Running Away, are all controlled by dice rolls based on the stats listed on both the Hero's and the Bad Guys cards.<br/><br/>After that, if not in combat, the player will draw a Something Happened card and execute what it states. If the player enters a location he rolls a die to see if a Mission is currently available there. If it is then he may try to resolve it to save that area by placing the appropriate new tile and Bad Guys onto that tile with the Waple and any that join him.<br/><br/>The third phase of a turn is for any Bad Guy that the player is controlling to either move peacefully or attack the player.<br/><br/>A game can be played with a simple one tile and one mission limit to up to five tiles and over a dozen missions completed, based on the time limit the player wants.  Missions increase in difficulty by placing more Bullies (minions) along with the Big Shot (boss) on the Mission tiles.<br/><br/>On the first tile everyone starts at level 0. After the tile's mission is cleared, all Waples level up and can enhance their skills in the way the player wants, increasing dice rolled for certain stats. Bad Guys level up and roll one more die per level as well. On the second tile the Waples search and complete two missions. The game progresses as such until the final Scenario Mission has been conquered.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Golden Islands&quot; - a gambling and fun game with easy rules for 2-4 players, age 8+, in which you take on the role of the captain of the ship. You will plow the ocean, exploring the islands and collecting gold coins. Of course, it will not do without battles with other captains! Despite the seeming simplicity, the game has many strategies and options for progress towards victory!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is collecting gold coins. To win, you need to collect more coins than other players.<br/><br/>On your turn you will travel between islands (you choose your way), fight with other players and, using dice, play different events (good or bad).<br/><br/>Turn sequence:<br/><br/>Players turn consists of three phases: moving, battle and event.<br/><br/>- Moving:<br/>        Move your pawn to any neighboring island (including any starting position). You can move only vertically or horizontally (orthogonally). If another player is already on the island, go to the battle phase. If the coin is on the island, pick it up and put it in front of you, then go to the event phase. If the island has neither a coin nor another player - go to the event phase.<br/><br/>- Battle:<br/>        If you moved to an island on which another player is already located, it means that you attacked him. Proceed to battle. Each player has three health markers that represent the state of your ship. The battle consists of a series of rounds - attacks. Both players roll one die each. The player, who has less value, gets damaged and turns over one of his health markers. If both players have the same values, the dice are thrown. Attack is repeated until one of the players turns his last, third, health marker - this player lost in this fight. After the end of the battle, the winner takes half of the coins from the loser (rounding up), and the loser returns to his starting position. Players reverse their health markers (repairs the ship). If the losing player does not have a single coin, the winner does not receive anything. This ends your turn.<br/><br/>- Event:<br/>        The event is played if you moved to an island on which there is no other player. Throw three dice and play the event which corresponds to the rolled dice value. This ends your turn.<br/><br/>",

Can it be that you set up the tactic that leads to the goal? Are you ready?<br/><br/>Regardless of the game variant, it&rsquo;s about being the first to defeat another army, so there are no more cards in front of an opponent. Always keep in mind that a wrong move may allow another player to win the game.<br/><br/>On your turn: Pick up two cards from the middle of the pile (or your own - depending on the game variant). You can attack with the face-up cards you face. You can play some action cards in your hand at any time (during an attack or while another player's turn takes place), others only when it's your turn. Once you've completed your attacks, you can reveal up to two face-down cards (or just one or none at all) and put them forward and replace them with hand cards. A maximum of 3 cards may be revealed and two cards face down. Think good of your strategy, because if you make too many attacks, you may not be able to defend yourself.<br/><br/>If an attack is made and it succeeds by higher value, both cards are placed on the open stack in the middle. If the attacker's army card value is lower than the defending card, the attack failed and the attack card is placed on the open stack in the middle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Although it&rsquo;s not necessary to play the missions in order, should players wish to do so, a short narrative campaign is included in the game.<br/><br/>Gain weapons and armour from the chests scattered about the rooms on-board in your attempt to defeat the forces of space pirates that are attacking your ship.  Missions have different objectives ranging from simply surviving a massive rush of pirates or escorting a VIP, to securing and defending vital parts of your ship.<br/><br/>Do you take on the role of a marine and attack the enemy head on or the role of medic or engineer and assist your fellow players in staying alive as wave after wave of blood thirsty pirates swarm the ship.  Maybe you are the voice of command and as captain organise the others to follow you.  Perhaps you want nothing more than 2 really big guns and a singular purpose and take the role of the robot.  Maybe you are stealthy and tactical and can take on the pirates with nothing more than a chefs cleaver?<br/><br/>Each crew character starts with 3 action points which they can then spend freely on either moving, combat (melee or ranged) or on a special action, though only one special action maybe completed per person per turn.  Special actions include healing, repairing doors, searching chests and trading etc.<br/><br/>Characters gain further actions and special abilities as the &quot;Alert Level&quot; on-board ship increases.  While players start with a modicum of gear as play progresses they may pick up and trade items to suit either their own play style or that of the persona of the crew member they are playing.<br/><br/>Want to design your own campaign where you keep the items on your character and progress through your own customer scenarios?  This is entirely possible with Repel Boarders modular double sided game tiles, corridor tiles and board connectors.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Background knowledge of batter statistics is advantageous. <br/>The game is handmade by the designer and consists of a 6 inch round piece of wood depicting a baseball diamond with cribbage peg holes around the baselines. Players are represented by team-colored cribbage pegs.<br/><br/>Pegboard Baseball can only be played when watching a baseball game on TV or at the stadium. The main reason you need to be watching a game is because fouls count for one peg movement. The best way to tally foul balls is by watching (or listening to) a game.<br/><br/>The score of the actual baseball game you are watching is not related to the score in Pegboard Baseball.<br/> The movement of your peg depends entirely on what the batter does at the plate. Any contact between the bat and the ball is awarded by movement of your peg.<br/><br/>How to start:<br/><br/>Choose two pegs that represents your team and the opposing team. Place the two pegs on home plate.<br/><br/>The visiting team will start on the top of home plate (top of the innings) and continue around the bases on that line. The home team will start on the bottom on home plate (bottom of the innings).<br/> What it looks like<br/>when you are playing:<br/><br/>The person representing the batting team holds the pegboard.<br/> Choose a goal for your game.  <br/>Possibilities include:<br/><br/>--Follow an entire game and the player with the most points, plus furthest distance, wins.<br/>--Play for an equal number of innings and see whose peg traveled furthest (points plus distance). For example, prior to starting announce, &ldquo;We are going to play for three innings.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Peg movement depend on<br/>what each batter does at the plate.<br/><br/>Foul Ball = 1 peg movement<br/>When the batter hits the ball foul, out of play, that equals 1 peg movement.<br/><br/>Inplay Out = 2 peg movements<br/>When a batter hits the ball in fair territory, but the batter is out. This includes pop flies and ground outs.<br/><br/>Single = 3 peg movements<br/>When a batter hits the ball and is safe at 1st base.<br/><br/>Double = 4 peg movements<br/>When the batter hits the ball and is safe at 2nd base. Also, ground rule doubles.<br/><br/>Triple = 5 peg movements<br/>When the batter hits the ball and is safe at 3rd base.<br/><br/>Home run = 6<br/>Two run homer = 12<br/>Three run homer = 18<br/>Grand Slam = 24<br/> Bunt foul = 2<br/>Bunt infield but out = 4<br/>Bunt single = 6<br/><br/>Optional Scoring<br/><br/>Optional scoring prior to play:<br/><br/>For more peg movement: see directions<br/>For less peg movements: see directions<br/><br/>Optional scoring during play:<br/><br/>Prior to any at-bat (or inning), a player can wager for more or less peg movements based on a hopeful outcome. Experienced fans may know when good players are coming up to bat and decide to risk their peg's movement.<br/>Players are encouraged to be creative in their wagers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The enemy guards are constantly on the move, so the players must look for the opportune passage to strike.<br/><br/>In Penny Assassin, you start as a lowly member of a gang. As you travel about the town of Rorcester, you get stronger and more powerful. Missions that took multiple turns in the beginning can be accomplished in a flash, at the end. This leads to a mad dash to the finish. Only one can become The Most Awesome Assassin.<br/><br/>1-4 players get 3 actions each, per turn. Players can move unlimited spaces around the board, until they need to perform an action, such as hiding, climbing, or shooting. Events bring new missions and orders for the guards and coppers. Completing missions brings nickels. Nickels and pennies gained can be used to move closer towards victory, or for gaining more power and better tools of the trade. This brings the battle of risk versus reward, as players vie for the best strategy to take down the targets.<br/><br/>Different characters, skills, abilities, weapons, and setups give lots of options to take down the many targets.<br/><br/>Can you become the Most Awesome Assassin?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Extra attack and defense cards can be added to a nerd in battle, where their IQ value is the amount of extra cards they can add.  A nerd's attack and defense values can also be boosted by adding a confidence token.  Defeat 4 nerds and you win!<br/><br/>Everyone starts the game with 2 nerd cards, 4 battle cards, and 4 random confidence tokens.  At the start of a turn, draw 1 nerd card, or 2 battle cards. Then choose to pit your nerd against an opponents' to start a battle, or simply play an action card.  If you start a nerd battle, choose the player you want to attack, and put your nerd into play.  Add battle cards to your nerd to increase their attack defense, keeping the number of cards at or under their IQ value.  At this time, a confidence token can also be added to the nerd.  If the token matches the nerd, they get a permanent +2 to attack and defense.  If it's unmatching, it's only a +1 to those values, and is discarded at the end of the battle.<br/><br/>Then, the opponent needs to put a nerd into play to defend the attack.  If they can successfully block the attack by getting enough defense to equal or be greater than the attack, they not only don't lose, but they may be able to add enough attack cards to counter attack and defeat the attacking nerd.  They are still limited by the nerds IQ, but can also add a confidence token.  Either way, the losing nerd hides in the winners basement (an area under the play area) and gets turned sideways.  After the battle, all battle cards are discarded, but any nerds that didn't lose stay in play, face up.  Discard down to 7 battle cards, and it's the next player's turn. First player to get 4 nerds in their basement wins!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hero Team Quest is a co-op game designed for young children.  Very few board games that kids are exposed to emphasize cooperation and team success.  With Hero Team Quest, all the players compete together and the outcome of victory or defeat is shared by all players.  The goal is to defeat the wizard before time runs out (when the goblin gives the crystal of magic to him).  The goblin moves 2 spaces on the board every round, closer to the end.  Players must get to the end and defeat the wizard before he gets there.<br/><br/>Players first form a hero team of four characters and each may obtain a magic power at the magic school - each power is a weakness of one of the four bosses in the game.  As they move across the board, they look to avoid losing a turn by stepping in mud.  Players stop on the battle spaces to roll the dice to defeat the various bosses.  Certain powers will make the chance of success better for some characters.  If you should lose, you go to the cage where you must roll a 1 on your turn to pick the lock.  Otherwise, other players may come to your rescue if they should defeat the boss OR they can decide to continue on the path if time is of the essence.<br/><br/>The game does offer some choices and teamwork/communication, but is ultimately a simple game designed for young kids that is easy to follow.  From a complexity standpoint, it's a step up from games such as Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry, etc. - but in a genre that most kids enjoy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players play either scandal cards or cover-up cards. A player then chooses which scandal to reveal, hoping the next, bigger scandal is just around the corner to occupy the press. If they can't play a same level (number) of scandal or higher, they have to pick up all the revealed scandals.  If you play the same level (i.e. same number) of scandal as your opponent, they can stack and give you special bonus actions.<br/><br/>Eventually, once you've eliminated of all your hidden scandals, you can finally get to putting those nagging open scandals behind you, knowing you will not be the last one left in the press.<br/><br/>There are no winners in this game of politics, with only the last one left holding onto scandals being indicted and losing.<br/><br/>",

The Dealer flips over a green &ldquo;IF&rdquo; card with the beginning of a conditional statement, like &ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up your butt &hellip;&rdquo; The other players each play one &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; card face down to the Dealer. The Dealer shuffles the &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; cards and then reads each &ldquo;IF/THEN&rdquo; combination:<br/><br/>&ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &hellip;&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;THEN we're in for a big, sloppy surprise&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &hellip;&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;THEN these blueprints are all wrong&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &hellip;&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;THEN my new nickname is 'Sharty McFly'&rdquo;<br/>The Dealer picks a favorite &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; card and reads the winning IF/THEN combination out loud:<br/><br/>&ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &hellip;&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;THEN my new nickname is 'Sharty McFly'&rdquo;<br/>The player of the winning &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; card gets a point. Everyone draws back up to 5 &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; cards, and the player to the left of the Dealer becomes the Dealer for the next round. You can keep your winning &ldquo;THEN&rdquo; cards to keep track of your own score. The first person to reach 5 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Toxic Logic is great for parties with 4 or more adults. You and your friends will have hours of laughs putting together &ldquo;IF/THEN&rdquo; statements which are absurd and so funny. Remember, &ldquo;Toxic Logic&rdquo; is not for kids! Some of the cards are filthy, and some of them are bizarre. While there is plenty of adult language and potty humor, rest assured that there is no racist or hate-based content. We want it to be fun for all adults! Put it all together, and you've got almost endless hilarity.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player places a bone on the playing surface to form a square base, then each player in turn places a new bone on the pile.

In this case, there is no bonus for playing the last bone.<br/><br/>The game is packaged in a plastic barrel similar to Barrel of Monkeys.<br/><br/>",

A geography game played on an authentic and colorfully detailed world map. Fun and educational for teens and adults.<br/><br/>The game comes with four different categories of card (flags, general, capitals, countries).  Players roll and move their pawn on a track.  Each space on the track represents the color of card that must be answered.  In order to move again on the same turn, players must answer their trivia cards correctly.  For flag cards, players are shown a country flag with three possible answers on them.  They must choose the correct answer to move again.  General cards ask various questions related to physical or social geography.  Country cards ask players to identify what country is being referred to on the map (each country of the world has been numbered on the board).  Finally, players must identify the capital city of a specified country when they land on a country card.<br/><br/>To win the game, the player who lands on the finish space and answers one final trivia question correctly wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Get Organized is a mafia-based card and dice game.  The goal is to accumulate 100 or more points by collecting &ldquo;Industry Cards.&rdquo;  Each player begins with 1 of each industry card in play (Strip Clubs, Drug Trafficking, Waste Management, Money Laundering, Gambling Ring and Law Enforcement).  Each turn begins with a &ldquo;Collect&rdquo; phase, where the player takes $200 from the &ldquo;stash.&rdquo;  Then there is a &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; phase, where they player may choose to purchase more industry cards (kept in their hand for now, but not in play) or bullets to attack with.  Next is the &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; phase, where the player can choose to roll dice to &ldquo;shoot the bullets&rdquo; at another player&rsquo;s industry cards.  If a 4+ is rolled, the player takes that card and adds it to his/her industry cards in play.  Finally, there is the &ldquo;Build&rdquo; phase, which is when a player may play one industry card that was purchased earlier.<br/><br/>The first player to accumulate 3 of any one industry card in play, &ldquo;owns&rdquo; that industry and gains the benefits of it (for example, the person who owns the Gambling Ring gets to roll a die during his/her collect phase and collects $100 X the number they roll, in addition to the $200 they already collect).  Every time an industry is taken over, the player who now owns it gets to pull a &ldquo;Good Earner&rdquo; card, which can be saved and used at any time (for example, there is a bullet proof vest, which makes bullets only hit on 5&rsquo;s and 6&rsquo;s for one attack phase).<br/><br/>After each round, the player with the most industry cards in play (not counting the ones purchased but not played yet) is the &ldquo;Rat.&rdquo;  They must pull a rat card, which almost always has a negative action that must be taken.  The Rat goes first in the next round, which isn&rsquo;t always a good thing.<br/><br/>Each industry card in play is worth 5 points, but once the player owns the industry, all the cards within that industry are worth 10 points for that player.  The game ends when there are one or more players over 100 points at the end of the round (the one with the most points wins).  If someone gets over 100 points in the middle of a round, others can attack that player to reduce their points to less than 100.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Once your candidate has earned the electoral points (states) needed to win, then you win.<br/><br/>It's easy to learn, hilarious to play, fast-paced, more fun than the actual elections, and without long-term consequences!<br/><br/>Here's how you actually play the game:<br/>After rolling the dice to see who goes first, in turn order everyone selects a Candidate.  Each Candidate comes with its own unique special ability.  Everyone gets starting money, 3 Event cards, and 3 Situation cards.  Players (in turn order) draw a State Card to see which they will be competing for that turn.<br/>Your Candidate will collect a campaign salary for the turn.<br/>You will then draw an Event card and a Situation card from the decks.  Now you can play as many Event and Situation cards from your hand as you want:  some are useful playing on yourself, others are fun to use to mess with the other Candidates.  Your goal here is to earn money and popularity points.  The more you have, the better the chance to win the State at the end of your turn.  After all of the card play, everyone competes for the State.  To win the State (and its electoral points), you roll the die, add in your popularity tokens to the roll, and subtract any negative points from Scandal cards that other players may have dropped on you.  The player with the highest net total wins that State.  Game play proceeds like this until one Candidate has enough electoral points to win the game.  (The number of points needed to win is determined by how many players are in the game.)<br/><br/>It's straightforward and easy to play - a typical game of 4-5 players taking about an hour.  This game never bogs down, doesn't require political knowledge, does not take any political stances, and is not designed as an educational game about politics. This is a fun little game about winning by accumulating points and messing with your opponents to prevent them from doing the same!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You can play 3 to 8 players (ages 16 and up), starting off with a decision of whether to get to work or go get educated (sound familiar?).  But from there this game diverges from humdrum life, as you move your token along the board you can get to do and experience things that maybe you only wish you could do, or in some cases - wish that you could avoid!<br/><br/>How the game plays:  <br/>Once everyone has their starting money and figured out who goes first, each player will decide whether you want to obtain an Occupation that requires a degree or one that does not.  Both sets are unique.  You will start your turn by drawing a Redefine card.  Then you will use your Occupation Special ability (if applicable) if you want. The Occupation abilities are funny and unique to each job.  You'll roll the die to see how many spaces to move your token on the game board.  (Yes, this game does feature that old-school notion of rolling dice for movement.)   <br/>Then you and other players can start using Redefine cards on yourself or on each other.  These &quot;wild cards&quot; can have a fun and unexpected effect on the game - either helping yourself, helping others, hindering others, or downright messing with the other players in funny ways.  You will move your token forward on the game board, following the instructions on the space you land on.  Usually this means you draw a card from a specific deck and follow its instructions.  Then there can be another round where you and other players can use Redefine cards again.  <br/>And that&rsquo;s about it &ndash; this is where your turn will normally end, and on it goes until you reach the Get Done space, cash out, and wait to see who has the most money (cash, properties, other assets).  If you have kids, you can cash them in for money at the end - because children can have value!<br/><br/>Whoever has the most money at the end, wins!<br/><br/>The typical game of 5-6 players will take about 2 hours to complete.

        "description": "Expect!, previously known as Experience:Streetwar or XPSW, is a surprisingly swift, match-n-tactics card game for 2-4 players.<br/>Players build color groups from their cards on a 5x5 grid, to score as many points as possible, and mix in useful effects to gain more options.<br/>Card positioning and the board itself plays a key role in the gameplay - the game quickly changes from easy score-grinding to fight over last positions, and back.<br/>The finish line is set to 100 points, whoever finds the quickest way to beat it, gains control over the grid :)<br/>Expect! the unexpected. Easy to learn, interesting to discover, challenging to master, coated in nice comic-based design and tested on humans.<br/><br/>",

Grab a Turkey Leg for an energy boost, purchase a Royal Pass to cut in line, or shop for the finest Souvenirs of your trip to the past. Claim the weekend&rsquo;s best experiences and be crowned Ruler of RenFest!<br/><br/>Hex tiles build out a board of activities in seven types, such as Shoppes and Taverns. Each set of seven tiles forms a Grove, and the board contains one grove per player (3 to 6.) Parking spots line the edge of the groves, or a player can choose to save money by parking remotely and taking an extra turn to reach the activities.<br/><br/>Turns move quickly as the clock advances through the three nine-hour days of a long weekend at the RenFest. The starting player advances a clock dial piece one hour before each round.<br/><br/>The first player to reach each event has the option to claim the spot for the day. At the end of each day, the player with the most activities claimed in each grove scores points. Each player has only six Stamina per day, representing the energy needed to experience an activity. Stamina can also be used to run up to 3 steps to get ahead of other players.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players score scaled points for collecting sets of the same activity type from multiple groves.<br/><br/>A limited supply of money must last the whole weekend. Shoppe tiles sell Souvenir cards with bonus points and special abilities. Food tiles allow purchase of extra Stamina for the day.<br/><br/>At the Royal Court space, players can buy Royal Pass cards that allow claiming an event that has already been claimed.<br/><br/>A player can choose to use their turn to leave early, making them starting player for the next day. Turn order is the final tie breaker.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Everyone plays as the world's incompetent criminal underbelly, all trying to gain street cred for a crime none of you committed.<br/><br/>Players can play as a set character with traits or a new one made up on the spot. The players draw evidence cards, create a play pile for the game and keep a hand of three pieces of evidence they can swap in. Every game has one specific crime, from stealing the Mona Lisa from the Louvre, to Replacing church bells with maracas.<br/><br/>Each round a piece of evidence is turned over and every player has to construct a unique story of how they left that at the crime scene. As the rounds go on more evidence must be woven into your stories trying to keep them as consistent as possible. But watch out, if you mess up and your story stops making sense other players can wager their street cred to call you out on it. You&rsquo;ll need to convince everyone at the table that you&rsquo;re making sense to not lose face (and points).<br/><br/>At the end of the game a Story Winner is chosen and players count up their street cred. Whoever has the most cred earns bragging rights for this crime.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players take cards from each of three decks:  sets, props, and characters.  They must then develop a quick story including each of these random elements.  One player each round serves as the director.  He/She takes a card indicating a direction or goal for the winning story - that only the director knows.  Players tell their stories, and the director chooses the best one.  The winning storyteller receives $1, which may be used as a victory point, or to choose a different card when telling a story.

Every card has a cartoon illustrated monster, with some having trigger abilities that occur at various points in the game.<br/><br/>Players take turns playing Monster or Bonus cards to both destroy opponent&rsquo;s cards and score the most points. Each Monster type has a strength and weakness against another type. Bonus cards can be played instead of a Monster card, providing unique advantages. The player with the highest score after all cards are played wins a Monster Bite. Cards are then reshuffled and the next round begins. The first player to 10 Monster Bites wins.<br/><br/>[Gameplay]<br/>Beginning Phase:<br/>Each player draws 6 cards. Then, each player takes 3 cards off the Draw pile and places then face down in a row across from each other. When ready, flip over each card and determine the winning Monster. Monster cards battle directly across from each other.<br/><br/>Play Phase:<br/>At the start of a player&rsquo;s turn, they may choose to discard 1 card in hand and draw 1 card from the Draw pile.<br/><br/>Next, the player plays 1 card immediately to the left or to the right of one of their cards in play. If they have no cards in play, they must play a card across from one of their opponent&rsquo;s cards. When playing a Monster Card, if their opponent has a Monster Card directly across from their Monster Card, they begin the [Battle]. When playing a Bonus Card, no battle occurs.<br/><br/>This completes their turn and it is now their opponent&rsquo;s turn to play. Continue alternating turns until all cards in hand are played.<br/><br/>",

This is because the AI difficulty has been designed around the &quot;core&quot; product.  This is mainly because the Trade Agreements with Colonies will give the player a fairly large advantage with the Planetary Expansion.<br/><br/>This expansion is comprised of a total of 18 cards for the one (1) player experience. It features a 12 card initial deck and an 6 card development deck which makes the solo experience harder as the game progresses.

        "description": "Free game published in the January 2018 (GTM #215) issue of Game Trade Magazine.<br/><br/>The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Muses Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.<br/><br/>Background:<br/>The Nine Muses of the Old World were crafted as courtly educators and advisors, always on hand to help the young princes and princesses reach their full potential. &ldquo;Nine Virtues&rdquo; is<br/>a card game about excelling in all the best aspects of life.<br/>In the game of Nine Virtues, players try to collect hands of<br/>the most valuable virtues, and to take pride in owning them.<br/>But the greatest risk is to claim a virtue you do not possess!<br/>The game is played in rounds, with each player dealing once.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/>A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.<br/><br/>Each Round: <br/>Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. Then deal two cards per player face up into the center of the table. For example, if there are five players, deal ten cards face up in the center.<br/><br/>Turns:<br/>Play starts on the dealer&rsquo;s left and proceeds clockwise. On your turn, you must do one of the following:<br/><br/>Bid: Take a card from the middle of the table and keep it<br/>face up in front of you. This is called &ldquo;taking a bid.&rdquo;<br/>Exception: The 1 is wild, and can&rsquo;t be taken as a bid.<br/><br/>Swap: Exchange a card in your hand with a card in the<br/>middle. The card you take goes into your hand.<br/><br/>Kill: Choose any card in the center and discard it. You<br/>cannot do this until each player has had one turn.<br/><br/>The round ends when there are no cards left in the center.<br/><br/>Scoring: <br/>The player who holds the most cards in each rank scores points equal to that rank. For example, you will score four points if you hold the most fours. (Bid cards are not in your hand.) If there is a tie, all tied players score the full value.<br/><br/>Calling the 1: <br/>Before scoring begins, the player who holds the 1 must declare what rank it will become. It is important to do this before players reveal their hands.<br/><br/>After this, go up through the ranks and determine who has<br/>the most of each. You can set cards aside to tally your score.<br/><br/>Bids: Each bid you make is a claim that you will hold the<br/>most cards of that suit. If you have the most (or are tied for<br/>the most), then each bid card is worth its face value. If you<br/>were wrong, then each bid is worth negative points. If no one holds any cards of the bid rank, then all players are tied at zero. They score zero points for cards in their hands, but bids in that rank are worth their face value.<br/><br/>Final Score: A full game is one round for each player. The<br/>player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

You will write scathing reviews of entertainment properties, spreading vitriol while also refining your unique identity. In other words,score points with cards and win if you have the most.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/>A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Setup: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. Players will then draft a hand of five cards, because all good games start with a draft.<br/><br/>The Draft: <br/>From your starting hand of six, choose one card to keep, and pass the rest to the player on your left. Keep your selected cards on the table in front of you. You will do this five more times, but rather than passing the last card, you discard it.<br/>Each player should now have a five-card hand. With this hand you will now play five rounds.<br/><br/>Each Round:<br/>You will play cards trying to score points. The highest unique card wins each round.<br/><br/>First, deal one card from the deck face-up into the center of the table. This card represents a new entertainment property that some group of misguided fools have poured their hard work and time into, but which is an insult to all true fans of the genre.<br/><br/>Players will then &ldquo;review&rdquo; the property by playing a card from their hand. This play is simultaneous. The number on the card represents (roughly) the amount of spite and vitriol in your review.<br/><br/>Next, the reviews are scored. First, discard any cards that match the center card or that match each other. These reviews are unoriginal and worthless.<br/><br/>Next, look for the highest card among the reviews that remain. The highest number wins the round,but the lower numbers also score points.<br/><br/>If your review was unique, whether it is the highest or not, you keep it aside for points. In addition, the player whose review was highest (not counting the discards) scores the card from the center.<br/><br/>If all reviews were duplicated and were therefore discarded, the center card is also discarded.<br/><br/>Winning: <br/>The highest total score wins the hand. If there is a tie, count it as a win for all tied players.<br/><br/>The first player to win three hands wins the game!<br/><br/>",

When the game starts, depending on the number of players, a number of landmarks are drawn from the landmark deck and placed on the board as places for the players to travel to and collect. Once a landmark is collected by a player, however, the other players cannot collect that same landmark and a new landmark is drawn from the deck and placed on the map.<br/><br/>During a turn, players must choose to collect resources, travel, or use a free ride card. When collecting resources, they may choose any one of the available tickets (bus, rail, high-speed rail, or airline) or all of the cash currently face up in the resource pool, called the panhandle. New cards from the resource deck replace those that were taken. To travel, a player spends the required resource cards from their hand to move from one city to another city, matching resource cards to the method of travel required. Some cities are connected to one another by rail or road, others by high-speed rail, etc. Cash allows a player to buy any of the various means of travel. On a free ride turn, the player gets to utilize a rail or bus connection for free (without spending any resource cards from hand) by using a free ride card that is available in the panhandle.<br/><br/>Landmarks have three traits: Type (entertainment, natural, historical), region (Alaska, Hawaii, Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, Southeast) and alignment (represented by a number: 1-100). In order to win, a player must be the first to collect any one of the following sets: Any 8 landmarks; 2 of each type of landmark; 5 landmarks from different regions; or any 3 landmarks that have a matching alignment number (only the last digit of the number is used to determine).<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

They must explore the island to gather resources (food, water and fuel), with which they can escape in the Nautilus.<br/><br/>Captain Nemo has also hidden his marvelous inventions around the island, and player can use clues to dig up those treasures. Gathering resources and digging up treasures earn the player victory points.<br/><br/>But Nemo has also hidden booby traps around the island, and if enough of the traps are triggered, the volcano on the island erupts and covers the island with lava. If the players escape the island before the lava covers the island, then the player with the most victory points wins, so players must work together to gather the resources needed to escape, but also work independently to dig up treasures to win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The purpose of this book is to provide a simple set of fast moving rules, to simulate battles using model soldiers in the &ldquo;HO&rdquo; scale.  This Scale is also referred to as 1/72nd or 20mm, and these figures are the most commonly available (and cheapest) on the market today.  As such, it should be easy for the tactically inclined gamer to find armies of whatever time or country he or she may be drawn to.<br/><br/>These rules favor simplicity over &ldquo;realism&rdquo; and provide a fast moving and exciting style of play. They give you the feel of a historical battle ... without the death and tragedy of the real thing.<br/><br/>With this game, you can test your knowledge and understanding of strategy and tactics, while you enjoy the company of like-minded friends.  You can reenact actual historic battles or create your own unique scenarios.  The game is quite open-ended and has a lot of possibility for surprise, intrigue, fun and (hopefully) victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from rulebook<br/><br/>",

Like Yahtzee, the scorecard is divided into upper and lower sections. The upper must be completed before anything in the lower can be done.<br/><br/>The upper section sets your Base Salary. You choose which number you are going for (1's through 6's) and roll all five dice. Count the ones that match what you are going for. You can continue rolling the 5 dice and adding more of your chosen number (1-6), thereby increasing your salary. One of the dice has &quot;IRS&quot; in the 1 position. If it ever comes up your turn is over and you only get half of the income you've accrued for that number.<br/><br/>The lower section lets you add extra income via Stock Options, Profit Sharing, Capital Gains, and a Tax Refund. Those rolls are also negatively effected if IRS come up.<br/><br/>Once you add your Base Salary and extra income you get your Total Income. You then have to roll for an Audit. Depending on your roll you will subtract money leaving you with your Take Home Pay. Highest Take Home Pay wins.<br/><br/>You record your scores on a pad of 1040 Forms.<br/><br/>Comes in a 2pc dice cup that doubles as case.

The rules have been written with 1/1200 scale models in mind, their inspiration being the models designed by Outpost Wargaming Services and others.<br/><br/>The rules mainly use six sided dice (d6), with ten sided dice (d10) used in some circumstances. Unless specifically stated otherwise all die rolls use a d6. Sometimes a d3 roll is called for. In this case roll a d6 and halve the score, rounding up (so a 1 or 2 gives  a result of 1, a 3 or 4 gives a result of 2, a 5 or 6 gives a result of 3).<br/><br/>You will need (in addition to models and a playing area) a handful of dice, a ruler measuring in inches, pens and paper. Ship damage states are denoted by markers. Suggestions for more visually attractive markers are given later in the rules. Also included at the end of the rules are sailing templates for caravels and other sailing ships.<br/><br/>-description from Wargame Vault<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to The Game of Oppression: Poe&rsquo;s Law (GoO) a darkly, sardonic game focusing on inclusive gaming through humor. Similar to Cards Against Humanity in comedy style, in GoO you play a troll on the internet trying to prove you&rsquo;re the most oppressed snowflake of them all. You are a troll though so your complaints aren&rsquo;t about real issues but things you&rsquo;ve made up in your mind. Your friends, evil trolls that they are, are also trying to prove they&rsquo;re actually the most oppressed and stop you from gaining the win. Most importantly though the Game of Oppression: Poe&rsquo;s Law is about inclusive gaming. Almost everyone will find an image of themselves somewhere in the deck.<br/><br/>The goal of GoO is to gain the most Oppression Points (OP) and/or to be crowned King of the Snowflakes. Game play is simple turn-based competitive point grab. There are three to five rounds per game depending on the number of players. Each game is approximately 30-90 minutes in length.  During your turn you&rsquo;re allowed to play up to three Cards of Complaint (CoC) worth between 3-5 OP. Additionally, you may play up to one Special card per round. All CoCBlocks are worth -3 OP and one may be played per Card of Complain. Every CoCBlock though can be countered with a DoubleDown worth a single point. Any item on the table not in the SafeSpace may be stolen through judicious use of the special Yoink card. After each round all players draw up to the hand limit of five so you&rsquo;re never low on ways to prove how &ldquo;abused&rdquo; you are by the world.<br/><br/>Storytelling is an important element of the inclusive comedy of GoO. After playing a Card of Complaint you explain your story that goes along with the card. The story is built upon via blocking and then finished via DoublingDown. Each CoC can contain one tiny snippet of story for the group to discuss and share. While you do not have to include storytelling to play the game one of the main goals of the Game of Oppression is to share with your fellow trolls. Prove you&rsquo;re the most oppressed troll ever to gain the crown.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "That's So Wrong: Caveman Edition is the first in what is hoped to be a long series of strategic party games that you can learn quickly, but spend years mastering. The game system offers so much substance that you can play them forever and ever until you die and pass them on to your children. Traditional standalone games usually make you pick one: they're either easy to pick up, but don't have enough gameplay to keep experienced players engaged; or they're loaded with depth, but tough to get into.  That's So Wrong: Caveman edition was designed to keep experienced gamers entertained, while maintaining simplicity so new players can jump right in.<br/><br/>Players start the game by building their tribe from a random set of 4 caveman. Once all players have done this, players can send their caveman out to the &quot;wild&quot; to fetch items which in turn help make your tribe stronger. Conflicts happen when your caveman and another player's choose the same item, cave woman, event, caves to live in, or dinosaurs to hunt. If this happens conflicts begin and are resolved by looking at the text of the card. Follow the simple instructions to determine the winner. Winners take the prized possessions back to their tribe.<br/><br/>Certain cavemen and items are better at accomplishing different tasks. Some cavemen are good at hunting, some are good at finding love with the cave-ladies, and others are less practical. Some are even perfect for winning conflicts.<br/><br/>Cavemen who successfully accomplish their mission by being uncontested or winning a conflict become exhausted and they (and their spoils of discovery) are unable to be sent back out again until the following turn. Managing who is exhausted and how many cards are in your hand (which can be expanded with the discovery of a new home/cave) is important to claim victory. As your tribe grows rich with items, powerful dinosaur hunts, cave-woman, and pets you'll be able to win more conflicts and cause more mayhem for other players.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players add up the value of the cards they've collected and a winner may emerge.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pilgrim cavalry charges! Desperate attacks on fortified settlements! Daring ambushes! These are just a few of the skirmishes you can fight with 1676 - a tabletop miniatures game set in New England during the Native American uprising that became known as King Philip&rsquo;s War.<br/><br/>The types of conflicts that occurred in King Philip&rsquo;s War were usually small skirmishes that can be represented on a tabletop with these rules. You can play a native war party or a force from the Army of the United Colonies. If you want to add &quot;fell creatures,&quot; magic, &amp; (gasp!) European powers, there is a supplement available with these additions (Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen).<br/><br/>The core rules are provided in only 5 pages. They are simple &amp; straightforward. Simple die rolls - using 6- &amp; 8-sided dice - are used to resolve combat &amp; other actions. Most actions have the same target for success, so they are resolved quickly.<br/><br/>You can use one of the pre-made &quot;armies&quot; provided in a second PDF (Part Two), or can create your own balanced forces using a simple point build system. Part Two includes unit cards, sample army lists, &amp; all the tokens you&rsquo;ll need. Alternatively, premade Unit cards, Command cards, &amp; (Mis)Fortune cards are now available from The Game Crafter.<br/><br/>Both books are illustrated with photographs of figures from Brigade Games' King Philip's War line. With these figures (supplemented by those from other manufacturers), you can now easily field beautiful forces in miniature to represent the combatants.<br/><br/>So heed the call to arms! Your colony or tribe is depending on you!<br/><br/>",

There are two PDF downloads included with your purchase: a 36 page rulebook, and a 45 page book of army lists and rosters. You can use one of the six premade armies, or create your own force with a comprehensive point system. The game has a historical &quot;feel&quot; through the use of Assets specific to different types of characters &amp; units. Optional &quot;otherworldly&quot; rules are included to take advantage of some of the outstanding figures available for this period. Color photographs of figures from Conquest Miniatures, Eureka Miniatures, AW Miniatures, &amp; Warlord Games, as well as structures by Acheson Creations (all used with permission) illustrate both documents.<br/><br/>Part One contains the game rules (summarized in a 4-page Quick Reference), Assets to personalize your troops (Abilities &amp; Characteristics, Weapons, Artillery, Special Unit Members, Equipment, Vehicles, Animals, &amp; Structures), Liabilities, Otherworldly Assets (including Divine Interventions), Templates, Markers &amp; Tokens, &amp; optional Event Cards.<br/><br/>Part Two contains brief historical information, Army Lists, and Unit Cards for the Indians, French, British, Canadians, &amp; American Colonials. There is also information on Bears, Dogs, Zombyes, &amp; a few other optional (but fun!) non-historical additions to the game (inspired mainly by figures from Conquest Miniatures). There are six sample armies, &amp; information about how to create your own troops &amp; armies.<br/><br/>",

Example: There is a Bridge made of Glass in China, would you walk across it? Predict correctly and points are gained. Every time 3 points are accumulated, an Earthly Card can be drawn, which contain certain clauses on them that can be used on yourself to get ahead, or against other players to keep them down. First player to 30 points wins!<br/><br/>Intuition of your peers is put to the test, as the most instinctive player is the most likely to win.

This educational tool explores themes of belonging, identity, discrimination and culture in a hands-on experiential way.<br/><br/>Refugee Journeys is based on a simple &quot;snakes and ladders&quot; game concept - players move forward, backward, or miss turns based on the cards they draw or the spaces they land on. Cards include integration experiences of real refugees, drawn from academic research, news and media, and the game creator's personal experiences. Examples are: &quot;You are 65 years old. You want to learn English, but the topic is always about finding a job. Move back a space.&quot; &quot;You were sponsored to a rural area, where there is no bus transportation. You always have to ask for rides. Move back two spaces.&quot; &quot;Your child has made a friend at school. Move forward a space.&quot; Players move through the game using an &quot;Identity card&quot; which details their country of origin, family background, housing situation, gender, and many other identity markers. As they move through the game, their identity influences the path they take. For example, one space on the board says, &quot;Are you Muslim? Move back 2 spaces.&quot; The game critically highlights experiences of discrimination and profiling.<br/><br/>While the goal of Refugee Journeys is for players to move from the &quot;start&quot; to the &quot;finish,&quot; the real purpose of the game is to establish a space for critical conversations about refugee experiences, integration, and the intersectionality of identity. To this end, after every experience card is played, players choose a discussion question from options printed on the board to talk about as a group. The discussion questions cover topics related to identity, injustice, policy, and allow for players to share their personal experiences with the topic.<br/><br/>",

For example, if the players know northern Italy very well, central Italy a little but, and southern Italy/islands not at all, all 24 of the northern Italy tiles can be selected, only 8 from the first level of the central Italy group, and none from the southern Italy/islands group, for a total of 32 cards in all.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Weltindor's Stones is a fairly simple game to win, despite it actually being lightly complex. The board is set up with nine platforms, each of which is split into a 3 by 3 grid. The platforms are all set out about 3 inches from each other, and connected by bridges, which are 1 tile long and create choke points. The corners are elevated about 1 inch off the ground, which gives an advantage to the player on them by giving them a higher chance to attack successfully. Each player is given a corner and the board to the left of the corner. The corner itself is named the lead board. On each of that player's platforms, there will be one stone, which can be moved by other players by having three individual units on the same tile as that stone. The overall point is to get 5 stones to your lead board.<br/><br/>A single turn consists of placing five units and moving them as a group or single unit 5 times. A move can also be spent attacking an adjacent square. Different units have different abilities, such as being able to attack from 2 tiles, or moving 2 tiles at once.<br/><br/>5 basic soldiers can come together to form a barracks, which essentially acts as a factory allowing extra units to be placed at the beginning of your turn. Barracks have to be hit 5 times to be destroyed. The leftover neutral platform in the middle acts as free land to establish barracks for anyone who can get there.<br/><br/>Action cards are abilities that cost mana (You get 1 mana at the beginning of your turn.), and can be played whenever they are needed, not specifically on your turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

And would the former still let you talk as an adult, and if the latter were true, what would happen if you grabbed onto a fast moving car? This game is about creating and fine tuning the most difficult choices in order to split your friends right down the middle!<br/><br/>All players start with a hand of five cards, each with a different scenario on, and during a round each player gets the chance to be the 'chooser', picking two cards to present to the others as a choice. All the other players must then ask at least one question to define the rules of each choice, with the goal of the chooser being to answer them in such a way to make them even more difficult to choose between. When a player has made up their mind, they take a 'decision card' and can no longer contribute to the discussion, and when all decision cards are gone, an immediate vote takes place. If the players split their votes as evenly as possible, the chooser wins!<br/><br/>This is as much a discussion mechanic as it is a game, focusing as much on creativity, humour and considering the implications of each situation as it does on winning!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

There are three marked zones across the playing board. Each zone has both an eastern and western color course. Each zone should contain 2 stacks of corresponding game cards, marked EAST and WEST, placed face down on their allowed geographical spaces. There should be a total of 6 stacks of game cards on the playing board.<br/><br/>THE PLAY... Play begins with each player rolling die. Highest roll starts from Florida coast first. Second highest goes next and so forth. Speedboats progress across the board according to the roll of the die. When a player lands on a space marked X he/she must pick a game card form the corresponding zone and comply with the requirements before returning card to bottom of respective stack. Players are to draw NO MORE than one card per turn.<br/><br/>MOTHER SHIP &amp; YOU'RE BUSTED... &quot;Mother Ship&quot; counts as one space to board and load. After reaching the &quot;Mother Ship&quot; each player must decide upon the quantity ( 1 or 2 bales) he wishes to load. The quantity of the load decides the degree of risk. If a player carrying 1 bale back to Florida draws a &quot;You're Busted&quot; card he/she must replace the bale back on the &quot;Mother Ship&quot;, return his/her speedboat to start in Florida and try again. Two busts and player is out of the game. A player who risks to smuggle 2 bales on one trip back to Florida is automatically out of the game upon drawing a &quot;You're Busted&quot; card. (Exception see Pay Off Cards). The first player who successfully smuggles 2 bales back to Florida either on one trip or several is the winner.<br/><br/>PAY OFF CARDS...

This was the closest that we were ever able to walk amongst these creatures &ndash; until now.<br/>    <br/>    Through ground breaking use of recreating DNA, scientists have been able to bring these creatures back from their millions of years of extinction.  Theme parks are now being built for every man, woman and child to gaze upon these animals in their natural habitat.  You have been tasked to design the ultimate dinosaur theme park with the hopes of it becoming the World&rsquo;s Most Incredible Theme Park!<br/><br/>Through two Eras, you will be tasked with drafting cards to build a Dinosaur Theme Park.  By strategically placing Herbivores and Carnivores around your park, you will attempt to outscore your opponents by collecting Victory Points (VP).  However, dinosaurs alone will not be enough to win the game.  Attractions and Rides will need to be built to increase your income, and you&rsquo;ll need to build around the natural geography that your park is built upon.  Oh, and let&rsquo;s not forget about security, otherwise all those people you are bringing into your park may not be able to make it out and let others know how incredible your park is.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Noisavni Invasion is a light, science fiction skirmish game for two players. It consists of eight scenarios that can be played individually or linked together in a campaign telling the story of a conflict between identical mecha forces across mirrored dimensions. With only two pages of rules, it&rsquo;s ideal for both inexperienced wargamers and seasoned veterans who want to have a series of quick, fun battles.<br/><br/>Players drive the action through a strategic hand-management system that gives them partial control over the order in which units activate - both their own and the enemy&rsquo;s &ndash; adding a layer of command confusion. The scenarios specify changes or exceptions to the standard rules and explain the game end and victory conditions. Some scenarios even let you &quot;shift&quot; your units between the parallel dimensions, adding a simulated 3D experience!<br/><br/>The game adds fresh ideas while incorporating familiar wargame concepts such as zone of control, supporting fire, attacker losses, and advances after combat, tucking them into the mechanisms in subtle ways that make it easy for novice players to understand.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need to print and cut 2 map sections, 10 unit standees, and (optionally) 10 Turn Tokens. The components come in two sizes, and you&rsquo;ll only need to print one or two pages depending on the size you prefer. You&rsquo;ll also need a regular deck of playing cards or a handful of six-sided dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

And no one likes a loser.<br/><br/>So, if you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to bribe a cop, claim oppression, impersonate an officer or claim conspiracy in the comfort of your own home, Guilty!

Don&rsquo;t make any noises, for if the humans wake up, they&rsquo;ll bring their brooms and you&rsquo;ll have to run away empty handed.<br/><br/>Game Description<br/>Shhhhh!!! Bocadillos de medianoche (&quot;Shh!

This is achieved by moving food tokens from the kitchen to a nearby window, but the bigger the food looted, the noisier the racoons will be and chances are they might wake the dog up. If the dog is fully awakened, it will start barking and the residents of the house will wake up.

After each player chooses a pawn, they roll the dice with the greatest number rolled getting a three space starting advantage on the game board and the role of video operator. The video operator poses the questions in the booklet and operates the remote for the VHS player.<br/><br/>To play, the video operator reads aloud the next question in the booklet. Each player offers an answer starting with the video operator and going clockwise. Players must offer a different guess than one already offered by a previous player or pass one&rsquo;s turn. When everyone has made a guess or passed, then the video operator plays the VHS tape which reveals the proper response. If a player has given the correct answer then that player rolls the die and advances that many spaces on the game board toward the finish. The first player to reach in the finish is the winner.<br/><br/>The Video Trivialities game contains 258 questions. There is at least one expansion with a question booklet and another VHS cassette.<br/><br/>",

There is a single path through this map.<br/>The second part of the board are fields at the border of the board with fields known from Monopoly. Instead of streets this are chapters from the New Testament. There are some special fields where you have to ask questions from the bible.<br/><br/>The game starts at the start point of the map track. The actual player roles 2 die and moves. dependent of the points on the die he gets questions from different stacks of cards (all from the bible). If he knows the answer he gets the points written on the card.    <br/>When the track ends the figure changes to the Monopoly kind path. Like in Monopoly you can by the fields, but not with money but with the points you have collected with the right answered questions. You have to pay parking fee for fields owned by other players. As in Monopoly you can increase the parking fee by placing houses (they are named red and white stones here.<br/>Running out of points and area cards you may change back to the Mediterranean Sea path 1 time to get points answering new questions.<br/>The game ends after a predefined time. The player with the most points wins (including value of area cards and stones).<br/><br/>Variants (mentioned in rules):<br/>1. Just role the die and run first the Mediterranean Sea path and after that the Monopoly path. The first player who comes to the Start of teh Monopoly Path again.  <br/>2. Bible trivia: Just use the question cards. Who has the most points at a predefined time wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players continue battling until one obtains 10 Cash Cards ($1 Trillion worth) and successfully deposits their full Trillion into the bank. You can only obtain sufficient Cash Cards for victory by Bankrupting opponents' Billionaire Cards.<br/><br/>Billionaires range from a sentient computer from Neato Prime, who philanthropically solves global problems, to a space traveling asteroid miner from the Bermuda Wormhole dimension.

Players may use one of the pre-built decks, or each player's deck may be customized before play begins. Trillionaire was designed from the start to be both highly customizable and strategic.<br/><br/>There are four categories of cards which make up each deck:<br/><br/><br/>     Cash Cards - Worth $100 Billion each, these cards are the heart of the game.

Without them, your Billionaires wouldn't be able to do anything.

It moves one or two squares diagonally in any direction and can jump over a friendly SOL to an unoccupied space.  It captures forward only.  It can be promoted to KING upon reaching the far rank by turning it over and inserting it into an opposing SOL.<br/><br/>The ZAM has complicated movement and capturing abilities and restrictions.  It can move one space diagonally, or two diagonal spaces not in the same line.  It captures by leaping (with certain restrictions).<br/><br/>The KING can move in any direction.  It can move one or two squares diagonally or two squares vertically or horizontally.<br/><br/>The rules are presented in the form of fourteen laws.<br/><br/>The game comes in a small box.

        "description": "Jibe is a strategic matching card game.<br/><br/>The Cards<br/><br/>There are twelve icons, each with a different point value. Each six-sided card has either two sets of three identical icons or one set of six identical icons. The cards with six identical icons are known as a &ldquo;core&rdquo; cards. There are 80 unique cards. There are four colors associated with the icons. Each color is shared by three icons.<br/><br/>The value of each card is the sum of the values of each icon set on the card and is displayed in the center of the card.<br/><br/>The icon set values are as follows: Can=0; Joker=0; Beakers=5; Pencil=10; Bulb=15; Note=20; Star=25; Heart=30; Plane=35; Gear=40; Key=45; Fire=50.<br/>Play<br/><br/>There is a core card for every icon. Every round of the game is started by placing a core card in the center of the playing surface. You can play just one round, or you can play multiple rounds, starting with a different core card each time. Choose it before distributing cards to the players.<br/><br/>Deal five cards to each player. During your turn, play one card from your hand by matching the colors or icons with cards already played. If you just match the color(s), you can only count the value of the card you laid down. If you match the icon(s), you can count the value of your card plus the value of each card(s) where the icon(s) matched. All colors must match, except when a joker is played.<br/><br/>If you play a core card during your turn, you can play another card during your turn to match it.<br/><br/>After your play, you replenish your hand by drawing one card from the pile. If you play a core card and are able to match it with another card from your hand, you draw two cards.<br/><br/>If you can&rsquo;t play or choose not to play during your turn, pick up one card from the pile.<br/><br/>Jokers are wild. They can match any icon and each of the three Joker core cards can be used to match six cards at once. They have no point value when played, but make sure you play them, because their value switches to 100 points and count against your score if left in your hand.<br/><br/>Record your score after each play. Keep playing until all the cards in the pile are drawn. Then play until someone has played all their cards or until no other play can be made. Each player then adds up the card values left in their hand and subtracts the sum from their score.<br/><br/>If you play multiple rounds, you can add the scores from each round to determine the winner. Or, you can treat each round separately, award a point to the player with the highest score for each round, and the winner is the player who won the most rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dojo Sensei is a worker placement game set in the future on a fictional Japanese island called Meiyoshima. In this game, you are a sensei opening a new dojo, trying to make a name for yourself and your school.<br/><br/>In Dojo Sensei, you will make decisions that will customize your dojo, your fighters, and your students. You will carve a path to victory and honor by training students, turning fighters into warriors, putting on demonstrations of your skill, constructing and remodeling your dojo how you see fit, investing in different martial arts styles, competing in various martial arts competitions, and of course proving yourself in the Kumite!<br/><br/>Players are in control of 3 different types of workers - Sensei, Trainers, and Champions that will be placed on the main board and in their dojo.  The Sensei is a trainer that you can customize with bonuses or even break the rules.  The trainers are the majority of your workers and they will build your dojo and train your champions.  Champions are workers that are placed in competitions - forms, breaking, and weapons - that when resolved, will earn you victory points.  You can add more trainers and more champions to your dojo, but you will first have to start training them as students in your dojo.<br/><br/>Tableau<br/>     Champions - players are able to customize up to three champions.  Their basic stats - Strength, Finesse, and Mastery.  As well as use trainers, to give their champions new maneuvers.  These maneuvers are the deck-bulding / card management of the game.<br/>     Dojo - your Dojo is a player board that you will customize by placing different shaped tiles on it, that will slowly bring your dojo to life.  These tiles will give you actions and bonuses in the game.  Here you can decide if you want to focus on income, on building strong champions, on performances, on specific competitions, and many more.<br/><br/>Every play of Dojo Sensei will be different.  The goals you are reaching for to end the game will change, the tiles available to build your dojo will be different every turn.  The maneuvers that are available in the temples to train your champions will be different. In order to win you will need to both focus on how you will bring honor to your dojo, but also be flexible enough to react to your opponents and the conditions on the main board.<br/><br/>",

All our cards are large 2.75 x4.75 inches (standard tarot size) with high-quality materials. One vs. One, Light vs. Darkness, opposing powers and conflicting factions compete to shape the future of Planet Lyra.<br/><br/>Galatune is an anime battle tabletop card game set on the fantasy planet of Lyra. The United World Government maintains peace and prosperity through the monopoly of advanced ancient technologies, but utopia comes at a steep cost. Will you join with the government to protect unity, or will you join the rebels and fight for freedom and independence?<br/><br/>2-5 players each lead a Champion warrior into battle and earn a Victory Point each time an opponent is defeated. You win the game by being the first to earn 3 Victory Points by defeating 3 opponents. BUT there's a twist! The game doesn't end for you when your Champion falls in battle. Instead, you just get back up on your feet, respawn your Champion, and continue fighting! Think of it as a sort of card-based battle-royal, like a Battle Arena game, where you play for KOs.<br/><br/>Unlike other battle card games where players take their turns one-at-a-time, in Galatune everyone attacks simultaneously! It's an exciting formula that keeps the game moving and encourages players to predict and react to each other in real time.<br/><br/>Great game for first-time gamers or serious pros! Easy-to-Learn, impossible to master!<br/><br/>",

At the same time, players take the top card from the pile and turn it over in front of everyone.<br/>If there are at least 2 farm animals and/or at least 2 wild animals, the players concerned must make the noise of their animal. The fastest one to do this correctly picks up all the face-up cards and puts them with their cards.<br/><br/>",

As the very pinnacle of the tumultuous Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War, the Battle of Grunwald marked victory for the Polish-Lithuanian alliance, who decisively defeated the Teutonic Knights.<br/><br/>All of the lavish illustrations presented in the game are taken from a digital restoration of Jan Matejko's Battle of Grunwald - a painting which, more so than any other, gives insight into the fury and chaos of the battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The five categories in full are;<br/>Eten en Drinken (Green) - Eating and Drinking<br/>Geschiedenis (Yellow) - History<br/>Sport, Spel en Vakantie (Orange) - Sport, Games and Holidays<br/>Kunst en Cultuur (Red) - Art and Culture<br/>Stad en Land (Blue) - Cities and Countries<br/><br/>On each card the category questions are in a different order. On the back of each card are the answers. You play in rounds. The Round Card is placed on the bottom of the deck. You start with the first question on the card you have just drawn. If the Round Card is on the top of the deck, you put it back on the bottom and then ask the second question, and so on until 6 rounds have been played. On the question cards there are also commands, recognizable because the icon box is blank. These commands are on the lines of &quot;Change a Souvenir to a different colour, Lose a souvenir, and so on.<br/><br/>The Question reader is the player to the left of the player whose turn it is. If the question is answered correctly, the player receives a souvenir in the same category of the question. If the player answers incorrectly then that player must lose a souvenir (if he has one) in that category. The question card is then placed on the bottom of the stack and the turn passes to the next player in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>Maximum number Souvenirs<br/>The number of souvenirs that a player may have in a category is a a maximum of '2 players - 3', '3 or 4 players - 2'.. If a player gets a question in the category of which he already has reached the maximum, then he can choose a souvenir of any other category if he answers correctly. At the end of your turn you can exchange any 2 matching souvenir cards for one in any other category.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to get souvenirs in all 5 categories<br/><br/>",

Rules for Delusion Shichinarabe, Delusion Daifugo, and Delusion Chinese Poker are introduced in this package, but more games can be played with it.<br/><br/>When you play a card, you just name a card out loud. While playing, each player holds a suit-and-rank matrix, and mark what that player has played. Judging from your matrix and your memory, when you think another player has just made an illegal play (playing the same card twice, 5th card of the same rank, and so on), you may challenge that player. You win the game if the challenge is correct, otherwise you lose. You may win the game by winning the played card game normally.<br/><br/>You can adapt other playing card games into it with your own ideas.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>妄想トランプは「カードを使わないトランプ」です。<br/>プレイヤーはトランプのカード一覧が示されたメモを持ち、自分の使用したカードだけをメモします。<br/>この状態でトランプのゲームを行い、普通にゲームに勝つか、他の人の間違いを指摘できたら勝ちになります。<br/>（逆に、指摘が外れたら負けになります）<br/>トランプ＋記憶の、トランプゲームの新しい遊び方を体験してください。<br/><br/>ルール説明では「妄想七並べ」「妄想大富豪」「妄想十三張」を記載していますが、トランプなのでいろいろな遊び方ができます。<br/>いろいろな遊び方を探してみてください<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a House Plan that shows eight rooms: Living Room, Dining Room, Family Room, Kitchen, Bath, Master Bedroom, Child's Bedroom and Garage.<br/><br/>The goal is to purchase Construction cards for each room to complete the house. Each player starts with $18,000, but this amount is a &quot;mortgage&quot; that must also be paid back in order to win.<br/><br/>In order to build a room, a player's token must move to the Home space and draw a Construction card. This may offer a chance to build a specific room at a certain price; if the player cannot afford, does not want to pay the price, or already has built that room, his turn ends. Construction cards may also direct a player to draw and act on a card from the Risk/Option deck. Players may stay at the Home space as long as they wish and continue drawing a Construction card each turn.<br/><br/>Since the initial mortgage is not enough to build the entire home, players must also spend time &quot;working&quot;. This involves starting from the Work space and rolling 2D6 around the board. Players earn $200 per space moved, and continue to work until they are able to reach the Home space. Board spaces have various events with bonuses and penalties dealing with home-building issues like strikes and permits. Players may also choose to play the stock market instead of moving, drawing a card from the Stock Market deck that either wins or loses money.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Extended Broadside is like a classic Battleships game on steroids. Instead of having two players placing their hidden fleets on a 10X10 grid, this one is played by four players on a huge (36&quot; across) octagonal board in which each player has a five-sided slice of 160 numbered squares.<br/><br/>The board, vertical dividers, posts and spacers are all of wood. The ships are gorgeous metal and wood miniatures, with carriers, battleships, cruisers and liners about 6&quot; long, and destroyers and submarines about 4&quot;. Each player gets two of the large ships and one of the small ones, and may place them either orthogonally (covering 5 and 4 spaces respectively) or diagonally (covering only 4 and 3 spaces).<br/><br/>Each player also has an island (same size as a destroyer), two minefields and an airplane. Before normal shooting starts, each player calls out the location of his island, and any island intersecting with any other player's ship(s) cause a grounding equal to a single hit, and the placing player gets a free additional shot. Then each player calls out the location of each one-space minefield: any ship on any of these squares is sunk instantly. These spaces are marked on all boards as hazards and are permanently blocked. Finally, each player gets a shot with a plane, which requires only one additional hit of any kind to sink a ship (an aerial hit on a grounded ship would sink it).<br/><br/>Finally the regular shooting begins. Each player calls out the number of a space, and hits any ship on that space on all other players' boards. A hit grants another shot. Once all spaces occupied by a ship are hit, it sinks and is removed from play. Players may also choose to use a more powerful air or mine attack, but lose their next one or two turns for doing so. Finally, unlike any traditional game of this type, this game allows a player to move a ship to a new location instead of shooting.<br/><br/>The game appears to have been hand-crafted, since the ships are all of slightly different sizes with a unique storage insert for each in the box. The only indication of a publisher is a coat of arms with a Greek motto on the wooden box. The use of a carrier with monoplanes suggests that it was made in the mid-1930s, shortly after the traditional Battleships game appeared under multiple titles including Broadside.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Exploring space. Grow your wealth. Become the richest.<br/><br/>In Star Pioneer you play intrepid pioneers seeking out new riches in the great expanse of unknown space.<br/><br/>You will explore new regions, trade with newly discovered inhabited worlds, search for mineral deposits and manufacture super commodities from strange new materials.<br/><br/>With some luck and careful strategy you will be become the richest pioneer in the galaxy.<br/><br/>The Basics<br/><br/>You start with 100,000 Galactic Dollars (GD) and your rocket on a map card. As you play you will lay down new map cards expanding the playing area. Most map cards will provide a new opportunity to earn money and you'll get some money just for exploring.<br/><br/>Planet map cards will let you trade one of 3 commodities; water, food and ore. By buying at planets where the price is low and selling at planets where the price is high you'll make a profit. Easy! But be warned that the prices are not fixed. When any player buys or sells, the price will go up or down due to demand. Additionally, prices have a chance to fluctuate on their own, this can happen locally on a single planet or galactically for a single resource. A good trade route won't stay open for long, but without risk there is no reward.<br/><br/>Planets also have resource points that let you buy resource cards. These are expensive long-term investments as you'll need two or more before you can make a profit from them. There are also only a limited number of resource points, so make sure you get them before your fellow players. The investment can be worth it as a good hand of 3 or 4 resource cards can win you the game.<br/><br/>Mineral Deposit map cards offer good earning opportunities for those feeling lucky. The smaller mineral lodes are easier to find than the big ones. You could spend several turns just floating in space looking at rocks before hitting the mother lode.<br/><br/>The player who reaches 1,000,000 Galactic Dollars first wins, so don't spare the rocket fuel and get earning if you want to be the best Star Pioneer!<br/><br/>(Rules Summary)<br/><br/>There are 24 hexagonal map cards, each divided into three lozenge-shaped movement spaces. There are 2 blanks, 4 wormholes, 8 planets, and 10 mineral deposits. In a four-player game, the starting map consists of two side-by-side planet cards.<br/><br/>The three Commodities on each planet (Ore (red), Food (green), and Water (blue)) have prices indicated by a correspondingly coloured die (1 to 6), in units of 10,000 GD. Additionally, each planet (except the starting one(s)) have D3 Resource Points (yellow), indicated by Resource tokens.<br/><br/>On a player turn, they first roll two dice. If the total is 7, reroll the Commodity prices of the closest planet(s). If a double was rolled, there is a 'Galactic Crash' of a specific Commodity (1-2 Ore, 3-4 Food, 5-6 Water). Reroll the Commodity price of the affected commodity on all planets.<br/><br/>Next, the player moves their ship, up to 3 spaces. Wormhole spaces are connected to all the other Wormholes on the map. If they explore (move off the map), they draw and place a map card, oriented as they wish. This earns the player 10,000 GD.<br/><br/>Finally, the player can perform one action (out of 3 possible ones).<br/><br/>The player could Prospect if on a Mineral Deposit space. These are rated from 1 to 5. When Prospecting, the player must roll greater than that number to find the mineral deposit. If unsuccessful, nothing happens. Otherwise, the player earns 50,000 GD times the Mineral Deposit's size, and the Deposit is marked as exhausted (black token).<br/><br/>The player could Trade if on a planet. A player's ship can carry up to 3 Commodity tokens. If the Commodity price is 2 or less, the player can only buy. Once the player has bought or sold, the price is adjusted. If the player sold, the price goes down 1 (but no lower than 3); if they bought, the price goes up 1 (but no higher than 6).<br/><br/>Finally, the player could buy a Resource Card if on a planet with remaining Resource tokens. The player pays 50,000 GD, removes one Resource token, and draws a Resource Card. You can only buy one at a time.<br/><br/>Resource cards are used to make Super Commodities. At any time during their turn, a player can reveal 2 or more Resource Cards to produce a Super Commodity. Its value is the sum of the base numbers on the cards multiplied by the highest multiplier on the cards. The Resource Cards are then discarded.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

One player is the caller and draws letters at random from their set, calling them out. All other players take the same letter from their sets, and place in one of six columns, trying to make words vertically. Tiles may not be rearranged, but completed words can be removed to score, or left in the hope of making them longer with subsequent tiles. Words must be at least four letters and score one, with an extra point for each additional tile, and one bonus point for the longest word of the game.<br/><br/>The game's date is uncertain, but judging from the typography is late Victorian.

In reality the Germans did have an interest in Antarctica. In 1937 Germany sent an expedition aboard the MS Schwabenland, primarily for the purposes of establishing a whaling station. The German venture to Antarctica is fraught with myth and so for the purpose of making an interesting expansion (NEU), we are going to write a bit of alternative history:<br/><br/>The German exploration of 1937 was surprised to find a high volume of low-salinity water flowing from a wide opening in the glacial ice on the Prince Martha Coast. Miles of navigable passageways in the Antarctic interior lead to an enormous geothermal heated lake. The Germans quickly established a submarine base and fortress in Antarctica and mapped passages all through the south polar ice cap. Antarctica quickly became a base for submarine operations against South Africa and Australia. Later in the war the German &ldquo;Base 211&rdquo; served as a research laboratory for top-secret projects and a redoubt from which the last vestiges of the Nazi empire could hold out.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It is a testament to the horrific effects of these weapons that they considered too brutal for use in the Second World War. However, these weapons were at times used clandestinely by the Axis. The Japanese used them against China and the Italians used gas against the Abyssinians.<br/><br/>On the eve of World War II the production capacity of many nations far outstripped its World War I capabilities.  Germany, which could produce about 40,000 tons of gas per year in World War I had the capacity to create 184,000  tons by 1939.  Germany had also excelled in the development of new gases such as Tabun and Sarin gas with near 10 time the toxic potential of Mustard Gas (which itself was responsible for a quarter of all US casualties in WW I).<br/><br/>In these set we will explore the use of weapons in select theatres as well as the grim possibility of their full-scale use.   In researching this set, I can&rsquo;t begin to describe the abject horror and brutality of these weapons and the experiments used to test them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

With little exception, it has not been resolved peacefully or resulted in greater democratic representation. Syria remains embroiled in a civil war that started in March 2011 and the immature Iraqi government was easily contested by the growth in Islamic State in Syria and Levant (ISIS).<br/><br/>Nothing is more horrific than the actions of ISIS, also known as DAESH (Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham), and this game is not intended to glorify them in any way. ISIS is a radical extreme with megalomaniac goals that has fed off the turmoil and instability of this region inside the Fertile Crescent. Their actions fall into three broad categories: atrocities in Syria or Iraq, atrocities inspired by their radical ideas occurring outside the region, and other external ISIS planned and executed events&mdash;largely in Europe.<br/>Western powers have attempted a multitude of approaches with each of the revolutionary uprisings but the global ambitions of ISIS placed them in direct confrontation. Of all the contestants, ISIS is the most aggressive, far reaching and extreme in their methods; ensuring that they cannot be ignored or contained without direct intervention.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RATH<br/>Race Against The Horde<br/><br/>Goal: To be the first survivor of the zombie outbreak to complete 3 Survival Missions.<br/> Premise: You are one of the few surviving humans in a zombie infested world.  Your town, once full of beautiful trees and parks is now decaying and run down. There are a few groups of fellow survivors with base camps set up around the town.  Through your walkie-talkie a distress call is heard requesting that a supply run be done as soon as possible. You accept the task and start off on your journey. Along the way you come across floods, fires, zombie hordes, and military fall out.  At the end of the journey, you are the hero that helped save mankind from annihilation.<br/>     <br/>Game Board: Movement can only be done on spaces that have grid lines. Players cannot move through bushes and trees or walk on water. The buildings can be accessed by any space surrounding the border.  <br/>Daily Update Cards:  The Daily Update cards effect game play in different areas of the board.  Hazards in this zombie infested city slow down a players&rsquo; travel time, move them back to their home base, or force detours from their original path.  Multiple grids on the map can be effected at once and each player must comply.<br/>Survival Mission Cards:  Each player will have one Survival Mission at a time to fulfill.  Each player has a separate base camp of survivors they are trying to keep alive.  By completing the missions on the cards, each player saves human lives by delivering life sustaining goods such as food, water, weapons, or building supplies to repair dilapidated structures.<br/>To Start: Shuffle Survival Missions cards and place on corresponding space on board. Shuffle the Daily Update cards and place on the corresponding space on board. Place each colored playing piece on the corresponding colored home base buildings on the map. This means each player will have a different starting position based on the color of their piece. <br/>Each player picks a random Survival Mission at the beginning of the game. The mission does not start until the player reaches the first building to pick up supplies and the mission does not end until the player reaches the destination to drop off supplies. Once complete, the player turns the card over and picks another Survival Mission to start on the next day/turn.  Once a player has completed 3 successful Survival Missions, they are the winner of the game.<br/>Player Movement: Each player can move a maximum of 5 spaces per day (turn) unless specified on the Daily Update card.  Players can move horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. <br/>Game Play: One (1) Daily Update card is drawn per day (turn) and effects each player on the board for that day/turn only.   <br/>The youngest player at the board is the first to draw a Daily Update card.  Each player moves based on the Daily Update card in a clockwise manner, starting with the card drawer first.  For example, player one reads the Daily Update card and is slowed from maximum movement of 5 spaces to 2 spaces. Their turn is over and now player two reads the same Daily Update card and makes their move.<br/><br/>",

On the other hand, Satan's Attack card, designed to damage all the players' decks, promotes competition with skills and tactics between skilled players.<br/><br/>In the 2- to 4-player games, the players race to defeat Satan. In the solo game, the player fights directly against Satan.<br/><br/>「こんなブラックな魔王様はイヤだっ！！」は、プレイヤーごとに英雄と呪文を選んでデッキを持ち、迫り来るモンスターを倒したり仲間にしたりしながら、最終的に魔王を倒す、デッキ構築型カードゲームです。<br/>一般的なデッキ構築型ゲームと違い、いわゆる&quot;&quot;金&quot;&quot;と&quot;&quot;点数&quot;&quot;に分かれていないので、初めての人も遊びやすくなっている点と、全プレイヤーのデッキにダメージを与えようとする「魔王の攻撃」カードがあり、慣れた人同士も技術や駆け引きで競い合える点が特徴です。<br/>より早く魔王を倒す２〜４人用ルールと、１人で魔王と直接戦うシングルルールがあります。<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a victory condition, which are printed on certain cards. This means you must cast a spell that has a victory condition and then use your other spells to help you achieve that condition, while preventing your opponent from achieving theirs first.<br/><br/>You get three willpower on your turn, which can be spent like action points to do things like draw and play cards. Spells are played face down, and remain that way until you manifest them. This gives you plenty of opportunities to bluff and outwit your opponent.<br/><br/>Every card in your deck is unique and every card can be played as either a spell or as energy. The choices you make about which cards to play as energy and which ones to play as spells can have a massive impact on the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>The core set comes with 150 cards, divided into 5 preconstructed decks. You can play with any of these decks, or build your own deck by combining any 30 Rezonite cards. There are no restrictions on which cards can go together, but think carefully about which energy types and victory conditions to include in your Rezonite deck.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Drawing up to 5 cards from any combination of common deck or the nation specific deck players will draw cards to upgrade their ship. Available upgrades are stronger cannons, thicker and stronger hulls, and crew members with special abilities. Players declare an action during the action phase that can include boarding the enemy ships, attacking with the ships crew and cannons, or batton down the hatches to give a temporary defense boost. Shaman and mages can be used to cast spells giving boosts to your crew, damaging enemy ships, or repairing your own ship.<br/><br/>",

Players also receive a hand of four crop cards comprising resources and actions for successfully growing and harvesting a crop, or revealing eliminating the pest cards. Each round, players all draw one more card for their hand, choose one to play, and pass the rest of their hand to the next player. Players must decide between monitoring and managing their pests, applying fertiliser and other crop enhancers, or amassing the seasonal workers, pack houses and export licences needed to make the most profit.<br/><br/>The cards run out after eight rounds, when players take turns to tally their scores. Type of orchard they have and the resource cards they have collected determine their base profit level. This is increased by fertiliser, pollination etc, but decreased by the particular pests that remain in their orchard. The game can be customised for regional orchard types.<br/><br/>Integrated Pest Management is part of an educational kit used in schools to teach children about horticulture and biology.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The cards are chosen but not shown to the enemy player. Each plane can be tailed or tailing or even unopposed.

        "description": "This game consists of 5 little games which can be played as a tournament one after each other, where the player with the most points wins or each game as a single game.<br/><br/>Didi Hallervorder is a famous German comedian, actor in funny films and moderator e.g. from &quot;Hidden Camera&quot;. This game is a party game. Didi is known to participate for each joke and this is the reason written in the rules why his name is in the title and his image is in all games.<br/><br/>The games:<br/>1. Pinch the Didi (Zwick' den Didi). A spinning circle is in the middle and a path for a kind of race. The players pinch their little clothes peg at the edge of the spinning circle.<br/>At all positions there is an action e.g. move 3 fields, suspend 2 turns.<br/>These actions are executed, normally moving forward your figure on the path.<br/>After the round 1 or more players reach the finish line this game ends. The points each player gets are written on the path.<br/><br/>2. Didi listen (Didi horch einmal):<br/>5 little balls: 4 empty and 1 with stones in it.<br/>1 4 part puzzle showing Didis face for each player. <br/>The active player takes all the balls in his hands and tries to hear which is the stone filled. Each player who is right gets 1 piece of his 4 piece puzzle. Who has finished first gets 5 points all others 1 point for each piece.<br/><br/>3. Didi eats chinese (Didi i&szlig;t chinesisch):<br/>Feet a Didi figure with your chips using chopsticks like in China. Game ends when 1 player has feet all his chips. He gets 1 bonus point. Each player gets 1 point for each of his chips Didi has eaten.<br/><br/>4. Jiggle Didi (Wackel-Didi)<br/>There is a jiggling figure of Didi in the middle of the table. Each player tries to get rid of his chips by placing them on the hat of the Didi figure. If chips fall down, the player gets them. The player who has placed the last chip on Didi wins this game and gets 1 point. Each other player gets 1 point minus for each chip he still has.<br/><br/>5. Didis gymnastic party (Didis Party-Gymnastik)<br/>There is a start and finish sign. These are placed in 4 m distance.<br/>A stack of cards is shuffeled. Each of the cards shows a kind of gymnastic figure. The actual player opens the top card. This shows how to hold the arms and feets and where to place chips on the body for his run. With this positions the actual player tries to transport as many of these chips without that they fall down. Each chip which is still in place at the finish gives 1 point. The rules do not mention how many rounds this game is played.<br/><br/>Playing with more than 4 players you have to build teams.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tempus is a retro style card game that's fun for everyone! Inspired by the greats, like UNO, Skip-bo, Phase 10, and Rack-O.<br/><br/>Players control time to play all of their cards before their opponents!<br/><br/>Components: 1 travel case/game board, 1 instruction sheet, 168 cards, consisting of 12 each #1-#12 (clock cards), 18 n (wild) cards, and 6 Reverse time cards.<br/><br/>Reverse time cards: These cards dictate the counting order of the game. The first time they are played, they are played face up to change the direction to counterclockwise (backward) counting direction. The second time they are played face down to indicate clockwise direction. They are played to the side of the time zones, separate from the counting piles.<br/><br/>Objective: Play all of the cards in your countdown deck before your opponent! The game ends when a player has accumulated 365 points, and then the lowest score wins!<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>     Deal 12 cards face down to each player, each player flips their top card over and places it on top of their cards to create the countdown pile.<br/>     Reveal 4 cards face up in the 4 time zones in the center. If any n (wild) cards are revealed, cover them up with another card until 4 clock cards.<br/>     If any reverse time cards are revealed, they are played to the side of the time zones.<br/><br/><br/>Play: The player to the left of the dealer draws cards until they have 5 in their hand. They may use cards from their countdown pile, hand, or discards to count the hours of the clock in the time zone, according to the direction (forwards or backwards) in the directional area.<br/><br/>Counting in Tempus is cyclical, like a clock. Players will count 11-12-1 in forwards direction, and 1-12-11 in backwards direction.<br/><br/>If a player can play all 5 cards from their hand in a single turn, they can draw 5 more cards and continue playing<br/><br/>All n cards must be covered by the next clock card in the sequence before that players turn is over. If it cannot be covered, it is removed from the time zone and placed at the bottom of their countdown deck.<br/><br/>A player MUST count at least one card in the Time Zone from their countdown pile, hand, or discard per turn. They must draw cards into their hands until they can. If a player has more than 5 cards after discarding, they must place the excess cards at the bottom of their countdown pile.<br/><br/>A player ends their turn by discarding 1 card into one of their four discard piles. Cards may be stacked, but only the current top card of each discard pile is playable. Any remaining cards in a players hand carries over to their next turn, where they will draw until they have 5 again.<br/><br/>Play continues to the left until one player has used all of the cards in their countdown pile. All other players add up their cards remaining in their countdown piles and add it to their score. (1-4: 5 pts, 5-8: 10 pts, 9-12: 15 pts, n: 20, RT: 25)<br/><br/>Once a player has reached 365 points, the game is over, and the player with the lowest score wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These spies can be used in a few different ways.<br/><br/>In the operations section of the board exists four cards. On the top right hand corner there is a circle with a number in it. That number is how many spies you need to allocate to purchase that card.<br/><br/>When you purchase a card you have two options with it. One, you can play the card and gain the effect of the card. A card can be played at any time even if its not your turn.<br/><br/>In the top left corner of the card is a star with a number inside of it. These are victory points points you get when the game is over. However if you play them you wont get victory point total<br/><br/>Another use of spies is to capture territory on the world map. If an area is undefended (Meaning there is no spy there) it only requires you to put one spy there. If there was 1 defending spy there you would have too expend 2 spies to capture it, if 2 are defending you would need 3 spies to capture, and so forth.<br/><br/>When controlling an area that area gives you certain perks. For example as long as you control north america you gain one extra worker. However once you lose influence over that area you lose the extra spy.<br/><br/>At the end of the game you will look and see who has influence over the seven continents.

        "description": "This turn of the century German game stands out for its magnificent artwork and very unusual board. The box cover shows a pre-dreadnought battleship slicing through the sea, from off its starboard bow, while the board initially unfolds to show a side-on view of the ship with no apparent game features.<br/><br/>However, the board image then unfolds further from the ship's main deckline to reveal a schematic of the ship's compartments, a 46-space roll-and-move track from a bunkroom in the bow to the engine room. The artwork in the gameboard portion is highly detailed, with images of furniture, seamen at work and varied ship's stores, but in a plain red ink against a white background.<br/><br/>There are six playing pieces, highly detailed human figures in different uniforms and dress, printed on cardboard and standing in coloured wooden disks.<br/><br/>Both the cover illustration and the board take considerable artistic liberties with technical details. The ship on the cover looks very much like the 1898-commissioned pre-dreadnought battleship Kaiser Wilhelm III, but has an extra funnel and is missing a side turret. The ship on the board has the correct two funnels, but is missing the barbette gun beside the main forward turret as well as one of the three side turrets, and has no rear turret. The ships fly non-existent and therefore neutral flags of horizontal stripes, but are red-yellow-blue on the cover and red-blue-yellow on the board.<br/><br/>The cover art is signed with the initials SR, while the board art is unsigned, which may explain the differences in detail. The lack of any publisher information is unusual for a German game of such high quality.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The game recreates World War II tactical battles by using an innovative integrated sequence of play which meshes the actions of each player in order to simulate the swirling battles of the period.<br/><br/>The game allows you to command forces modeled on historical battlegroups in games based on actual battles or in hypothetical match ups between roughly evenly matched forces.  All technical data is presented in one table covering a wide range of equipment used in World War II from French Somuas to German Panthers.  The easy to use Quick Reference data chart allows players to concentrate on maneuver and not on minutiae yet covers all the important weapon systems and hardware innovations of the war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Applying for the mission with the codename &quot;Elite Peacekeeping Shockwave&quot; sounded glorious at first, but turned out being a little bit dull as patrolling a remote part of the galaxy without any upbeat outposts did not motivate the crew greatly. Instead, one of the most stimulating activities became the weekly BBQ on the electric fire in the dust-heavy unused launch bay, within the protective shield of the XP95 fighter craft. Today's menu included some deep space frozen Milky Way cow meat, discovered on an abandoned vessel near the dwarf planet Taplor 4.<br/><br/>&quot;RRAARRRAARR!&quot; &mdash; The ship's alarm was blazing.<br/><br/>Only after a few important wasted moments did the squad realize this was not a test as they found themselves between the run wild XP95 fighter, filled with enough explosives to destroy a small moon, and the marching forces of the until now assumed defeated Zraxii Empire trying to board the ship. Luckily the squad's exceptionally extensive combat training and experience came in handy, if only they had kept up training regularly...<br/><br/>Launch Bay Escape is a ridiculous co-operative game featuring planning that's enriched with a small deck-building mechanism. It's suitable for space soldiers from the age of 10 and takes about 30-45 minutes. The difficulty level is easily adjustable per game as you increase the complexity by adding more and more aliens, obstacles, and madness.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. At the start of the game a rectangular game board divided in rows of squares is placed. One end features the launching ship and the starting area for the players, the other end features the Launch Bay exit. All players have their own character sheet and corresponding deck, and all players have their own special abilities, number of hit points and shield. Players start with six cards in their hand. At the start of a round, all players plan three cards from the available cards in their hand, face down. Next, the first card of all players is revealed. All cards show a number, movement options, and special abilities. In order of highest to lowest number, every player follows the instructions on their planned card. When all cards are resolved, the ship moves one row towards the Launch Bay exit and all aliens move once towards the ship and attack. This is repeated for both remaining planned cards. At the end of the round, all planned cards and remaining cards in the player's hand are discarded and a new hand of six cards is drawn. Once damage accumulates, some cards will be planned randomly.<br/><br/>Players can gain experience by killing aliens. Experience enables the players to buy extra cards to add to their deck. In addition, players may find items on the game board, usable only once or multiple times.<br/><br/>The players lose if the ship or all the players are destroyed before reaching the escape pods at the end of the Launch Bay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Super Meat Boy Rival Rush is a one versus one competitive card game where Players race to the finish. Players assemble twenty card decks comprised of actions and skills that will get them to the end, along with some nasty tricks to trip up their opponent. Beloved characters from the Super Meat Boy Cinematic Universe make appearances for the first time as trading cards, each with their own unique abilities and powers to help navigate the levels ahead at breakneck speeds. Rival Rush is a nonstop fast paced no holds barred finger blistering every card for themselves showdown where only the swiftest and smartest survive.<br/><br/>Taking heavy influence in the micro-deck builder genre, the game puts the players in the task of creating a deck of cards that matches the symbols that pop up in the &quot;stages&quot; in front of us. The trick? Your rival might guess which card you have chosen for this turn and could block your moves through the stages; and in Rival Rush there will be only ONE winner.<br/><br/>Taking in consideration that the game offers the possibility of a fresh experience every time it's played thanks to it's random generated levels (constructed from the cards themselves), Rival Rush seems like a very fun and competitive way of enjoying Super Meat Boy; hopefully not as frustrating as it's digital counterpart.<br/><br/>",

Alternatively, you can get the game professionally printed over at The Game Crafter here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/i-know-how-you-died1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/i-know-how-you-died1</a> (Cost-to-cost price by Game Crafter with zero profit for us) This game is intended for pure utter rubbish type of casual fun, don't go in expecting any serious game play! Play this with the wrong crowd and you'd end up in an awkward evening!<br/><br/>Players are issued 3 random secret cards depicting various deaths, and they must choose one of them to re-enact. Then after everyone has done a quick 5 to 10 seconds re-enactment of their chosen scene, they toss these cards (still face-down) into a common pile in the middle of the table. Shuffle the pile and reveal the top card to everyone. If anyone wants to guess at who had acted out the death scene of that particular card, simply say 'I know!' and call out that player's name. This is on a first-come-first-serve basis. Note that the actual actor of the card cannot guess his/her own card, but must pretend to participate so as not to give the answer away.<br/><br/>If a scene was guessed correctly the first time, the guesser gains 4 Point. If a scene was guessed correctly the second time, the guesser gains 3 Point. The actor also gets 3 Points. All wrong guesses will deduct 1 Point from the guesser.<br/><br/>If no one got the correct answer to a scene after two attempts, the next scene is drawn and the game continues. After 3 scenes, the entire pile is discarded completely and a new round begins. This also means there will be some scenes that do not show up despite having been acted out. This is to increase the difficulty of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last card is drawn, or when someone achieves 20 or more Points. Rules can be found at the Files section of this game page.<br/><br/>Have fun dying...<br/><br/>",

After a pass, the next player can play any new word.<br/><br/>Scoring system:<br/><br/>The player who gets rid of all cards wins the round, the losing player has to take the penalty points which is the number of cards in his/her hand plus the number of cards remains in the draw pile, 1 point each.

        "description": "In Legend of the Ancients, players will attempt to piece together the greatest legend of a people lost almost entirely to antiquity. By exploring deeper and deeper into the ruins of this lost tribe, they will discover and try to make narrative sense of new elements to the legend, all while hopefully not succumbing to their worst fears. As these things always go, however, there is a catch. Somewhere in the deep, dark underground waits a malevolent force, older than time itself, and with each step they take, our intrepid explorers are unwittingly awakening it. Will our noble adventurers unlock the key to the lost Legend of the Ancients? Or will they be overcome by terror... or something infinitely worse?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the introduction<br/><br/>The cooperative storytelling game is published as an 8-page PDF rules document and a 12-page print-and-play PDF game materials document.  A 1-page, print-and-play DOC file also is included as an errata.  The game uses two distinct decks of cards and a play surface that is randomized at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Play involves drawing map tiles and placing them, to create the randomized playing surface.  Players have a token marking their position on the board.  During each turn, the player selects an action from among six possibilities and executes that action.  Several of the options entail moving the player token to a new map tile.<br/><br/>Players are free to cooperate to achieve game goals, and play is considered cooperative.  Indeed, a few game actions require more than a single player.  Individual players may have leave the game prior to the end of play (they are driven &quot;stark, raving mad&quot;), but this is not common.  Instead, the game ends when the players collectively complete one of two tracks of play (one of the tracks is the &quot;happy&quot; ending - universal success; the other is the &quot;doom&quot; ending - universal failure).<br/><br/>The game is meant to be played with 3 - 5 players; a minor variant rule can be used to adapt the game for 2 players - in effect, the rule creates a dummy, limited, third &quot;player&quot;.<br/><br/>The game was written for, and submitted to, Game Chef 2018.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

This deadly contest is known as a deathmatch.<br/><br/>The most powerful heroes among the mortal races are known as Avatars of War--heroes chosen by the Gods of War themselves. These Avatars, in addition to being fierce combatants, are able to draw upon the silver of divinity within their souls for the power to expand their already awesome combat abilities.<br/><br/>In Arena DeathMatch, each player controls a band of Avatars of War as they face off on the arena floor in front of a cheering (or jeering) crowd.<br/><br/>The perils of the Arena stand against you: traps, hazards and even savage beasts stand between you and your opponent. The door to the Arena opens, and the shouting crowd is eager to see their favourite heroes fight to the death. Will they be cheering your victory...or your death? There's only one way to find out!<br/><br/>DIFFERENCES IN SECOND EDITION (2011) VERSUS FIRST ONE<br/><br/>The second edition is the result of compiling all the feedback from players and review and refine the first edition rules accordingly, resulting in a  smooth and streamlined set of rules that deliever plenty of action and strategy. In Arena Deathmatch 2nd. ed  you can customize your fighters and game tactics to new levels, choosing from more than 500 different options for their weapons, armor, feats, abilities and spells.   The potential combinations and strategies with the new ruleset are almost limitless.<br/><br/>DIFFERENCES IN THIRD EDITION (2016) VERSUS SECOND ONE<br/><br/>The 100% new thing in 3rd are Combat combos: A combat combo consists of performing a succession of combat actions to carry out extremely powerful attacks. Look for the symbol &sect; to know which actions are comboable.<br/>After successfully executing a comboable action, the Avatar can immediately (without the enemy being able to act) perform another action (comboable or not). The combo will end when a non-comboable action is performed, or when performing an action without success (by mistake or by the opponent's counter).<br/><br/>COMBATE GLADIATORIO FANT&Aacute;STICO<br/><br/>Arena Deathmatch es un juego de combate de miniaturas.<br/>En Arena Deathmatch cada jugador crea y dirige una banda de Avatares de la Guerra y la enfrenta a la banda de otro jugador en la arena, bajo la mirada de la muchedumbre, sedienta de acci&oacute;n, sangre y violencia.<br/><br/>El desenlace de una partida de Arena Deathmatch empieza a escribirse mucho antes de saltar al combate, al reclutar y adiestrar a tus campeones de la arena.<br/>Una vez en la arena, deber&aacute;s poner a prueba tu capacidad para pensar r&aacute;pido, usar t&aacute;cticas astutas y utilizar los puntos fuertes de tus luchadores para atacar los puntos d&eacute;biles de los luchadores de tu oponente.<br/><br/>Pero tu contrincante no es el &uacute;nico obst&aacute;culo hacia la victoria, los peligros de la arena son un reto por s&iacute; solos: pozos de muerte y bestias salvajes se ciernen sobre tu banda.<br/><br/>Finalmente, no subestimes la importancia de agradar a tus seguidores &iexcl;Tener a la multitud a tu lado marcar&aacute; a menudo la diferencia entre la victoria y la derrota!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the Network's newest hit reality survival game show... Anime Island!<br/>We've taken 16 cliche anime characters and stuck them on an island together.  They'll face new challenges each episode.  They'll fall in love, become rivals, and entertain you every step of the way.  One-by-one they will be voted of by you, the viewers, in a process called, The Tribunal!  Call in your votes now to make sure your favorite characters survive... Anime Island!<br/><br/>Players have secret agendas dictating which characters they want to stay and which ones they want to go.  For instance an agenda may say if you get both Cookie and Jikurou kicked off the island you get 10 points.  Another could say if you make sure Daphne stays on the show the whole game, you'll get 11 points. Each episode (round) the characters face a challenge which will change which characters fall in love, become rivals, or are immune to the tribunal vote.<br/><br/>Use deduction and negotiation, along with special tribunal powers of the fallen characters, player will try to manipulate the game to score the most from their secret agendas.<br/><br/>The Game takes place over several rounds (episodes).<br/>Each episode has the following phases:<br/>1) Today's Challenge<br/>Challenge cards are flipped up and determine which characters become rivals, form partnerships, or have immunity.<br/>2) The Discussion<br/>A 1-minute sand timer is flipped and everyone discuses who to vote off of the island.  Characters that gained immunity during the challenge cannot be voted for.<br/>3) The Tribunal Vote<br/>When the timer runs out every player simultaneously points to a character (that does not have immunity).<br/>The character with the most votes is kicked off the island.  In a tie&gt; They are each kicked off!<br/>Any character that is partnered with a character that is voted off, also gets kicked off the island.  A Character that is a rival with a character that gets kicked off the island gains immunity for the next episode (in addition to whoever gets immunity through the challenge)<br/><br/>After 9 episodes, the game ends, and players calculate their score based on their secret agendas and which characters got kicked off, and which ones remain.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A political game where a player plays as a party in a town called Brige in Europe, 1915. His goal is to attract as many followers to support his party by moving across the map of Brige. The game begins with the overthrow of Major of Brige, and ends in 1918, the end of WW2, when order is brought back to the town and elections take place. The party with the most voters wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is consisted of a main board map (the town of Brige), Personal Board- these boards give information about the party's current stand. Their content is changed along the game as the party is influenced by the player's decisions, and other effects . In addition, there are &quot;Point of Interest&quot; cards that resemble an encounter with a citizen or an event that is happening that requires the party's decision. Whenever a player lands on a Point of Interest, he takes a card from the pile and must act according to the type of event at hand, and organize his position after reading the consequences. The face of the cards is where the information about the event is given, with the available decisions &amp; options at its bottom. On the back of the card is where the decision's effect is shown.<br/><br/>Along the game, a party may hire citizens that it encounters and turn them into &quot;Agents&quot;. Once this is done, the player places a figure on the board. Agents are the connecting bridge between the players, and allows a party to make contact with other parties. Every agent has its own skill and have specific actions that can be done with them. A Gunman for example, may attack other units on the board, including the party leader that will lose the player's game if is assasinated.<br/><br/>An important aspect in the game is money. The game currency is called &quot;Brigs&quot;, and is affected by the current information on the player's Personal Board, or throught drawn Point of Interest cards. Without money, an agent can't be paid, some actions can't be made, and the player will most likely have few units on the board, what makes him vulnerable to Gunmans. The player must carefuly plan his campaign in order to make sure he doesn't fall into issues such as this.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each card contains six questions. The asker simply asks the next question on the card. The correct response is on the back of the card. There is no penalty for a wrong answer. However, if while taking one&rsquo;s turn that player says, &ldquo;Yeah, but&rdquo; then the player&rsquo;s pawn is sent back to the starting space.<br/><br/>Players must follow the instructions on any space on which one&rsquo;s pawn rests. A player may not advance a second pawn until the first pawn has reached Home of Humility (finish). The third pawn may not be moved until the second pawn has reached the finish space.

However now you must race and battle opponents, slip past security guards, dodge bullets, avoid lasers, find the crystal and escape to safety with your prize, for in this safe, nobody is safe.<br/><br/>This is a print and play game with a 5-piece double-sided modular board, originally created for the 2017 Nine Card Nano-game Print and Play contest. The rules for setting up the game are quite loose allowing for many variations and levels of play. You can even make up your own special rules for the boards you make (for example you must touch all five cards of the board before leaving the vault). You can overlap boards, you can use less than 5 boards, you can use the sample boards in the rules, you can decide how many security guards to play with (if there are less players you could even use the unused player meeples as security guards for extra challenge), you can decide if you want to use the holographic crystal, etc. the point of it is, get creative. Once you have a board set up, you and the other players must race to grab the crystal while dodging around walls, avoiding lasers and security guards, and dueling each other to grab the crystal out of the hands of the opponent. Then you must get back to the vault door and punch in the code to escape into the night with your prize.<br/><br/>In addition to printing the files for this game you will also need:<br/>-4 different colored meeples<br/>-3 black meeples<br/>-2 acrylic crystals<br/>-3 green d6s<br/>-3 red d6s<br/>-1 black d6<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Setting &amp; Theme: The cursus honorum was the sequential order of public offices held by aspiring politicians in the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. This game simulates those career paths, with senatorial factions represented by each player, during the rise of the Republic. Starting around 241-237 BC when the provinces of Sicilia and Sardinia et Corsica had been conquered through war with the Carthaginians, each turn abstracts a generation of Roman politicians competing for offices and wielding state powers, with factions leveraging their wealth and influence to increase their reputation and legacy. Senators also serve in provincial posts, protecting and developing the expanding Republic while amassing their own fame and fortune. Throughout the game players must cooperate to ensure the public&rsquo;s satisfaction with the government remains stable and the Republic remains prosperous and secure, all while competing to attain the highest status.<br/><br/>General Course of Play: Each turn begins with die rolls triggering events in the provinces. Then elections are held where factions compete to form the strongest voting coalitions and senators claim offices in Rome and the provinces. Players then alternate taking actions that include using office powers and influencing clients, often with adverse effect on their opponents. Each turn concludes with a sequential reckoning of state and faction accounts, setting the stage for the next generation of struggle and achievement.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: This is a updated prototype that has been play tested, but is still in development.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>ポプボブ (Popubobu) (POP &amp; BOB) is a very fast party game themed on the manga/anime Pop Team Epic. (You can play it without knowing the show.) The game takes under a minute to pay.<br/><br/>There are mainly 2 types of cards to play, one with ポプテピピック (&quot;Pop Team Epic&quot;) printed on it and the other with ボブネミミッミ (&quot;Bob Epic Team&quot;) on it. First,randomly deal one of these cards to each player. During the game, each player can only speak the words on the cards dealt to them.<br/><br/>Next, deal another card to each player. Each player must show this card to other players but not see it themselves (like in the game of Indian Poker). Players must tell the others if other players' cards are ポプテピピック (&quot;Pop Team Epic&quot;) or ボブネミミッミ (&quot;Bob Epic Team&quot;), and they will win if they all manage to guess their cards correctly.<br/><br/>However, this is quite a confusing challenge, because each player can only utter the word on the card dealt to them. The rules of this game can be explained in 1 to 2 minutes and it can be played in 30 seconds or so, with up to 9 players.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>「ポプテピピック」の二次創作パーティーゲームです。（作品を知らなくても遊べます）<br/>主に「ポプテピピック」と書かれたカードと「ボブネミミッミ」と書かれたカードの２種類を使って遊びます。まずランダムにこれらのカードを書くプレイヤーに配ります。このゲーム中そのプレイヤーは配られたカードの単語しか話せません。<br/>次にもう１枚ずつカードを配り、同時にカードを他のプレイヤーに向けて公開します。（インディアンポーカーです）。<br/>プレイヤーは、他のプレイヤーのカードが「ポプテピピック」と「ボブネミミッミ」のどちらかを教えて全員が正解すればプレイヤーの勝利となります。<br/>ただし最初に配られたカードの単語しか話せないので大変なことになります。<br/>ゲーム説明に１～２分、ゲームプレイ時間は30秒、最大で９人まで遊べます。<br/><br/>",

None is more terrible than bestowing the title of &quot;Blessed&quot; on a member of the cult. The ritual is performed once a generation, and is the deciding proof of December's choice of the leader of His cult. During this, the chosen sacrifice is stripped of all humanity, transformed into a living expression of December's power ... and His all-encompassing hunger.<br/><br/>At the beginning of her stewardship, Rasputina performed the ritual as December directed, choosing a young woman from the Silent Ones. It did not take long for the Ice Witch to regret going along with the ceremony, as she watch the woman become a prisoner in her own body. The Blessed retained more of her sanity than any in memory, and it became clear this was nothing more than a constant torment. This poor creature became one of the driving reasons for Rasputina's defiance of December, as she is forced to watch the poor wretch become more feral with each passing day.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Land of the Two Rivers is a game of the Iraq War in the post-invasion period starting roughly in Summer 2003. By this point Saddam's government had disintegrated and fateful decisions had already been made regarding official U.S. policy towards powerful factions within Iraq. The players are faced with the situation as it existed at that time, as the Sunni insurgency was building momentum, the Shia were taking advantage of the chaos to flex their long-suppressed muscle, and everyone was realizing there were insufficient U.S. forces to police the entire country. Regional and global entities like Syria, Turkey, Iran and Al Qaeda were attempting to shift events in their favor. The game does not provide the ability to alter what had already been done up to that point, but each player has options on how to conduct operations going forward.<br/><br/>The game is designed for three players, representing:<br/><br/>1. United States, British, Other Coalition, and Iraqi National Forces (INF)<br/>2. Sunnis (Iraqi Sunnis and their sponsors in the larger Sunni world)<br/>3. Shiites (Iraqi Shia and their sponsors in Iran)<br/><br/>The U.S./Coalition objective is to stand up the Iraqi army in sufficient strength and effectiveness to control the majority of the country, with a small number of supporting U.S./Coalition troops.<br/><br/>The Sunni and Shiite objectives are to gain control over enough of the population to give them a decisive advantage in the eventual political and economic solution that must one day be achieved.<br/><br/>Players are free to cooperate and make (or break) any agreements they wish. However, there can only be one winner, so ultimately one player must outmaneuver the other two.<br/><br/>The game has rules for U.S. Morale and Commitment similar to Nick Karp's classic &quot;Vietnam: 1965-1975&quot;, training of Iraqi National Forces (INF), Ground Attacks, IED Cells, Ambushes, Air Strikes, Al Qaeda unpredictability, Suicide Attacks, Coalition country withdrawals, Civilian Casualties, and more. There are sub-systems for the hunt for High Value Targets (HVTs), Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), and Infiltration of support from regional players.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

By harnessing and focusing their Chi, they are able to create mystical barriers that prevent spirits from passing. The most powerful of their number can even create powerful Chi Blades, which can cut through many of the defences of otherworldly creatures.<br/><br/>Since last year's Battle of London, some Charm Warders have felt the barriers between the worlds weakening. These men and women have travelled to Malifaux in search of some way to repair the damage being done to the world.<br/><br/>As with most spellcasters, the magical talents of the charm warders have increased significantly since they passed through the Breach. Most end up selling their services to the Ten Thunders in exchange for the ability to study the Oni, ghosts, and other strange creatures at their beck and call.<br/><br/>As a group, the charm Warders are starting to realise that Malifaux itself might be the problem. They have started to research a way to strengthen the barrier between worlds in the hopes of saving Earth... even if it means the loss of Malifaux.<br/><br/>Ten Thunder Box Set, containing two 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high-quality plastic.<br/><br/>Set Contains:<br/><br/>Models<br/><br/>2 Charm Warders<br/><br/>Stat Cards<br/><br/>2 Charm Warders<br/><br/>Please Note: Miniatures are supplied unpainted and assembly will be required.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By This Axe: Medieval Fantasy Battle Rules presents a simple, fairly standard wargame ruleset to handle small- to medium-size miniatures battles (optional rules allow play without miniatures).  The rules assume two or more armies will be involved, each with two or more units.  Infantry units contain 3 to 25 figures; cavalry units contain 2 to 15 figures; figures may be arranged as desired but only up to the first three ranks are involved in combat.<br/><br/>The game assumes 1:5 to 1:20 scale ratios though any type of (consistent) basing is allowed.  Action resolution uses a modified six-sided-dice resolution method; 1 is successful, 6 is failure.  Unit movement takes place in inches; various terrain effects are noted.  The mass combat is fairly abstracted.<br/><br/>An optional &quot;Command and Control&quot; method relies upon card drafting from a standard pack.  The standard command method assigns a Leadership level which limits actions.<br/><br/>The game does support individual figures that may represent generals, leaders, and &quot;characters&quot; (generally - mages, priests, etc.); these figures may duel each other.  The game does support (but does not require) fantastic elements and magic, and a variety of non-human &quot;monster&quot; units are described in &quot;Appendix A: Fantasy Supplement&quot;.  Numerous unit types have special abilities that allow units to take special actions or make special movements.  Generally, these all work within the basic framework of the game.  Opposing forces are constructed using a &quot;point cost&quot; method that allows disparate but balanced armies to be fielded.<br/><br/>Play involves turns, with both players executing some portions of the turn simultaneously, other portions in alternating order.  Each player turn is executed in five enumerated phases that take place in order.  The phase orders are:<br/><br/><br/>        Phase 1 (optional) - draw cards<br/>        Phase 2 duels between individual units are resolved<br/>        Phase 3 Ranged fire and magical attack is resolved<br/>        Phase 4 Movement (each side, in turn)<br/>        Phase 5 M&ecirc;l&eacute;e is resolved<br/><br/><br/>Units must test morale after sustaining damage; units may route; leaders may attempt to rally.<br/><br/>The game does not elucidate a winner or formulaic victory situation; presumably this becomes evident through play.  After the battle is concluded, a simple process is used to determine Battle Results.  This process may determine a &quot;victor&quot; for post-game results.  Opposing armies are impacted by the Battle Results, both in survivorship and field location (presumably this allows multiple engagements in a campaign).<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

At the end of the 7th Century, the player with the most VPs is the winner and becomes the highest rank aristocrat in the newborn empire.<br/><br/>The game is played in 16 rounds. Each round, players take turns placing their workers on production buildings in a counterclockwise order, and then buying cards from the market in a clockwise order. When you buy a card, the production buildings you own and the one occupied by your worker in total must produce the resources sufficient for the card's cost. Some cards become your own production buildings, and others provide VPs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Baby Boum is a board game in French designed to answer to a popular scientific objective. It was created by five doctoral students and produced by the Nancy student association Big Brother. This game was created by Quentin Dumont, Micka&euml;l Lebdar, G&eacute;raud Le Falher, Tania Louis and Camille Paoletti, advised and supervised by St&eacute;phane Goria (researcher at the Mediation Research Centre of the University of Lorraine) and Marie-Laure Lenertz (Communication Officer at the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology of the University of Strasbourg) as part of a training for doctoral students during the &quot;Science &amp; You&quot; days at the University of Lorraine in Metz in 2015. Using black humour, this game highlights the problem of infertility in some parts of Africa (contrary to stereotypes and other preconceived ideas, research shows the health and social urgency associated with this problem). The scientific elements conveyed by the game are based on the research work undertaken by Emmanuelle Simon (researcher at the Centre de recherche sur les m&eacute;diations of University of Lorraine).<br/>It is a humorous game in which each player plays a character or a pair of characters whose particular winning conditions and other characteristics are represented on a tablet on which the cards drawn during the game are placed. The game also requires 2 dices.<br/><br/>",

The asked player can answer the truth or use their ability to avoid answering or confuse the asking player. The first player that found their master's location wins.<br/><br/>",

It is thematically set within the Varya universe, where mages and spell casters use elements to bend the world around them to their will.  Players within this game are competing to be crowned as the Champion Spellmaster<br/><br/>Varya: Spellmasters is designed to be played by 2-5 players from start to finish in 15 minutes.  Gameplay is easy to pick up, as players perform one action on their turn before play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Spells are cast by focusing on the elements (playing an element card on the table in front of the player) and then playing a spell card.  Focusing on an element counts as the player's action for that turn.  Spells which affect the field of play are drawn throughout the course of the game.<br/><br/>The first player to cast 2 Master Spells will be crowned champion and win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Conga Mummies is a simple grid movement game for one to four players.  Each player controls a &quot;mummy&quot; token that moves about the board, square-by-square, as desired.  The gridded board is laid out roughly to approximate a humanoid form.  Players start in the &quot;head&quot; grid and then move to specific squares in each &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;foot&quot; to collect canopic jars containing organs.  All four embalmed organs (stomach, intestines, liver, and lungs) are required for the mummy to reach the afterlife.  The first player to recover all four of the needed organs wins the game.<br/><br/>Each grid square has a random chance (25%) of containing a beast; this is determined when the first character moves into the square.  Beasts, if encountered, must be defeated to proceed.  Individual mummies can take damage and be destroyed (the player loses and drops out of the game).<br/><br/>The primary innovation of the game involves player movement.  Players must move in a &quot;conga line&quot; pattern, following exactly in the leader's footsteps, but one to three squares behind (depending on how many players there are).  The line leader makes all decisions and performs all combat.  If desired, the line leader can yield their position (when low on health, for example) and move to the back of the line.  Alternately, each player can cast three &quot;compel&quot; spells during the game.  Each &quot;compel&quot; spell forces the leader to move to the back of the line.<br/><br/>The basic strategy is to remain at the back of the line (in safety) through the first three organ collections then to move (and remain) in the lead position for the final organ collection (thus, winning).<br/><br/>The game supports single-player play, though this becomes simply an exercise of trying to move and survive to the end, rather than managing the &quot;conga line&quot; strategy.<br/><br/>The game is provided as a four-page, print-and-play PDF document containing the rules and the game board.  It was distributed for free from various online sites.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How I expect the synopsis to sound when it's actually done:<br/><br/>Traverse caverns full of monsters, forests full of traps and towers full of rats.<br/><br/>This roguelike dungeon crawling adventure for 1 to 5 players features customizable characters, an innovative swarm mechanic, and endless fun.<br/><br/>Do you like old school Gauntlet? Experience? LOOT?<br/>Players take on one of the 6 elemental playstyles. The Martial Knight, The Holy Priest, the Nature Druid, the Clockwork Gunslinger, the Shadow Necromancer, or the Arcane Mage are playable characters in the base game. And don't let that stop you from playing the way you want to play! Earn access to other classes through XP gain and continue to defeat wave after wave of enemy.<br/><br/>The game is a tactical exploration adventure where the players play cards to attack monsters. Each card played goes into a cooldown row to be used later, or the player can burn their highly coveted bits to cool them down faster. Through exploration, the players will reveal monster spawner tiles in search of the exit tile. Once the players decide to exit the dungeon they must face the second level, full of harder monsters and better loot. After exiting that level, the dungeon's boss must be defeated if the players wish to keep the loot they've gained thus far. If the players die at any time, they lose their gear and can try again.<br/><br/>The base game comes with (at least) two dungeons that are different each time you play. Completing a dungeon will allow you to purchase more gear for another run.<br/><br/>Honestly, we're still playtesting the hell out of this game, so everything here is subject to wild changes. Including the theme. I'm not 100% sold on fantasy.<br/><br/>",

Each counter represents a single combatant.  Each combatant has unique skills derived from an available pool of combat &quot;styles&quot; that are reminiscent of pop-culture martial arts.  Combatants are further specialized by buying abilities using a points pool.<br/><br/>Players take alternating turns.  Within a turn, movement and combat are rather free-form; attacks are resolved using two ten-sided dice, with modifiers, and results are applied immediately.  Players may set their own victory conditions, but the default condition is complete destruction of the opposing force.  The game is unusual in allowing much variety in the individual units, with significant player decisions made during unit construction (this also is a somewhat time-consuming pre-play process).<br/><br/>The game is published as a print-and-play instruction manual.<br/><br/>&mdash;User summary<br/><br/>",

All the characters are from Japanese video games named &quot;The Idolmaster&quot; and &quot;The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls&quot;.<br/><br/>Each player has six idol (pop singer) cards at the beginning of the game. Players take turns playing an idol card and rolling a number of dice printed on the card, determining her power. Then she activates her ability written on the card. Dice results are changed frequently by their abilities.<br/><br/>The game ends when all players have played five cards. They total the power of all their idols, and the player with the greatest power wins the game.<br/><br/>Depending on game mode, initial cards are determined by simple deal or rochester draft. Additionally, a three-game match can be played if each player has a copy of this game. Players make three groups of six idols and play three games. The player with highest total score of three games wins the match.<br/><br/>The game has been published since 2012, and new stand-alone expansions have been added, from Track 2 through to Track 5. You can mix these sets as you like, or play them separately. The rules remain the same, the card sets vary. The decks are for two players, but more can play when combining decks.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>ビデオゲーム「アイドルマスター」、「シンデレラガールズ」をモチーフとした二次創作のカードゲームです。プレイ人数は２～３人推奨ですが、カードを増やせば６人まで対応できます。<br/>手札のアイドルカードを交互に出してはダイスを振り、5人（枚）出した時点でのチームの合計力を競うゲームです。<br/><br/>",

In addition, there is a bonus scenario for Third Newbury, where the Parliamentarian armies declined to fight another battle.<br/><br/>One player controls the Royalist armies of King Charles I, King Charles II, and the Duke of Hamilton. The other player controls the Parliamentarian armies of the Earl of Essex, Earl of Manchester, Sir William Waller, and Oliver Cromwell.<br/><br/>Philip Jelley uses the same grand tactical area/movement design as Lilliburlero (ATO 40), with counters representing the generals and regiments of horse, foot, dragoons and artillery that fought in the battles. Each turn represents one or two hours of time, with weather and nightfall affecting command, control and activation. Scenarios are included with historical and free deployment, and optional units. Players may deploy on the edge of the maps and manoeuvre to a battlefield of their own choosing. Ironsides contains 470 &frac12; inch counters, one full size and two half sized maps, and a six-page rulebook.<br/><br/>FIRST NEWBURY, 20 September 1643: The Earl of Essex had marched his army deep into the midlands to relieve the Parliamentarian stronghold of Gloucester only to find the road back to London blocked by the Royalist Army at Newbury. In the bloodiest battle of the war so far 28,000 men fought each other to a standstill in the hedgerows as the London Trained Bands fought off charges by Prince Rupert&rsquo;s Cavaliers. Horrified at the slaughter King Charles I withdrew to Oxford, and Essex returned to London in triumph.<br/><br/>SECOND NEWBURY, 27 October 1644: After their victory at Lostwithiel King Charles I and Prince Maurice entrenched their armies around Newbury, only to be surrounded by the Parliamentarian armies of Essex, Manchester, and Waller. Outnumbered three to one the war might have ended in an afternoon, but after desperate battle the Royalists survived long enough to escape during the night.<br/><br/>THIRD NEWBURY, 9 November 1644: Reinforced by the remnants of the Northern Royalists under Prince Rupert, King Charles I returned to Newbury to relieve Donnington Castle and recover the artillery left there after the last battle. Manchester refused to fight, Cromwell accused him of incompetence, Manchester accused Cromwell of insubordination, and the resulting furore led to the creation of the New Model Army. This is the battle that might have been.<br/><br/>PRESTON, 17 August 1648: The captive King Charles I made a deal with the Duke of Hamilton to restore him to the throne with a Scottish Army. Hamilton invaded England with the help of Sir Marmaduke Langdale&rsquo;s Northern Royalists just as uprisings across England and Wales stretched the New Model Army to the limit. Cromwell force-marched his &ldquo;Ironsides&rdquo; 300 miles from Wales to join John Lambert&rsquo;s Northern Army so they could attack the Royalists despite being outnumbered two to one. They defeated Langdale on Preston Moor, and caught Hamilton&rsquo;s divided and disorganised army crossing the River Ribble. After his victory Cromwell marched on London, purged Parliament, and executed the King.<br/><br/>WORCESTER, 3 September 1651; Charles II succeeded his father as King of the Scots, but Cromwell invaded Scotland and destroyed the Scottish Army at Dunbar on 3 September 1650. Raising a new army, the young king slipped past Cromwell into England, and tried to rally English Royalists to his cause. Cromwell followed him with the New Model Army, gathering County Trained Bands as he marched south. Intent on a battle of annihilation that would end the civil wars for once and for all he surrounded the Royalists at Worcester on the River Severn. Seeing the Parliamentarian army divided by the river, Charles II attacked one half, but was defeated as Cromwell used a bridge of boats to reinforce his threatened flank. The Scottish army was destroyed and Charles escaped into exile.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is played with a unique deck of cards numbered 1-13 and each card has an ability written on it.<br/><br/>The objective of a round is to get rid of cards in your hand by playing them onto separate piles in descending order from 7 to 1, and ascending order from 8 to 13. The objective of the game is to be the wealthiest Kingdom at the end.<br/><br/>There are four &quot;suits&quot;: Kingdom of Dragons (orange), Kingdom of Pixies (purple), Kingdom of Seafarers (blue) and Kingdom of Animals (green). In general, it is good to have cards of mid values as these must be played before the higher and lower cards can be played.<br/><br/>Players start the game with 20 coins each. At the start of each round they must pay 1 coin in tax to their Kingdom. When a player plays the &quot;Tax Collector&quot; (number 11) they get to collect all taxes currently on that Kingdom.<br/><br/>A round ends when someone plays their last card. All other players must pay coins based on the cards still in their hands &mdash; very low and very high cards cost more.<br/><br/>If at any point someone is unable to play a card they must take &quot;the Plague&quot;. Whoever has the Plague when a round ends must pay an additional penalty of 3 coins.<br/><br/>There's a second deck of cards called &quot;Prosperity Cards&quot;. Whenever you play the number 12 of any Kingdom you get to draw a Prosperity Card. These cards have special perks such as forcing another player to play a specific card, or moving the Plague to another player. They are kept face up in front of you and can be activated at any time during the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone runs out of coins, at which point the player with the most coins is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bloody Christmas is a drinking boardgame that tasks a group of players to make their way to the bar and then back home. The first player to do so wins. To do so they take turns rolling a six sided die and simply move that number of spaces on the gameboard.<br/><br/>There are three types of spaces you may land on. Drink spaces require pulling a drink card from a pile in the center of the gameboard and simply taking that number of drinks before throwing the card in a discard pile to be shuffled and placed back in the center when there are no more drink cards to draw.<br/><br/>Fight spaces require the player to draw a fight card from the pile in the center of the board. These unique characters all have a power rating from 1 to 6. The player then has to roll a six sided die against the power of the fight card. If they win they keep the card and can use it once against their opponents to knock them back on the gameboard a number of spaces equal to the power of the card. If they lose they drink the difference of their roll and the power of the fight card as well as move back that many spaces on the gameboard.<br/><br/>The third type of spaces are home and the bar themselves. These are safe spaces where no fighting can occur. Otherwise no two players can occupy the same space on the board and will have to fight each other (by each rolling dice) to see who stays on the space and who gets bumped back the difference of the two rolls on the gameboard.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A solitaire Tarot card game of making connections and finding demons.<br/><br/>In this game you take on the role of a teenage exorcist. You had transferred to this school when you learned of a demon possessing one of the students. As you arrive, you can sense the demon within but cannot pinpoint the exact student.<br/><br/>During the following schoolyear it&rsquo;s your job to make as many allies as you can, identify your foe and drive out the demon. But remember, the demon will be turning your classmates against you too.<br/><br/>'&mdash;description from the introduction<br/><br/>The game is provided as a print-and-play PDF document (25 pages).  Several pages of the document are needed for reference during play (even for experienced players).  Play requires a Tarot deck of cards, though a mapping table can be used to play with a standard pack of French playing cards.  Play involves card distribution into several distinct, named piles (Friend, Classmate, Rival, and Discard).  When play begins, most cards are placed in the Classmate pile representing students.  The goal of play is to transfer cards from the Classmate pile to the Friend pile.  The &quot;demon&quot; works against you, moving cards from the Classmate pile to the Rival pile.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in three phases.  During the first phase the identity of the &quot;demon&quot; is unknown.  During the second phase the identity of the &quot;demon&quot; is known.  The third phase is the final period of the game when the player and the &quot;demon&quot; have the &quot;final battle&quot; - the outcome of which determines if the solitaire player wins or loses the game.<br/><br/>The first two phases essentially are discovery and building phases, with the player attempting to gather as many resources as possible (thus denying them to the &quot;demon&quot;) - this is represented by the distribution of cards into the Friends or Rivals piles.  The third phase determines victory in the game - the player wins, or the &quot;demon&quot; wins (thus, the player loses).<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the principle action involves card manipulation to influence a basic card vs. card flip where the winner, by default, is determined by suit and rank (court cards always beat number cards, etc.).  Too, each court card is identified as a specific &quot;student&quot; in the school, and each student has variable power.  For example, &quot;The Sun&quot; equates to student &quot;Hiroko Harunobu&quot; - who has specified powers over &quot;The Moon&quot;.  Unsurprisingly, &quot;The Moon&quot; equates to Hiroko's younger twin, &quot;Horie Harunobu&quot; - who has specified powers over &quot;The Sun&quot;.<br/><br/>Because the cards are randomly distributed by shuffling, replay will always be unpredictable.  While essentially a solitaire card game at heart, the extended game concept and especially the variable card effects create quite a nuanced game that would lend itself well to an immersive experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each hand a is series of rounds in which some merchants will prosper, and some will struggle.<br/><br/>Equipment: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.<br/><br/>Setup: To start the hand, shuffle the deck and deal six cards to each player. Note the alternate rules for 2-3 players, below.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play: On each round, every player will play one card face up, going in turn to the left. On the first round, play begins on the dealer&rsquo;s left. On later rounds, play begins with the player who took the most points on the previous round. If this is tied, which is rare, then the same person leads the next round.<br/><br/>Generally, each card played in the round is worth its face value in points. However, if more than one card of the same rank are played, then the earlier ones are &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo; and only the last one scores. For example, if three 8&rsquo;s are played, only the last 8 can score.<br/><br/>There are also five special cards, described below, which do not behave by these basic rules.<br/><br/>Rules for 2-3 Players:<br/>Players start with ten cards. Each player will play two cards on each round, so play proceeds twice around the table. Be sure to remember which cards were played in what order.<br/><br/>Special Cards:<br/><br/>Each of the following cards breaks the basic rules in its own way.<br/><br/>1: Tinker. At the end of the round, this card may trade places with any other card.<br/><br/>2: Knight. Before scoring, this card kills (discards) the highest scoring card. Knights cannot kill cards of rank 3 and lower. Playing a second Knight does not spoil the first, and they can each kill a card.<br/><br/>3: Royal. This card cannot be traded, killed, or spoiled. When you play a 3, you will always score it.<br/><br/>7: Rain. If only one Rain card is played, it spoils everything except Royals, including 1&rsquo;s and 2&rsquo;s. (The player who played the Rain does score the Rain card.) However, if more than one Rain card are played, treat them as ordinary 7&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>9: Bandit. The first bandit, not the last, is the card that scores. Bandits played after the first one are spoiled.<br/><br/>The round ends after all players have played one card.<br/>Before scoring, first remove any cards that are spoiled, and then check the other cards in the following order:<br/>Royals, then Rain, Knights, and Tinker.<br/><br/>The hand is over when all cards have been played. A full game is six hands, or one hand for each player, whichever is greater.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Free game published in the August 2018 (GTM #222) issue of Game Trade Magazine.<br/><br/>The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Pirate Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.<br/><br/>Story: You are mutinous pirates trying to gather a crew and overthrow the Captain. But the Captain and his allies hide among you, and they aim to foil your plans!<br/><br/>Captain&rsquo;s Orders is a game of bluffing and deduction.<br/><br/>You Need: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.<br/><br/>Definitions: The Captain is a secret player, the person holding the lowest ranked card. The identity of Captain can change whenever cards are played and passed. Sometimes there will be a tie for lowest card, so there may be more than one Captain.<br/><br/>All non-Captain players are Mutineers. Mutineers can win the round either by discovering the Captain, or by accumulating the most points in their hands. (Cards are worth their face value in points.) The Captain can win only by running out of cards.<br/><br/>Each Round: To begin the round, shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. Play begins on the dealer&rsquo;s left and proceeds clockwise. Pass the deal to the left after each round.<br/><br/>On Your Turn: Your options are different depending on whether there is an Order on the table.<br/><br/>NO ORDER: If there is no Order on the table, you must do one of the following: play an Order, pass a card, ask for a card, or discover the Captain.<br/><br/>Play an Order: Play a card face up in the middle of the table. This card becomes an Order and you are its owner.<br/><br/>Pass a Card: Pass a card from your hand to another player, face down. That player must then discard one card face down.<br/><br/>Ask for a Card: Ask another player to pass you a card from their hand, face down. Then you must discard one card face down.<br/><br/>Discover the Captain: If you think you know who the Captain is, you can accuse that player. This ends the round, and all players must immediately reveal their hands to find the true identity of the Captain(s).<br/><br/>If you are a Mutineer, and you correctly identify the Captain, you win the round. Otherwise, you can&rsquo;t win, and the other Mutineer with the most points wins the round.<br/><br/>STANDING ORDER: When an Order is on the table, your options are different. You must either follow or belay the Order, or discover the Captain as described above.<br/><br/>Exception: You do not respond to your own Order. If an Order has traveled all the way around the table, its owner simply discards it, and the turn passes to the left.<br/><br/>Follow the Order: Pass a card face down to the owner of the Order. The rank of the card you pass must be equal to or higher than the rank of the Order. (Note: there is no discard after this type of card pass.)<br/><br/>Belay the Order: Play a new Order of a lower rank than the current Order. The old Order is discarded, and the new one belongs to you.<br/><br/>Ending the Round: The round ends when any player runs out of cards, or tries to discover the Captain.<br/><br/>Running out of Cards: Whenever you empty your hand, either by passing a card or by playing an Order, you may reveal that card and declare that you are the Captain. This ends the round, and if you&rsquo;re right, you win. If you were passing that card away, and you are not the Captain, then the card passes into that player&rsquo;s hand for scoring.<br/><br/>Ties for Captain: If more than one player holds the lowest card, then either of them can win by running out of cards, and Mutineers can win by accusing either of them. However, one Captain can&rsquo;t win by identifying another one.<br/><br/>Ties for Points: If two or more Mutineers win with the same score, they each score a win for the round .<br/><br/>Winning: The first player to win three rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each people shapes its unique civilization and develops its unique abilities. Eventually they will all meet and their meetings will tell which civilization that is destined to stand the test of time.<br/><br/>There are six victory conditions linked to the six civilization traits. Culture victory is won by placing all your culture tokens, Economic victory by collecting one of each resource, Military victory by placing all your tribes etc.<br/><br/>The game is played on modular map where new areas are added and merged as your civilization grows and expands.<br/><br/>Each turn you engage one tribe only. A tribe may either produce resources in its area or spend civilization points to take one of six civilization actions. Certain development cards improve certain actions.<br/><br/>1. Civics lets you build settlements or activate all tribes in a settlement in a turn.<br/>2. Culture lets you place culture tokens, which give discounts on civilization points.<br/>3. Economy lets you exchange resources with adjacent peoples to collect more valuable sets.<br/>4. Military lets you attack adjacent peoples to plunder their resources.<br/>5. Religion lets you place religion tokens, which give discounts on development cards.<br/>6. Science lets your tribes take actions in areas further away from their own areas.<br/><br/>When all tribes are engaged (but not before!), you must disengage them with a Revolution action. This is also the action where you grow your population and acquire civilization points and development cards. This also serves as a catch-up mechanic, since larger civilizations gets more productive actions but have to wait longer for the next Revolution action.<br/><br/>In Peoples, you are faced with tough tactical and strategic questions. Which civilization traits do you prioritize to achieve your goals? Which development cards do you acquire to adapt to the changing conditions? Which civilizations do you cooperate with and which do you compete with? The history will judge whether you answered the questions right or wrong.<br/><br/>",

Players choose their faction from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Dark Age Pagans, Ancient Egypt and Eldritch Abominations. Each faction has a unique roster and playstyle, further affected by the player's choice of deity.<br/><br/>The Mythos Board is the domain of the gods. Each player has one 35mm scale deity model which affects the rolls that they need to make on the battlefield. By way of example, soldiers that follow Ares will fight more effectively in combat than those who follow Hades, but Hades' followers are much tougher to kill. Each deity also has unique abilities called Divine Interventions, such as Osiris resurrecting friendly models or Loki stealing the enemy's dice,  meaning that overall the player's choice of deity has a massive effect on how their army performs. The gods are locked in their own struggle of wills and moods as they move around the Mythos Board. Their position grants further bonuses to their followers depending on what stats the player thinks are most important at the current moment in time.<br/><br/>The soldiers, beasts and heroes fight on the battlefield in the name of their deity. Legendary Units such as the Lernean Hydra, Julius Caesar and Ragnar Lothbrok are represented by 15mm scale miniautres, while ordinary soldiers are sculpted in 10mm on ranked bases. Players secretly assign their units order tokens and then activate them alternately, carrying out the order. Success or failure comes from dice rolls based on four stats - Wrath, Wisdom, Swiftness and Determination - with the number of dice to be rolled based on the unit's profile, equipment and the position of the patron deity on the Mythos Board. The deity's stats determine the roll for a success.<br/><br/>The turn structure is set up so that players roll off for priority, move their deities and attempt divine interventions, secretly assign orders to their units, carry out their orders alternately and then finally take break checks and check for victory conditions as determined by the scenario.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this cooperative board game players are taken back into the world of F. W. Raiffeisen. You 'll get to know the hard way of life in those days and experience, how a normal mayor by the name of Raiffeisen started alleviating misery and distress of normal people in 1845 and developed his concept of the cooperative idea, exactly in line with his motto &bdquo;What can't be done alone, can be done together&quot;.<br/><br/>During the course of time, this cooperative idea co-founded by Raiffeisen, has spread all round the world and since 2016, has been declared by UNESCO as &bdquo;Intangible Cultural Heritage&quot;.<br/><br/>The game board consists of 8 puzzle boards, which when together form a large landscape map. Here, the players travel through the villages where Raiffeisen implemented his ideas. Different fields of work present times of waiting, because the tasks set can only be overcome together. Players experience through 53 fields, what Raiffeisen undertook against hunger and misery. Those players falling behind are taken by the hand of solidarity and given the chance to carry on playing. Players with &bdquo;Solvency Problems&quot; are given financial help through solidarity. Single moves mostly affect the other players, so that all participants are ensnared in this exciting journey through time &mdash; right from the beginning, all the way through to the end.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, there is not only one winner and one thing is for certain: this lively game is lots of fun and imparts to children as well as grown-ups lots of interesting facts about Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen and the times he lived in. Game board size and length of play can be decided upon. Decide how much time you have and then take the plunge into Raiffeisen's World for as long as you like: one, two or even for three hours.<br/><br/>&mdash;from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

In the audition phase each player drafts a choice role or scathing gossip from their hand and passes the rest along. Roles a player places into their schedule are worth points at the end, but are at risk of being lost or stolen based on the Sabotage cards played.

Game play involves playing market cards to claim control of either regions or industries, manipulating market limits, or developing key growth industries.  Markets may only be developed to fixed limits (based on the number of players) and thus it is essential for players to balance their limited investments with efforts to manipulate the market limits.  Controlling a growth industry provides players with additional cards with which to plan, but growth industries can shift rapidly.<br/><br/>Business is both a regional and an industry affair.  Although each region and industry operates within its own context, there are strong connections that interweave to create the global market.  Knowing how just one market works can earn you a fortune, but to be a true economic titan one must know how to manipulate all the markets together.

        "description": "GROK-or-GUMP contains 3 games in 1.  All 3 games use a special dual-suited 30 card deck called a GROK Deck.  Each card has a Major Suit and a Minor Suit.  There are 3 Major suits (each with 10 cards) and 5 Minor suits in the deck (each with 6 cards).<br/><br/>The 3 games included are each distinctly different from each other.<br/><br/>GROK: A trick-taking with escalating bids in which 1 player takes on all other players.  Players bid on the number of cards of either Major or Minor suits they will capture during the round.  A player wins the bid points if they are successful; however, if a player obtains a result that is better than the highest bid at the start of the round, all other players score points per that result.<br/><br/>GUMP: A hand-elimination game in which players attempt to be the first player to play all of their cards - or - be the player with the least cards in hand when the round ends.  This game makes use of 18 supplemental GROK Rule cards that specify how cards must be played.  If a player is unable to play according to the rule, they add all played cards to their hand and flip up a new rule.  The game ends when a player plays their last card or if all 18 rules have been used.<br/><br/>GROK-or-GUMP: A pattern-recognition and social deduction style game.  This game uses a small number of GROK Rule cards and a hand of 5 cards.  Prior to starting the round, all players secretly decide if they will follow 1 of the face up rule cards or follow none of them.  Once all players have decided which way they will play, players each play 1 card down in front of themselves.  Players may then choose to place a bet on any player as to which way they are playing.  Play continues until all 5 cards are played.  Players score points based on when and if the other players' bets were correct.<br/><br/>From the Publisher:<br/><br/>Some people are natural players; some are just plain lucky.  And though it can be hard to tell them apart, at least each has a name.<br/><br/>GROK:(n) A player who understands a game intuitively and completely and thus obtains success through skill.<br/><br/>GUMP:(n) A player who plays without obvious thought or plays randomly but nonetheless has consistent success.<br/><br/>Not sure which you are? The games included in GROK-or-GUMP will figure it out for you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Champions: Hills of Glory is tactical arena style card/board game for 2 to 4 players where each takes the role of a commander in a fantasy battlefield who is ordered to capture and hold a strategically positioned small hill. Commanders will send their units up the hill battling the opponents&rsquo; in a 4x4 field, trying to keep as many as possible alive while assisting them with their unique abilities and specialty cards. Each unit in the field will grant their commander 1 victory point at the end of each round. The first player to score 24 victory points claims the hill and becomes the winner.<br/><br/>The game consists of two types of cards; units (of levels 1 to 5) and specialty cards (of five types: combat, tactics, sorcery, trickery and faith). Each player chooses a commander and takes the appropriate template. On their commander templates, players can track their power (the resource needed to play cards), their actions and their abilities (each commander has two). Commanders aslo have one or two specializations each, noting which specialty card types they're favoring. Units are set up on 5 stacks - one for each level and players will reveal the topmost of each level and place it in front of its stack. Specialty cards are also separated in 5 stacks by type.<br/><br/>During a game round each player will take two turns. When one's 1st turn comes, he or she will choose and execute two of the four available actions (any of them in any order). Once done, turn passes to the next player and so on. When his or hers second turn comes, he or she will execute the remaining two actions. The actions player can take are: A) Increase Power: player increases his or her power by 3. If he has a specialty card in hand, he can discard one to increase the power for 2 more. A player's power can't be more than 6 or less than 0. B) Draw: player can draw up to two cards whether they are units, specialties or a combination of both. If a player wants to draw a unit, she must pay the unit's level in power. She can either draw from the revealed ones or the top face-down unit of a stack. To draw a specialty card the player needs to pay no power. She can just draw one from any stack plus one of the stack she specializes. C) Play: player can play up to two cards from their hand, being a unit, a specialty or a combination of both. To play a specialty card he must have at least as many power as the card indicates (though he doesn't spend it). Specialty cards can empower friendly units or effect negatively the opponent ones. Each specialty type focuses on different gameplay aspects (damage, buff, debuff, heal, extra activations etc). To play a unit he puts it face-down on his starting area. Opponents can see now that he is about to send a unit of X level (it's typed on the card back) in the field. D)Command: the meat of the game. During this action the player can activate up to 2 of her units in the field. Units have 4 characteristics indicating how long they can move, how many dice they roll per attack and what type of attack they have (determines its range), its defence (how difficult is to get hit) and its life (how many damage it can sustain). They also have special abilities that they can use at that moment. When a unit attacks another, the controlling player rolls dice equal to its attack. For each roll that was equal or higher than the target's defense, he scores a hit. The number of hits is the damage inflicted upon the opponent unit. If a player has more than 2 units in the field and he didn't activate them, he can put them under &quot;defend command&quot;. They can now act during an opponent turn! Special condition effects such as daze, poison, bleed or shatter can be applied to units via abilities or specialty cards, to spice up the game and give it more tactical depth.<br/><br/>When all players have played 2 turns each, the round ends and they count score - 1 point for each of their units remain on the field. If a player has 24 points at that time, he or she is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Fourteen pieces (two sets of 7) marked with a number between 1 ~ 7 and and two pieces marked with an X.  The X marked pieces are called the Dukes.  All pieces are free to move in Queen style movements.  Their imprinted numbers define their step limitations.  Dukes also move freely, but only one step at a time.  The goal of the game is for each player to eliminate both opponent Dukes.<br/><br/>The game is played on the above three simple rules, plus one optional rule for advanced players.

        "description": "The Universal Tabletop Strategy Game of Gods, Monsters, and Machines<br/><br/>From the mountains of Olympus to the depths of the darkest oceans, they awoke from their long slumber. Gods, demi-gods, titans, demons and other-worldly beings from your nightmares came from myth and became reality. Alliances formed and the stage was set for war like never before seen on Earth, or even beneath it.<br/><br/>Mankind has found itself between colossal forces of legendary power. C&rsquo;thulean terrors rise from the oceans as gods ride winged beasts into battle. Meanwhile, the armies of humanity fight simply to survive. With the awakening of the gods, long dormant demi-gods, mutants, and freaks, have unleashed chaos on the world.<br/><br/>This new world disorder has left many cities burning husks while the people flee to the remaining bastions of safety and security.<br/><br/>The Immortal Wars is a table-top strategy game mixing fantasy, modern, science-fiction, and superhero genres. Do battle with tanks, infantry, hovercraft, jet fighters, giant mecha, mutants, superhumans, and abominations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>The Immortal Wars is played on a flat surface (a minimum of 4' x 6' is recommended) with distances measured in inches (the game uses the curiously mixed ratio of 1 inch to 7.5 meters).  Combatants are represented by miniature figures (representing single units) with an associated &quot;unit card&quot; providing data and tracking damage, etc.  Combat and movement occur in rounds, each round representing about six seconds.  Random results are generated using only twelve-sided dice (d12).  Several dice in different colors are recommended.<br/><br/>The game assumes two &quot;sides&quot; in each combat, each controlled by one (optionally more) player.  Each player builds their force by purchasing units with points.  One player is the defender; the other player is the attacker.  Setup follows a pre-determined &quot;scenario&quot; (setup guide).<br/><br/>During each round, initiative is determined.  The losing player moves 1/2 of their units; the winning player moves 1/2 of their units; the losing player move the remainder of their units; the winning player moves the remainder of their units.  Most units can move vertically as well as horizontally.  Units utilize a somewhat simplified method of two-dimensional facing.  Attacks are resolved at the end of a movement, if legal - this means the player that loses initiative will perform the first attacks of the round.<br/><br/>The game supports a wide range of combatant types, from mecha to armor to monsters.  Many units have special abilities that invoke special rules.  A variety of terrain and status situations may apply.  The game also provides a wide variety of optional rules (including adjustments to 25mm scale).<br/><br/>Play persists until one player achieves pre-determined victory results or eliminates the other player.<br/><br/>The game document includes a large number of print-and-play tokens to mark various effects on the battlefield.  Also included are blank, print-and-play unit cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Except for moving along the board, picking up power or money cards, players can interact with merchants placed along the board, as well as interact with other players but only when both players end up on the same tile. Each player then rolls a die and multiplies it with each current power status and the one with the least takes damage on his/her power status.<br/><br/>As the goal of the game players by selling and buying products to gain the most power and money.<br/><br/>",

This game is designed to be easy to play, yet the degree of &quot;luck&quot; involved can make it interesting to gamers who like the thrill of risk-taking.

        "description": "Once, there was a woman who was too busy playing board games that she remained single throughout her life. (Board games do have such an appeal.) During her lifetime, she won prizes at all sorts of major game tournaments and became a billionaire.<br/><br/>Then a rumor spread that she lies in her coffin with game components made of gold, but time has passed without anyone finding that coffin. And, on this day, from among millions of games, you have found and acquired this coffin by spending a large sum of 500 yen. (Hurrah!)<br/>However, you have opened the coffin and found out that the rumor about the gold components was not true, though it was not entirely false either. The coffin contains mysterious unknown components collected by the deceased from across the world over the years. And many of them are human figures. (Eek!) The woman, who has become a zombie, is trying to put a curse on you to turn you into a zombie. She is vexed to have died without playing enough games and therefore has a grudge against you, who opened this coffin so joyfully.<br/><br/>So now is the time to play this game and win it in order to nail in the coffin and put the zombie old maid into an eternal slumber. Well, do not fear. This is a simple game like any other Old Maid. All you need to do is just get rid of the cards in your hand quickly. Go ahead and break the curse with joy!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>In this Old Maid variant, pairs are made up of a color card and a  gray card. A player that has one of the two Zombie Old Maids has to show his gray cards to the other players. When drawing a card from him, other players can choose to draw one of his (concealed) color cards, or to choose one of his gray cards - but then they get the Zombie Old Maid too. The goal of the game is to be the first to empty your hand.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A contemporary variation on the classic game of Clue (Cluedo) crossed with the Trump-Russia collusion scandals. It is simultaneously humorous political satire and yet an engaging fully playable game with more complexity than the original.<br/><br/>This card and board game contains many new innovations such as an action-point based system of movement between locations, the requirement that other player-suspects be subpoenaed with an action point (and the ability of other players to resist being moved by subpoena), and the Pardon Power--the ability to pardon the the guilty suspect to alter the game's logic mid-game. The game is played both collaboratively and competitively with other players.<br/><br/>Each player is a Special Agent on a FBI team investigating clues at potential crime scenes from New York and Washington to London and Moscow. Each player is assigned one of eight suspects to tail around the world, and also has subpoena power to summon one other suspect each turn to a potential crime scene.<br/><br/>Players use logic to separate out the merely scandalous from the criminally scandalous, and work to bring an indictment against the correct suspect in one scandal at one scene. The indictment must be correct, or the team will lose the game--and the country.<br/><br/>Ideally, you would like to be the first Special Agent to discover the correct indictment, but any agent on the team can win for the good of the country.<br/><br/>Remember, the clock is ticking. If the team makes Donald Trump too angry, he might exercise the Pardon Power. And if the investigation drags on too long, then all will truly be lost...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A battle-royale, tile placement, strategical board game with grid movement and resources management mechanics.<br/><br/>The game starts with putting villagers on the border and each stepping to the middle tile of the side. Villagers start moving by opening new tiles. They explore new lands and mine or find resources, kill enemies, buy new soldier... But they must be afraid of The Storm. The Storm is behind them, and the safe zone is becoming smaller over time. They must fight for that zone and survive. They can mine resources, help friends, shoot from catapult, be lost in a forest an much more.<br/><br/>A bit detailed:<br/><br/>Getting Started<br/>To start a game you need to connect borders and place tiles inside borders. Then choose a color, take 2 soldiers, open the central tile of one of the sides of hexagon and place your soldiers on it. That tile is considered as free space. It cannot harm you or be used in any ways. Place the counter on one of the corners of hexagon, which will be counting point. After finishing the preparation choose the first player by rolling the dice, the queue will be determined clockwise. The goal is to survive and be the last man standing.<br/><br/>Turn<br/>Each of villagers can do one action in each turn. The actions are: moving to neighbor tile, buying another villager, killing enemy villagers. Villager can move only to neighbor tiles (the tile which has common side). He must open the unopened tile after moving on it, if the tile is not closed by the storm. He can also carry the resources with him to the new tile (maximal quantity of each resource is mentioned on villager&rsquo;s section), but resources only of one type.<br/><br/>Villagers<br/>A villager dies after a hit from another. To hit an enemy, villager needs to stand on the neighbor tile of the enemy and move to another neighbor tile of an enemy, which is not an abyss, another enemy. You can only kill one enemy on a tile, if the enemy villager&rsquo;s number is greater than one, you can choose which on must die. Villager dies immediately, when he stands on enemy tile. Player can use only the resources, which are located in it&rsquo;s villager&rsquo;s tile. Player must pay one bread , if his villager&rsquo;s count is more than or equal to 3, otherwise he must sacrifice one of his villagers for each unpaid turn. On one tile can be placed less than 4 villagers. You can buy new villagers by gold. Bought villager is placed on tile, where is the other villager with gold. After death of the villager all his resources stay on the same tile, and everyone can take it. If that tile is not available, the resources go to bank. If player does anything with villager, he cannot cancel it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These rules describe an often overlooked period of warfare known as the Wars of the Orcses, a civil war between competing factions in the northern regions of Orcland. The war was fought between two rival branches of the House of Plantagut: the House of Lank-Pasta, associated with the emblem of the red rose growing out of the skull of a dead Angry-Vin Goblin &ndash; and the House of Yorc whose symbol was the white rose (growing out of the arse of a dead Stu-Wart Goblin). The wars lasted for over thirty years with many epic battles fought including the Battles of Stained Albans, Pewksebery and many many more. The struggle swung back and forth with first one faction in the ascendancy and then the other. The heavy loss of Orc life was both widespread and tragic &ndash; and neighbouring powers looked on with interest as Orcland seemed to tear itself apart. Eventually the war ended at the decisive Battle of Bogsworth Field and the crowning of the warlord Hen-Wee as king Hen-Wee VII. The kings position was further strengthened when Hen-Wee married Elibarf of Yorc, the daughter of Edturd IV, the most prominent Yorcist claimant to the throne of Orcland.<br/><br/>The Wars of the Orcses rules allow players to fight large scale battles between rival Orc armies with lots of supporting allied and mercenary units of Goblins, Hobgoblins, Trolls and Ogres. The rules included a detailed background to the conflict, the key players and a list of the major battles fought. Also included is a scenario describing the Battle of Pewksbery. If you fancy a bit of Orc on Orc action you probably need help &ndash; but either way these are the rules for you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One of them is the murderer and the others must figure out who it is by studying the clues, police report, map, crime scene photos, and cross examining the other players.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s early century, but the rapid development of steam technology makes it feel like we are living in the far future. Steam power has ushered in a technological age with machines and devices that are amazing. Steam power is modern power, yet the age old drives of greed, lust, envy, and hate still guide us, and still, murder happens.<br/><br/>The guests in this steampunk world arrive at the Lilly Hotel to gather in this quaint place in the middle of town, yet surrounded by woods. Actually, that sounds a little creepy. It&rsquo;s a comfortable establishment with good food, but the Lilly&rsquo;s claim to fame are the seances held there. So ghosts are expected, as are the lost loved ones. Perhaps what is surprising are all the tawdry foibles of the living; greed, secrets, lust, and the soon to be dearly departed.<br/><br/>So sit down at the table and as soon as the honored guest arrives by steam driven airship you can be assured of an interesting evening&hellip; and that someone ain&rsquo;t gonna make it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You win the game by out-manouvering your opponents and pushing them out of the playing area.<br/><br/>The game features a novel and highly thematic mechanic when the first player loses all their robots, the rate of arena shrink dramatically increases bringing a tense, engrossing, organic and rapid resolution to the game. The game is therefore designed to have a dramatic climax and if you are the first to go out, you will always want to see how it plays out.<br/><br/>Your robots have a Charge Chamber, which when filled can be used to perform upgraded actions to help give you the edge over your opponents.<br/><br/>Each turn you will perform actions with one robot, then perform actions with your other robot on your next turn.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will perform up to 3 different actions or the same action twice:<br/>- Run. Move your robot round the arena. Each space on the board can only be travelled over twice so how you move is criticial to your success or demise.<br/>- Jolt. Knock opponent robots (or even your own) one space to gain a tactical and positional advantage!<br/>- Place Force Shields. Inpenetrable shields that you can place adjacent to your robot to use for area control or to help push opponents out<br/>- Drain / Recharge Arena. Use this to take some power from the arena and power up your charge chamber, putting you at more risk or replenish the arena to give you some breathing space<br/>- Jump. As the game progresses you will need this to help get you out of a corner or to cause spectacular KO's<br/>- Upgrade Charge Chamber Capacity. You want to get more powerful actions? Of course you do!<br/><br/>If you find yourself in a tight spot and see no way out then don't worry! You can use your Prime token to give you some breathing space or to open a path to victory.<br/><br/>There are multiple variable player powers which provides great replayability and for more variants, there are rules for House Robots who add to the mayhem!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The player who&rsquo;s card has the greatest number of letters is the dealer. <br/>The dealer shuffles the deck and gives each player 7 cards.<br/><br/>Then places the remainder of the deck face down to create a &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile. <br/>The dealer takes the top card off the &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile and puts it face up, to begin the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile.<br/><br/>START PLAYING<br/>The person to the left of the dealer begins the game.<br/><br/>When it&rsquo;s your turn you must put down a card matching the top card on the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile, either being the same type of word (adjective, noun, verb or conjunction) or having a matching punctuation sign<br/>(!   ,   ?   &lsquo;   :   &ldquo;&rdquo;  . ). <br/>You can also put down any &lsquo;action card&rsquo; (see action card).<br/>&nbsp;<br/>EXAMPLE: If the top card on the &ldquo;put down&rsquo; pile is the word &lsquo;happy&rsquo; with a : on it, the next person must put down either another adjective card, a card with a : on it or a action card (see Action Cards).<br/>&nbsp;<br/>If you don&rsquo;t have a card that matches the card on top of the &lsquo;put down&rsquo;  pile you must pick up a card from the top of the &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile.  This is the end of your turn.<br/><br/>ACTION CARDS<br/>The following action cards can be placed on the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile at any point during your turn, no matter what the top card on the pile is. When an action card is played the word type is automatically changed to the same as the word on the card being played.<br/><br/>Pick Up 2  &ndash; When this card is played the next player must pick up two cards and cannot put down any cards. If they have a &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; card as well they can then play that card, making the next person pick up four etc.<br/>Miss A Go  &ndash; When this card is played the next person misses their turn. <br/>Go Back  &ndash; When this card is played the direction of play is reversed. <br/>Spell It &ndash; When this card is played the player putting the card down picks up a card from the &rsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile and asks the player, who's turn it is next, to spell the word. If the word is spelt correctly, the card is placed on the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile and the speller takes his turn. If the word is spelt incorrectly, the card is given to the speller and they miss their turn.

Players play intrepid Characters from the Island who are preparing to venture into the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean, at the calling of their Ariki (Chief), following the tale of a navigator that returned from sea with stories of the Great Fish of Maui.<br/><br/>Players will play as a small whānau (family), within the story. They will work to build Waka Hourua (seafaring boats) and their whānau Mana, while following the Seasons and the Atua (Gods) that drive them. Players move three Meeples representing three generations of the whānau around an Island, collecting resources and building their technology.<br/><br/>The game uses an asynchronous game ending mechanic, meaning Players can finish earlier than others, but risk missing out on building bigger, and better Waka Hourua. Additionally, when playing as a game series, Players order of completion in OCEANS translates directly to the starting order of ISLANDS, providing a connected narrative between the games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The first player flicks all of their ships once.<br/>4. The second player then flicks all of their ships once.<br/>5. Play continues like this with each player only being able to flick their mobile ships (right way up).<br/><br/>Beyond flicking to move, spaceships in MAG-Wars can do a number of different things. Here is a list of some of the potential actions that can be declared during a battle:<br/><br/>A. Attack - You can flick a ship at an enemy and if it makes contact, that enemy ship loses power and is immobilised (placed with its tail end down on the table).<br/>B. Assist - If you have an immobilised ship on the table, you may declare assist, rotate that ship to the angle required and then flick a ship at it to try and knock it back down (power it up). If successful, that ship may be flicked this turn as normal (chaining multiple assist flicks can potentially power your entire team back up in one turn).<br/>C. Repair - Some ships need only make contact with a powered down ship to be able to power it back up and get it flicking again.<br/>D. Dock - Certain ships have the ability to dock with other ships. If this is declared and the flick successfully makes contact with an appropriate target (varies per ship), then the two become docked together.<br/>A docked ship can be:<br/>- Towed to its enemy&rsquo;s portal and captured (removing it from the game),<br/>- Boarded and looted,<br/>- Did I mention these ships TRANSFORM!!!<br/>Well actually they can be combined together in various different combinations. Should a player declare &lsquo;dock&rsquo; and then make contact to the appropriate ship, the two ship models can be temporarily combined to form a &lsquo;Hyper Ship&rsquo; with a very powerful and unique ability.<br/><br/>To win the game you must either:<br/>Knock/have all your opponent&rsquo;s ships immobilised,<br/>Fulfill all three of your hidden objective cards,<br/>Have the highest total ore value when all ore has been collected.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Along the way you will also raise revenue by milking your cows, breeding cattle and sending your herd to graze on both your own and your opponent's farm, all while attempting to defend your own patch of grass from your similarly inclined neighbor.<br/><br/>Players have a hand of cards from which they play farmland, cattle, action, enrichment, and building cards. Farmland cards are free to play and produce grass which can be spent to play other cards. Any unspent grass can be grazed on by your opponent's cattle to earn money. Money can also be earned by milking cows or slaughtering cattle. Action and enrichment cards directly affect the player or other cards in play.

        "description": "Se Rappeler, also known as &quot;Fun to Remember&quot; is a box containing the components to play a series of children's memory games:<br/><br/><br/>     The Pairs Memory Game - the traditional &quot;Memory&quot; game where players turn over two cards at a time trying to make matched pairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Countryside Game - On a board depicting an outdoor scene, a player arranges several pieces in the empty spaces and shows it to the other player.  The first player then secretly changes one or two pieces and shows it again to the other player, who must identify the changes.  Players take turns until one has identified ten changes correctly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Kim's Game - Players take turns being the dealer.  They place 20 silhouette pictures on the table, give other players a few seconds to look and then secretly remove one or more.  Players then must mark on their board which pieces have been removed, keeping the markers for correct guesses.  After each player has been dealer twice, the player with the most markers wins.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>     What Followed Next? - Players start with a set of eight pictures face-down.  The first player chooses a picture, looks at it, says aloud what it is and then places it face-down, starting a row.  The second player chooses a second tile, looks and then must say the name of the first and second tiles in order.  The third player must name the first two tiles in order and then his or her newly-drawn tile.  This continues until a player thinks another has made a mistake and calls for a check.  The tiles are checked and whichever player is wrong is eliminated.  Play includes until only one player remains.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In the Pocket Game - Each player has a board depicting 20 objects.  Silhouette tiles of these objects form a supply.  In turn, each player chooses a silhouette and hides it.  The player to the left then asks a yes/no question about the item (e.g. &quot;is it round?&quot;).  If the answer is no, the next player asks a question.  If the answer is yes, the asker may guess the identity of the item.  If correct, the player receives the tile and places it in the correct space on his or her board.  If incorrect, the next player may take a turn.  The player who wins the tile becomes the next to choose a tile and answer questions.  The first player to get five tiles wins.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Cell-O allows players to change their pieces over the course of the game, creating countless combinations of movement possibilities!<br/><br/>In Cell-O, each player starts with a single cell creature which can move, eat, multiply and evolve into slowly-growing shapes that dictate their future movement. Competing against other creatures for food and space, players must try and expand their population enough to escape the primordial pool of their species' birth into the greater world beyond.<br/><br/>During a turn, each player gets one action to move, eat, or spawn a new creature from an existing one. Eating gives a creature a new shape that then dictates how it moves in future. It takes tactics and foresight to mutate and expand your population in order to escape while preventing your opponent's from doing the same.<br/><br/>When a player gets enough of their creatures across the board and out of the pool, they win!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These rules will enable you to play skirmish or adventure games, using 40mm or 28mm miniatures, from any era of history from the Prehistoric right through to the Napoleonic wars. Games can be played with as few as 2 figures and up to about 30 figures a side. Rules for stealth, fist fighting, martial arts. multiple combats, cavalry, spears and a whole host of other weapon types are included. Most games can be played in a couple of hours and so are suitable for club nights. Although these rules were primarily designed for our 40mm Samurai range, they could be used with our 28mm Prehistoric Settlement. These rules will also help you find a use for all those part finished armies that we all have. As you only need a small number of figures, taking up a new period need not be a vast and time consuming occupation.<br/><br/>The game has a Character development section, enabling the Player to chart the progress of their Characters. So who knows maybe your peasant can make it and become a Warrior or even a Hero!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Set the remaining cards aside.<br/><br/>Each trick (or turn) of the game consists of every player placing 1 card into the middle of the playing surface, in clockwise order.<br/><br/>The player to the dealer's left begins the game.<br/><br/>For each trick, the first card played must be one of the game's 8 suits&ndash; cat, zombie, werewolf, witch, vampire, ghost, monster or mummy. Subsequent cards played in a trick must follow suit, unless a player does not have a card of said suit, or holds a special (!) card (which may be played instead). The player with the highest value card played, of the dominant suit, takes the trick. Players score 1 point for every card of any type taken, as well as bonus/penalty points listed on special cards.<br/><br/>The trick taker begins the next turn. Special cards cannot be used to start a trick. If the player starting a trick has only special cards to play, all remaining tricks of the hand are void, along with that player being assessed a -15 point penalty.<br/><br/>The first player to 100 points, wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ROKURIGO is a two-player abstract strategy game that contains elements of Reversi.<br/><br/>The playing area is a 6x6 grid, although players will be placing their pieces only in the central twenty spaces. Each player has three types of double-sided pieces that mirror the numbers you find on opposite sides of a standard six-sided die: 1/6, 2/5, and 3/4, with five of each piece. Some numbers are printed on the game board.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing a piece on the game board. You can freely place one of your pieces in the four central spaces or on the second-closest row of the game board. If you want to place a piece elsewhere, though, you must &quot;sandwich&quot; a piece Reversi-style in order to flip it. You need to track the sum of numbers visible because if you bring the total to 33, then you capture one of the opponent's pieces. If you bring the total to 37 or more, then you lose the game instantly, so think carefully before you flip something!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is based in London in 1890, and the player is setting up a department store.  The store consists of a number of departments, which each need to be filled with stock.  Customers come to the store with a list of items that need to be bought.  If all items are sold by a single player's department store, then that player wins that customer.  If the customer still has items remaining to be bought, then they move onto the next player's department.<br/><br/>This is mainly a card-based game, where customers, items to be bought, and departments are represented by cards, and stock is represented by small wooden cubes.  On a player's turn, they can choose a customer from 3 available customers, who each have a number of items that they want to buy, the number of which are decided by the roll of a dice.  Only the number of items to buy is visible to the player, not the actual items themselves, so it's only when the customer is chosen that the items are revealed and the player knows what can be sold.  Players receive money for items sold, which can then be used to buy new stock or new departments at the end of their turn.<br/><br/>The game relies on players choosing the right departments to set up, depending on what other players have already chosen, and deciding which departments should get restocked and at what time, especially when money is limited.  A player wins by being the player with the highest number of customers that had all items sold during one turn.  There are bonus points available for having the majority of customers in each family of customer.<br/><br/>Game contains 70 cards, 50 wooden cubes, 1 dice, 45 &pound;1/&pound;2/&pound;5/&pound;10 notes and a rule book.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is now 2017, one hundred years since the United States entered the First World War on the side of the Allies in one of the most unnecessary and wasteful wars ever fought.<br/><br/>The research required almost got in the way of the game system, with diagrams and illustrations. Consequently after system, with diagrams and illustrations. Consequently after many rewrites it was decided to create one book as a game system and another as a simple note book. Both over lap each other. It did seem necessary to describe the tactical techniques in some great detail. Fortunately there is plenty of information on how these weapons were used on the battlefield. This availability of information made it possible to transform information into a realistic game system. However incomplete as it may be, the rules still effectively cover only a small part of the late ground war.<br/><br/>The game system includes supportive diagrams, illustrations, tactical notes and Quick Reference Sheets (Q.R.S.). The Turn Sequence and Turn Phases, once understood, make play easy and fast. The system has two Turn Sequences one of which is optional and the other mandatory. Six basic Turn Phases move the game along to a conclusion. Manufacturers will be glad by the fact that the game is best played using lots of figures and models. Let us be glad that there are sources for figures and models.<br/><br/>Basic units are 12 figures for a platoon with four platoons making a company and three to four companies making a battalion. Figures can be mounted individually or on multiple stands. Morale is based on unit size and applicable modifiers. Movement is with a D-10 die roll for both infantry and tanks. Transport and field artillery movement is determined by the roll of a D-6. There are two Turn Phases in which players can shoot. Hand-to-hand combat is easily performed. Players are always encouraged to adjust the rules to suit their perceptions.<br/><br/>To me, Yanks and Tanks captures the flavor of the late war. I hope your games will be hard fought, yet fun, and the game system competes well with other similar systems.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Politics can be dirty and politics can be frustrating but now politics can be fun with this fast-paced exciting card game. Players work to win the nomination of their party in the first phase of play then join together in teams to compete in the national election. Votes are gained by using political influence in this trick-taking game. Do you have what it takes to run for office and lead your country to greatness or, at least, have a lot of fun trying?<br/><br/>Run For Office is played in two phases of seven rounds each. The first phase is the Primary where each player works to win the nomination of their own party. The second phase is the Election where players work together in two competing teams to elect a president (winner).<br/><br/>In the Primary, each player gets a party, negotiates a platform by trading cards, and then gains Influence Cards. The Influence Cards are used to win Vote Cards by taking tricks. The Top two players who collect the most votes in their party are the winners of the Primary. The remaining players form teams with the two winners and a final Election takes place. Again, players gain Influence Cards to take Vote Cards through tricks but must do so in teams. The party members with the most votes at the end of the Election are the winners.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Oh, and it&rsquo;s got psychotic bunnies. Don&rsquo;t forget the bunnies.<br/><br/>To win the game, you need to ensure you have the lowest score possible each round. The last bunny standing is the winner. That might sound easy, but with only 10 seconds to view half or your drawn cards and the other half of your hand a complete mystery, it soon becomes more of a challenge!<br/><br/>Play can become incredibly strategic (e.g. do you 'play safe' and try to attain low scoring cards, or do you collect high scoring cards that others are more likely to discard, running the risk of being stuck with them when play ends?).<br/><br/>Then there's the element of luck. You have no idea what half of your deck contains. Sometimes at the end of a round, they're as much as a surprise to you as to the rest of the players. This can be a good or a bad thing! Add to that several 'Trick or Treat' cards designed to test your skills (and your sanity), and Psychobunnies is an absolute riot to play.<br/><br/>No bunnies were harmed in the making of this game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

One of each card type is used to create the main character, the hero/ine of the story.  A main character will also have a Trait and a Theme that help direct the narrative.<br/><br/>The players take turns as the Author to add cards from their hand to the table.  Everyone who is waiting for a turn is an Editor.  Editors offer suggestions (in the form of cards from their own hands), and reward the Author for creative plays with &quot;Awesome cards&quot; - as in &quot;That was awesome!&quot; - which are bonus cards added to the Author's stock.<br/><br/>Any card may introduce the namesake element into the story (eg. a volcano, Zombie, or mask), OR be used as an action to describe another character doing something (eg. incinerating, chasing, or tricking).  The cards provide a growing pool of words to be used, reused and reinterpreted as the story goes on.  The rules of narration may be as strict or generous as the players wish.  Spontaneous role-playing and voice-acting are often observed in casual play.<br/><br/>The game ends when the main character's conflict is resolved, or any player runs out of cards.  Players can resolve &quot;cliff-hanger&quot; endings in a number of ways: they may reveal the remaining cards, ad-lib a fitting resolution, or by player elimination.<br/><br/>CoAUTHORation can also be used for brainstorming or as a tool to overcome writer's block.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Adolf Hitler declared the city's capture to be the leading objective of Operation Barbarossa, the June 1941 sneak attack on the Soviet Union. Desperate to stop them and preserve the city of Peter the Great, the Red Army repeatedly made valiant efforts to stop them, and just as often, the Germans rolled over and around them. By August the city had been isolated from the rest of the Soviet Union, but its defenders refused to yield. For 900 days they held against savage Nazi bombardments, writing an epic chapter in the story of the Great Patriotic War.<br/><br/>Gates of Leningrad is a complete Panzer Grenadier game based on based on the German drive to capture Leningrad, and the Soviet defense of the approaches. There are 30 scenarios based on these battles, organized into ten &ldquo;battle games&rdquo; that allow you to play the scenarios in sequence toward your army&rsquo;s operational goals.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Competitors will have to travel across the Galaxy, capturing dangerous creatures (and earning credits in the process) in different systems before being able to return to the Guild&rsquo;s HQ and claiming the title of Leader.

Everyone knew everyone else&rsquo;s name (and business) and the only dramas in the village were small ones. In short, it was peaceful.<br/><br/>But all that changed when, one night, a wolf&rsquo;s howl split the darkness.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/><br/>Werewolf in the Dark is a game of hidden roles, deception, strategy, and, above all else, survival. When the lights go out some are afraid&mdash;they hide and hope. Others know that it is up to them to protect their fellow villagers and drive back the monsters menacing them. Still others begin to the feel the dark stirrings of a terrible hunger and rise to hunt.<br/><br/>Werewolf in the Dark is played in two alternating rounds: night and day. Players join one of two teams: the village team or the monster team. Each night the lights go out and players get up and venture out to hide or hunt. The players on the monster team are trying to kill the other players by covertly tapping them on the shoulder until all the villagers are dead. The villagers are trying to survive the night round and gather information about the identities of the monsters among them. When the first dead body is found, the lights come on and the day round begins. All players then gather together to discuss what happened in the night round and vote someone out of the game. The game continues until there are only monsters or villagers left.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the distant future, the year 2000. Mankind has colonised all of the rocky planets of the inner solar system. However Ceres, deep in the heart of the Asteroid Belt, remains a distant and desolate outpost even after the industrial process used to create fertile soils and an oxygen-rich atmosphere.<br/><br/>You are one of a few hardy (some would say fool-hardy) galactic pioneers who have sunk everything they own into a patch of Cerean land and a handful of 'bots to tend and defend it. For the rapidly growing crops of Ceres fetch premium prices back on flooded, overpopulated Earth. Meanwhile the warlike colonies of Mars, intent on their independence from Earth, continue to blockade and harass Cerean shuttles. Will you make your fortune and retire to the balmy resorts of Venus? Or will the challenges of Starfarm Ceres overwhelm and ruin you?<br/><br/>Starfarm Ceres is a worker placement solitaire game divided across three game boards. On the first, you deploy your 'bots to sow crops and harvest them once they mature using a unique time delay mechanism. On the second you must shoot down Martian saucers that multiply and descend to raze your crops. Finally you must send shuttles back to Earth, through the Martian blockade, to the third board where you sell your produce and buy upgrades. The language-independent game boards are double-sided with slightly different scenarios on each, giving eight different game setup possibilities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

DIY Takuya helps by making game boards, components and organizers using laser-cut wood.<br/><br/>In the 2-player game of ARIZIGOKU, you try to save members of your faction from the Antlion pit.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, you are assigned one of four factions. Member tokens are scattered in a concave pit-shaped game board. Each member belongs to two factions, inscribed in each side of the token.<br/><br/>You have three actions each turn. By spending an action, you move your rescuer pawn to save a member, or move a soldier pawn to force a member fall one tier. If a member falls to the bottom, that member is lost.<br/><br/>You win the game when you save a certain number of members of your faction. You lose the game when three victims of your faction fall into the bottom of the pit. (Other conditions may apply.)<br/><br/>This game has two modes: basic game and standard game.

This international business is all about the gold, but watch out for your gold hungry opponents! With the roll of the dice, the selection of a port where you're destined to carry the purchased goods on your ship, and the luck of the winds - you can win it all! Beware of the adventures, fun, and laughs that are likely to occur along the journey.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>TRADE - The new exciting game of strategy, negotiations, and fun.<br/><br/>Can you navigate the high seas? Run your own company? Build the ultimate trading empire? In TRADE, the board game, you can do it all! Brave the rough Atlantic Ocean, make decisions, and sail to victory!<br/><br/>In this exciting game of strategy and negotiations, you return to the 18th century to amass riches in international trade. With the roll of the dice, you select a port where you purchase goods for your ship to carry. Next you transport these goods across the sea, for sale. Get ready for many adventures along the way!<br/><br/>Gameplay overview from rule sheet:<br/><br/>The basic premise of TRADE is simple: you enter a port with one of your ships, buy one of the goods that the port exports, transport that good across the sea, and then sell that good in a port that imports it.<br/><br/><br/>     You get 2 ships.<br/>     There are 6 goods available for trade: Sugar, Tea, Lumber, Rum, Molasses, and Wheat.<br/>     A ship can carry at most 5 loads of goods.<br/>     There are 6 ports (Boston, Charleston, Kingston, London, Lisbon, Africa).<br/>     You can purchase a dock at any port which cuts your purchase price for goods in half at that port.<br/>     Each turn roll 4 dice and divy those results up between your 2 ships.<br/>     There are 6 trans-Atlantic routes.<br/>     Each route goes through a central Hurricane space you want to avoid ending your turn on.<br/>     Along each route are &quot;A&quot; spaces. If you land on those you draw Adventure cards that can be a Task or a Demand. Tasks are missions you can complete for rewards. Demands represent the economic climate and change values of goods. Players vote to keep current Demands or adopt the new Demands.<br/>     You can sabotage opponent ships if you are in the same space by paying gold to destroy their goods.<br/>     If a player lands on the Hurricane, all ships not in a port are drawn towards the hurricane.<br/>     You can bribe other players in exchange for non-binding verbal agreements (votes, etc.)<br/>     Play continues until the last Adventure card is drawn. Highest score wins.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Assemble your superhero team to defeat encounters and earn the most honor! Rescue bystanders, capture henchmen, and form a plan to defeat the evil meeples terrorizing the city. A drafting card game that is easy to learn, quick to play, and fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>How To Play:<br/>Players will draft cards to assemble their team of superheroes. Without revealing their cards to the other players, each player looks at the 9 cards they were dealt, selects one, and places it face down in front of them until all players have selected their card. Players then take all of the remaining cards (now 8) and passes them to the player on their left (who also is passing their cards to their left).<br/><br/>Then, starting with the player with the &quot;First Player Card&quot; and continuing clockwise around the table, each player takes a turn choosing either to:<br/><br/>     Play the card drafted<br/><br/><br/> or<br/><br/>     Discard the card drafted and attempt to win an encounter<br/><br/><br/>If they Play the Card Drafted, they turn their card face-up and resolve any effects on the card (Example: the cards says &ldquo;Gain a bystander.&rdquo; They would pick up one of the purple bystander tokens and place it in front of them.)<br/><br/>If they Discard the card drafted and attempt to win an encounter, the player places the drafted card face-up in a discard pile in the middle of the table. They then attempt to win an Encounter, seeing if they are able to meet the requirements of one of the face-up Encounters. If they are able to do so, they place the defeated Encounter face-up in their play area. If the encounter had any special text on it, resolve those now. (Examples of special text: &ldquo;Discard two superheroes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gain a planning token&rdquo;)<br/><br/>After ALL players have revealed their drafted card and resolved any special card abilities, replenish any Encounters that were defeated from the face up available Encounters. Then the players pick up the stack of cards that were passed to them from their right. Repeat the process of choosing a card until all cards have been drafted.<br/><br/>After the last cards are drafted, players count up the Honor (Victory points) they earned. Add all Honor earned from defeated Encounters, rescued Bystanders (each purple bystander token is one honor), and any additional Honor from any Ally cards drafted (Allies do not have an icon in the top left corner and also refer to &ldquo;At end of round&hellip;&rdquo;). The player with the most Honor is the winner!<br/><br/>TYPES OF CARDS AND TOKENS<br/>Superheroes - There are four types of Superhero cards: Strong (green fist), Telepathic (blue eye), Fast (yellow bolt), and Flying (pink wing).<br/><br/>Allies &ndash; Allies give additional Honor at the end of the round if certain conditions were met. Allies do NOT count as Superheroes and may not be used to help defeat encounters. Allies do not have an icon in the top corner (also, the art on all the ally cards is a person that is grey).<br/>    <br/>Encounters &ndash; The requirement to defeat the encounter is listed on the bottom half of each encounter. Some encounters give bonuses or require costs. The number in the top right corner is the amount of Honor earned from defeating that Encounter. Some encounters have icons with a &ldquo;?&rdquo;, indicating any type superhero may be used in that requirement.<br/><br/>Henchman Tokens &ndash; Henchman tokens are represented by the white meeple tokens. They represent a henchman being captured who can share valuable information to you, making it easier to defeat encounters in the future. Each Henchman token counts as a &ldquo;?&rdquo; icon when defeating encounters. You do NOT return Henchman tokens to the supply when they are used, they remain with you for the rest of the round and may be used on multiple encounters. Multiple henchman can be used on an encounter, up to as many &ldquo;?&rdquo; icons that are on that encounter.<br/><br/>Planning Tokens - Planning Tokens are represented by the star tokens. They represent valuable foresight and information you have gained to more easily defeat encounters. When a planning token is used to help defeat an encounter, it is returned to the planning token supply card. Planning tokens count as a &ldquo;wild&rdquo; superhero while defeating encounters. They may be spent to replace any icon on an encounter. Any number of Planning tokens may be spent at one time.<br/><br/>Bystander Tokens &ndash; Bystanders are represented by the purple meeple tokens. Each one of these tokens counts as one Honor at the end of the round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Inspired by the work of Laurent Bontoux of JRC (European Commission) they made a mobility game intended to connect people, show empathy for each other's role and let new ideas surface. After an elaborate testing round, the game was launched on 21 June 2017 at the Mobility Congress<br/><br/>In this game players will take turns playing action cards to build arguments for their goals. Other players can vote on what arguments they like.<br/>You get points by having other people vote for your arguments.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The plagued living and the restless dead clash as the wall crumbles in this unique board game from Twilight Creations.<br/><br/>Victory is obtained by eliminating the opposing army but it's not a simple matter of superior numbers or strength of arms. The battlefield is divided by The Wall, an ancient un-scaleable barrier of rubble and bone. As play progresses, spans of the wall fracture and collapse opening the way for troops but also triggering boobytraps.<br/><br/>The End is nigh! Will humanity endure and prevail or will the hordes of relentless shambling dead plow the defenders into the dirt?<br/><br/>The Wall is an exciting, unique element to this game. Players will have the opportunity to physically remove portions of the wall during play, causing parts of the opponent's play field to become vulnerable, but also potentially hurting your troops. Reveal enough of your opponent's forces to crush them on your way to victory!<br/><br/>Beyond The Wall offers a unique experience in tabletop gaming. The game can be tailored to fit your play style and mood. Beyond the Wall can be played at the basic level with no options or,  for those seeking more complexity, additional elements can be added to enhance your experience. Elements include mines, wall traps, army construction, special ability cards and attack rolls.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Inspired by retro adventure video games, Launch the Dragonslayer! will challenge your hero to brave ever-changing wilds, ration limited resources, leverage unique class abilities, and withstand the temptation of cool cheat codes, all in a noble quest to find and slay a monstrous dragon!<br/><br/>Gameplay progresses through a cycle of turns, which involve rolling for randomized time- and region-dependent encounters, deciding to either travel or recover resources, and moving Time forward one unit. If an encounter occurs, then a system of hit values and encounter effects determines the encounter's ebb and flow. Play is meant to be divided into several sessions, with the general progress of each turn saved between plays. The game ends when your hero resolves the Dragon encounter to slay their sworn foe.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players can choose one of six classes for their hero, each of which has a unique ability that encourages a different style of play. Four stats act as resources that are expended to withstand damage, increase the power of a launch's effect, make it easier to hit a target, or level up to increase your hero's maximum stat amount.<br/><br/>As the hero draws closer to their goal, they will face different effects in each region they visit, challenging you to optimize your hero's path and assess the rewards of various risks. But all the careful planning in the world will only take you so far. In the end, what will make or break your hero's future is how well you can Launch the Dragonslayer!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The amount of cards you may trade are equal to the number on the card, (which moves up and down during the game like a mini stock market) If you are the second boat to arrive on this spot you can trade one less card.<br/><br/>Fish - You may draw cards equal to the number on your fisherman card that you have leveled up to. If you are the second boat to arrive you draw one less card from the deck.<br/><br/>Sell - If you move your boat to this space the seagull switches to the player it is currently not with. (Seagull forces you to pay one extra when selling) <br/>On this space you may sell to the fancy man. On his card is a row of numbers that slowly grows each time he's sold to and is also the amount you must sell to him. There is a small 5 card deck next to him with the top card revealed that shows what sardine can the fancy man is wanting to be sold. When a fancy man sale is made you raise the trade market number up one, your fisherman up one, and the fancy man up one on their respective trackers. After selling to the fancy man you flip over the sardine can to show it has been sold to you and you gain points based on how many you acquire by the end of the game.<br/><br/>During the game you are collecting sets of cans or a variety pack which is all 5 brands of cans.

        "description": "Dominus is a tile-laying game where players compete to build the most prestigious medieval monastery. The game features very simple rules, lots of interaction between players (in the form of a shared resource market) and clever tile-laying where players try to match the sides of the tile they are building with the sides of previously built tiles (dominoes style) in order to maximize their score and get access to extra resources. DOMINVS is a fast-paced tile-laying game where a clever placement of your workers on the market will not only grant you access to more resources but may occasionally help you win coins when other players harvest, thus saving you from spending one of your turns harvesting. The market manipulation provides a lot of interaction between players, but not the destructive type of interaction because, even when somebody messes with your plans, new possibilities open in the market for you.<br/><br/>On their turn, the player places one resource tile together with one of their workers into the market (formed by a 3x3 grid of resource tiles). The tile is either placed on the leftmost space of a row or in the topmost space of a column, thus pushing out one other resource tile from the market that the player then collects. If there is a worker on the expelled tile, it's owner recovers it and gains a Prestige Point. Then the player activates the row or the column of the market where the tile and the worker were placed (each resource tile specifies if activates a column or a row).<br/>When activating a row or a column, the player performs one of two possible actions: harvest or build:<br/><br/>The end game is triggered when a player reaches 50 Prestige points. Then, a final round is played and the player with most Prestige Points wins the game.<br/><br/>During playtest, 4 player games would take no longer than 30 minutes, making DOMINVS a fast playing game, with an interesting engine building mechanism integrated, with simple rules but with lots of interesting decisions each turn.<br/><br/>DOMINVS was also designed from the beginning with an integrated and fully functional solo variant.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A town (18 towns total) can receive a defender when landed on in the course of regular play, which prevents any further damage to that town. A player is knighted when he/she becomes defender of both of the 2 towns in a shire. Once Knighted the play becomes eligible to fight the dragons with an Amulet upon obtaining one.<br/><br/>The object for the players is to kill the 6 dragons in a contest against each other according to the above mentioned criteria with the use of the 3 Amulet types (a player can only possess 1 Amulet at a time), but are quickly drawn into a perilous concerted drive to preclude the dragons from thwarting their opportunity with a 13th attack on an undefended town.<br/><br/>In a dragon fight each of the 3 Amulet types ensures the defeat of any one of 4 of the 6 dragons, so each of the 3 Amulet types ensures the defeat of a different set of 4 of the 6 dragons. Therefore, an Amulet gives the player a 2 to 1 advantage over the dragon, which could kill the player if it is not one of the 4 listed on the Amulet. Players can prevent being killed if they have an escape card.<br/><br/>Amulet features a fascinating paradox where players are compelled to cooperate and form alliances to set up an end game where they can seek to defeat each other. Failure to do so, could brings the game swiftly to and end with victory going to the dragons.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Roll and navigate your way through the oceans and find the hidden treasures first of all!<br/><br/>A entertaining quick game with coasters. Fun for everyone!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Game play: At the beginning of the player&rsquo;s turn, the player navigates over the map (board) and tries to get a good navigation point to find good treasures.<br/><br/>The active player initially rolls both dice and then optionally has another roll with one or both dice. After that, counts the result. He now hit exactly 1 field of the board through the specified navigation lines (intersection).<br/><br/>If a player hits an island field directly or indirectly (across a neighbored sea field), all treasure tokens lying on this island can be revealed immediately. The player now has the chance to win the treasures of this island. With a direct hit the player has up to 3 rolls, with an indirect hit (across neighbored sea field) only 1 roll with the dice.<br/><br/>For the winning of treasure tokens of islands being hit (directly or indirectly) the following applies:<br/><br/>Number tokens: If a dice shows the number of a certain number token, the treasure is discovered and can be picked up by the player.<br/><br/>Sven Gl&uuml;ckspilz or H&auml;gar tokens: A double (2x same number, no matter which one) wins one of these outlying tokens.<br/><br/>Lucky-7 (sum): A dice combination with the sum = 7 (1/6 or 2/5 or 3/4) can also be used as a wild card. The player can choose any outlying token of the island.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately, once all number tokens (total of 6 pieces) are discovered. The player with the fewest victory points in total loses the game. In case of a tie, several lose.<br/><br/>Each won number token counts victory points based on its numerical value.

Spa&szlig; f&uuml;r jedermann!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (German)<br/><br/>Spielablauf: Am Anfang des Spielerzuges navigiert der Spieler &uuml;ber die ausliegende Karte (Spielplan) und versucht einen guten Navigationspunkt zu erspielen, um von dort gute Sch&auml;tze zu finden.<br/>Der aktive Spieler w&uuml;rfelt anf&auml;nglich beide W&uuml;rfel und hat danach optional einen weiteren Wurf mit einem oder beiden W&uuml;rfeln. Danach z&auml;hlt das erw&uuml;rfelte Ergebnis. Er hat jetzt durch die festgelegten Navigationsreihen genau 1 Spielfeld des Planes direkt getroffen (Schnittpunkt). <br/>Falls ein Spieler ein Inselfeld direkt oder indirekt (&uuml;ber ein angrenzendes Seefeld) trifft, k&ouml;nnen alle auf dieser Insel liegenden Schatzmarker sofort aufgedeckt werden. Der Spieler hat jetzt die Chance die Sch&auml;tze dieser Insel zu erspielen. Der Spieler hat hier bei einem direkten Inseltreffer bis bis zu 3 W&uuml;rfe, bei einem indirekten Treffer (&uuml;ber angrenzendes Seefeld) immer nur 1 Wurf mit den W&uuml;rfeln.<br/><br/>F&uuml;r das Erspielen von Schatzmarkern getroffener Inseln (direkt oder indirekt) gilt:<br/>Zahlenmarker: Erzielt ein W&uuml;rfel dabei die Zahl eines ausliegenden Zahlenmarkers, ist der Schatz geborgen und kann vom Spieler aufgenommen werden.<br/>Sven Gl&uuml;ckspilz- oder H&auml;gar-Marker: Ein Pasch (2x gleiche Zahl, egal welche) erspielt einen dieser ausliegenden Marker.<br/>Lucky-7 (Summe): Eine W&uuml;rfelkombination mit der Summe = 7 (1/6 oder 2/5 oder 3/4) kann als Joker genutzt werden. Der Spieler kann sich einen beliebigen ausliegenden Marker der Insel aussuchen.<br/><br/>Das Spiel endet sofort, sobald alle Zahlenmarker (gesamt 6 St&uuml;ck) geborgen sind. Der Spieler mit den wenigsten Siegpunkten insgesamt verliert das Spiel. Bei Gleichstand verlieren auch mehrere.<br/>Jeder erspielte Zahlenmarker z&auml;hlt anhand seines Zahlenwertes Siegpunkte. Dazu gibt es (f&uuml;r einen Spieler) ggf. doppelte Siegpunkte f&uuml;r einen Schatzmarker auf dem x2-Feld. <br/>Der H&auml;gar-Marker bringt die Anzahl aller erspielter Zahlenmarker als zus&auml;tzliche Siegpunkte f&uuml;r den Spieler (neben den eigentlichen Zahlenwerten). <br/>F&uuml;r jeden Sven Gl&uuml;ckspilz-Marker w&uuml;rfelt der entsprechende Spieler beide W&uuml;rfel genau 1x. Die Differenz der beiden Ergebnisse (h&ouml;here minus kleinere Zahl) zeigt die hierf&uuml;r erzielten Siegpunkte. Bei einem Pasch gibt es also nichts.<br/><br/>",

The scoring scales proportionately when adding more players to remain balanced and has a special rules set for playing solo games.

King Levir of the LeCroix dynasty gave the task of defeating the enemy to his Gundam Knights. The Gundam Knights departed immediately to the mountainous frontier of the LaCroix Kingdom to turn back Devil Gundam and his forces.<br/><br/>In this strategic board game based on the highly successful SD Gundam series, players will each assume the role of a Gundam Knight protecting the LaCroix Kingdom.

In this game mode, players will be battling the forces of Devil Gundam who have seized control of the Legendary Sacred Shrines. In order to defeat Satan Gundam, you must journey to the Shrines, defeat the enemies within, collect the Sacred Treasure from each shrine (Shield of Power, Armor of Power, and the Sword of Fire) in order to be powerful enough to defeat Devil Gundam.<br/><br/>Game Mode Two: Castle of Devil Gundam. The Knight Gundams, having reached the fortress of the enemy, with the Three Sacred Treasures in hand, must penetrate and search the Castle to find the Sacred Stone Tablet with the spell that will imbue the Sacred Treasures with their legendary power, allowing the players to try and defeat Devil Gundam.

        "description": "The purpose of the game is to have fun with friends, ideally in a party setting. The game is a card version of the spin-the-bottle game that has been played at teen-ager parties for decades. It worked like this: a mix of girls and boys sat in circle on the floor. In turn, somebody spun an empty bottle in the middle of the circle. When the bottle stopped, the &quot;spinner&quot; kissed or slapped the cheek of the boy or girl the bottle pointed to. It never failed to get some young hormones flowing and some cheeks reddening (and not just because they had been slapped). It was an innocent enough game for innocent times.<br/><br/>Inhibited attempts to recreate that feeling with cards and extends the slapping/kissing to several actions. It also specifies a series of body parts, but without ever crossing the limit of decency and good taste.<br/><br/>A player sets up an activity between two players (e.g., Peter is to bring his nose in contact with with Paul's ear) and all players in turn can play cards to change the activity and/or the players involved; when there are no more changes, the activity that resulted from all the changes must be carried out. For example, Jane might have to rub her cheek against Peter's neck.<br/><br/>All players involved in an action receive points. If a player refuses to perform an action, s/he is penalised with negative points. The game ends when all 108 cards have been played or when the turn goes around the table without anybody setting up a new action. The winner is the player who has accumulated the highest number of points.<br/><br/>Players can play as individuals or in teams.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

They need the support of an entity, one willing to take the necessary risks even to break the law. That said, we should clarify they agreed to only proceed against criminals, so the school will accept orders just for assassins, thieves and terrorists who escaped justice.<br/><br/>Students will have to take these orders, with the name of criminals written on them. Once they got the name, the next step is to register it on the Black List. The ones marked on the list, will be doomed. There are professors to help them in their path. Meanwhile, in the shadows, there&rsquo;s a new clan rising, the Elite, with which trainees may interact as well.<br/><br/>Each student has their own motivation, so watch out and keep your role secret. Everyone has their specific objectives to win the game. And if your identity is revealed or you cannot fulfill them, your victory objectives will change.<br/><br/>In this hidden role game for 2-6 players, you must complete your objectives before you get killed, and be faster than the others.<br/><br/>You'll need to contact with the elite and several professors,to get help; to get black parchments to complete the orders; to destroy your enemies, in other words, to kill your friends' characters so you have the only one alive; to steal your student files; to go through the elite path and do the blood covenant...<br/><br/>But most important of all, you must recover information. Info is the new coin. But be careful who you trust, no one is what they seem to be in this school...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Only you can defeat them!<br/><br/>Taking on the role of cyberpunk themed heroes and heroines, the players will try to survive in a place they thought they knew well but which has now been corrupted by Lovecraftian outside forces.<br/><br/>Players go through a location deck where each card represents a different location within the city. For each location an encounter &ndash; such as a creature or other hazard &ndash; is drawn from another deck. Players have a number of options on how they can try and defeat the encounter depending on their characters skills and armament, equipment and magical artifacts (even the foul Techronomicon!) they have gained and the characteristics of the location and encounter card.<br/><br/>If defeated the encounter gives extra resources for the characters. Otherwise, they lose life or psych tokens; If one character loses all of either, then they die or go hopelessly insane and the game is over.<br/><br/>Players have to be careful on how they manage the resources they gain &ndash; take on too few and they won&rsquo;t be strong enough, but having too much technology or dark knowledge risks losing psych, eventually destroying your very humanity and blasting your mind apart.<br/><br/>Eventually the players will face off with one of a number of different &lsquo;big bosses&rsquo; lurking in the labs of the Nyarlatho-Tech Foundation &ndash; overcome this final encounter and the city is saved!<br/><br/>Nyarlatho-Tech is a science fiction and horror themed card game, played solo or cooperatively with up to four players.

Although titled Computer Vegas, the large wooden game board only depicts a Craps table. Protruding through the center of board are fourteen light bulbs that serve to display the pips for a computer-generated roll of a pair of standard six-sided dice. The dice are rolled by pressing a button. All other gameplay is handled manually by the players. The game includes small plastic chips and paper money for use in betting and collecting payouts.<br/><br/>As Computer Vegas was simply a die-roll simulator at heart, it could also be used to play Backgammon. The EDC overlay for Computer Backgammon turned the Craps table into a Backgammon board. A cut-out in the center of the overlay allowed the virtual die roll to be displayed.<br/><br/>Unlike most other EDC games, Computer Vegas ran off an AC adapter rather than batteries.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Origin  <br/>WordGhost is the card game that turned a childhood car game into a game night favorite. The game combines vocabulary with competition to create a perfect source of entertainment for any occasion. Turning the car game into a card game made it possible to add more features that add to the excitement. With new cards such as the &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; card and the &ldquo;anagram&rdquo; card, the game has twists and turns you won&rsquo;t see coming!  We are passionate about words and are super excited to introduce Word Ghost!<br/><br/>Objective / Rules<br/>The game can be played by any number of people at any age. The objective of the game is to use your letters to continually create a word without ever finishing that word. Each player will begin with &ldquo;letter cards&rdquo; in their hand and one by one will place a letter down in order to spell a word they have in their head. The word must be four letters long to be considered a knockout word. This means 1-3 letter words are fine to play.  If a player is caught completing a word, he or she is out. The game gets interesting when introducing the &ldquo;special cards.&rdquo; These cards are incorporated into the card game because it changes the dynamic of the game and the word(s) being played.<br/><br/>Special Cards<br/>The &ldquo;special cards&rdquo; consist of wild cards, skip cards, reverse cards, &ldquo;remove 1&rdquo; cards, &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; cards, and anagram cards. The wild card allows the player to play any letter of your choosing, the skip card allows a player to skip their own turn, and the reverse card allows the player to reverse the order of the game. The &ldquo;remove 1&rdquo; card allows the player to remove one letter from the word and the &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; card allows the player to remove two letters from the word. When using the removal cards, the player must pull all the letters together without reordering. The anagram card allows the player to rearrange all the letters to create a part of a new word. The letters still cannot form a word, or that player is out. Another competitive aspect of the game is the &ldquo;challenge.&rdquo; The challenge is used when a player thinks their opponent that plays directly before them is spelling a fake word. In this situation, the player can say: &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; to their opponent and that player must say the word he or she was spelling. If the word is valid, the player that called the challenge is out and if the word is not valid, the challenged player is out.<br/><br/>Rule Variations <br/>There are technical infinite rule variations to the game which you can come up with.  Here are two that we like:  <br/><br/>     The &ldquo;strike play&rdquo; method allows the players to use a strike system instead of an instant elimination.  Think of it like playing &ldquo;HORSE&rdquo; on a basketball court. When a player spells a word, he or she will get a strike and when that player collects three strikes, then he or she is out. <br/>     The &ldquo;timed play&rdquo; method calls for a timer that will only give the players a certain amount of time to play their letter or they automatically lose.<br/><br/><br/>This game will challenge your vocabulary and your ability to stay one step ahead of your opponents. It is the perfect game for a quiet night in or to be the center of game night.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This contains Russle's Letters and Numbers card game with a set of 4 lotto cards with 2x5 pictures based on the cards. My copy has no instructions, but it's obvious that you play Lotto using the card deck as a random way to determine which pictures to cover on the boards.<br/><br/>The card game included does have its rule sheet, so it's games can also be played with this set.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",
