        "description": "This early word card game has players all trying to find words simultaneously, from the same set of cards.<br/><br/>There are two decks of 56 cards each.  The green-backed deck's cards have single letters or 2-letter combinations on them, and is suitable for children as well as adults (2-6 players).  The red deck is for larger groups (4-10) and older players, and has 2- or 3-letter combinations, as well as individual letters in red ink.  Each card also has a point value attached.<br/><br/>Any even number of cards is dealt out, so the total is about 50 cards with one deck, 100 cards for both.  (E.g. 25 for 4 players, 20 each for 5, 18 for 6, etc.)  The remainder makes a face up pool in the center.  Players hands are kept face down, and all start by turning up the top card, starting their pack.<br/><br/>A turn consists of exposing the top card of your hand onto your pack (and presumably waiting a short time for people to think).  At any time, if a player can make a word out of 2 or more of the visible cards, they call it out and play stops.  If the word is verified, the caller takes the entire packs containing the cards he used, and places them at the bottom of his hand.  Red letters may only be used as the first or last letter of their word.<br/><br/>If two players call out at the same time, the longer word wins; if tied, the packs involved go into the pool.  If a word is wrong and challenged, the challenger gets the packs; if the challenge was incorrect, the challenger's pack goes into the pool.<br/><br/>The winner is the one who gets all the cards; or, after a set length of time, it is the player with the highest total value in his cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Square chess (方棋 fāngq&iacute;), also known as 丢方(diūfāng) and 下方(xi&agrave;fāng), is an abstract strategy board game played traditionally in the northwestern regions of China, especially Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other areas with a high concentration of Chinese Muslims. The game is also played by Dungans, who have brought the game with them to Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 7x8 grid, with pieces played on the points, much as in Go. Players take turns alternately placing stones until the board has been filled up, attempting to form 2x2 squares with their pieces. When the board has been filled up, players each remove one of their opponent's stones. The player then counts up the squares that he/she has formed and removes an equal number of the opponent's pieces, as long as those pieces are not part of a square. After the initial removal of pieces, players take turns moving pieces; pieces can move any distance along the grid up, down, left, or right. Every time a square is formed, the player can remove one of the opponent's pieces(again, as long as this piece is not part of a square). The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces first is the winner. Thus, the game is similar in concept to Nine Men's Morris.<br/><br/>The game can be played on any 7x8 board using black or white go stones, even on the intersections of a chessboard. The game is popular in agricultural communities in northwestern China, and often played on a board traced out on the ground.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Unique horse racing game where each player guides a stable of horses through a program of eight races, where purse money is won and where the majority of races are &quot;claiming&quot; races where the players can acquire other players' horses.  Each horse is assigned a value, so stable owners must be careful not to drop a horse in class so much that the horse is snagged by another owner.  There are ten race programs that each dictate a different combination of Claiming, Stakes, Fast and Sloppy races.  Each horse has a card with a set of numbers for each quarter of the track. A spinner determines which number in the quarter's set is used for movement. The board has bonus spaces.  The cards have bonus moves for horses that are &quot;mudders&quot; when entered into races with a sloppy track.  The game winner is based on highest stable value added to cash in hand after the eighth and final race.  Advanced rules include betting options.<br/><br/>The game was later released as a computer horse racing simulation with Daily Racing Form like past performances and other additional features under the same name.  The computer game is still available along with equestrian related stained glass, an odd combination of products.<br/><br/>",

Even grandmothers turn into rabid weasels over a game of Pitstop.<br/><br/>What is Pitstop? A fun family card game based on a simple idea: Players race each other to complete a run of numbered &quot;Lap&quot; cards; then be the first to play the checkered flag card to win the game.<br/>But there&rsquo;s a catch. Pitstop cards lurk in the deck and they can ruin any dreams of a quick win.<br/>A game of Pitstop can be fast and furious because players can play all the cards in their hand in one turn and Lady Luck, in the form of prized wild cards, can make or break a racing career in a hurry.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Pitstop is that it can take as little as 5 minutes for one game or all day for a Pitstop tournament. Race Season rules are included for a 10-race, 20-race or whatever-race competition.<br/><br/>The game consists of 108 unique, racing-themed plastic-coated playing cards, divided into two decks. English and Spanish rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Published by Forerunner Publishing a division of Friends of the Bridegroom, Inc, Omega the End Times Board Game is a game of knowledge (trivia question and answer) based on biblical eschatology. Trivia questions are based on knowledge of certain books of the New King James bible, such as Daniel, Matthew, and the Book of Revelation.<br/><br/>The board contains six colored tracks that extend from left to right along the rectangular game board. Each colored track corresponds to six colored playing pieces. Each player selects a colored playing piece and places it on the track.<br/><br/>On each turn, the player gets an opportunity to answer a trivia card question. If answered correctly, the player moves forward along the track and they get to draw special &quot;oil&quot; or &quot;crown&quot; cards that count for victory points at game end. The tracks have certain phases which represent passage of time. For example, the left most track section is the present, the middle of the track corresponds to the &quot;tribulation period&quot;, the end of the track corresponds to the &quot;millennium&quot;, etc.. The first player to reach a time-based stage causes all other players to immediately move forward to that stage.<br/><br/>In order to win the game, a player must answer questions correctly allowing them changes to collect oil and crown cards that are worth points. When a player reaches the final stage of the track, all players get one more turn. Then card-points are added up to determine a winner.<br/><br/>It is an educational game focused on the escatolagical teachings of Friends of the Bridegroom, Inc, AKA International House of Prayer, located in Kansas City.<br/><br/>",

They'll have to wheel and deal to make sure their proposals for the city are the grandest of them all. Players also take on the role of contractor, supplying the project with the supplies necessary for construction. The competition will be fierce, but no player can go it alone. Opponents will need to use one another's supplies in order to finalize plans and earn points. Temporary cooperation will spurn heated rivals as players make and break promises along the way. Once the blueprint is finalized, the planner who shaped the city the most is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Perfect Captain website:<br/><br/>The first in our series of Spare Change games, Villehardouin is a campaign game of the Byzantine Reconquest of the Morea in southern Greece in the year 1263 AD.<br/><br/>Players take the role of either the Achaean Franks under Prince William de Villehardouin, freshly back from captivity in Constantinople, or that of the Byzantine Empire under the Sebastocrator Constantine (the Emperor Michael VIII's step-brother).<br/><br/>As with all of our games, supply and logistics are as important as naked force. Never fear- there is of course no bookkeeping. At the start of each turn players figure out how much &quot;change&quot; they gather to fuel their activities for the turn. Simply marching off into arid and barren territory, even if it is strategically important, will leave you high and dry and out of supply- forcing a humiliating retreat. Players must plan carefully where they are going, how long they will be there, and what can go wrong; losing a battle will deplete your treasury as well as your army.<br/><br/>The opposing armies are different too, adding another element to strategy. The Franks have excellent cavalry and good foot troops, but not many skirmishers. The Greeks have an abundance of archers and ambushers as well as hard fighting regulars, and a corps of Turkish mercenaries (of dubious loyalty..). Both sides have to pick their battlefields and their timing must be near-perfect to pull off a game-winning battle.<br/><br/>The terrain is not the friendliest; each players base is green and lush, but you can't win by sitting still. Feint and counter-feint will be the order of the day, but when the time comes, you must strike. Sieges can be long, but sudden assaults costly. Greeks can set up ambushes while the Franks can attempt impetuous charges- either one can, if handled properly, bring about your opponent's overthrow.<br/><br/>This is the kind of game where there can be no wasted moves; everything is important, and dilly-dallying will hurt you sooner rather than later. This is a game that will lead to taut nerves and a lot of beard stroking!<br/><br/>Does it take long to play?<br/>That's entirely up to you. You could easily fly through it in an hour, but if you want to win you'll need to think things through very carefully. Still, it's one of our quickest-play games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game Overview<br/>Cabin Fever is a small, dice-based scoring game with the theme of escaping a cabin during a harsh winter. Players begin the game &quot;snowed in&quot; requiring them to &quot;dig out,&quot; or score 100 points before they may begin collecting points. The first player to score 1,000 or more points wins the game! The game has a strategy component where players may trap other players in the cabin, preventing them from scoring.<br/><br/>Special scoring situations have easily recognizable winter themed monikers. Players encounter obstacles along the way in the form of certain types of die rolls (&quot;squalls,&quot; &quot;thaws,&quot; &quot;broken chairlifts&quot;) which may end their turn or put them in the cabin. In addition to obstacles there are special die rolls that immediately reward a player such as &quot;vacations&quot; and &quot;chairlifts&quot;.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Cabin Fever is designed for 2-8 players with an optimal number of 3 or more players. A game can be played with more than 8 players at the consequence of extending the game's duration. All that is needed in addition to the game is a pad of paper and a pencil or pen with which to keep score.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player rolls a single die to determine who starts the game. The highest roll goes first (after resolving ties). All players are considered &ldquo;snowed in&rdquo; and must &quot;dig out&quot; by rolling 100 points or more on the scoring dice. Once a player digs out he or she ends his or her turn and passes the scoring dice to the next player on the left (clockwise) and may begin scoring on his or her next turn. The first player to accumulate 1,000 points wins the game!<br/><br/>The five same color dice included with the game are called scoring dice. Players start a turn by rolling all five dice (opening roll) in an attempt to create matching die faces. Players may elect to end their turn at any time and collect their points (with a minimum requirement of a matching pair). Players may continue a turn to earn more points but must roll at least one match to an existing match, or create a new matching set on each consecutive re-roll of non-matching dice. Dice that have been assigned to a match may not be re-rolled. If players fail to roll a match on a re-roll they immediately end their turn and do not collect any points.<br/><br/>Components<br/>    * 5 Scoring Dice (white)<br/>    * 1 Vacation Die (green)<br/>    * Cabin game piece (clear)<br/>    * Cabin Fever rules sheet<br/>    * 3 &quot;I have Cabin Fever!&quot; stickers<br/>    * Palm-sized, clear acrylic, travel box<br/><br/>",

The hedonistic Vampires believe it to be their birthright to own the night. The untamed Werewolves believe that none other than themselves should  master the Earth. Whose claim is true? When twilight descends, which species will set the ancient records in stone and prove their powers of domination? Time to settle old scores. It&rsquo;s time to Bare Your Fangs!<br/><br/>Bare Your Fangs is a two-player dice fighting game devoted to resolving once and for all which species will reign supreme: Vampire or Werewolf. Players choose their faction dice and roll to attack! The fully customized die icons determine successful hits, blocks, and of course, one&rsquo;s ability to hunt for humans and thereby heal wounds incurred in these savage battles. But there is always risk. Some humans won&rsquo;t go down without a fight! And one particular human seeks only the total annihilation of all creatures of the night.  The Werewolf&rsquo;s physical power is unmatched but the Vampire&rsquo;s ability to heal is legendary. Only one will rule when dawn breaks, but will the victor crush his opponent into oblivion and take his rightful place as Leader Eternal, or will the fang fray destroy them both!<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately this ore only exists in meaningful quantities in a small, blighted archipelago in a remote area. Your superiors cannot spare many men or resources - it would be strategic suicide to move important units from their existing positions - but you've been given the vital task of securing enough telonite to ensure the victory of your nation. Unfortunately, the other world superpowers have sent task forces of their own...<br/><br/>Conquest of the Skies is a light 4X in which 2-3 players compete to gather sufficient quantities of ore before anyone else. Players will explore the abandoned archipelago, research and develop new technologies, manoeuvre airships and giant warships into combat, harvest the meagre supplies of food to keep their people alive and try to be the first to obtain enough telonite ore, by fair means or foul.<br/><br/>Play proceeds via an action point allowance, with each of a player's settlements granting a number of action points which can be used for harvesting resources, researching technologies and acting with units; however, food is almost as scarce as ore, and players must be sure to harvest enough to feed each settlement every turn.<br/><br/>",

The credits can be applied in the team or teams the player chooses.<br/><br/>To increase the confidence level of their teams and play in more times the dice to win games, each player must manage the trust claims as best they can. Thus, the CC can be invested in two types of resources: players and coaches. Both types are rated as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;outstanding&quot;.<br/><br/>In all matches, the last dice roll made by a player is the one the counts for the final score of the match. For example, if you can throw the dice three times, but if you are satisfied with the 2nd roll, you don't need not make the final one. The latter roll is the one that counts, whether or not the most favorable.<br/><br/>The &quot;home&quot; team may choose to re-roll the final dice of both players, by using the &quot;home factor&quot; card. Once rerolled the results are final.<br/><br/>Each victory is worth 3 points and 4 CC, each tie is worth 1 point and 2 CC and every defeat is worth 0 points and cost one CC.<br/><br/>This increase or decrease of confidence in players and /pr coaches and the gain or loss of CC are accounted at the end of a match day, and before the next match day.<br/><br/>At the end of the group stage, only the two or four best teams from each group (depending on the number of players) advance to the next stage. The tie breakers are: <br/>1st: point gained;<br/>2nd: greatest goal average;<br/>3rd: most goals scored for.<br/>4th: result of the match between the tied teams.<br/><br/>All other teams are eliminated from play at this point.<br/><br/>For each stage a team advances, the controlling player receives 2 CC<br/><br/>The quarter finals (if applicable),  the semi finals and final games are to be elimination games. If they end up tied, they go to penalties, using the &quot;penalty die&quot;. A series of five penalties for each team is rolled, and if the score is still tied, each team roll once until the tie breaks.<br/><br/>The winner of the European football championship is the one whose team win the final of the competition!<br/><br/>",

Player one now turns over the timer and puts on black squares until the timer runs out.  As before add up the numbers in any line that player completes to determine that players score.  When the timer runs out pass on the timer to player 2 who then turns over the timer and when it runs out that player scores as above.  Then pass the timer to the next player who plays the game in the same way and so on depending on the number of players.  When the puzzle is finished then the player with the highest score wins that game.<br/><br/>",

The card suits are fractions (ex. 0/0, 0/1, 1/1, 0/2, 1/2, 2/2, ..., 0/3,..., 0/4, ..., 0/,6, ... 6/6) with the mid-cards also being worth extra points.<br/><br/>Some'R'Set is best played with partners (like in Spades).<br/><br/>The object is to bid on how many points you and your partner will take. There are 21 available points, 14 from the available tricks and 7 from the red cards.<br/><br/>Bidding goes around the table once where the players bid for the two card blind. High bid takes the blind and decides which suit (fraction set) will be trump.<br/><br/>Like in many trick taking games, and if you make your hand, you get the points. If you do not, you are set, hence the name (as they say in the rules) Some &quot;r&quot; set.<br/><br/>See also:<br/>Double Some'R'Set - 50 card version<br/><br/>",

Be on your toes, though, because you don't want to get stuck with frozen monsters or miss your chance to grab the prized weaseltonium particles!<br/><br/>The game begins with a line of cards face up, representing an ice floe. Most of the cards depict a weasel frozen in the ice. On your turn, you may either chip one end off the ice flow and tow it away (take a card from one end of the line) or split the ice floe (separate the cards into two separate lines). If you have collected a matching trio of frozen weasels, you may thaw them to take an extra turn and score more points.<br/><br/>More cards are laid out as the game progresses. Preference cards make particular weasels worth more or less, so part of the strategy is keeping the other players from getting varieties they like while forcing them to take monsters.<br/><br/>",

The players help Benjamin find the animals in the woods.<br/><br/>Aim of the game:<br/>Being the player who finds the most animals.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>The shrub tiles are laid out and under each shrub an animal tile is hidden. The Benjamin figure is switched on. It explains the game and if you press a button, he asks the first player to find a particular animal. The active player turns over a shrub tile. If the correct animal is hidden there, the active player keeps the animal tile. The shrub tile is removed from the game. If it is the wrong animal, it stays uncovered and the next player gets to look under a shrub. If it is the wanted animal, he/she keeps it. If not, this one stays uncovered too. This continues until the correct animal has been found. Then all the other animals are covered again. The next player presses the button on the Benjamin figure and a new search begins.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the animals have been found. The player with the most animals wins the game.<br/><br/>Then all the animals are returned to the &quot;zoo&quot; (box bottom). Sea animals are put into the water area, monkey, pelican, panda and mouse go on the box sides (monkey goes on the side with the tree picture, pelican on the pole etc.). The other animals are put into slits in the box bottom insert. (This isn't part of the actual game but an additional activity that can be done with the game materials.)<br/><br/>",

Playing a card that matches your color is called &quot;Affinity&quot; and you get added benefits for doing this.  You can play Pillows, Weapons, Special Items, and Shields.  You do this by placing cards in your Action Row to be used on your next turn.  Your Action Row is a set of 3 cards that you play from on your turn.<br/><br/>Pillows are required to play Weapons and remain in play to help protect you until they are destroyed.  Weapons are used for attacking Players and Pillows and are always successful against Players with no Pillows.  Some Weapons, that are harder to use successfully, reward you with the Remote Card.  Thematically, this is something that is getting jostled about in the chaos and landing a really good hit buys you time to pick it up.  Special Items are used to destroy Pillows and Action cards, while Shields defend against certain Items.<br/><br/>Using Weapon and Item cards successfully rewards you with Movies!  The more challenging it is to use a Weapon card successfully, the more Movies you get.  Sometimes success will come down to the luck of the roll or draw, but most often you will rely on your foresight and timing to use cards successfully.  Pillow Fight is a game that rewards you for paying attention to what your  opponents do, giving you an edge if you notice patterns in play.  It is also dynamic enough that you can easily change your strategy each hand and change the tide of the game.  It accomplished all of this with a consistent theme and simple mechanics.<br/><br/>",

There are 4 small red tiles that are placed in the center of the table to form the wall. The side of the wall facing each player is their inner wall. The inner wall extends to an imaginary horizontal line.  The space before the inner wall is the player's home city.<br/><br/>Both players have 11 Warrior pieces: the Trojan Horse (1 big square tile), the cavalry unit ( 1 of 1x1 tile, 1 of 2x1 tiles, 1 of 1x2 tile), the swordsmen (1 of 1x1 tile, 1 of 2x1 tile, 1 of 1x12 tile), the spearmen (2 of 1x1), the archer (1 of 1x1), and the king (1x1). The actions that may be available to the warriors are:<br/> - Move a tile in one-space<br/> - Move a tile in a straight-line<br/> - Move a tile over on the other side <br/>The game starts by placing the 4 red tiles to form the wall. After which, players then take turn to either place or move any of their tiles. The Trojan Horse may be introduced any time but it must be placed first behind the player's inner wall. The Trojan Horse takes on the characteristics of any piece of the same color it touches at the time. The swordsmen can move up to three one-spaces. The cavalry can play one of the actions per turn. The spearmen can be placed to any free side of a piece orthogonally adjacent to the spearmen tile. The archer can play one or two actions per turn. The king can have a series of actions per turn but these actions can only be done on the pieces of the same color.

It's primarily for four to six people; deal the Ace of Spades, King of Diamonds and then two to four Jacks depending on how many people are playing (one card each; for more people, add in Queens too).<br/><br/>Cards are kept secret; each player's card gives him/her a secret identity: Ace = dope dealer; King = undercover policeman; Jacks/Queens = customers.<br/><br/>The game is played as the policeman vs the rest of the players.  The dealer's goal is to sell his dope without getting caught.  He makes a sale by slyly winking at a single customer whom he does not think is an undercover policeman.  If it is a customer, the customer within five seconds of receiving the wink says &quot;I'll buy some&quot; and flips over his or her Jack/Queen; he/she no longer takes part in subsequent play.  (Dealer and customer must make eye contact one on one; if another customer oversees a wink between the dealer and another customer, he/she cannot say &quot;I'll buy some,&quot; but instead must wait to receive an individual wink from the dealer.)<br/><br/>If the policeman thinks he knows who the dealer is, he makes an accusation.  This ends the game.  If the accusation is right, then the policeman wins the game.  If the accusation is wrong, he loses and the dealer's team wins.<br/><br/>The dealer can also win by successfully selling to all the customers without being caught by the police.<br/><br/>(If you want to play with children, re-theme the game as playground bubble gum dealer, and change the policeman to &quot;teacher.&quot;)<br/><br/>",

A player can include one spell in this pair of cards, and the spell might, say, steal an opponent's weakest monster or kill all monsters other than the undead. Whoever now has the highest monster total claims the treasure.<br/><br/>The first player to win two treasures valued 1-4 claims a crown card worth 7 points.

The players also distribute among themselves the five high offices of the Republic, and use the corresponding powers to their advantage as well as to hinder the other factions.<br/><br/>In the end, the faction that rebels to the Senate and wins the resulting civil war, or gains the allegiance of the majority of the Roman senators, wins the game, but only if the Republic is not bankrupt and the Roman people are content.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Roma Celer uses 54 poker-sized cards and 29 half-sized cards; the players must supply 60-80 euro-cubes or similar objects to be used as markers, and 16-18 six-sided dice. The print-and-play components include counters that can be used instead of the cubes and to reduce the number of physical dice required.<br/><br/>Roma Celer was originally an entry in the 2013 &quot;In-A-Tin&quot; / &quot;Express&quot; Print-and-Play Design Contest.<br/><br/>",

As soon as everyone is ready, someone shouts &quot;GO!&quot; and all the players simultaneously begin starting number piles in the center of the table, and playing on each others number piles.<br/><br/>The number piles are not removed from the table for the duration of the round, and continue to grow and change very rapidly throughout the game. Players can play a card higher, or lower than whatever number is showing on the top of any given pile, but they do need to be sure to match the color of the pile. Also, players can place a wild card on any pile and announce a number, and a color, and then play a card higher or lower than the number they called, in the new color on that pile.<br/><br/>The speed and excitement build until someone who has played all of their down pile shouts &quot;Flip Flash!&quot; and everyone must stop. Next, the players gather and sort all of the cards that have been played in the center of the table and sort them, so that each player can count up how many cards they played. The score is figured by taking the number of cards that were played, and subtracting double the number of cards that were still in each players down pile.<br/><br/>WHAT MAKES FLIP FLASH DIFFERENT:<br/>The ability to play up or down on the number piles, and the wild card twist, speed up the game by making sure that you rarely stay stuck for long! The number piles are never capped off, or removed from play during a round, and players flip through their hand-deck one card at a time. The three suits keeps things interesting, but limits confusion as well.<br/><br/>Flip Flash is different than Nay-Jay! in the number and design of the cards, and a rule change. Flip Flash includes 4 decks of 60 cards each.<br/><br/>",

On either long end of the board is a triangle comprised of six circles, three on each outer end (the Bases,) narrowing toward the center of the board.<br/><br/>Each player has three pieces of varying colors called Knights which start the game on each player's Bases, and whose movements are determined by the spinning of a teetotum in a hole on the bottom of the game's box.  Currently there is no photo or record online to describe in what combination of colors the pieces were made, nor the teetotum.  Players do not take turns moving; they spin the teetotum to see which colors come up, and determine who moves and for how many spaces based on its outcome.  Knights always move towards the opponent's side of the board, unless no move is available, in which case they must move backward.  Knights may jump opponent's Knights, sending the opponent's piece back to one of its Bases.  The center safety spot prevents any occupying Knight from being jumped.  To win the game, a player must move all three of his Knights onto the opponent's Bases.<br/><br/>",

Day-to-day life was made increasingly difficult when monarchs decided to send all of the able-bodied men off to fight in the Crusades. Could circumstances get even worse? Yes, when a creature of legend arrives at the local castle, eats the Regent and demands tribute. All that&rsquo;s left to deal with the creature are old men, women, children and cowards. It&rsquo;s time for the cowards to step up.<br/><br/>As a village elder in this coward-placement game, you are to assign tasks to your village&rsquo;s cowards. <br/>Cowards can go to the lists to learn to become warriors, to the forests to become better hunters, to the monasteries to learn about their foe or to get boons, or to the fields to plant and harvest carrots (tribute to the Dragonbunny is paid in carrots&hellip;)<br/><br/>Eventually, you will have to send your cowards to face the dreaded Dragonbunny in the castle.<br/>The player whose coward eventually kills the Dragonbunny is the winner.<br/><br/>Game time is 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Minimal Space Combat is a game of tactical space ship battle. The players design ships and then can battle to the death. It may be used with any scifi background as it has a very minimal theme. Players plot movement and then move simultaneously. Combat can occur at any time during movement when opposing ships are in range and in the weapons firing arc. The goal is simply to destroy the other player's ships.<br/><br/>Timothy Swenson describes the reasoning for designing this game as follows: <br/>&quot;The premise behind this game is this: what is the simplest playable game possible to game tactical space combat. The game must make some reasonable attempt to come close to simulating space combat and not just the simplest possible game. The emphasis in this game is fast and easy. Playability is given more consideration than realism. There is no consideration for expansion of these rules, because then it would not be minimal. Use the game for those times when you want a quick and dirty space combat game or for introducing someone new to gaming.&quot;<br/><br/>In addition to the basic game Timothy also has minimal rules for a campaign game, a method for playing solo and a tutorial for introducing new players to space combat games.<br/><br/>",

They can be used either as Candidates (for the post of the Prime Minister), or Agents trying to help their candidate in the elections.<br/>-Threats are the means of eliminating enemy Agents, or even Candidates<br/>-Shelters are for protecting from enemy Threats<br/>-Events are for general purpose, either to hinder your opponents or to earn you points.<br/><br/>In both variants, each player has his own Candidate for the post of Prime Minister, whose identity is unknown to other players. Those candidates are placed in a column face down and each round ever player puts a card face down in a row with his Candidate. After each player has placed his or her card, all those cards are revealed and resolved in a fixed order (Event, Agent, Threat, Shelter). When a player reveals an Agent, other players may guess the identity of his Candidate. If they guess right, he is revealed and that players cannot gain any points for revealing him by himself. The game continues on, regardless of a successful guess. After a playing a Threat card that will not be neutralized by a Shelte card, that player may reveal his Candidate and earns a number of points corresponding to the game's turn. If all the players' candidates are revealed (either by a guess or willingly) or if number of Threat cards on the table equals to number of players +1, the game ends. The player who caused end of the game gets extra 3 points and each player gets points for surviving of his own and killing opponents' agents.

This game uses the Stand and Deliver Standard Series Rules for tactical warfare from about 1700 to 1799. The Standard Series Rules provide beginning and advanced players with the feel of linear combat of the time while being designed for easy play.<br/><br/>THE GAME MAP<br/>The 22&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; inch game map represents the general area where the battle was fought around the small Polish village of Mollwitz. Each hex is about 180 yards across. The map is mostly white as there had been a heavy, late snow in April that year.<br/><br/>COUNTERS AND MARKERS<br/>There are three general types of combat units: foot (infantry and grenadiers); mounted (cavalry and cuirassiers); and artillery. In addition, there are commander units.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>Frederick II and his army were caught behind enemy lines with a large Austrian force lying between him and the rest of his kingdom to the north with his supply and communication lines cut off. The Prussian player wins the game if at the end of the game any Mollwitz Town hex is occupied by Prussian ordered foot units. The Austrian player wins immediately if Frederick II is killed. The Austrian player wins if at the end of the game the Prussian player does not capture at least one Mollwitz hex and at least 6 ordered Austrian infantry units remain on the field. Either side wins if the other should rout. Anything else is a draw.<br/><br/>SEQUENCE OF PLAY<br/>There are ten game turns. Each game turn consists of the following phases performed in the sequence shown:<br/><br/>A. Roll for Turn Initiative<br/>Both players roll one six-sided die (1D6). The player who rolls the higher result is the First Player. In the event of a tie, roll again.<br/>B. First Player Phases<br/> a. Ranged Artillery Fire<br/> b. Movement<br/> c. Combat<br/> d. Rally<br/>C. Repeat Above Phases for the Second Player<br/>D. Both Sides Check for Rout; Advance Turn Marker<br/><br/>",

In safe locations, encounters will tend to be friendly, or harmless, while in dangerous locations, encounters will be aggressive and will be a liability to the player. Each encounter card shows three type of behaviors, and the player applies the one, associated to the location he was met. <br/>To deal with an encounter, the player will use action points. If the player has no action points, he will suffer the consequences, which will involve, eventually, spending time, and the player only has a limited amount of time/days/turns, to catch the culprit.<br/><br/>The player will have to go through the investigation deck, gaining clues and evidence, to frame the suspect, that will make the player understand where the criminal is hiding.<br/>It's up to the player to determine how fast or slow he should investigate, keeping track of his action points, knowing where he's investigating, and managing his time, action points and the risks.<br/><br/>Once the player has gained enough evidence (in the evidence phase) he will decide wether to keep investigating, to gain more evidence which will limit the number of locations the murderer will try to hide in, or start looking for the criminal, early on (but with more places to search him, into).<br/><br/>Dystopian: the adventure deck game is the second installment in the dystopian trilogy, with Dystopian: the manhunt, and the soon to be finalized: Dystopian: raise and fall.<br/><br/>",

How many headbands were worn? Or how many weapons were pointing to the left? Was the second Indian from the right painted with war paint? Or is there an Indian wearing a shirt, and carrying a tomahawk? The player who is able to give the first correct answer, gains a token.<br/><br/>The 10 playing cards in Kiqsuyapi are double-sided. They determine the level of difficulty of the game. With only 4 cards, the challenge is still moderate. With 10 cards even true champions are going to work up a sweat. And if you still consider this too easy, the expert version will be an even greater challenge for you. Here, all players have to answer and the right answer will gain you a point, as before. Wrong answers, however, will cost you points! This applies in particular to those questions that ask for two or even three aspects at once. For example, how many Indians are wearing a shirt, a headdress and are carrying a bow?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ATS HUERTGEN HELL is a detailed historical module that tells the story of the Battle of the Huertgen Forest with a broad sweep, and detailed historical map. The presentation is a large as the battle was ... in terms of importance to Allied hopes to be &lsquo;home for Christmas&rsquo; ... 1944. Those hopes were dashed by bitter German resistance in the dark, dank wooded hills and villages around the Kall River. Names like Kommerscheidt, Vossenack, and Germeter, not to mention the infamous Kall Trail ... ring out in the history of the battle. Every one of those places is depicted, and more, allowing the tactical-level gamer to contest every inch, or pull back and await reinforcements ... or lay in a mortar barrage ... or stand pat and await new orders. Whatever was possible to local commanders is in YOUR hands as you re-make history in minute detail.<br/><br/>The map presentation is extensive, providing almost a dozen square feet of gaming area with evocative terrain artwork by a professional military illustrator What&rsquo;s more, when combined with OBJECTIVE SCHMIDT, ATS HUERTGEN HELL creates another CH monster battlefield measuring some six feet in length ... there just has never been anything like it. You&rsquo;ll be able to gaze across the expanse of the battlefield on both sides of the Kall River, including multiple villages, hundreds of terrain features. And yet, many scenarios play on portions of the overall map area, making the module easy to dive into and get your dice rolling without delay.<br/><br/>The module includes two sheets of 176 5/8&rdquo; die-cut German and American Personnel and Weapon counters, plus a sheet of 108 AFV/VEHICLES in 3/4&rdquo; size, a total of 460 counters in all&mdash;everything you need to play (just bring your standard ATS markers). You also receive 10 scenarios (all playable on the map provided) in color format, and color Battlefield WalkaroundTM special rules in 3-hole format. THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME! Ownership of the ATS 2014 rulebook and play aids plus standard system small and large marker counters is required (plus one or more 10-sided dice).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Barnyard Legions March to War<br/>From the frigid north to the arid Sahara, the Barnyard Legions march forth to claim their place in history. In Barnyard Legions you, the general, have been given a mission to keep the other Legions from ever completing their goal of lining up a proper battle line or two. Will you command the Sheep Legionnaires under the rule of Julius Sheepsar? Or will the hoof of Auroch the Red Boviking crush the Celtucky Chickens?<br/><br/>How do you play? <br/>Each player takes their choice of Barnyard Legion and mixes some of their cards into a common deck. The rest of their cards are kept as their own deck. Each turn, players take 2-3 actions, attempting to complete a battle line of five cards from their Legion. To keep the game moving, every player draws a card from their deck at the start of each round, hoping to not run out of cards, causing elimination, before the battle has been won.<br/><br/>What is unique about it?<br/>The game has built in subtleties that will appeal to gamers, while the unique decks and humorous tongue-in-cheek art make Barnyard Legions a great gateway game for players who are not familiar with more complicated card games. Families will be able to sit down and follow the very simple rules and start playing immediately.<br/><br/>",

Steam is used to power different attacks or shift gears from first to second gear.<br/><br/>The arena has three different steam vents located throughout. A normal steam vent, a gear vent, and a hatch vent. These can be turned on or off with a die roll. When the vents are on, moving over them can increase the amount of steam in your tank but at the cost of some life. Gear cards could appear on the gear vent with a die roll. The hatch vents are used to move a player from the gear vent.<br/><br/>Gear cards are equipped by players to modify the player's stats. Playing cards are used to help launch attacks or defend. Combat is determined by a die roll adding any modifiers and comparing it to the defender's defense with their modifiers.<br/><br/>The game ends when there is only one person left alive.<br/><br/>Gear Grinders is the first game from Roll One Games Limited.<br/><br/>Game time is 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the number of players and the aggressiveness of the game play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ard R&iacute; is a 2 to 5 player strategic competitive card game, designed for players ages 14 and up. Average game-play time is 30 to 90 minutes. A simplified introductory version is also available for children ages 5+.<br/><br/>In the game, players take on the role of ancient Gaelic warlords and compete among each other to collect the most wealth in order to force the other players to acknowledge them as the ARD R&Iacute; (i.e. the High King).<br/><br/>Play progresses through the seasons of the year, with each season providing players with the opportunity to engage in specified actions. For instance, Cattle are added to a player&rsquo;s wealth in Spring, with Warriors flocking to banners in the Summer. Wealth is acquired from the wilds during the harvest time of Autumn, with the Harvest Feast of Samhain occurring at the end of that season. At the Harvest Feast, players are required to feed those Warriors they wish to remain under their banner. Winter is a time of hunting, raiding, and politicking, when fortunes can change in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player accumulates enough wealth or warriors to force the issue and cause the others to acknowledge them as High King.<br/><br/>The game has been heavily influenced by the history and mythology of the ancient Celts, and the advanced version of the game incorporates the mythology into the game-play.<br/><br/>The game uses our Celtic Myth playing cards as game components, with one deck being sufficient for a 2-player game, two decks being recommended for 3 to 4-player games, and all three decks being recommended for 5-player games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cover the city in graffiti and earn respect of your rivals by creating the most original words. But be careful! Only the graffiti left at the end of the game will allow you to earn points. Don't hesitate to cover the creations of your opponents, while always thinking to protect your own!<br/><br/>Each player has a character card and corresponding tokens (by colour) that are used to tag which graffiti was done by them. The game is played in 6 rounds, with 2 phases per round. The Night phased is when you do the actual graffiti and the Day phase is when players explain their creations and voting takes place. Each player starts with a hand of 7 cards. There are 2 types of cards in play, brick walls and Subway cars (BW and SC for the rest of this explanation). Each player then secretly constructs a word (no, this is not scrabble, you can have fictional words. Acronyms may be constructed, but with a limit of 3 vowels or 3 consonants in a row. You must explain what each of the letters means), as long as the words are made up entirely or BW or SC cards.  No mixing is permitted! The words must be pronounceable (no smattering of all consonants or all vowels). Add your artist tag (worth the corresponding number of points hidden on the underside) to your creation and the Night phase is complete.<br/><br/>During the day phase, you reveal your word to other players and then explain why your creation is the best of all (in a counter-clockwise manner). Once you've explained your reasoning as to why your creation is the best, voting takes places. Simultaneously, each player points to the creation they find the best and places their tag on the appropriate creation. If no one votes for your creation, you do not turn your tag over and receive no points for this round. Each draws up to their 7 card hand limit and the Night phase recommences.<br/><br/>Aside from SC and BW cards, there specialty cards within the game:<br/><br/>Police Officer cards (that you may have drawn from the deck) protect your creation from being painted over by only one person. The remaining players are free to attack your design.<br/><br/>Bag cards allow you to draw an additional card at the end of the Day phase.<br/><br/>Eraser cards steals the opponent's card of your choice, that is part of a creation on the table.<br/><br/>Ladder cards permit you to cover a second creation of someone (instead of the typical creation that was just played).<br/><br/>Covering others' creations (possible as of the second Night phase) requires that you use the same card type + 1 (4 letter BW creation must be covered by 5 BW cards).<br/><br/>The aforementioned Special cards must be used BEFORE placing the current Day rounds creation in your personal player area.<br/><br/>The rounds continue until the sixth round has past.<br/><br/>Endgame scoring is calculated by counting the cards of each word that has not been painted over by other players multiplied by the number indicated on the tag placed on he word. Example: 7 letter word X 3 point tag = 21 points for that word alone.<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>The 122 letters and the logo of the game were designed by hand by 5 'Street Artists' internationally recognized for their great talent: Cope2, Indie184, Nasty, bead, RosyOne. Their characters and sets were beautifully illustrated by Regis Torres.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Project Discovery is a solitaire Solar System space exploration game. Building space vehicles with a unique array of instrument cards, you move about the Solar System, explore planets and moons and find different science discoveries.<br/><br/>Space exploration is full of mystery, and Project Discovery has been given funding to discover some of these mysteries. You've been tasked with destinations to explore, uncovering new science as you probe each site with your vehicle and its instruments.<br/><br/>The game is a mix of mechanics including: random chit pulling, modified dice rolls, action choices, light deck building.<br/><br/>The game is setup by randomly pulling 4 destination cards (from a deck of 22) face up onto the map board. These represent the only destinations explorable for the game. On top of each destination card a hidden discovery chit is placed, representing 1 possible science discovery (science discoveries are worth victory points). The player starts with funding which allows him to buy cards and pay for other things in the game. Every 3 years there's a funding increase.<br/><br/>Each turn the player chooses from a list of free actions (building a vehicle mission by buying instrument cards, launching a mission, etc) and a list of choice actions, choosing 3 from a list of 8, these are the actions that move the game forward.<br/><br/>To explore each destination, there are 3 exploration types; Using the Space Exploratory tokens from Earth orbit, sending an Explorer Mission or sending a Vehicle Mission. Only vehicle missions can find discoveries. They are a collection of up to 4 cards purchase with funding (thruster, GNC support, 2 instrument cards). The Explorer Missions are single stand-alone cards that model the real life Voyager Probes, there are 2 for each game and are sent before the vehicle missions to gather data about any particular destination. The data is gained by successfully rolling the explorer mission exploration number at a destination which allows a choice of adding a second discovery, flipping a discovery already there, or adding a modifier to a future Vehicle Mission's success roll.<br/><br/>Each instrument has a discovery type and base roll number to roll when performing a discovery roll. Successfully finding a discovery is done by getting an instrument card to the destination by using the thruster card to move the vehicle map piece along planet, moon or inter-planet spaces  and once at the destination of choice rolling a die. The success roll can be modified from previous game play to better the odds of success.<br/><br/>",

Your task is to use Intelligence cards to influence your country into taking wise decisions. The trouble is, enemy spies have infiltrated your country and are influencing it into taking less wise decisions! Develop your culture to make it easier to spot enemy spies, improve science to get access to more elaborate cards, further your military to increase the number of spies at your disposal, or invest in economy to pay for bonus actions, known as Secret Directives.<br/><br/>Aim: There are four different types of Intelligence cards which are used to make progress on  4 corresponding development tracks. The winner of the game is the first player to reach the end of any one of these tracks. As players progress up the tracks, which each have 10 spaces, they also unlock various benefits:<br/><br/>Economy: Increases income of coins. Coins are spent on bonus actions which happen at the end of a round.<br/>Military: Increases number of spies you have. More spies means more actions can be taken in each round.<br/>Science: Makes more cards available. There are three levels of cards, at the beginning of the game, players only have access to the most basic cards.<br/>Culture: Means capturing enemy spies is easier. At the end of a round, players who have developed culture can roll one to three dice to try to capture enemy spies.<br/><br/>In addition to trying to progress on development tracks, players need to build a deck of cards made up of Intelligence cards and Action cards. Cards can be added to their deck through research actions, which allow players to take cards from a shared supply. Most of the time, cards that are played return to that players deck by reshuffling their discard pile. However, playing Intelligence cards into another player&rsquo;s country removes that card from their deck more permanently, and can also slow their opponents progress on the  development tracks.<br/><br/>",

Their parents patch them up, but now it's easier to tell who's who when you spot them passing by, and your job in Spooky Wooky is to find pairs of ghosts quicker than anyone else.<br/><br/>To set up, all the tiles are laid face down. Players take turns revealing one tile, and as soon as someone spots a pair of ghosts with patches of the same shape, that player keeps the matching tile newly revealed. Players contain playing until no more matches can be made, then whoever has the most tiles wins.<br/><br/>Alternatively, players of Spooky Wooky can look for ghosts with patches of the same shape and color, or for ghosts with the same number of identically-shaped patches.<br/><br/>",

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTo flip a stone means to replace it with a stone of the opposite color.<br/><br/>The flipping direction is horizontal for Black and vertical for White.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you must perform exactly one of the following actions:<br/><br/>- Maneuver: Place one stone of your color on an empty point and flip all straight lines of contiguous enemy stones that are both parallel to your flipping direction and adjacent to your placement in the same direction.<br/><br/>- Sweep: Flip a straight line of contiguous enemy stones along your flipping direction, provided that said line touches the two opposite board edges of your opponent's color and that you haven't swept that same line on any previous turn of the game.

A tactical game system allows players to skirmish one-on-one with each other using the Falling Stars Opposed d10 game system. Players can take a break from role playing (or completely ignore that aspect of the game) and simply enjoy fighting other players. Players can select teams or elect to play free-for-all or anything else in between. The maps in Falling Stars are scaled perfectly for 28mm miniatures, or players can make their own maps using half-inch grid squares or as a miniature gaming system with ranges measured in half-inch increments.<br/> Maybe that tough talking UPAS marine thinks he can take your brawler. So take a break for the RPG and let the two players settle the argument with the Tactical Game System. Bragging rights goes to the winner, and then the group can get back to playing the role playing game. The possibilities are endless!<br/><br/>This box contains everything you need to learn the basic mechanics of Falling Stars. It includes Quick Start Rules, eight pre-generated characters, the first three chapters of an ongoing sci-fi adventure campaign, &ldquo;Into the Long Dark Night,&rdquo; characters and tokens mounted on high-quality cardboard and full-color printed maps for the adventure.<br/><br/>",

By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.<br/><br/>Liberation Forces are decimated, paving the way for control of the galaxy's Inner Ring. &ldquo;But you promised me a real fight.&quot;<br/><br/>Suddenly, the comm crackles to life, &quot;Commander! Liberation reinforcements are dropping out of hyperspace!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ah, your playmates have arrived...

This expansion adds new counters for Japanese, Soviet and Iranian. And new rules and scenarios for Iranian intervention in the Iraqi side, and Soviet intervention in the Iraqi or Coalition side.<br/><br/>The Desert Storm: The Mother of All Battles base game is a one- or two-player operational simulation of the Gulf War. It focused almost exclusively on the Coalition ground war that liberated Kuwait and shattered the occupying Iraqi army.<br/><br/>The game included a 22&quot; x 34&quot; hex map of the significant terrain in the Kuwaiti Theatre of Operations, 192 counters, and 20 pages of rules, charts, and tables.<br/><br/>Rules are split into both a basic and an advanced game. There are separate rules for solitaire play.<br/><br/>The U.S./Coalition player had to completely liberate Kuwait to have a chance to win. If Kuwait was liberated within 12 game turns, the player who has gained the most 'points' in inflicting losses on their opponent, was the winner. The Coalition player had to be aggressive in order to completely clear Iraqi units from all Kuwaiti cities, towns, oilfields, and airfields, otherwise the Iraqi player would win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Arc of the Kaiser's Last Raider (Last Raider for short) puts you in the position of a writer of pulp fiction during the 1920s in which you are trying to complete an adventure fiction novel set some time during World War I on the high seas. You, the writer, are trying to construct a story arc in which the narrator of your novel, the commander of a German high seas raider in 1917, is trying to find a lost secret somewhere in the South Seas which, if he can return it to a port in Europe, will change the course of the World War raging in Europe. This objective is represented by an Objective card.<br/><br/>Along the way, your commander must face many perils, from shark infested waters to monolith haunted lost islands to Uber-Nemeses who will do anything to stop him from completing his mission. These are represented by various Plot Cards.<br/><br/>But you have many ways to complete your mission (i.e., finish the book on deadline). One of these is the mighty Cliche, cards which you can hold and play at critical moments when all seems lost. However, the more Cliche cards you play, the greater the chance you have of losing the reader's suspension of disbelief, quantified as The Plot Thins Index. When you reach your Objective, you must use your Savvy and trusty crew to overcome the final obstacles, grab the prize, and then return home.<br/><br/>",

They excel at damage output and generate a lot of momentum through combat and damage effects. They provide each other with a good assortment of buffs and debuffs in order to allow combo play. Butchers mainly focus on raw damage.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s not to say that they don&rsquo;t have some surprises up their sleeves - characters like Shank and Boiler can pop up and surprise you with their goal threats if you&rsquo;re not careful &hellip;<br/><br/>A Guild Ball match requires two teams and a ball. Play against the Butchers and you will find that the ball was really just decoration. The Butcher's Guild knows that there is more than one way to win a game; their intimate knowledge of anatomy developed over years in the slaughter yard is just as useful as the ball skills practiced by their opponents.<br/><br/>In Ox, the Butcher's have one of the deadliest players ever to step onto a Guild Ball pitch. On his own he is responsible for crippling and killing more players than some teams manage over entire seasons. Always on the look out for young talent, Ox brings the apprentices Boiler and Brisket with him to show them just how the Butcher's play the game. They are the meanest, nastiest, most deadly trio to step onto a Guild Ball pitch in a long, long time.<br/><br/>This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Butcher's Guild.<br/><br/>",

The Allies used this time to build up their strength and the 8th Army was formed. Before dawn on 18 November, the 8th Army was ready to strike and the Allies launched a sweeping offensive into the Axis controlled Cyrenaica (Eastern Libya) in order to relieve the besieged fortress of Tobruk. After a series of swirling battles, the Axis had to withdraw and the siege was lifted.<br/><br/>Michael Gustavsson, co-designer of FAB: Golan&rsquo;73 is back with volume IV in the Fast Action Battle series. In this game, as the Allied player, you control the XXX and XIII corps, Tobruk Garrison and the Strategic Reserve force of the 8th Army. As the Axis player, you control the DAK (Deutsches Afrika Korps), the Italian XXI corps and the Corpo d&rsquo; Armata di Manovra (CAM) of the Panzergruppe Afrika commanded by the famous Erwin Rommel. Units in the game represents regiments/brigades and some battalions, while assets are mostly battalion size and turns are 1-2 days in time.<br/><br/>In FAB: Crusader you will see features like Motorized Infantry units, higher stacking limits, Tank Refit, Italian Trieste Reserve Division, Ghost Units, Fortified areas, Realistic Armor treatment, Special Reconnaissance Unit Capabilities, movement points to trace Supply and Divisional Integrity rules, a new Combat Matrix and other rules for transferring the system to desert warfare.<br/><br/>Assets include Machine Gun Battalions, Allied &quot;I&quot; Tanks, Powerful German 88&rsquo;s (AT) and more. Various events are included such as Air Missions, Allied Rapid Response, The Beta Convoy, British LRDG Commando Raid, Naval Bombardment and German Auftragstaktik, Command Confusion among others. The game also have optional rules to enhance realism such as Allied Armor Doctrine, Probe Attacks, Italian SNAFU Check and German Momentum.<br/><br/>This battle will provide interesting challenges to both sides: Will the Allies try a risky breakout from Tobruk, and will it be relieved, will Rommel go for a dash to the wire, will Allied replacements outlast Axis fuel and supply, will the Italians crumble or hold? Now, it is up to YOU to find out&hellip;<br/><br/>",

This feature is in the game every time you play and with the design, also gives great replayability.<br/><br/>It has taken some time and a lot of changes especially over the last year and a half, but we do now finally have our first run in and are also taking in dealers now. The game has undergone a lot of revisions and art changes. We wanted to take the extra time to adjust the game play and have a very good balance to the game. Now we are very happy with the results and are beginning to get the game out. (Please note this is not a &quot;Legacy&quot; game, this is part of the title because of the overall story.)<br/><br/>Cypress Legacy: The Board Game is based on the Cypress Inheritance Saga.<br/> OBJECTIVE: Use Weapons, Skills, Assets, and Classified Prototypes to be the first player to escape the Cypress Mansion with all the required inheritance items and be Lorna&rsquo;s proven friend.<br/><br/>STORY: The story you are playing within begins with Lorna Ritten just learning of Alfred Cypress, the grandfather she has never known. Lorna has always wanted to find out more about her biological family, which has always been a mystery. Her grandfather&rsquo;s attorney, Phillip Brandt, tells Lorna of an inheritance, which includes one of her grandfather&rsquo;s many mansions and its contents. Her desire to know more marks the beginning of a very unique and potentially dangerous situation. Lorna has no idea just how important this actually is to her and will be to others. As Lorna is studying some of the inheritance documents before visiting the mansion, she realizes there are objects that hold key information hidden throughout the mansion.<br/><br/>Also note the complete Cypress Legacy: The Board Game Manual in the files below. (Note the player versus player elements in the manual)<br/><br/>The Novel Series has gone through a lot of changes as well and the first novel will be available soon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this tile-laying game, players are aquarium designers trying to create the most delightful aquarium.<br/><br/>Tiles can have up to 4 areas depicted on them: <br/><br/>     Brown (area where visitors can see seals)<br/>     Pink (dolphins)<br/>     Light blue (penguins)<br/>     Dark blue (angel fish)<br/><br/><br/>At game plays over eight rounds, in which players pick and place tiles. Points are awarded points at the end of the game for the areas they created. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, every player gets an &quot;Entrance&quot; tile (featuring all four areas). Shuffle the layout cards to make a draw deck (cards face up), and place a number of layout tiles equal to the number of players face up. The player that has most recently visited an aquarium goes first.<br/><br/>Each round, there are two phases: a tile acquisition phase, and a building phase.<br/><br/>During the tile acquisition phase, players take turns picking a tile from the available layout tiles. Play proceeds clockwise, and each player may decide to pick immediately, or postpone their decision (&quot;pass&quot;) and pick a tile after others have picked theirs. Players can only pass once: if a player decides to &quot;pass&quot; they will have to pick a tile after the other players have picked their tiles or passed. This continues until all players have picked a tile. The last person to pick a tile will be the starting player next round.<br/><br/>Examples: 4 players, A-B-C-D, A starts<br/>1. A: picks, B: picks, C: picks, D: picks. Every player has a card, acquisition phase ends. D is next round's starting player.<br/>2. A: picks, B: passes, C: picks, D: picks, A: does nothing, B: picks. Every player has a card, acquisition phase ends. B is next round's starting player.<br/><br/>During the building phase, player place their tiles in their own Aquarium. The following restrictions apply:<br/>1. The sides of the tiles have to touch completely. The orientation of the tile does not matter.<br/>2. Tiles cannot go outside a 3 by 3 frame. Entrance does not have to be in the middle.<br/>3. Areas on the tiles do not have to match.<br/>4. Once placed, tiles cannot be moved.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the layout cards are replenished.<br/><br/>After eight rounds, players will have a 3 by 3 grid.<br/><br/>Scoring points is easy: <br/><br/>     You can only count connected areas with 2 or more animals.<br/>     For each area, count the number of tiles in that area and add the number of animals.<br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

If the player peeks, they play their card face-up. Once all cards are played, all is revealed, critters steal their seeds, and the birds share what&rsquo;s left.<br/><br/>This 18-card micro-game gives players a limited amount of information along with a few ways to learn more about and impact what is available at each of the feeders.

In each term of office, one player is the president (of Czech Republic), player on his or her left is the president's spokesperson and all others are journalist. The President chooses the subject of speech and, after playing the cards (statements) he/she must use them in a speech. Journalists then ask unnecessary and provocative additional questions to which the spokesperson must react promptly, even if they are far from being worthy. If his responses gets journalists offended, they give him points of shame. When a journalist buzzes, the spokesperson is satisfied.

If it falls in Botilde the throw of the other dice remaines unchanged; while a x2 doubles that roll; and the - forces to go back instead of advance.<br/><br/>As in the Game of the Goose, falling into a Botilde means going &quot;from boot to boot and shoot because it touches you&quot;. There are also question boxes; and trip boxes, which assignes a try-out. The other boxes all have a specific function, sometimes positive and sometimes negative, including those that make leaving the game.

The merfolk have always lived a quiet agrarian life below the waves, but times are changing and the way forward is building up.<br/><br/>Seascrapers is a solitaire roll-and-write city-building game in which players attempt to develop an underwater metropolis. By rolling dice, players can build facilities to house builders(which allow for the rolling of additional dice), priests (which allow re-rolls of dice), and scholars (which allow for the creation of more advanced buildings). Players can also construct more specialized facilities, which can modify the effects of adjacent buildings or award points. The most lucrative points, however, come from buildings that scrape the very surface of the sea and emerge into the alien world above -- but these first require the development of vast infrastructure below.<br/><br/>Each turn, after dice are rolled and buildings are built, a space on the time track is crossed off. The end of this track represents the conclusion of the merfolk's efforts, and the city's score is tallied up for evaluation.<br/><br/>Can you balance the various classes of merfolk society to build towering seascrapers, or will your city end in a heap on the ocean floor?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>Released in the June 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

Hence, they are forced to travel the world up and down in order to buy the best bottles directly from local producers.&quot;<br/><br/>There are 6 markers in the game, each one representing a character; players choose who they want to be at the start of the game.<br/><br/>The Game table show the world that is divided in cells linked with each other. The greater part of the cells represents the world, the cells with the bottle icons indicate the typical wine production places. Other cells represent the market, the blue ones, the sea.<br/><br/>The players, only at start, will stand about two meters away from the board and will, when prompted by an agreed cue, throw their marker on the board trying to get as near as possible to a convenient cell. If the marker does not fall within the cells area, it will be positioned in the closest permitted cell to start playing. In case of launch failure, players can have as many attempts as it takes at throwing their marker on the game board.<br/><br/>The youngest player (alternatively, if you are having fun playing BOTTLES in a bar, the guy buying the first round) starts to move. <br/>The player throws the die and checks the result on the movement chart, according to this the given marker will move from the start cell to a different one.<br/><br/>During his turn the players move and can buy bottle-cards. Moreover they can auction, sell, exchange or donate their bottle-cards or beg other players for theirs at any time during his turn.<br/><br/>There are approximately 80 different cards representing the wine bottles that the players can buy. Each card shows a variety of information about the type, the name, the country of origin and the value of the wine. This value is given by the amount of wine glass icons on the card. For instance, a card with 3 wine glass icons will cost 3 Monetary Units.<br/><br/>When players run out of money they get out of the game... Unless they convince other players to lend them money.<br/><br/>The first player that collects at least ten bottles from ten different countries wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each turn a die will drop from the top of the building, a die will drop from out of a window on the building face.  These dice are what you have to avoid as you climb up the face of the building.  You can move up to two spaces on the building.  Each die has a falling speed represented by a number from 2 to 6 with 6 falling the fastest.  Each turn a vulture will fly across the building sections trying to knock you off.  If you can climb up to the top of the building and avoid being knocked off by the dice you win.  If you get knocked off you lose the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The world is about to end, but nobody is quite sure exactly how it's going to happen. In Dangerous, your goal is to save as many innocent lives from certain doom as possible. To do so, you must outsmart your rival investigators and correctly deduce which apocalyptic predictions are true and which are false. The player who saves the most lives wins.<br/><br/>In each round, shuffle the twelve prophecy tiles, then lay out three rows of four tiles: the top row (face down) are true prophecies, which players must deduce; the middle row (face up) are false prophecies; and the bottom row (face down) are hoax prophecies. Below each hoax prophecy, lay out a column of four cards face up. The cards come in five prophecy suits, with values 1-3. Among the tiles are two of each prophecy and two 2x.<br/><br/>The lead investigator for that round places one of their two personal tokens by a hoax prophecy tile, looks at that tile, then chooses a card from that column and places it face up in front of themselves. Each other player then chooses a card from this column. If a hoax prophecy tile has two player tokens next to it, don't refill it; otherwise, do refill it. The next player becomes the lead investigator, and this process continues until each player has chosen eight cards, which they now take in hand.<br/><br/>Now you evaluate how well you predicted which disasters will take place. The lead investigator reveals one of the true prophecy tiles, then all players simultaneously reveal two cards from their hand. For each card that matches that revealed prophecy, you score positive points equal to the value of the card; otherwise, you lose points. If the prophecy tile instead shows 2x, you score positive points if you lay out two cards of matching value, but different suits; any other combination loses you points.<br/><br/>Record your scores for the round, and after a total of four rounds (with four players), whoever has scored the most points wins. (With two and three players, you make adjustments to the number of cards and prophecy tiles used and rounds played.<br/><br/>",

The card count will be exactly as before, but with the alternate bill in place. We suggest that you shuffle the alternate bill and the one being swapped out so you don't 100% know if the alternate bills are in place.<br/><br/>The Cleaner counts as a regular $10 bill, but also has the bonus ability of canceling a marked bill.<br/><br/>The Kingpin stops a Snitch from saying they are a cop. You take an unmarked bill of your choice from their end THEN the game ends. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>The Pigeon is an ally to the Snitch / Cop in 4 player games. The player who holds the Pigeon card cannot snitch, but only wins if the cop wins. On the downside, it&rsquo;s a little harder for the cop to win since the Pigeon&rsquo;s marked bills don&rsquo;t count.<br/><br/>",

What does this mean? Well the rules allow for spying, assassination, stirring speeches and the rules of war as well as the usual mechanisms for playing a wargame!<br/><br/>The sequence of play begins with any artillery shooting by either side, then one side moves and issues orders, then combat is resolved, and the next side then has a go (in other words, You-go;I-go).<br/><br/>Armies begin in march columns, so scouting plays a part in the tabletop wargame to discover where enemy forces are. Each column is represented by an officer figure until it is spotted so you really don&rsquo;t know what the enemy&rsquo;s doing until your patrols see them!<br/><br/>Orders are used, and the possibility of marching to the sound of guns included. Allowance is made for brigadiers disobeying orders as well!<br/><br/>All in all a very different set of rules for grand tactical battles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players then alternate turns removing one of the pyramids on the board and replacing it with one of their tokens. Moves are restricted based on the pyramid that your opponent has just removed: you must play in a square that matches this just-removed pyramid in either orientation or color.

Finding the relics of reggae in the ruins of the old world, a circle of youths rediscovers the power of music.  They plan to coordinate an enormous underground dance party to return the message of nonviolent resistance back to the people.<br/><br/>Reggae Revolution is a cooperative card game for 1 to 6 players.<br/><br/>Players work together to bring the message of peace and love back to the world.  In the game are four suits: peace, love, unity, and respect.  Players try to use these cards to collect sets in the score area to win the game.  But, at the beginning of each player's turn, a villain card pops out and makes the player discards all cards of a suit that the villain supresses.  Instead of fighting the villains, the players must sway them by giving them cards from their deck.  If the player does not have enough, the villain stays in play.  As the villains stack up, the players must discard more and more cards from their hand.  If the villains ever supress all four suits, peace, love, unity, and respect, then no one has any cards and the villains win the game!<br/><br/>Fight the power!  Join the resistance!

Can you avoid picking up Bad Habits that will send you Bankrupt?<br/>Living a lifestyle beyond your means?<br/>Gambling eating into your income?<br/>The Debt pile is stacking up?<br/>Spending out of control?<br/><br/>This game will have you laughing in stitches as you strike and counterstrike your opponents. Be the last one standing!<br/><br/>This is a fast paced card game where people are trying to avoid financial bad habits and not go bankrupt.<br/><br/>The game play is fairly simple.  There are as many Bankrupt cards in the deck  as there are players. Each player is trying to avoid having to pick up Bad Habit cards from the deck. The more financial Bad Habits you get the more cards you have to draw - with any one of them possibly being a Bankrupt card! If you get a Bankrupt card and don&rsquo;t have any Insurance that&rsquo;s it you are out of the game. Last person standing wins!<br/><br/>Just to make it a bit more interesting the player who picks up a Bankrupt card gets to put it back in the deck - wherever they want. Watchout! Players also have the chance to pick up Attack or Defense cards that enable them to strike and counterstrike against the other players, change the order of play, skip a turn or even block another player&rsquo;s action, take a peek at cards coming up in the deck, steal another player&rsquo;s card, transfer some Bad Habits to another player... Remember though any Bad Habits that you pick up could send you Bankrupt. If you start to accumulate Bad Habits in your hand the more Bad Habit cards you will have to pick up!<br/><br/>It is a bit different from other card games that you might be used to. The goal is really to not be picking up cards and making your opponents pick up as many cards as possible. Whether you have a lot of cards in your hand doesn't matter BUT the more financial Bad Habits you have the greater the chance you will need to pick up more cards. The more cards you pick up the greater the chance you will go Bankrupt!<br/><br/>The deck is full of twists and turns in the game. Just when you think you have the game won another player can turn the tables on you and send you Bankrupt!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The active player rolls the dice and has to combine all 5 dice using the basic arithmetic methods (addition / subtraction / multiplication / division) to reach a number that has not been calculated by any other player before. He then can mark this number (e.g. circle, cross out, box ). The player can, but does not have to, use all types of calculations methods. He can e.g. use only addition or e.g. once addition, once subtraction and twice multiplication. He can use brackets to work with the dot-before-dash calculation. Only whole numbers are allowed in the calculation process.<br/><br/>End of game:<br/><br/>The players play alternately.

Four scenarios center on the SS &ldquo;Death&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; Division and are designed to shatter illusions about that formation&rsquo;s &ldquo;elite&rdquo; status.<br/><br/>In addition to boards and counters from Broken Axis, most scenarios require components from one or more of Kursk: South Flank, Fire in the Steppe and Armata Romana.<br/><br/>The booklet takes its name from its feature article on the famous Grossdeutschland Division and the included set of 64 die-cut counters portraying its lower level units in the division&rsquo;s color scheme. The counters aren&rsquo;t actually used in any of the booklet&rsquo;s scenarios. They are provided for the numerous Broken Axis scenarios in which the Grossdeutschland fought. Other articles in the booklet discuss the Romanian Royal Army and Soviet armored fighting vehicles employed in the Romanian campaign.<br/><br/>Note: This booklet should not be confused with Panzer Lion: Grossdeutschland 1944, a long out-of-print Panzer Grenadier supplement that portrayed the division&rsquo;s actions in Romania and was superseded by Broken Axis.<br/><br/>",

Collect more office characters than your opponents and avoid being stuck with the dreaded Bad Boss.<br/><br/>The deck has 3 types of cards - Character cards which players try to pair and accumulate as many as they can, Arse cards which players use to sabotage others or to get ahead; and the Bad Boss card which everyone tries to avoid.<br/><br/>The goal is to collect as many pairs as possible while avoiding the Bad Boss card by using Arse cards to your advantage. There are 9 different types of Arse cards like Arse kisser, Lazy Arse and Smelly Arse which makes getting ahead of others hilariously funny.<br/><br/>The player that is stuck with the Bad Boss card when all the cards are players will be the loser and the player with the most pairs is declared the winner.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It is a head-to-head board game comprised of simple rules and brilliant tactics.<br/><br/>Players attempt to control the largest area on a 5 x 5 grid board using zone of control tactics. Each piece added to the board affects all the other pieces of the same color so careful placement is the key to winning the most squares and the game.<br/><br/>Motif always begins with an empty board &mdash; no pawns, all white squares.<br/><br/>On each turn:<br/><br/><br/>    Add a new pawn to any square that is reachable by your existing pawns if any.<br/>     Move your other pawns on the board. Relocate all of them if possible. Pawns can freely maneuver around other pawns in complicated trails. Diagonals and jumps are prohibited.<br/>    Turn squares into the same color as the pawn that lands on it. Pawns always leave a mark.<br/>     Play until all the squares are occupied.<br/><br/><br/>The player with the most squares in their color wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The first player to write down those words flips a 17-second timer. That player is now the fastest player, and every other player now has 17 seconds to write down their words.<br/><br/>When the timer runs out, players compare their lists of words and remove any words found by multiple players. Points are then awarded for remaining words: 1 point for each original word which moves a player's pawn on a score track. The track has 38 places and the first player who reaches the end of a scoring track is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Individual units represented are the battalion and regiment and players can do sub-unit actions such as company and squadron actions.<br/><br/>The complexity of the game is moderate, and would appeal to a player who enjoys small unit tactics and a wide latitude of unit options (within historical parameters) on the table.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Next, you&rsquo;ll arrange the cards numerically beside the current client.

Players perform the same actions as in real life: go to school and work, earn money, buy food, acquire personal property, pay utility bills.  Players all the time have to plan their income and expenses, as well as their actions during the working day, week, month.  The game helps to acquire financial decision-making skills and choose your development strategy on the path to success.<br/><br/>A player on his turn can visit from one of the three city buildings on the game board. Moving between buildings is possible both on foot and by taxi.<br/><br/>There are several types of buildings: buildings in which the player works; buildings in which the player spends earned money (shops); buildings in which the player receives improvements in personal skills (educational institutions).<br/><br/>An example of a building where the player earns money is a factory. Arriving at the factory, the player rolls a die and, depending on the result of the roll, the player receives a certain amount of money earned.<br/><br/>Gradually, the player buys more items for himself in the house. As soon as any of the players has 10 items at home, 5000 units of currency after paying off all loans and utility bills, then that player wins.<br/><br/>",

They need care and love, but unfortunately, there is not enough space in the shelter yet. Luckily, Lili and her friends - the players - are there to help! They're taking a few into their own home, and will look after them for a while until they find the best, loving owners!<br/><br/>Each player can collect care tokens (such as bathing, feeding, and playing) on their own game board, creating the perfect temporary home for one or two of the animals. But the game doesn't end there - you'll also have to find the best real owners for your pets! Once you've done that, a space on the board will open up for you to temporarily adopt another pet. Players earn points for the animals they cared for and delivered to their future owners. The player with the most points win.<br/><br/>As well as being endlessly cute and teaching responsibility in a subtle way, this game is also highly recommended because after two rounds your child won't be demanding that you take all the animals home from the shelter.

Because on each of the seven dice, one of the numbers from one to seven is missing, which gives you something extra to think about when deciding which dice to keep and which to re-roll.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Greed is a concise and fascinating eurogame from substantial developer of board games - Reiner Knizia. In addition to a good mechanic this game can show off a peculiar look styled as picture post cards of the Russian 19th century lifestyle designed by Oleg Ershov.<br/>The game is of the sort when rules understanding takes 15 minutes but mastering of playing skills requires indefinite time.<br/><br/>You will play a role of a pre-revolutionary businessman beating up among the winds of city life and trying to make money in these fickle conditions &ndash; you are not surprised, are you? Bargaining with proper people, using contacts and getting biggest profit by turning the circumstances to your own advantage.<br/>The most skilled merchant wins the game. And what is the better evidence of business success then undertaking profit? That&rsquo;s why the winning point counters look like cash notes and for the mostly successful ones &ndash; like gold bar cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Each player acquires two &ldquo;Фарт&rdquo; cards, one &ldquo;Big Фарт&rdquo; card and 10 more cards with random characters (8 cards if there are five players). Characters have positive and negative values. The first ones add the winning points, the others withdraw. &ldquo;Student&rdquo; is a special character which has a neutral, zero value. These two card types differ at the back so as to know how many &ldquo;Фарт&rdquo; cards each player has at the hand. Players shouldn&rsquo;t hide this information.<br/><br/>Define by any suitable way who will start the game. Further the turn will dispose clockwise. In your game-business action several card piles will be formed &ndash; one for each player and one in the center. Only upper cards make sense during the game.<br/><br/>Player should put a card from his hand during his turn. Cards with positive or negative values can be placed to the own pile or at the center. &ldquo;Student&rdquo; card can be placed to any pile except the one with upper &ldquo;Фарт&rdquo; or &ldquo;Big фарт&rdquo; card on it. These cards can be played only to the own card piles.<br/><br/>When you&rsquo;ve got all needed contacts and character positions at the table brings you delight and rejoicing, it&rsquo;s time to catch up a moment of gain and hit the jackpot playing &ldquo;Фарт&rdquo; or &ldquo;Big фарт&rdquo; card. It&rsquo;s placed near player&rsquo;s pile and incites the instant count of all cards values at the table. Sum up the positive values, subtract negative and acquire or lose the sum of cash notes equal to the outcome. It&rsquo;s simple! Though not as simple as it seems because all other &ldquo;Фарт&rdquo; cards at the table also work at this moment. In this case their owners are swept over the commercial tide and they get or lose the congruous sum of banknotes. If &ldquo;Big фарт&rdquo; has been played or provoked the sum of points, positive and negative as well, doubles.<br/><br/>When everyone plays all the cards the round ends. Then there can be more rounds at will. The amount of rounds can be equal to the number of players to let everyone to make the first turn for the most unbiased result.<br/><br/>Firstly, the game is logical so the word &laquo;фарт&raquo; obtains a bit different meaning then luck or risk. It can be associated with business acumen, enterprise and skill to use the chance. Remember: maybe business path loves the lucky ones but respects only gentlemen who are sober-minded and prudent.<br/><br/>",

If someone's ribbon gets tangled, they'll be out of the running!<br/><br/>Sewing Circle is a game for 2 or 3 players. Your goal is to be the player who avoids tangling their ribbon. 12 cards are placed onto the table in a circle, with the 6 remaining cards being divided evenly among the players. Each player decides which color ribbon will represent them, and the first player to choose will go first.<br/><br/>The rules are simple- keep your line unbroken. If your turn ends and your line is broken, you lose. Every turn you must flip a card in the circle face-up, then you may swap a face up-card with its neighbor, and then you may exchange any face-up card with a card in your hand.<br/><br/>To win the game, you'll have to plan your moves so that while untangling your ribbon you tangle your opponents' ribbon as well. Causing multiple tangles means they'll have to spend their turn dealing with them and can limit their options in tangling things up for you. Choosing the best cards to flip on your turn and making sure the cards in your hands have different lines on them can be important as well. If you can plan multiple steps ahead you can improve your chances even more.<br/><br/>Sewing circle also includes a solo/cooperative mode, where players must keep all three ribbons from getting tangled. If any ribbon is tangled at the end of any player's turn they all lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

How much is a &quot;day&quot;?  Well, you start on a mountaintop and begin walking.  If you come back to the mountain by sundown, you get all the land you encircle.<br/><br/>The board is a 24x32 grid.  Each player drops a small cylinder to indicate their starting location, and then draw cards (generally) to move.  Each card indicates how far and in what direction you move (your &quot;boundary&quot; is indicated by plastic cones in your color) and how much time it took--around the board, a Sun token moves from Dawn to Dusk.  When the Sun token hits Dusk, the game is over.  If you end up back on your mountain, you get points equal to the area you have enclosed (plus how many spaces are in your boundary--for the Go-enabled, it's &quot;Chinese scoring&quot;).  If you're not on your mountain, you get nothing.  If nobody is on their mountain, the Bashkirs win--just like in the story...<br/><br/>",

Players receive ten sheets at random, then try to reproduce the model by flipping the sheets and stacking them any way they like; the sheets do not have to overlap perfectly, but a player will lose points for any non-perfect overlaps. How does a player indicate which squares in his stack are to be considered the solution? Through the use of a 3x3 grid that has a thick black outline; each player has one of these in addition to the ten sheets.<br/><br/>As soon as a player recreates the model, the round ends. Each player scores one point for each square in the model that she reproduced in her image; whoever ended the round receives one bonus point, scoring 10 points (instead of nine). All players then lose one point for each row and column that &quot;sticks out&quot; from her 3x3 black-bordered grid.

There are some important differences.<br/><br/>In the building phase:  Instead of building a short section of track each turn, players buy an entire route between 2 cities.  The price of the route is determined by its length + $2.  This continues until one player has less than $50 left.  This speeds up the building phase considerably.<br/><br/>In the racing phase:  All players who compete in the race receive a share of a pot of $30.  Ties on the same number of dice rolled, split their shares of the pot.<br/><br/>Many maps for different countries have been published.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The tile-laying game Scratch House takes its inspiration from the Winchester Mystery House, a bizarre mansion in San Jose, California owned by Sarah Winchester that was added on to continuously.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>Scratch House is a multi-player solitaire tile placement game. After your home is destroyed, fairies help you build a new house. But since they will live there too, they walk around the new rooms having a good look.<br/><br/>Players take turns collecting room tiles and spells from the board and then follow a solitaire process of building and scoring. The tiles show four portals, but 0-4 exit arrows which allow the fairies to walk only one way. Players can only build off arrows, so building is always with a mind to the next walk to score points as well as keeping it legal.<br/><br/>Fairies will not walk through unfinished rooms, and rooms don't become available until the build time is spent. All the tiles have a build cost, and players add to this cost how many steps to the nearest bedroom, and how many rooms built this turn to get the final cost. This is marked on the room with tokens.<br/><br/>Then build time is taken off each room according to which season you chose on the board. If you picked Spring, you get only 1 new tile but take 3 off each build time; Summer and Autumn get you 2 tiles and 2 off build times; Winter gives you 3 tiles but only 1 off build times. This means a balance forms between your house expanding quickly, or the rooms opening quickly, but not both together. Get it wrong and you restrict the walk and the chance to score points.<br/><br/>Add to this special effects in rooms to trigger bonus VPs, teleports, repainting and so on, Feng Shui to affect the fairies, spell cards to help you gain, extra steps for reaching bedrooms, and bonuses for seasons and colours, and there's a lot going on.<br/><br/>Production quality is high, the artwork is very good and the theme and the mechanics all work together nicely. Apart from the tile selection each round though, there is zero inter-action and players are really just trying to optimise their own builds and walks each time. The first edition of the game does not include English rules (downloadable though), despite full English on the cards and game box.<br/><br/>",

On the delivery stations (beige), one of each of the eight destination tiles are placed randomly, face up.  On each of the pick-up stations (green), two passenger/freight tiles are placed randomly, face down.  Players roll a die to move (and sometimes advance the sun along its path in the sky).  As trains arrive at a pick-up station, players reveal the goods/passengers.  Sometimes, the player will load them onto their cars (limited number of cars on each train).  Sometimes, they will leave them for other players to pick up.  A player can even take a passenger part-way and leave them for another train to complete the job later.<br/><br/>The idea is to work together to see how many jobs will be completed before the game ends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Havok Skirmish Battle Set was a starter set for the short-run miniature war game Havok produced by Bluebird Toys in 1997. As well as this base set additional units &amp; even vehicles were also available in non-random booster packs.<br/><br/>The Havok Miniatures Game was intended to fill a gap in the market by posing as a cheap alternative to Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition). Unfortunately bad marketing and Bluebird Toys' financial shut-down cost the game dearly, and the line (along with the Bluebird Toys company) folded by Christmas 1997.<br/><br/>Initially sold exclusively through Argos stores, all the unit boosters had a single item code meaning customers could not purchase the specific unit boosters they desired (Argos would pick from the boosters 'at random'). At the end of the line remaining Havok boosters were sold in bulk to toy suppliers where they proved surprisingly popular, but it was already too late for the game and many new fans didn't initially realise that the game was already discontinued.<br/><br/>The game itself can be compared to a lighter, more simplistic version of Warhammer 40,000. Two or more players pick forces from three possible factions of the Havok sci-fi universe using a point system, and then battle it out across the tabletop.<br/><br/>In the game's favour the models were made of from durable plastic, pre-painted and simply slotted into their bases which were decorated with simple stickers, meaning there was no modelling or painting required.<br/><br/>The Havok Skirmish Battle Set included everything you needed to play, including a small fixed selection of miniatures, custom dice, range rulers and instructions, as well as four pieces of slot together scenery.<br/><br/>",

The primaries have just ended and up to five candidates must fight to become the winner of the general election. Whether you choose to be a punk, a Democrat, a Republican and Independent or Green party is secondary to how well you organize your campaign and come up with a lean, effective strategy to win the most votes.<br/><br/>Power to the Meeple has three main gameplay phases. First the players participate in an augmented draft where they will be selecting resources. Most resources are just what they are, face value additions to a player's coffers. Alternatively, a player can pick lower valued resources that have abilities attached to them, which brings another balance to the player's strategy. Throughout the draft (which consists of as many rounds as players) each player is required to select one issue card which will stay with the player for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>The second phase consists of each player, in turn order, deploying their five campaign tokens to the areas of the modular board they want to canvass (Urban, Estates, Eco-Buildings or Suburban areas).<br/><br/>During the third phase, tokens are revealed and the costs of the campaign are paid with the resources drafted earlier. Players who score in the top 3 positions on an area are usually awarded votes or other bonuses. Scores at individual locations are resolved by the key value comparisons printed on the areas, and the tie breakers are done according to who drafted the tie breakers such as Megaphone, Billboard, Scandal or Town Hall.<br/><br/>Once votes are counted, any money earned during that round are counted, players move up on their respective Urban, Suburban, Estate and Eco-Housing tracks, and lastly, discard all unused resources (besides money). All players also keep their issues.<br/><br/>Rounds 2 &amp; 3 are similar to the first round, with the major difference being the advantages each player may have gained in the previous round.<br/><br/>After 3 rounds the players resolve any pending end of game awards or penalties for the last bit of votes and a winner is declared.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The game is played on a 5 x 5 leather-like board and each player has four markers (we give you extra in case you lose one).<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get your four markers in one of four simple groupings: a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line, or in a square. Play begins with each player alternately placing a marker on the board. When all four markers are in place, players then take turns sliding their markers in any direction to achieve the objective. No jumping!<br/><br/>Things can change quickly; think ahead to your next move because your opponent may just slide into a winning position right under your nose! Games can last from 2 to 20 minutes depending on how crafty each player is.<br/><br/>Markers for three players fit into the round zippered pouch attached to the board.<br/><br/>This is a reboot of Teeko by John Scarne.<br/><br/>The entire board rolls up and snaps shut so you can take Zenteeko fun with you anywhere!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You have to lie to your fellow players right in the face. You have have to catch them lying. You need to remember what cards left the game - even tough cards leave the game face down! You need a strategy. You need a second strategy if the tides change. You need to organise your hand so the others won't get a read on you. There's a million tricks to learn. You need to stay calm.<br/><br/>The game is for 3 to 4 maniacs, and one lunacy lasts about 5 - 10 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But there are Corporation Cities that are not subject to him.<br/><br/>In one of those cities - Helios - one of two players take on role of Stella - daughter of deceased head of the city, and other player become Roy - successor of Stella's father. Remember: Helios can only have one ruler! Who will become it? Players only have 24 hours to determine this...<br/><br/>The struggle take place in five districts of the city. The goal of each player is to take control of more districts than his opponent. The game consists of two rounds, according to the results of which the winner is determined.<br/><br/>Players in their turns place tokens from their player boards in an attempt to earn as many Victory Points (VP) as possible. Each type of tokens(there are five of them in the game) has its own abilities and its own strength. A district is considered to be under control of player if total power of his tokens in it is greater than that of the opponent. Each controlled district in the round end is worth one VP to player.<br/><br/>But not everything is so simple. The game has 25 unique district cards that allow players to make changes on the struggle field. When player playing a card from his hand, he applies its ability and then places it on the Timer represent the hour counter.<br/><br/>As soon as the twelfth card is placed on Timer, the round ends. The game ends after second round ends. Player with most VP is winner, in case of a tie both players are loosers, and Syndicate is enslave Helios.<br/><br/>The game has an asymmetry module represented by four special Boss ability cards &mdash; the main tokens of players. Placing the Boss token on an district, the player applies its ability, which can frustrate all the opponent's plans.<br/><br/>The game can also be played in tournament mode. In this case, players do not receive points for each controlled area. Instead, player receives one victory point if he wins the round. The game lasts up to two wins of one of the players.<br/><br/>",

If you'd land on one of your own dogs, you can instead jump it and move to the next space of this color.<br/><br/>The first player to get all three dogs home wins!<br/><br/>",

But before, you are going to have to assemble the goal!<br/><br/>Los Futbol&iacute;simos is a collection of adventures, friendship, mystery and football. This game starts with a strange invitation. Los Futbol&iacute;simos are summoned to the Campo4 tournament. It is a very mysterious tournament with rules on the field of play that are very different from those known. Nothing there is what it seems. The adventure of playing with Los Futbol&iacute;simos in Campo 4 and overcoming the challenge to win the match is shared.<br/><br/>Each of the characters will have an associated action. The objective will be to have the greatest number of balls of the same color as the associated goal.<br/><br/>There will be a total of four goals, being necessary for each player to have their own to end the game. The colored balls multiply throughout the competition, going from goal to goal. The goals will not be decided until the end.<br/><br/>On each turn, you have to decide which is the best action to apply. It is also essential to know when to use certain key cards such as the free kick, the referee, the VAR... And of course you have to be flexible because the game is constantly changing.<br/><br/>",

An introductory game of observation and speed for sharp eagle eyes!<br/><br/>When all players are ready and paying attention, the active player turns over the first card in the pile and places it face up on the table. All players play at the same time and look at the card, searching for the odd one out: a small object or an animal that does not fit the theme of the scene on the card. The first player who thinks they found the odd one out places their index finger on the object and shouts its name. If the player gets it right, he wins the card and a new round begins. If the player gets it wrong, the round continues without them. To start a new round, the next player waits until everyone is ready and turns over a new card from the pile, and so on until all the cards have been turned over. The game ends when there are no more cards in the pile: the winner is whoever won the most cards!<br/><br/>",

Perhaps you're one of the heroes who has evaded the gauntlet of traps in Dragonvault; perhaps you're a pirate marauder surveying your booty in Goblins, Guns &amp; Grog; perhaps you're just a generic treasure hunter in a generic fantasy RPG. Either way, a dozen chests are now staring you in the face, tantalizing you with promise of hidden treasure, and mocking you with their intricate locking systems. Good thing you brought your lockpicks!<br/><br/>Lockpicks is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write game that takes place in the Legends of Dsyx fantasy setting. The game picks up where most others end, with the hero surveying their acquired treasure. Now, the challenge is to open as many as possible of twelve chests and find the best prizes inside. Chests consist of small grids with start points, end points, and a number of waypoints, each of which must be activated in order to unlock the treasure. Each turn, the player picks one chest and rolls five dice. Each number corresponds to one type of movement based on units in chess. Beginning at the start point, the player must utilize the dice in any order to navigate the grid, activate each waypoint, and end at the finishing point. Upon successful completion of a puzzle, the player may roll a die to select one of several treasures, each of which may give just give points or even assist in the unlocking of more loot.<br/><br/>Time is running out, however, and if the player doesn't unlock all the chests before the time track fills up entirely, each additional turn runs the risk of alerting the guards/dragon/merchant/anyone and causing the player to lose ALL their prized possessions.<br/><br/>Good job beating whatever game you were playing; now, play Lockpicks to find out what happens after the credits have rolled. Will you be rich as a king, or as poor as you started?<br/><br/><br/>Released in the November 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

Beware, or pirates will steel your gold coins, even before you have made your first move towards finding the treasure of Lame Max, the notorious pirate king of ancient times. The treasure of Lame Max was not lost when his ship was sunk. Scattered across the playing field are old coins, which you should try to gather and keep safe from competing pirates! It is your goal to retrieve most of Max&rsquo;s treasure and become the next Pirate king.<br/><br/>The pirate game is intended to stimulate counting, comparing and playing together for children at a young age. The different game variants are constructed in such a way that the game follows the development stages of the children in the period between ages 3 and 9, for children interested in board games a crucial time. Whereas the younger players depend on a simple game structure and a relatively short playing time, they gradually develop towards a stage where they will want to have control over the game development, their progress as well as that of their opponents. In fact they desire that their own strategic insight can make the difference between winning or losing. In the most elaborate game variant the Pirate game is a challenge even for grown ups!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player begins with a set of eight d8s* in the same color. Three gray d8s that belong to no player are rolled first and are not re-rolled for the remainder of the round. Then, the remaining dice are rolled, and each player must freeze at least one of his dice. The non-gray, non-frozen dice are re-rolled, and each player again must freeze at least one more die. The round ends either when all players' dice are frozen or when the dice have been rolled four times.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, a player scores no points unless he has rolled three dice that match the face values on the gray dice. If his dice have matched, then his score is the sum of the face values on his five other dice. Another round begins, and play continues until a player reaches 150 points.<br/><br/><br/>    Note: in the Stones Ultimate version, the game play is the same, but the players&rsquo; eight dice are different: two d12, three d8, and three d6. This makes for more interesting game play trying to match the three numbers on the grey d8s. <br/><br/><br/>",

Intended for use in homes, classrooms, museums, and other science programs.<br/><br/>Based loosely on Go Fish, the goal is for players to collect as many sets of closely related animals as possible. The sets are &quot;clades&quot; of closely-related animals on the evolutionary tree board, which players use for reference. Players take turns asking another player for cards, and if they do not have a matching card, they say &quot;Go Extinct!&quot;. The gameplay is more strategic than Go Fish because players can ask either for a specific card or a matching card at any level of the tree hierarchy, thus trading off the specificity of the result for the likelihood of a match.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be fast-paced and fun, while familiarizing players with different animal species, common classifying traits, and the 'nested sets' nature of the evolutionary tree.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game of the 1930s bank-robbing gangster era --Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde and the rest.  Each player attempts to put together a gang and to accumulate the most money.  Besides your starting random allotment of gangsters, you can recruit from the deck, other players' gangs or the jail.  Some gangsters have natural affinities for each other; if you manage to put together a &quot;compatible&quot; gang, the victory condition is lowered for you and the gang gets a bonus when pulling off jobs.<br/><br/>Jobs are resolved by rolling a varying number of dice (depending on the job's difficulty) against your gang's total in Cunning, Charm and/or Combat.  Success garners Loot Chits, which are mostly money but also include bonuses to Cunning (to assign to a gangster).  Gangster Leaders allow you to draw more action cards; Molls allow you to draw more recruits.  Some action cards are starred; this means they are resolved immediately --sometimes to your detriment.<br/><br/>The game does a good job of recreating the hectic life of the bank-robbers of the era, constantly on the run from one state to another.  The artwork and components are crude, but that's forgivable.<br/><br/>",

The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The main German offensive, dubbed the Sichelschnitt (razor cut), struck through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest. The Germans quickly broke through the Allied main line of defense along the Meuse River at Sedan and Dinant.<br/><br/>German Tank and mechanized forces, led by General Erwin Rommel's 7th Panzer Division, were boldly sent racing towards the English Channel to cut the Allied forces in half. The Allies launched a desperate counter-attack against the now strung-out and vulnerable German spearhead near the town of Arras.

Each hand played requires one more card than the last for its initial meld.  The object of each hand is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards.  After making your initial meld, you layoff [sic] cards on any meld in play in order to get rid of your cards and go out.  Special decks of cards are used which includes [sic] 6 wild cards called &quot;Swirls&quot;.  The winner of each hand scores the value of all the cards that remain in the hands of the opponents.&quot;<br/><br/>From the credits:<br/>Ultimate Rummy is based upon a version of Rummy known as Contract Rummy.  People may know Contract Rummy by different names, such as Joker Rummy, King Rummy, Progressive Rummy or Shanghai Rummy.  What they all have in common is a fixed number of deals, with each deal having a prefixed goal.  Ultimate Rummy is not so much a creation of one individual, as it is a perfection of the Rummy games that have preceded it.  We therefore must give credit to all the players who over the years have added their own nuances in seeking to achieve the 'ultimate' rummy game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It is a game based on small unit operations so that large battles cannot take place within the context of these rules. [...]<br/><br/>There are two different scales used in Space Marines, in effect, there are two different games here. The basic game uses a time scale of twenty seconds per turn and a normal ground scale of one inch equaling twenty-five meters. In the 'skirmish' rules the time scale is ten seconds per turn and a ground scale of one inch equaling 12.5 meters. The basic scale assumes that the players will have a significant number of figures on the table, possibly ten to twenty per player. The skirmish rules are intended for very small numbers of figures per player, no more than two or three under normal circumstances. The skirmish rules are almost entering into role-playing, although they do not constitute a full role playing system, just a combat system. [...]<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Strike North. Japan vs. the Soviet Union, 1941<br/><br/>Strike North presumes that Imperial Japan has decided to invade the Soviet Union in 1941, instead of going to war with the United States. Conceptually, a Japanese invasion of the Soviet Union would be in conjunction with the German attack on the USSR (Operation Barbarossa) on 22 June, 1941. The strategic possibilities of this alternative course are incredible; The Soviets will be under the pressure of fighting a two-front war. However, by following this strategy, the Japanese would be temporarily abandoning their planned invasions of the resource regions of the East Indies and beyond, leaving Japan less than a half-year of oil to sustain their war effort.<br/>The map shows Northeast Asia as it was in 1941, with each hex on the map equaling roughly 37 miles (60 kilometers) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents one month of operations. The units are brigades, divisions and corps.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After capturing Vera Cruz and routing Santa Anna at Cerro Gordo in the spring, Winfield Scott&rsquo;s US Army was poised to strike at Mexico City. Boldly cutting himself loose from his supply line&mdash;as Cortes had done three centuries earlier&mdash;Scott embarked upon a risky campaign: He had only slender political support; a single reverse&mdash;or an inordinately bloody victory&mdash;might have spelled the end of his campaign. Instead of an assault on Mexican fortifications east of the capital, Scott circled to the south where large lakes and a lava bed (the Pedregal) gave him numerous approach routes. The Mexicans quickly moved to block him, fortifying the most obvious routes, but they neglected to man the Pedregal itself, thinking it impassable to large units. The US forces, led by an excellent set of engineer officers, repeatedly found paths through the morass. But the US army was roughly half the size of the Mexican army and necessarily was divided. A resolute Mexican attack at the proper moment could have led to the destruction of Scott&rsquo;s army.<br/><br/>Pedregal uses the Musket &amp; Saber system to accurately portray warfare during the Mexican War. All the primary facets of the muzzle-loading era are included. The combat system rewards intuitive play without the need for rifle-counting. There are substantial differences between infantry, artillery, and cavalry: Infantry, tough and resilient, bear the brunt of battle. Artillery can smash attacks or open holes in enemy lines, but is vulnerable and brittle. Cavalry is weak in stand-up combat, but crucial for pursuit and the occasional charge against a broken foe. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time, so players must maintain reserves. Leader provide an important supplement to unit capabilities, and armies must protect their headquarters and logistical tail or risk deterioration of their mobility and combat power.<br/><br/>Winning a battle depends upon deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.<br/><br/>",

Act it out...But DON'T SAY IT!<br/><br/>You Don't Say is the hilarious, high-energy guessing game where fast talkers team with fast guessers to win!<br/><br/>Get your teammates to guess words based on your clues, without saying the words. The more they answer correctly, the father you move on the board.<br/><br/>With six world-encompassing categories and 3000 simple-to-challenging words, YOU DON'T SAY is fast-talking, quick-moving fun for everyone! 500 Cards! 3000 Words!<br/><br/>",

Wrestling, players each take the role of an intergalactic pro wrestling superstar and battle it out with over-the-top moves in hopes of being the last wrestler standing!<br/><br/>Players start off by assembling their unique hand of 6 maneuver cards, which they will use as their arsenal in the battle ahead. Players also position their wrestlers on a &quot;Ring&quot;, which will become an important part of their assault, as where they and their opponent are in the ring at any given time could equal some BIG damage opportunities...if you play your moves right!<br/><br/>Played over the course of rounds, each round starts with a &quot;Lock-Up&quot; in order to determine who will start with the offensive edge. After the Lock-Up, each player then position their maneuver cards as &quot;Offense&quot; or &quot;Defense&quot; depending on who won the Lock-Up. One by one, players reveal their face down maneuver cards to see if the player on Defense was able to correctly guess what type of maneuver their opponent played. If they guess correctly, the opponent's maneuver is countered and the Defensive player now goes on the Offense! If they guessed wrong, the player on Offense gets to execute their maneuver!<br/><br/>Maneuvers become more and more deadly the further along in a combo they are, so do your best to juke and jive your Defensive opponent to get the most out of your combo! The wrestlers themselves get more deadly as well! Once a wrestler's stamina goes below 1/2, they get to add their super effective Finishing Maneuver card to their arsenal to help turn the tide of battle!<br/><br/>",

Each card represents a major discovery, innovation or breakthrough in our history. Most discoveries are based on earlier discoveries, called prerequisites, and open the way to new discoveries.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to earn the most points, by making discoveries and starting new eras. All the discoveries cards are placed in the common discovery tree, which is constructed together by all the players and organized by eras. A discovery card can be placed in the discovery tree only if all its prerequisites are already there, or if it has no prerequisite.<br/><br/>Discovery is a flexible and evolving game universe which allows you, with a single deck of cards to play different types of games. Discovery can be played as a solitary game or with up to 9 players, between humans only or with automatons (virtual players), in teams or individually, with simple fast 5-mins games or complex longer ones (&gt;1hr). Adults and children, beginners and experts, all can play together by adjusting the game difficulty and relative player strength.<br/><br/>In Discovery Simple, each player receives 5 cards and plays in turn. During your turn you can place one or more cards from your hand. If you don't, you must discard one card. You can also liberate cards from other players&rsquo; discards (but not from your own). The game ends when a player places his last cards. The winner is the player who has earn most points. Points are earn by placing or liberating cards, inaugurating new eras.<br/><br/>In Discovery Flash, all players select the cards they want to play at the same time, and then place them in turn. This creates a strong element of risk and suspense, as your outcome will depend on the selection made by the other players.<br/><br/>Discovery Battle is a more complex game in which each card has specific attributes which allow you to attack your opponents, capture loot, make alliances, etc.<br/><br/>",

First level is to figure out what the plate is supposed to say; HELOAGN = Hello Again. Second level adds a second element by asking for more information that the plate could be indicating; Sports plate GONFSHN = &quot;Gone Fishin'&quot; and is a fisherman, Hobby / Occupation plate ICLICK = &quot;I Click&quot; and is a photographer. Third level is used for the final challenge to win, and is the same as the second level but doesn't give the category. The player must decipher the plate, figure out the category and how the plate applies to that category. For more excitement the board has hazard squares to slow you down on your trip.<br/>This is a great game, and with 575 different plates, it provides hours of fun for any group.<br/><br/>",

The Allies need to take ground, but they must be careful not to spook the Germans into blowing the radio station before they can capture it.<br/><br/>Units stacked with a leader are deployed on a hidden unit display and a traditional odds ratio CRT is used.  As the units present in this campaign are inexperienced, casualties are quite heavy in combat, with one side generally being wiped out.  An attack can be modified for the presence of entrenchments, machine guns or artillery, all of which played a role in the battle, and a successful attacker can see his units advance and attack again in the same period.<br/><br/>Each hex is 15 miles, each game turn is two to three days (there are nine turns in total) and each unit is a platoon, company, combat group, artillery section or machine gun section.<br/><br/>",

Now they&rsquo;ve run out of room so they have taken to dumping the bodies down the sewer (out of sight out of mind). You, enterprising 3rd Class Sewer Engineers (Plungers), see a chance to make some fast money and solve the corpse clog threatening to overwhelm the existing system. At a quiet back door behind the Treatment Plant a line of customers queue up for the bits and pieces you have on offer. Deliver them the right parts, aged to the right amount of time and you&rsquo;ll receive your reward.<br/><br/>Needed to play: The deck of 27 cards<br/>10 eurocubes in each of 4 colors for the body parts (white for Bones, brown for Organs, gray for Brains and red for Hearts) and 9 black eurocubes for the rats<br/>1 eurocube marker in each of 2 other colors to keep track of player scores on the Gore Track<br/>1 large bag [or an old sock] (the Bag O&rsquo; Parts) to hold all the body parts, 10 small ziplock bags to act as body bags in the game and 1 four-sided die<br/><br/>Setup: Place the 4 Sewer Pipe cards,  Gore Track, and the score markers between the Plungers (players).<br/>Shuffle the customer deck and deal 2 customers to each Plunger, placing the rest in a face down draw pile known as &ldquo;The Queue&rdquo;, next to the Sewer Pipe. Each plunger should place their customers face up in front of them.<br/>Shuffle the tool deck and deal 3 tools to each Plunger that they will use as their initial hand of cards. The remaining tool cards will be placed in a tool card draw deck next to The Queue.<br/>Place the body bags within reach of both Plungers. Each Plunger should take 1 body bag for each customer they have during the game. Lastly place all the body parts and rats in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Adding new body parts<br/>Roll 1d4 and add that value to the number of waiting customers in front of them. The Plunger will then blind draw that number of body parts from the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. Shift all existing body parts towards The Clog to make room for the incoming body parts. Rats will never move. Set aside any body parts that are shifted off of the Day 3 card into a reserve pile. Place the new body parts in the order they are drawn on the Sewer Pipe cards beginning from the rightmost space on the Day 1 card. If any rats are drawn they will be placed on the Rat spaces beginning from the far left of the Day 3 card. Any body part occupying a Rat space where a Rat will be placed, during this phase, will be removed and tossed back into the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.<br/><br/>Roll 1d4 and place that many reserved Day 3 parts on The Clog card spaces, tossing the rest back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Filling orders<br/>Each customer card lists the number of parts required to fill the order.<br/><br/>To fill an order a Plunger must choose all of any of 1 type of body parts on any one Sewer card (meeting the desired aging requirement) placing those parts in the customer&rsquo;s body bag. Any extra body parts not needed for the orders go back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. Plungers may use the body parts to attempt to fill 1, 2 or more customer orders as long as the body parts are of the desired type and aging. If a customer&rsquo;s complete order is filled the Plunger scores the money value, indicated in the lower right corner of the customer card, on the Gore Track. All body parts from this order are then tossed back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. A new customer is then drawn from The Queue.<br/><br/>Tool Cards: Each Plunger may use one of their tool cards at any point during their turn. Once played, the card will be placed on a discard pile next to the tool card draw pile and a new card is drawn.<br/><br/>Game End: The game ends in one of two ways:<br/>a. The Clog card has become full of body parts. In this case, the current Plunger finishes their turn and any final scoring is marked.<br/>b. All 10 customers have had their orders filled.<br/><br/>The Plunger who has earned the most money is declared the winner and receives a promotion to 2nd Class Sewer Engineer.<br/><br/>This game can be played solo as well.

        "description": "Dragons Arena is a two-player strategy and confrontation game using dice. However, it is accessible from 8 years old thanks to its clever implementation and the simplicity of its rules... But do not be fooled by this apparent simplicity, because the most experienced players are still likely to rack their brains and will take a lot of fun!<br/><br/>An abstract game with dice, for two players ! Strategic, smart, original and accessible from 8 years in the world of dragons...<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The two opponents play in turn.<br/>In turn, the attacking species must eliminate an enemy dragon with one of its adjacent dragons. It is also necessary that the dragon powers allow it. In most cases, a dragon can eliminate an enemy dragon if the latter has a strictly lower value.<br/>Special case: a dragon with a power of ￼1 is the only one who can eliminate dragons with a power of 6 !<br/>The dragon used then takes the PLACE AND POWER of the dragon it has just eliminated.<br/><br/>If a species cannot eliminate any enemy dragon but has at least one dragon adjacent to an enemy dragon, it must, instead of eliminating a dragon, modify the power of the dragon of its choice (of its species or of its opponent).<br/>Once the dragon&rsquo;s power has been modified, it places a force field (symbolized by the &laquo;square frame&raquo;) around the dragon concerned, on the square. It is impossible to change the power of a dragon surrounded by a force field. This force field disappears if the dragon changes boxes to eliminate an enemy <br/>dragon or if it is eliminated itself.<br/><br/>The turn is completed at the end of one of these two actions (Eliminate an enemy dragon or Modify the power of a dragon of your choice).<br/><br/>The duel ends if there is no dragon left adjacent to an enemy dragon after a game turn OR if all remaining dragons are surrounded by a force field and the attacking species cannot eliminate an enemy dragon. The duel then ends immediately.<br/>We then add up the power of the dragons left for each species. The most powerful one wins the duel!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

We don&rsquo;t think so. Simply throw and collide your squishy foam dice to roll the highest score each round and win all the cards in the asteroid field. You must choose a dice from the middle of the table, but if you pick the same as someone else, then battle it out to see who gets that dice and who loses their card!<br/><br/><br/>How to play: Place all the giant squishy dice in the center of the table and take your deck of cards. Secretly choose which dice card you want to play, and on the count of 3 reveal it to the other players. Grab the dice you chose and prepare to roll them! If anyone matches their cards, you brawl with the chosen dice.The last player hit will gain their opponent&rsquo;s cards and the losers have to choose from the leftover dice. Now everyone rolls their dice in turn - starting with the D20 and down to the D6 with the highest number winning. But watch out for the special cards! Losteroid cards are blackholes that will suck all the cards away in the round and reduce your score if you end up with one in your score pile. Play your &quot;I Can&rsquo;t Diecide&quot; card if you&rsquo;re not sure which dice to choose or as part of your dice game strategy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At Neuve Chapelle provides a tactical re-play of the World War I battle. The British attempted to reduce a poorly-defended German salient centered on the town of Neuve Chapelle. Plans were to expand a breakthrough and with cavalry and infantry reserves take the Aubers ridge line. However, poor communication and coordination and the weather conspired to slow the initial British successes and allowed the German army to rush reinforcements into the area. Among other game features, designer Michael W. Kennedy uses offensive artillery and defensive artillery fire, British command checks, and a unique assault combat mechanic to simulate the bloody struggle. (Sourced from the White Dog Games website.)<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of 14 turns which represent the three days of The Battle of Neuve Chapelle. Each day is divided into four turns with a separate night turn in between. During the day turns, both sides will fire artillery (weather permitting), move, and attack. During the night turns, both sides will dig in new trenches on the new front lines.<br/><br/>The game simulates early trench warfare and makes prominent use of artillery and the defensive advantages of trenches. Weather conditions and British communications among the four divisions are determined randomly each turn. Each assault phase contains a defensive artillery and defensive combat phase, making defense a major component of the game.<br/><br/>There are several hexes that have victory point values. The British win by controlling as many of these hexes as possible. The Germans win by preventing the British from achieving this objectives.<br/><br/>",

By sending Minions into battle of course!<br/><br/>The funny folks at Cloud Kingdom games bring you a fantasy card game where each player becomes a Minor Deity.  The object of the game is to get the most Glory.  The trouble is that, ever since that &ldquo;Atlantis Incident,&rdquo; deities are no longer allowed to directly affect the material world.  The only way to get the glory is to send your adoring Minions out to do battle in your stead.<br/><br/>Each player controls eight amusing minions who are sent out to strive against the minions of your opponents.  The battleground is defined and, based on your minions&rsquo; attributes, you choose the best &ldquo;ahem&rdquo; man for the job.  You can then grant your minion a Boon to help him succeed.  At this point a combination of daring and luck may bring you the glory.  Dice are rolled.  Points are tallied.  Only one Minion will emerge to shower glory on their master.  Will it be you?<br/><br/>This game contains all the cards and components for a two player game and takes about 20 minutes to play, ages 10 and up.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pig Wars is a skirmish-level miniatures wargame set in the Dark Ages: after the Fall of Rome, before the Norman conquest of England.  Each figure represents one person.<br/><br/>Each player controls one &quot;unit&quot; of 20 figures and is given one 52-card deck of ordinary playing cards, which are used instead of dice in this game.  Each unit has one chit (or 3x5 card) used to determine activation randomly in a given turn.<br/><br/>Units are distinguished by a bar of color on the base: since ten players can be playing at once, and there are no uniforms in that era, this is important.  A number of stripes (from 0 to 3) on the color bar shows the morale level of the figure, from militia to average to proven veteran to elite veteran (leader).  This is important both in melee combat and morale checks.<br/><br/>Pigs are a frequent goal of a given scenario, hence the name of the game.  In fact, different units are given different objectives in a raid scenario, though things don't always work out the way one intends ... it can get a bit chaotic.<br/><br/>Cards are used to determine all random events: missile fire, combat, rallying, morale checks, etc.  The system is very easy to understand and there is very little in terms of a player aid needed.  The only downside to the card method is that a player goes through his entire deck before reshuffling, and if he notices all the good cards have been used early, it may change his tactics half way through the game as he becomes more conservative ...<br/><br/>Overall, a good light system, more for &quot;fun&quot; gaming than serious gaming.<br/><br/>",

Brewing more coffee than the opposing team is the winning condition of this game.<br/><br/>In Torite Co, players will always be divided into two teams. If you play with 4 or more people, you may not know know who your teammate is (due to identity concealment).<br/><br/>Therefore, you can unintentionally help the opposing team, or there may also be situations where teammates drag each other down.<br/><br/>In addition to the identity concealment element, in the case of 4 and 5 players, it can be an irregular team structure (1 to 3 or 2 to 3). If it becomes one-on-three, it may be difficult to win on one side, but the sense of accomplishment when you win will be higher than when you win 2 vs 2&hellip;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>The 3 main wrinkles of this game:<br/><br/>The secret teammate component is similar to Doppelkopf where the &ldquo;part-time leader&rdquo; calls out a specific card to indicate that the player with that card is now on their team (this player does not have to reveal who they are). The leader also chooses the Trump suit for the round.<br/><br/>Tricks can be worthless or count for multiple points, as only  Coffee Cards (8-A) count for points.<br/><br/>2 is considered the highest number (still lower than A and T) when the trick is entirely comprised of the same suit.<br/><br/>",

In the beginning of each round, each player takes one of the Action tokens in his/her hands, and places it, face down, on the playing surface in front of him/her. Then, all players turn over their tokens simultaneously and take an action: either grabbing some Food from a Hen House (i.e. Eat), or exercising to trim down a bit<br/>(i.e. Lose Weight).<br/><br/>Each player has two goals in this game: first, getting a balanced diet by obtaining a variety of different Food cards &ndash; the wider the variety and the more the Food cards a player gets, the better the score; at the same time, each player should try to avoid getting marked Chubby whenever the Farm Owner makes an inspection to identify candidates for his Thanksgiving turkey dinner. At each inspection, the chubbiest turkey (as indicated by the highest number of Food cards held) will be given Chubby Markers. When Thanksgiving comes around, the turkey with the most Chubby Markers will be sent to the dinner table!<br/><br/>At the end of Thanksgiving, the survival turkey with the highest score wins!

Thousands of books published around the world rely on only one source: the account by the Greek philosopher Plato, who wrote of it around 350 BC.<br/><br/>On the island of Atlantis, there was the capital city of the same name in the center along with nine other cities. The island was divided among the ten sons of Poseidon and Clito.<br/><br/>Although the island thrived for hundreds of years, it eventually declined into tyranny and immorality. Eventually Zeus sank the island with earthquakes and floods in a single day.<br/><br/>To win the game, the players struggle for the crown of Atlantis. The winner is the player who succeeds in entering the temple of Poseidon in the very heart of Atlantis with his crown. He becomes the new king of all Atlantis. This attack must happen as quickly as possible before the island sinks.<br/><br/>",

The first part of the name &quot;Daruma&quot; is the name of the doll (usually the face of a angry-looking Japanese samurai-like guy, but also can be friendly looking, depends on the artist who draws the face),&quot;Otoshi&quot; means &quot;to drop&quot;.<br/><br/>This traditional Japanese game requires a good eye and fast reflexes. The purpose of the game is to knock the center pieces out with the hammer without causing the doll on top to fall over. The doll on top is called daruma; he represents the Buddhist priest Bodhidharma who is said to have lost the use of his arms and legs after meditating for nine years. Today daruma are used as a charm for the fulfillment of a special wish, for example, passing the entrance exam to high school or winning an election. The character written on this darumas belly reads gfuku,h or good fortune. Japanese children can play with daruma otoshi when they are alone by seeing how many blocks they can knock out before daruma topples over. They may also play it with friends and take turns until someone causes daruma to fall over.<br/><br/>Usually made of solid wood.<br/><br/>",

One of the players (nobody else knows who) has the Bottled Imp card. The number of cards they are permitted to hold is denoted by their 'Life Dice', it begins at 5, but can go up or down from 2 to 7.<br/><br/>In each round players get a turn to lay any number of one type of card, then draw back up to their allotted hand size.

This happens 8 times, recorded on a D8, then the game is over.

As the Solstice approaches, three Wizards break ground on what they're sure will be... Well, it will be a tower anyway.<br/><br/>Tower of Mages is a dice game for one player. Each of your three dice represents a scatterbrained wizard with a short attention span. Over the course of the game they will be working together to build a tower to gather elemental energies, convert them into valuable spells, and to predict and manipulate the spell market.<br/><br/>The game uses a sort-of-rondel mechanic. You roll your dice and choose which order to play them in. Each time you use a die, you count down the list of tower segments, starting at the last segment built.<br/><br/>There is also a market speculation aspect, all Elements begin at a value of -2. As the game progresses, you will roll dice to see how values grow and fall. To make the best of this, you can build high value rooms, destroy negatively valued rooms, cap towers to score them early, and gain rerolls to adjust the outcomes of the market.<br/><br/>All you need to play is the PDF, three standard dice and a pencil.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the January 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

Imagine if Guess Who and Red Flags had a spooky baby. That would be this game!<br/><br/>One player will be acting as a Ghost, looking to get a little lively with the living.  They will draw a Ghost Profile card and learn their secret identity before shuffling it with 7 other profile cards and placing them face up on the table in view of all players in a 2 x 4 grid. All the other players will be acting as Mediums looking to be the first to correctly guess the ghost player&rsquo;s identity from among the 8 face up Ghost Profile cards on the table. They will do this by asking the Ghost player questions using S&eacute;ance cards.<br/><br/>However, the Ghost has a hard time communicating across the veil and will be restricted in how they share their information based on the s&eacute;ance performed. The types of s&eacute;ances may require the ghost to knock their answers, use charades, make faces, or use non-verbal sounds to clue the mortal morsels in to their identity. There are limited chances to perform these rituals and if you take too long, the Ghost thinks you're playing games and the round will end.<br/><br/>When a Medium thinks they know who the Ghost is they can tap the card on the board.  If they tap correctly, they successfully hooked up and both they and the Ghost score a point.  If they tap the wrong Ghost, they have made an awkward misjudgment and won't be able to guess again this round.<br/><br/>Then the Medium to the left of the Ghost becomes the next Ghost and play continues in this manner until someone has 5 points and is declared the winner!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

(No bonus.)<br/>Teamwork: If an Active Ninja targets his teammate&rsquo;s locked Hourglasses with a Fortune, he can use the Fortune to remove one Hourglass (the Fortune can&rsquo;t be used for anything else that roll). You can revive a ninja who has run out of time.<br/>Once on your turn, you may give a Skill Die to your partner. They can&rsquo;t give it back and they can&rsquo;t lend you one afterwards.  They roll that die in addition to their other dice for the rest of the turn.<br/>Scores are kept as a team.<br/>Kage Dice (expansion content): Can target any dice. Awesome! (Hourglasses still lock to chosen ninja.)<br/>Your Team&rsquo;s Turn: Choose a pair of Locations from the same set. (You do not need to choose the same set each Round.) You will try to defeat one Location Card while your partner tries to defeat the other. Roll the number of House Dice in the black box and add the icons and rules on the card to create your House.You each roll Skill Dice simultaneously, but keep them separate. Skill Dice you roll only count towards your House. <br/>Your partner can choose not to roll while you roll.You can keep rolling if your partner is out of time.<br/><br/>Not Your Turn: Choose an Active Ninja to roll against; your Hourglasses don&rsquo;t affect the other Active Ninja this turn. Roll Threat Dice each time your chosen Active Ninjas rolls Skill Dice.<br/>If there is more than one Inactive team, ninjas on the same team have to be on the same location. If you&rsquo;re the only one rolling against an Active Ninja, roll an additional Threat Die (not a Kage Die).<br/>Ending Your Turn: Both ninjas must run away or collect coin rewards at the same time. A Ninja with 4 Hourglasses must stop rolling and collects no reward, even if she beat the House.<br/><br/>",

All five white and black dice begin the game on their respective sides. You can win the game one of two ways:<br/><br/><br/>     Move one die of your color to the opponents goal (This area is behind the starting line)<br/>     Have all five of your dice on top of the other opponents.<br/><br/><br/>On your turn you must move one of your dice to any orthagonal or diagonal space adjacent to this die. You may move your die on top of one or two (stacked dice). This means you will then create a stack of two or three, unless the space was empty.  You may not create a stack of four. You can also move your cube on top of any stack to an adjacent space.<br/><br/>It takes 5-10 minutes per game, but the moves demand much attention and cleverness.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gess is a chess-like two-player abstract that is played with a Go-Ban (that is, a go set), although it uses the squares formed by the grid rather than the intersections of the grid, and the squares around the outside edge of the board are not used. Thus, you play the game on an 18&times;18 grid.<br/><br/>The 'pieces' are 3&times;3 patterns of go stones, with each possible pattern of stones representing a different type of piece, each of which moves in a different way.  Rather than the pieces remaining the same throughout the game, however, a player can use any 3&times;3 portion of the board that contains at least one of his stones and none of his opponent's stones.  This means that two pattern-pieces can move near each other, and then portions of each of the original pieces can be moved away together as a different piece, leaving behind the remainder of the original formations, which can, in turn, be used as other pieces.<br/><br/>If a piece moves in such a way that it overlaps one or more stones (of either player), all stones that the piece moves onto are captured.<br/><br/>Each player must maintain one piece that is a ring of eight stones around an empty square at all times.  If one player is in a position where he no longer has such a ring anywhere on the board for any reason, he loses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Nomination Whist variant that is played with an odd deck of cards. The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which <br/>count as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a<br/>bonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score<br/>20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end<br/>of a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each<br/>player uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,<br/>this suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off<br/>here between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.<br/>However, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away <br/>a high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has <br/>been determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.<br/>This gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.<br/><br/>",

To prove that you are old enough for an undercover mission, you are going to find the most secret room in your superhero house. And Elp &mdash; your Electronic home assistant &mdash; is always ready to help you out with a hint or put you on the right track.<br/><br/>Kid&rsquo;s Quest. Mission &lsquo;Cookies&rsquo; is an exciting tabletop quest designed specifically for children. Open new locations, solve unique puzzles and complete your mission, relying not only on your smarts but on your senses as well. Learn more about the character's family and watch the story unfold as you play.<br/><br/>This is a tabletop quest in the form of two fold-out envelopes. The players are not allowed to unfold them immediately. Read the story page by page until you come across a puzzle. Use logic, good reasoning and sometimes your senses to solve each puzzle. If you are stuck, you can always look up a hint or solution with a short explanation of the puzzle. Do not open new pages unless you are instructed to do so. Usually, you'll need to solve a puzzle in order to turn over a page. As soon as you reach the page stating &quot;To be continued...&quot; or &quot;The End&quot;, you have successfully finished the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This expansion contains two new captains, eight new galaxy tiles, two new discovery story arcs, and expands the story arcs from the base game to four acts from their previous three. Each of these elements further enriches the story within the Emergence Event universe.<br/><br/>Players seek to explore and control locations in the galaxy, but now the Markarians have arrived. The Markarians' arrival places the players in danger. This danger is represented by a new encounter deck that adds variety and difficult choices to the game. These encounters with the Markarians must be overcome for players to have a chance at victory when the Markarian Dreadnought arrives.<br/><br/>The Awakening expansion offers a variety of new galaxy tiles with special rules. These new galaxy tiles require players to adjust their strategy if they wish to unlock the secrets held within them.<br/><br/>Made up of modular tiles, the galaxy itself, and many of the elements within, is very different each and every time you play Emergence Event. The Awakening expansion allows for even greater replayability as players develop the story of their own species as they prepare themselves for the upcoming invasion.<br/><br/>",

By the eve of the Great War full fleets of these vessels faced each other across the narrow European seas, ready to fight for domination of the open ocean.<br/><br/>In an integrated combat system the game covers shell strengths, immune zones, armor placement, gun ranges, and angle of incoming shot without resort to complicated calculations. Detailed rules on movement, command, and other vital factors complete the game. 400 unit counters are included to cover every European, American, &amp; Japanese dreadnought of the period.&quot;<br/><br/>Scenarios include Dogger Bank, Jutland, and hypothetical battles.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Line of Battle (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

It was a runner-up for the Changing Landscapes design competition sponsored by Mesomorph Games.<br/><br/>IceFloe uses a piecepack set, piecepack pyramids, and a candle (or another easily accessible incendiary device) for its components.  The game board consists of piecepack tiles that are placed suit-side up; each representing an ice floe.  One player is selected to be the torch bearer and is given the candle.  Game play is broken up into phases.  During the movement phase, starting with the torch bearer, players take turns either moving a game board tile, or moving one of their own pyramids.  After movement, a voting phase takes place, accompanied by a comment period that allows some limited negotiation.  Players vote on which floe is to be blown up by the torch bearer, with the torch bearer being the tie-breaker.  Any pieces on the selected floe are removed from the game.  Often, multiple players will have pieces on a single ice floe, so short term alliances may form during voting.<br/><br/>Complete rules are free to download from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://piecepack.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://piecepack.org</a><br/><br/>Not to be confused with:  Ice Flow<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the company that brought you the &quot;How To Host A Murder&quot; series comes a series of games that are geared towards 2 players.  There are 3 themes to choose from in the &quot;How To Host A Romantic Evening&quot; series: Tropical Paradise, Roman Holiday, and Parisian Night.<br/><br/>From the back of the box: &quot;In her best-selling book, Light His Fire, author Ellen Kreidman shares the secrets of how to keep romance and excitement alive in a relationship.  Those principles were the inspiration for this unique evening of entertainment for two.  How To Host A Romantic Evening-TM is more than a game --- it is an event in which two people rediscover the excitement and attraction that may be forgotten in day-to-day routines.&quot;<br/><br/>From the &quot;Host's Guide&quot;: &quot;Object: players move around the board by correctly answering the 'Knowledge' or 'Imagination' questions.  When a player lands on a space and answers a question correctly, they keep the card.  Five cards can be redeemed for a Light His/Her Fire Certificate of the player's choice.  The first player to collect 3 certificates wins.&quot;<br/><br/>Of course, in a game like this, both players are ultimately winners!<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>-1 game box<br/>-1 game board containing 2 &quot;Start&quot; spaces, 12 &quot;Imagination&quot; spaces, 12 &quot;Knowledge&quot; spaces, and 4 &quot;If possible, take one card from your partner&quot; spaces<br/>-1 &quot;Host's Guide&quot; containing a note from Ellen Kreidman, an introduction, a list of game contents, guides for planning the evening, setting a romantic mood, and costuming, food, drink and dessert recipes, instructions for playing the game, and 18 tips from Ellen Kreidman &quot;on adding romance to your life every day&quot;.<br/>-1 advertisement/mail order product sheet<br/>-1 booklet containing 12 &quot;Light His/Her Fire Certificates&quot; which can be redeemed by the winners at a later date<br/>-1 invitation made up to look like a passport<br/>-1 envelope to go with the passport invitation<br/>-24 &quot;Knowledge&quot; cards<br/>-24 &quot;Imagination&quot; cards<br/>-1 white, six-sided die<br/>-1 purple glass playing stone<br/>-1 yellow glass playing stone<br/><br/>",

As they concentrate on removing the blocks, players tend to relax, allowing them to open up and talk more freely with one another. Playing Totika will encourage people of all ages to set and achieve goals, motivate themselves, identify strong role models and form healthy relationships. Totika includes the Self-Esteem deck of questions but may be played with any card deck made by Open Spaces, LLC.&quot;<br/><br/>48 colored, wood blocks and 48 question cards, each with 4 questions for 2 or more players ages 8 &amp; up.<br/><br/>",

One infantry stand is made up of four figures and each figure is 100 men.  The basic element is a brigade, which is typically four-five stands.  The ground scale is 100 yards for 15mm or smaller; for 25-30 mm figures, all distances should be doubled.  The time scale is 1 turn = 20 minutes, which is fairly short for a grand tactical set of rules.<br/><br/>Game turn sequence is as follows:<br/><br/>1. Activation (each division or cavalry brigade rolls a die to determine if they can move effectively that turn)<br/>2. First Move Determination<br/>3. Combat Phase One (first mover moves and fires)<br/>4. Morale Phase One (first mover)<br/>5. Combat Phase One (2nd mover moves and fires)<br/>6. Morale Phase Two (2nd mover)<br/>7. March Phase (both sides make march moves)<br/>8. Rally Phase (routing/retreating units may attempt rallies)<br/><br/>The game includes orders of battles (but not maps or scenario rules) for:  First Bull Run, Shiloh, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga.<br/><br/>",

Players use mine cards to build a mine while at the same time trying to construct (or steal) the mining tools needed to grab the gold before others.  The Diggity mine cards have two functions - they construct the mine the players use to collect gold, and they also hold parts that players can use to create a miner or to build tools.  The miners produce gold, and then it's a battle as players vie to use the best tool to collect it.<br/><br/>Easy to learn, quick to play, but with deep gameplay and unique mechanics, Diggity is suitable for a party, a family game night, or a break from school or work.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/>Mine Cards Deck (64 cards)<br/>Tool Cards Deck (16 cards)<br/>Gold Cards Deck (16 cards)<br/>Diggity Rules Document<br/><br/>",

You start with a single god with no worshippers, and during the game, you develop a cult of followers for your god and build a temple to your god.  You&rsquo;ll be in competition with other cults, and you may eventually add other gods and cults to your pantheon.  Your goal in the game is to attract more followers (and stronger followers) to your cult and to build complete temples to your gods.<br/><br/>You'll also be able to take your pesky competitor cults down a notch or two with special cards such as Heresy, Purge, Iconoclasm, and many others.<br/><br/>Sometime during the game, there will be a prophecy.  When the prophecy is fulfilled, it's the End of Days, and whoever is ahead wins!<br/><br/>The game is family friendly and easy to learn.  It takes about 45-60 minutes to play depending on how fast you are.<br/><br/>",

Each card represents an AFV (armored fighting vehicle) type and has counter marker tracks for up to a platoon of such vehicles.  Markers for armor leaders, malfunctions and special equipment could thus be off board, allowing for less clutter on the mapboard units.<br/><br/>Common in miniature game systems, vehicle tracking cards in ASL first appeared for German and Soviet forces in Streets of Fire: ASL Deluxe Module 1 and then for American  forces in Hedgerow Hell: ASL Deluxe Module 2, both encouraging the use of 1/285th scale armor miniatures as mapboard units.<br/><br/>Use of the cards does not impact the AFV rule set, it is simply a record keeping enhancement.  In particular, these cards are not meant to provide a means of hidden information, as the rules specifically require the AFV status to be displayed at all times to the opponent.  Thus, for example, hidden armor leaders are still be noted somewhere off of the cards.<br/><br/>Page F18 of Chapter F provided in West of Alamein: ASL Module 5 stated: &quot;British AFV Cards will become available for purchase as of January 1989.  Their cost will be $5.00 US, plus 10% for shipping within the USA (or for APO/FPO); or 20% for Canada or Mexico; or 30% for shipment overseas.&quot;<br/><br/>",

This can be reached by getting involved into different kinds of sexual activities.<br/>Each player represents a male or a female character. During the game, a player can get a relationship with an opposite sex card (no same sex possibilities in the rules, although it might be adapted). In each turn, a player plays three cards and draws three new cards. Cards can be played on oneself or on opponents or their partners. Card effects can be positive, as in having sex or making up etc., or negative, blocking others. When a sexual act card is played, one or two dice are rolled and the result is added to the pleasure point total of the player, until one of them has reached a total of 69 points.<br/><br/>",

Each must strive to rework and beautify the stained glass windows to emulate the light of heaven's glory.<br/><br/>Walls of Light is a light strategy game for 2-3 players. Each player places their colored winks to complete the cathedrals windows. Colored winks can be combined to make new colors. When a craftsman completes a window, he earns points for the number of different colors within that window. All craftsman then earn points for their colored panes in the completed window. The colored dice are used to determine which of the six windows the master craftsman may work on this turn, and in what way they may place their colored pane. Strategy is enhanced with the stained glass cards which allow dice to be rerolled, the switching of colors, the adding of extra colors on your turn, etc.<br/><br/>Walls of Light is a fast-playing strategy game that players of all skill levels will enjoy.<br/><br/>Available on The Gamecrafter or as a Print and Play!<br/>PnP Game Files include: <br/>Rules: 2 pages<br/>Cards: 2 pages (16 cards)<br/>Windows: 4 pages<br/><br/>PnP Players will need to supply:<br/>1 Red d6, 1 Yellow d6, 1 Blue d6<br/>8 Red Winks, 8 Yellow Winks, 8 Blue Winks (all translucent)<br/>3 small tokens (1 red, 1 blue, 1 yellow) for keeping score<br/>6 White cubes (or other token)<br/><br/>",

Horses are also rated by style of running and effectiveness of within their style.  The styles are Frontrunner (breaking hard from the gate), Stalkers (sits off the lead, then tries to close on the home stretch) and Closers (who run hard and the end). Finally it has a Class Rating, that is a race variable, that effects the horse on the day of the race. (making predicting the performance of a horse on any race, more troublesome).<br/><br/>It is fulled with horse racing terms and explanations, and comprehensive system for rating a horse to determine the odds of any race, and a full on campaign system, with buying, training and racing your horses and choosing your jockeys.<br/><br/>Product Description from the website:<br/><br/>THE SPORT OF KINGS, THE SPORT OF EVERYMAN<br/><br/>Once a year in early May, the sports world stops and takes note.

        "description": "Plants is a board game that attempts to model the life of plants from their point of view in a specific, easily playable format. Plants is also a modular, organic game system that can grow and adapt beyond a single game board or a set of rules. The game is not meant to be an educational simulation, but more like an open creative project that deliberately intertwines certain biological concepts with suitable board game mechanisms.<br/><br/>During the game, the players continuously move through several different types of phases and perform actions at their own pace. They must try to adapt to the whims of the competing players and manipulate the upcoming situations to help them pollinate their flowers and gather enough nutrients and energy to produce seeds. At same time the players may sprout from the seeds, use the nutrients to grow in the habitat area and be forced to use up their energy to get rid of pesky larvae. Having enough water available is always a concern, and sometimes the players must accept losing their precious biomass. And if the players are not careful, they might even be eliminated from the game completely.<br/><br/>Plants features no randomness after a simple setup and there are no auctions, negotiations or trading. It has an open spatial element with shared resources and some three-dimensional play. The actions are short and the turns go by quickly and the possible butterfly effects keep situations tense. Clever planning and timing is required for success, and in the end only the number of seeds matter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Action to stop climate change came too little and too late. Geoengineering, although dangerous and unproven, is now on the table. A world like this has no winners, but can you minimize the hardship your regions face?<br/><br/>In Geoengineering 101, you're one of two to four world leaders, and you have two parallel but sometimes competing goals: One is to minimize the hardship your regions endure from heat, drought, or flood.   The other is to fully decarbonize the world economy.  Only by eliminating all fossil fuel use can climate change be slowed and the game won. However, in the meantime, the air conditioners and pumps running on fossil fuels can shield you from the some of the impacts.<br/><br/>A world where climate change has gotten so bad that geoengineering is on the table is one without winners, only those that lose less.  There's only one way to &quot;win&quot; in Geoengineering 101: have the least amount of Hardship when all Carbon Tokens are finally removed.  There's plenty of ways to lose: having all regions destroyed by the climate going off the charts, or when all the players suffer a total of 100 Hardship - which in a typical game, is only 10-15 turns away.<br/><br/>In Geoengineering 101, you'll take turns with other players to carry out geoengineering programs or acts of deep green resistance.  There's a time delay to your actions, though: the program you initiate now doesn't come up until your next turn.  In between, other players' programs happen and if uncoordinated, can trigger side effects that cause hardship, randomize the sequence of future actions, or shift global rainfall patterns.<br/><br/>The game takes inspiration from real climate science and geoengineering ideas, as well as the political implications of different nations unilaterally or cooperatively meddling with the weather. Enjoy the game, but let's hope that carbon emissions can be stopped before we ever have to play it for real.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Bhaloidam is a time, a person, a feeling. Bhaloidam is a language, an idea, a place, and a memory. Bhaloidam is a modern expression of three timeless cultural forces: bha to tell, loid to play, and dam the tribe. In other words, Bhaloidam is where Story, Play, and Community come together.<br/><br/>Bhaloidam is an indie tabletop game from Zakelro! that is an open and accessible storytelling platform. With it you'll spin character-driven stories and weave them together with the stories of your friends. You'll exert your influence upon the storyworlds you create together, shaping its future and controlling your characters' destinies as you perform their successes and their failures.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>Bhaloidam can be used to build any type of storyworld you and your friends want to explore. Sail the high seas as vicious pirates, uncover inter-dimensional conspiracies as government agents, solve murder mysteries as retired librarians, or scheme for power as members of the Elizabethan court.<br/><br/>Bhaloidam&rsquo;s rules free you from context-specific actions, so your stories don&rsquo;t need to revolve around combat, or even conflict. You can find yourself rolling the dice and using the rules to determine the outcome of a conversation, the impact of a musical performance, the success of a cunning plan, or any other action you wish to perform. This works because Bhaloidam provides you with thematic ways of Influencing the world and characters around you, and these Influences can be interpreted differently depending on the needs of the story and of your character.<br/><br/>This empowers a Skein (group of storytellers) to explore deeply personal stories together. And because each Spinner (storyteller) is in complete control of their character, they are encouraged to interpret their failures in ways that advance the story and provide opportunities for character growth.<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>The rules of Bhaloidam are powerful and flexible, but they are also intuitive enough that new players--young or old--can learn them and start spinning stories within 45 minutes. Through the use of iconic visuals we are even able to represent every game rule you need to remember on the Lifewheel itself. Each storyteller uses one of these colorful gameboards to keep track of their characters&rsquo; influence upon the storyworld, and the storyworld&rsquo;s influence upon their character.<br/><br/>Community<br/><br/>Bhaloidam can serve as a Spinner-only platform, meaning everyone has equal influence upon the story. But it can also serve a more traditional approach, wherein one person takes on the responsibility of creating the storyworld, writing the plot, and acting as final authority on the interpretation of the rules. We call this role the Weaver and encourage you to see this role as a support position rather than an authoritative one, helping the Skein spin the best possible story threads they can and weaving them into a compelling tapestry.<br/><br/>Bhaloidam is also a flexible and scalable platform you can build on. The clear and consistent rules serve as a solid base that you can add to as needed for your storyworld.<br/><br/>",

Each scientist uses these materials to make their twisted schematics a reality. With the help of their faithful lab assistants and the occasional pack of ghouls at their summons, the madness is contagious. The Angry Villagers have their own set of 6 custom dice to determine their actions for the night. Will they storm the lab with a Pitchfork or Fire?

Surviving the trip would be great. Collecting a big pile of loot would be better.<br/><br/>Goblins, Guns and Grog is a solitaire roll-and-write adventure game in which players attempt to navigate a treacherous sea route to make it to the mainland. Each turn, the player rolls dice to &quot;Scavenge&quot; (add items to the inventory), &quot;Attack&quot; (if in possession of cannons), &quot;Loot&quot; (in case of a successful attack), &quot;Move&quot; (along the map track, always straight forward towards the destination), &quot;Adventure&quot; (if the turn has ended on one of the X's scattered along the track). Every turn ends with eating, depleting the meager store of food that, if exhausted, causes the player to lose the game.<br/><br/>Arriving at the end of the track is somewhat easy and is nominally considered a &quot;win.&quot; But points are only scored for looting the many ships along the way. To engage with these potential prizes, however, the player needs both cannons (to attack) and chests (to store loot). The catch? At the start of the game, the player's &quot;ship&quot; is large enough only to hold a pair of cannons. The ship can be expanded through adding Tetris-like pieces to the hull, slowly expanding the size until the raft has become a formidable warship. But focusing on acquiring lumber, cannons, and chests means passing up opportunities to acquire food. Players must therefore decide when to push their luck and when to play it safe.<br/><br/>Will you be satisfied to return to the mainland, safely and with a fully belly? Or will you risk it all to answer the siren call of gold?<br/><br/><br/>Released in the March 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

The objective of the game is to be the Top Dog in the pack the marks the most territory (collects the most cards). Along the way you will challenge dogs, get belly rubs, chasing squirrels, dodge angry cards, bark, get treats, pee on poles and do whatever it takes it get more territory cards between your paws.<br/><br/>Gameplay. <br/>The game is all about hand management. You get dealt 5 cards, and for the rest of the game, you are trying to get more territory cards by playing actions. It is a fun take-that game where you get to use a bit of strategy and have to submit to a bit of chance as well. Everyone gets two moves per turn, and you can pick up or play cards on each turn. There are also drop cards which act as curve balls that you have to deal with. You can't keep drop cards in your hand, they have to be played as soon as they are drawn from the deck. The game goes on until the draw pile is empty, and then everyone gets one last move before you count up the territory card points to see who has won.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If you know how to play Werewolf, you already know how to play Shitty Werewolf, but here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of the rules&hellip;<br/><br/>Everyone is secretly a villager or a werewolf, and over a series of night/day rounds, the werewolves will secretly eat villagers at night while the whole town will execute someone every day. The villagers are trying to kill all the werewolves while the werewolves are trying to eat enough villagers to outnumber them before they are executed. The game requires a moderator to run things and with special powers can get really complicated, but the core is a very simple game based around arguing with each other.<br/><br/>Unlike traditional Werewolf, the roles/powers in Shitty Werewolf frequently break not just the conventions of the genre but also the basic play loop of the game itself all while exploring the social dynamics present in all group interactions. With roles like the &ldquo;Socially Awkward Friend Who Hates Werewolf but Didn&rsquo;t Want to Make a Fuss About It&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mansplainer&rdquo; games can start to unravel around the all-too-real social conventions and conversational baggage we bring to the experience of playing Werewolf. But this high mindedness is coupled with roles like the &ldquo;Swearwolf&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Raccoon&rdquo; that make it clear that this is still a game about being weird together, even if you might end up with some deep thoughts along the way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each of the two players have a pawn, a knight, a bishop, a rook, a queen, and a king.<br/><br/>The pieces have modified rules that allow them to move in one-dimension. For instance, knights can jump 2 or 3 tiles from where they started. Bishops travel along every other tile, ignoring any pieces on squares of a different color than the one they currently occupy.<br/><br/>By breaking chess down into one single row, players may find themselves visualizing moves a little further in advance than they could in a normal game of chess.<br/><br/>Doc Pop's One-Dimensional Chess started off as an experiment, but after years of testing and feedback, it's turned into a highly enjoyable strategy game worth checking out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players can vote if their opponents are correct, leading to a fun exploration of the arts.<br/><br/>Objective: Be the player or team with the most points after each player&rsquo;s or team&rsquo;s five cards have been placed with an artist. For a quick version of Painting Parlay use three cards instead of five.<br/><br/>Set-Up:<br/>Layout the sixteen artists in a four by four grid on the table.<br/>Shuffle the large square art cards and deal 5 cards to each player or team. Be sure not to look at the back of the art cards, as the artist is revealed on the backside of the card. <br/>Place the small hint cards painting side up, next to the artist grid, players can search the hint deck for a painting. <br/>Each player or team will take a voting card, and a point card with a clip to track their points.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>On your turn, you will choose a painting in your hand, examine its style and elements, and compare it to the sixteen artists on the table. <br/>You will then place your card with whom you think painted this painting, and give a brief reason on why you came to that conclusion.<br/><br/>Hints and Help:<br/>If you are lost and need help you can search the hint deck for your painting, you will get fewer points if you choose correctly, however it will give you its date of creation, and information about the painting or artist. <br/>Artist Information: At any time on your turn, you can flip one artist card and read a brief summary of their life.<br/>Exchanging Your Painting: Once per game you or your team can switch one of the paintings in your hand with one of the top three paintings of the art card deck. You will take your new painting and discard the painting in your hand.<br/><br/>Once you have chosen who you think painted your painting, the other players will vote, flipping their voting card to a check or an x, on whether they think you guessed correctly or incorrectly. Then flip the art card, and reveal the artist.<br/><br/>If you placed your painting next to the correct artist you will receive a point amount based on whether you used a hint or not. Adjust your scorecard using the sliding clip on the card. If you guessed incorrectly, you receive no points. <br/>Your turn ends and the next player seeks to match their painting with an artist.<br/><br/>Point Values:<br/>Placed Painting Next to Correct Artist without a Hint: 5 points<br/>Placed Painting Next to Correct Artist with a Hint: 3 points<br/>If you voted correctly what the outcome would be: 2 points<br/><br/>Players continue to place their paintings with an artist until everyone has placed five of their paintings. In the quick version of Painting Parlay, it is only three paintings that are placed with an artist for the game to end.<br/><br/>Look at your scorecard and see who has the most points, that player or team is the winner! Congratulations on your mastery of the world&rsquo;s most famous masterpieces.<br/><br/>Team Play:<br/>In team mode, this game can accommodate up to eight teams of six players. Each player will receive one painting card and the voting card will be switched between players on a team each turn. Players on the same team can work together to figure out who painted a teammate&rsquo;s painting and to vote, however it is up to the player whose turn it is to make the final choice. In team mode, players cannot exchange their painting cards for another. The game will end after six paintings have been placed next to an artist from each team.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Why does everything itch? I can't stop scratching! Oh no! Are those... fleas? Use your cards to get rid of them and pass them on to your opponents. Be smart and get rid of as many fleas as you can, but watch out for veteran fleas, because they are tricky customers.<br/><br/>Be the dog with the least fleas at the end of the game and win. Are you starting to feel your whole body itch?<br/><br/>When it is their turn, the player plays as many action cards from their hand as they want. Once they have played, they decide whether to draw 1, 2 or 3 cards from the deck and they say this out loud. Next, they draw the number of cards they have said, one after the other. They put the action cards they have drawn into their hand and the flea cards in front of them. The player's turn then ends and they cannot play any more cards. The turn passes to the player on the left.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one of the players collects 5 flea cards in front of them.<br/><br/>That player cannot win the game. The rest of the players count the number of fleas they have on each card, and whoever has the fewest wins the game. If there is a tie, the player who has the fewest veteran fleas wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Some of the mini-games are like mini-challenge and if you fail to roll the right dices you lose points on the point grid.  There are also square where you must choose an opponent to play against, so you can win those or both players can loose points if they both failed. You can also ended up on square where you can't loose points.<br/><br/>Exemple of a mini-game with two dice:<br/>'Double': you have to choose a wild number before rolling the dices, that number will act like a jocker. To make points you have to roll a pair. You roll three times and make 10 points for each pair you obtained.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 225 points, or as they say reach the Rubicon, win the game.<br/><br/>",

Players will need to strategically navigate crowded Flyways and catch Strong Tailwinds while avoiding dangerous Predators, Fog and other hazards. The player with the most Migration Tokens when there are no tokens remaining wins the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview:<br/><br/>Each turn is comprised of three phases:<br/><br/>1) Draft Cards and Play Complete Flocks:<br/><br/><br/>    Each player may draft either two Birds or one Action from the Feeding Grounds. <br/><br/><br/><br/>    If a player is able to play a complete Flock(s), it may be played in any vacant, valid Flyway for that Bird type. A player may play as many complete Flocks from her hand during her turn. A player is not required to play a full Flock even if there is an open Flyway. <br/>            For example, a player may want to hold onto a complete Flock to create an even larger Flock for more points.<br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    After drafting cards and playing any Flocks, that player refills the Feeding Grounds back up to six cards to signal her turn is complete. If the draw pile is empty, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2) Play Actions: After each player has had the opportunity to draft and play Flocks, beginning with the person with the player one token, each player may play one Action from her hand.<br/><br/>3) Migrate: Starting with Pacific Flyway, moving in order towards the Eastern Flyway, place one Migration Token on each Flock currently in play, unless prohibited by an Action (i.e. Fog).<br/><br/><br/>    If the number of tokens on the Flock is equal to the Migration Time printed on the card, the Flock owner collects all Migration Tokens currently on the Flock and the Flock is then discarded. Full Flock Bonus: The owner of the Flock receives +1 additional Migration Token from the pile for each additional Bird over the required Flock size. Safety in numbers!<br/><br/><br/>After the Migrate phase is complete, all players must discard down to the hand limit of ten cards. The player one token is then passed clockwise, shifting the starting player for the new turn. Refill the Feeding Grounds and continue play until all Migration Points are expended.<br/><br/>Winning the Game<br/><br/>    When the last token is played on a Flock, the game ends immediately. Any Migration Tokens on Flocks in a Flyway go to the owner of those Flocks. Each player adds up their token and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/><br/>",

They need to work together, explore the mansion, collect cues and use deduction to find the &quot;safe exit room&quot;, and manage to escape through the it in 8-10 rounds before the bomb explodes. The serial killer disguised himself and hides among the victims in order to witness the suffering of the victims in a sadistic sense. His goal is to secretly thwart the escape. The victims win the game by escaping the mansion before the game ends. Or the killer wins by thwarting enough people reach the &quot;safe exit&quot; and have them killed by the bomb.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player can move to an adjacent room (given that he has the key to unlock the room) and execute the function of that room, which include: discover a cue card that points to the &quot;safe exit room&quot;, deter the bomb from exploding (if successful, add 2 more game rounds), cure poisons (yes, the victims started the game by being poisoned by the serial killer), and inspect other people's cue card. Players can also do generic actions such as giving room keys to other players, and so on.<br/><br/>The game plays similarly to the Mafia/Werewolf family, but with the spatial exploration element on a modular board.<br/><br/>The game is in Chinese only. Here is the Chinese description:<br/><br/>游戏讲述一群受害者被奸徒困在一个完美密室里而且身中剧毒，玩家需要在密室里面互相合作，运用有限的时间去寻找线索和破解迷题，最终突破奸徒的阻挠找到出口逃生。<br/>该款游戏的特色是将玩家的语言和实际行动相结合，游戏的临场代入感非常强，是一个需要玩家之间高度合作和策略运用的新型语言推理类桌面游戏。<br/><br/>",

Everyone wants to be the ﬁrst to ride on the rubber raft, so soon they are all shoving and pushing to get a place on the raft. It doesn't take long and soon the ﬁrst animal is nudged off and that is before the ride even starts. Who can place animals on the rubber raft without pushing off any others?<br/><br/>In S.O.S. Whitewater, players want to assist animals onto the rubber raft that stands before them, but the raft has a rounded bottom so it teeters precariously as each animal boards. Each animal is on a wooden token, and three animals (out of 16) are drawn randomly to start the game. The active player must place one of these three tokens on the raft without touching the raft, stacking the animals, or making any animals fall. Oh, and animals of the same type much touch, so be ready to push a bit, if needed.<br/><br/>If the player gets the animal on board with no mishaps, she receives a cardboard animal token of the same type. If she knocks animals off, she must place these animals before her, then continue to load her animal on board, even though she won't claim a token. The player then draws a new wooden animal token from the bag.<br/><br/>Once all animals are on board or have fallen off, or all players have passed in turn, the round ends. The player who knocked off the most animals loses a scoring token. Everyone then turns these tokens face-down.<br/><br/>S.O.S. Whitewater ends after three rounds, and the player who collects the most pairs of animals wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Although they served the same &quot;boss&quot;, it is not their nature to see things eye to eye with one another. Each Elemental King believes in his own way of running things and this right can be earned by defeating the others. As they cannot send their entire celestial army against each other openly, this conflict is traditionally resolved by their champions in tournaments held in arenas they take turns to host.<br/><br/>Are you the champion they are looking for? Will you be the most sought after in the Elemental Planes?<br/><br/>This is a card game designed primarily for 2 players, though it is also playable with 4 players in a free-for-all conflict. Players take on the role of a champion serving one of 4 different pig characters, also known as The Elemental Kings, representing Fire (Ashw), Water (Esbner), Earth (Ohif) and Air (Ukelele).<br/><br/>Each player uses a deck of 36 cards, made up of numbers 1 to 9 for each of the Elemental Kings, and starts the game with 20 LIFE. The goal of the game is to defeat all other players by reducing their LIFE to zero. Using a hand management mechanic similar to poker, players can attack and defend against other players by piecing together different ATTACK HANDS inflicting different levels of damage. Those who survives the onslaught to bring glory to his Elemental King will be rewarded with the arcane magic of his host.<br/><br/>Do you believe in the cause of the Elemental King you serve ...<br/>or do you &quot;actually&quot; serve more than one ...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bushi Shogi is a Shogi-inspired game played by two opponents on a field of two cells, with two pieces called Samurai. The pieces are cubes with kanji in red for 'samurai' and kanji in black for 'sword' on each face.<br/><br/>The playing field starts empty. Each player receives one Samurai and, beginning with Black, drops them onto their respective cells in turn. Such placement must be so that the upward face of the cube does NOT present a 'sword' kanji toward the opponent.<br/><br/>Movement consists of either rotating the cube one face clockwise, rolling it forward one face toward the opponent, rolling it    left one face or rolling it right one face.<br/><br/>The upward face of each cube controls the play of the game. If an opponent cube presents an upward face which has a forward 'sword' and the upward face of the player's cube does NOT present a forward 'sword', the player must rotate only. If an opponent cube presents a 'sword' forward, and the player presents a 'sword' forward, the player must roll the cube directly away from the 'samurai' kanji on its upward face.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who is able to present an upward face with a forward 'sword' and a rearward 'samurai' when the opponent cube also presents a forward 'sword' with a rearward 'samurai'. The 'samurai' are considered to be facing each other with their 'swords' met.<br/><br/>",

Yes, it is the bills that are the biggest challenge for the players (3 to 5). If you like fast and dynamic games with quick setup and low downtime, with a significant role of interaction, then this is a game for you!<br/><br/>In Byle do pierwszego players control 6-persons families trying to survive two months in the homely housing estate.<br/>They start a game with certain amount of money and a set of bills, which values are between 50 and 400 zł. By the end of each month, which passage is marked on a special calendar with 12 months to choose from, players must get rid of all bills.<br/>With proper management of family members, which can be sent to several premises on the board, players are able to gain valuable discounts that will allow them to deal with the debts.<br/>A great help (but a chore for rivals) are 3 types of action cards, which players earn after paying the bill. The higher the amount to pay, the better the deck from which the player draws an action card. And how much payment a player will get on hand the first day of the month will depend on its position on the career track.<br/>Each turn, a player is faced with the question &quot;career or family?&quot;. The player who after two months of fighting will have the most nest-eggs will win Byle do pierwszego.<br/><br/>",

In this quick-draw classic, the guesses can be just as hilarious as the sketches, making it the perfect way to get the party started. Pictionary now includes two erasable markers, boards for drawing, and an updated Pop Culture category of clues. Year after year since 1985, Pictionary has proven itself to be the ultimate party game! Each sold separately, subject to availability. Colors and decorations may vary.<br/><br/>Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers. In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer. When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers. No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances. A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition. Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.<br/><br/>",

The game system is a custom implementation of the classic Card Driven Game (CDG) mechanism combined with new mechanisms that simulate civil unrest on a strategic scale.  In the game 2 players simulate the First Palestinian Intifada.  One side is the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) composed of the Palestinian community leadership within the Israeli occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.  The other side is the conservative Likud-led Israeli government (ISR).  Hamas acts as a situationally controllable faction that acts more independently from the UNLU - helping and hindering both factions at different times.<br/><br/>Issuing Operations and exploiting events, players recruit and deploy units to control territory and/or foment uprising. The game is played over 3 rounds composed of hands of cards that are played as actions or events.  If, after this time, the Israeli player cannot maintain national will (support for the conservative administration), they will lose the game.<br/><br/>The UNLU&rsquo;s goals are two-fold: 1) sustain on-board protests and transition them into general strikes, and 2) influence international concern by engaging in non-violent efforts.  ISR aims to control the occupied territories by 1) suppressing civil disobedience in map locations, and 2) establishing intelligence networks within the communities to implant operatives or encourage collaboration with the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in suppressing the civil unrest.<br/><br/>Additionally, automatic victory conditions exist for both sides. The UNLU player may win if international concern sways in their favor; that is, in the form of UN intervention due to human rights abuses. The Israeli player may automatically win if they deploy all of their intelligence networks, effectively snuffing out the resistance at the source.<br/><br/>",

The winning player is the first to obtain a certain number of Gold Coins.<br/><br/>Players take turns being the Leader of climbs up the Golden Mountain, each turn choosing a Sidekick to join them on this journey. As players ascend the Golden Mountain, they land on levels with increasing amounts of Gold Coins, but they also grow likelier to &ldquo;fall off&rdquo; the mountain.<br/><br/>At every level, the Leader and Sidekick must each decide whether to Climb (continue to press their luck) or Chicken Out (cash out and end the turn.) Both players often agree that Chickening Out is a wise decision, and they may agree to play their Chicken Out cards. However, each player can benefit by breaking their promise and playing Climb, at the expense of the other. This dynamic is inspired by the &ldquo;Repeated Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma&rdquo; model of game theory. Players must weigh their greed in the short term against the value of their alliances.<br/><br/>Each player also receives one Chicken Trick card which gives them a special rule-bending ability (variable player power). There are 12 Chicken Trick cards, each representing a unique, silly chicken character.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is set in an eco household, so nappies are changed using colourful washable nappies. You have a long weekend to keep the rooms tidy while also keeping your baby happy. Every day is another challenge, because your baby always wants something different.<br/><br/>In Walking Baby each player controls a family member: mom, dad, grandma or grandpa. There are 8 rooms of the house where they can move around. And of course, there is the baby who always wants something and makes a lot of mess around the house. The game lasts for 3 days, that's 12 rounds (shifts of the day). In each round new housework tasks appear and the baby has new wishes to be fulfilled to keep up his/her mood.<br/><br/>Players win if they last until the evening of the 3rd day. But they will lose if the baby starts to cry or the housework overflows.<br/><br/>Players roll 2 dice simultaneously (starting player also rolls the baby dice). The throw shows the number of action points that can be used to move a character between rooms, perform housework tasks, change nappy, fulfil needs of baby cards or cheer up the baby. Plan your actions because you'll get more tired as evening approaches. Time for a coffee! Use it wisely to gain energy for the night shift.<br/><br/>Can you cope with even the most chaotic situation? Work together and hold on for three days to win! Your reward is a weekend spa! ;)<br/><br/>There are two game modes to play in Walking Baby: FAMILY and FROLIC mode.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Cards played can be either national industries, consumer goods, green technologies, or events; played industries require the roll of dice to determine pollution output. Collect enough happiness points and you win.<br/><br/>But by producing these goods, you influence the earth's ecology. The player's individual influence, as well as the overall influence, is shown by a marker on a second track, and if these markers reach certain (moveable) points on the warming track, bad things happen to the ecology and the players. If the third warming point is reached, the game ends and the player with the lowest contribution to the overall warming wins.<br/><br/>Thus, the players are embedded in a quite true setting in which they have to balance production and sustainable actions. Who will manage to control his industrial production in a way that minimizes the environmental impact while nevertheless allowing him to meet consumer demand?<br/><br/>Global Warming is the fourth game in M&uuml;cke Spiele's &quot;Edition Bohrt&uuml;rme&quot; series that uses the game pieces from Kosmos' Giganten in the context of a new game.<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the target cards and arrange them in piles next to the card square. The card in the center of the square marks the starting point. The aim of the game is to get out of the number square-maze.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a round, a target card is drawn and shown to all players. At this point, each player looks for a &quot;mathematical path&quot; on the grid starting from the card in the center and leading towards the edge of the square. Additions and subtractions of the numbers shown on the cards must result in the number shown on the target card.<br/><br/>By mathematical path we mean the passage from one card to an adjacent one by making a mathematical operation of addition or subtraction on each passage. The target cards, green or red, determine two game modes: if a green target card is drawn, the mathematical path must include at least one subtraction; if a red target card is drawn, the mathematical path must include at least two subtractions. As soon as a player finds a valid path they say &quot;DONE!&quot; and show everyone the path found by pointing at it with his/her finger.<br/><br/>If the math path is correct, the player keeps the target card. If the path is incorrect, the player is out for the rest of this round and the other players continue to look for their solutions. The winner is the first to get 5 target cards or a number of target cards previously decided on by all players.<br/><br/>Every five rounds, the cards on the square can be reshuffled. Error card The player who miscalculates is given the error card and sits the rest of the round out. lf, in the meantime, another player says &quot;DONE!&quot; and he/she is wrong too, that player will get the error card and sit the round out while the previous player with the error card can rejoin the game.<br/><br/>",

The game also includes a deck of &quot;mini-dungeon&quot; cards from which you draw when you drop to a deeper layer of the dungeon. Each one is unique, providing different paths for different players, and which exit you find determines where you'll pop back up on the main map. You can even play an always-changing game mode with just the dungeon cards in which players hop from card to card, eventually reaching a random final boss with a unique challenge.

The rules provide an analogue of the sport's rule set, and many of the same strategies and tactics that work on the track apply to the board game. <br/> In a 2-player game, each player controls a team of 5 game pawns: four Blockers and one Jammer. A player moves her Jammer through the pack, maneuvering around opposing Blockers, to earn points. At the same time, she must position her own blockers to prevent the opposing Jammer from scoring. Pawn movement is simply defined on a hexagonal grid. Blockers can in a counter-clockwise direction; Jammers can move in any direction at all and may &quot;juke&quot; to get around opposing pieces.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play:<br/><br/>Take Your Chances<br/>Players of the Take Your Chances flavorof the game will enjoy drawing cards that allow them to jump, juke, and block in special ways that help them make their way through the pack and defend their territory.<br/><br/>Pure Strategy<br/>Fans of abstract strategy games will skip the cards and dice, relying purely on their ability to outwit their opponent. They'll learn to master real derby strategies like skating the diamond, hammer &amp; nail, and goating.<br/> The game ships with a board, 10 plastic skater pawns, 2 scoring winks, cards, die, and rule book. Optional glass pawns and pewter miniatures are sold separately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ritter Rost: Eisenhart &amp; Voll Verbeult is based on the &quot;musical book&quot;-series and upcoming animated movie about Ritter Rost, a knight built of rusty pieces of scrap. In the game, each player has his own &quot;Ritter Rost&quot; tableau to equip with arms, horse, and so on. These are auctioned from three card piles: one face-down and two face-up. The players then decide when their &quot;Ritter Rost&quot; is ready for dice-rolling adventures. There are three adventures he has to go through successfully in the following order:<br/><br/><br/>     Joust<br/>     Fight a dragon<br/>     Attack the castle<br/><br/><br/>On their turn, players decide whether to start an auction of one of the topmost open cards (paid with &quot;sheet metal cards&quot;) or to send his &quot;Ritter Rost&quot; out to an adventure.<br/><br/>Auctions are held by bidding with face-down cards with values 1-8; these values are &quot;circular&quot;, so a &quot;1&quot; beats an &quot;8&quot;. Each card can be used only once and is discarded after the auction. When all cards are played, the discarded piles of each player is handed to the next player, since there are tie-breaking symbols on them.<br/><br/>To adventure, players equip their &quot;Ritter Rost&quot; with the items they gained via the auctions. Icons on these items tell how many dice the player uses trying to fulfill the adventure. To fulfill an adventure, the player reveals a matching adventure tile that tells him a number he has to reach by rolling the dice. The dice have only &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; sides. The player rolls all the dice he gets. All negative ones are laid aside, all positive ones are added and rolled again. Each consecutive roll is added (positive sides) or subtracted (negative sides) from the total until the number is reached, one die roll is entirely negative, or the player gives up.<br/><br/>Supplemental helper cards as well as cards that make adventures even harder add variety and more tactical elements to the game.<br/><br/>The first player who fulfills all three adventures wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Complication is provided by if you cover one of the stars of another player's color you move one of his pieces back to the start. If you cover one of your own stars you get another turn. Half of the stars are occupied by counters, one of which is moved to immediately cover any star a piece moves off.<br/><br/>",

It's like a relaxed version of Scrabble with free-flowing moves and high scores.<br/><br/>Equipment: Lingo requires a set of Scrabble tiles (with the two blanks removed), a flat surface about the size of a game board, and some method for keeping track of players' scores.<br/><br/>Start: Four tiles are chosen at random and placed into a pool shared by all players. Pool tiles are placed face up so that all players can see them. After each turn, new tiles are randomly selected to replenish the pool so that it always contains four tiles.<br/><br/>Moving: The opening player starts by taking any number of tiles from the pool and making a valid word. Thereafter, players take turns forming new words by taking any number of tiles from the pool and placing them adjacent to or on top of existing tiles. Words can be made forwards, backwards, upwards or downwards. No tile can be placed to cover the same letter.<br/><br/>All tiles placed per turn (if more than one) must form part of the same valid word. There are no other restrictions on placement; new tiles do not have to form valid words with tiles they are placed next to, but will score more points if they do.<br/><br/>If no new word can be made, then a single tile can be played for 0 pts. Players may not pass.<br/><br/>Scoring: After placing the tiles, new words formed that turn are counted to score points. Only the highest-valued word passing through each new tile along each axis (vertical and horizontal) is scored.<br/><br/>Word-length multiplier: The score for each new word is given by (total letter value) x (word length - 1).<br/><br/>Word-count multiplier: If more than one new word is formed, then the total word score is multiplied by the number of new words.<br/><br/>Winning: The game ends when there are no more tiles to play. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Gamerz (turn-based, play by email or play by web)<br/><br/><br/>",

Periodically, the right kind of replacements remove some of the damage, resulting in very durable units but fiddly stacks.<br/><br/>All other aspects of the game are quite classic, from movement to victory point based on geographical objectives.<br/><br/>This is a  wargame, dedicated to a not well-covered historical event, with an original incremental losses mechanism with four pages of basic rules.<br/><br/>El Eco de los Pasos, recreates four campaigns of the Spanish Civil War: <br/>Madrid (October 1936-March 1937), <br/>Teruel (December 1937-February 1938), <br/>Valencia (April-July 1938) <br/>Barcelona (December 1938-February 1939)<br/><br/>Division-brigade level and 3-7 days per turn. <br/>4 DIN A3 maps, 468 counters.<br/><br/>",

This is a playing card driven battle game, where individual figures move around the tabletop and draw cards to perform tasks and fight battles. Different fighting abilities and levels of armour are represented by differing card values in the game. Ordinary playing cards are used to play with.<br/><br/>Trials of a Demigod: a solitaire quest driven by action cards.This is mostly an exercise in pulling cards and seeing the total they add up to - nicely presented but not very much of a game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Super Soaker Twister is an outdoor game with the unusual requirement of a garden hose. A large, perforated vinyl mat is attached to a garden hose, which results in thin streams of water being emitted from the mat. Players place their hands and feet on colored circles on the mat, as dictated by a waterproof spinner. Example moves include &quot;left foot green&quot; and &quot;right hand red.&quot;<br/><br/>The object is to move as directed by the spinner, while only allowing your hands and feet to touch the mat. The player who can do this for the longest duration is the winner. As the vinyl mat becomes increasingly wet, moving without falling becomes more difficult.<br/><br/>Players familiar with outdoor games from the 70s and 80s might recognize this as a combination of Slip 'n Slide and Twister.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A traditional Japanese trick-taking card game based on the European game Ombre (originally &quot;l'Hombre&quot;), played with a special 75-card five-suited deck. This deck developed from Tenshō karuta, itself a close copy of the 48-card traditional Portuguese cards called &quot;dragon cards&quot; due to the dragons holding the suit symbols in the aces. Its creation was prompted by a ban on the older form of playing cards after Japan closed off the contact with the Western world in 1633, and became critical towards everything of European origin. Sunkun karuta took this game one step further.<br/><br/>The deck contains all 48 cards from Tenshō karuta; these are supplemented by introducing a fifth suit and increasing the number of cards in each suit from twelve to fifteen. Most additions refer to Japanese and Chinese culture, presumably a conscious choice intended to downplay the European origins of the game.<br/><br/>The suits are はう (hau), &quot;flower&quot; based on Portuguese 'paus' meaning &quot;clubs&quot;, いす (isu) a shortened form of 'espadas' or &quot;swords&quot;, こっぷ (koppu) from 'copas' or  &quot;cups&quot;, おうる (ōru) from 'ouros' or &quot;coins&quot; (literally &quot;golds&quot;) and finally the added ぐる (guru) with the traditional Japanese 三つ巴 (mitsudomoe) sign as suit symbol. As in the European predecessor games, higher-numbered pip cards beat lower ones only in the former two suits, while the latter ones are &quot;reversed&quot;.<br/><br/>The &quot;dragon aces&quot; are split into two distinct ranks by reintroducing a normal &quot;one&quot; in each suit and separate from the ろばい (robai) or &quot;dragon&quot; which normally ranks right above the ones. Above the number cards (1&ndash;9 plus robai) there are five court cards. From low to high, these are: そうた (sōta) &quot;queen&quot;, うま (uma) &quot;horse&quot;, きり (kiri) &quot;soldier&quot; (originally a king), うん (un) various Japanese mythological figures and すん (sun) various Chinese officials. The latter two ranks give the game its name. In the trump suit, the robai is promoted to above the kiri and the sōta above this again, except that the robai of hau is a permanent trump which is the fourth highest regardless of which suit is trump.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Sacramento, players draft cards from a common pool to create the strongest poker hand.<br/><br/>Played over multiple rounds. Each round a set number of cards are placed face up to a common pool. Each turn, a player chooses one of the cards from the pool and adds it to their hand of cards. This occurs until everyone has seven cards in hand. From those seven cards, each player builds their best five-card poker hand and is awarded points based on the strength of that poker hand. Whoever has the most points after all the rounds are played out, wins.<br/><br/>Sacramento is in the same family as Bonanza and Nugget.<br/><br/>Played with a standard deck of cards, published in Reiner Knizia's book Blazing Aces!: A Fistful of Family Card Games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A new expansion published in the 999 games 25 years gift box. It adds a new tile, a joker and gift tokens to the game. It seems it is more intended as a fun promo extension than a serious addition to the game.<br/><br/>The tile replaces the tile on which the number &quot;2&quot; is placed. The number &quot;2&quot; is then placed at the same tile as the number &quot;12&quot;. Place the joker on the new tile.<br/><br/>The joker gives away &quot;gift tokens&quot; that can be traded for resource cards.<br/>This expansion increases the strategic value of wool, which in the basic game is considered the least attractive commodity. Furthermore, the Joker is useful to chase the robber and/or to protect a land tile.<br/><br/>This item is contained in 999 Games trakteert!.<br/><br/>This is identical except in artwork and theme to the Catan Mini-expansion in Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015.<br/><br/>",

Each player must place its tiles touching at least 2 other pieces whose sides match in their colors. Different from dominoes, the hexagons make a closed grid, that forms the garden. That way, each play creates a new garden.<br/>The game can be competitive -win who puts down all their pieces- or can be cooperative. In this mode, players help each other to build gardens based on one of the 27 templates that comes in the manual. This mode can also be played solo, as a puzzle.<br/><br/>Designed by Rafael Arrivabene with art from Luiza Sequeira<br/><br/>",

Each role remains hidden and your objective is to help your allies and harm your foes. But how? Depending on your spy code, you will communicate to your team using either lies or truths.<br/><br/>Once you determine your fellow members, hurt players on the opposing team with the BULLET and heal those on your side with the MEDICAL KIT.<br/><br/>For each BULLET wound received, your team loses a point. For each MEDICAL KIT you receive, your team will gain one point. Side with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>If there is an EVEN number of players, shuffle together a deck of character cards with half the players on the Law Abiding Operative side and half on the Corrupted Defector side. Randomly distribute one to each player. Players must keep their role card secret during the gameplay.<br/><br/>Each player also takes a set of tool cards: One BULLET and One MEDICAL KIT. If there is an ODD number of players, select two even sets of ROLE cards (one more card than the number of players). Deal out the ROLE cards and reveal the last one. The team revealed will receive a scoring bonus at the end, to compensate for a fewer player.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>There are two rounds in this game.<br/><br/>Round 1: Gameplay begins with each player getting a choice to MAKE A MOVE or CALL FOR AN INTERROGATION.<br/><br/>MAKE A MOVE: When a player makes a move, they take one of their Tools, either Bullet or Medical Kit, and gives it to another player. The Tool Card remains facedown. Only the player who received the tool card can look at it. Send Medical Kits to your teammates to score, and fire your BULLET at the other team to reduce their point total.<br/><br/>CALL FOR AN INTERROGATION:  If you need more information, you may select one of your Tools, either Bullet or Medical Kit, and discard it without revealing to &ldquo;Call For An Interrogation.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Draw the next Interrogation Card and read it aloud. Starting with the next player clockwise, they must make a statement that answers the card. Law Abiding Agents, they must answer honestly. Corrupted Agents, they must tell a lie.<br/><br/>Feel free to discuss! Because the first player has less information to act on, that player does not have to give up one of their tools to Call For An Interrogation.<br/><br/>Second Round: After each player has had a turn to either Make A Move or Call For An Interrogation, in reverse order, each person now plays their remaining tool card. There is no more Interrogating in the second round. Gameplay ends with the first player distributing both of their Tool cards at the same time.<br/><br/>End Game: All the players reveal their Role Cards. All Tools are turned over. Your team gets +1 for each Medical Kit and -1 for each Bullet played on you. Team with the highest score wins. If there is an odd number players, the team with less players gets an additional +1 point. If there is a tie, the team with the most MEDIPACKS wins.<br/><br/>",

Today, you are playing pirates and want to build camps and a fort faster than anyone else.<br/><br/>In Catan: First Adventure, you start with a pirate camp that sits across two of the islands in the larger ring of islands. Each island depicts a resource, and you start with one of each of the resources showing on the islands under your camp.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first roll the six-sided die. On a result of 1-5, all players take a resource from the reserve if they have a camp on an island with a matching number; on a result of 6, you move the Ghost Captain to an island of your choice, taking two of the resource depicted there. No one else can claim resources from this island as long as the Ghost Captain remains there.<br/><br/>You then move the single ship on its course clockwise around the island. If you have one of each resource &mdash; molasses, wood, goat, cutlass &mdash; you can build a camp on an empty space adjacent to the ship. If you don't have what you need, you can trade any two resources for one of your choice, or you can spend a wood and a goat for random help from Coco the parrot. You don't know what Coco might give you, but ideally it's better than the wood and goat you just sacrificed to him!<br/><br/>After you build all your camps, you can build a fort on an empty space by spending two of each resource, and whoever does so first wins.<br/><br/>",

To do this, they have to lay out the cards in a pattern that shows the animals in ascending order. With each round, the scurrying gets wilder as more and more marsupials appear. Part of the teamwork is to turn over the sand timer every time a minute consists of fewer seconds than you would have estimated. In 5 short rounds, you learn to appreciate the estimation of your fellow players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The board has no special spaces because there is no score to tally.  In fact, all the spaces are designed to facilitate flipping the tiles over....<br/><br/>W&ouml;rterklauer works like this:  On your turn, you form as many words as you can, then leave the board for your opponent to try to convert letters and words.  Any word whose root she can alter by appending to it or changing one letter, any letter she uses in her word, and any crossed words tweaked (you're allowed to change one extra letter in one of the two crossed words), convert to her color by flipping over.  If you can't end your turn with more letters in your color than in your opponent's, you lose the game, simple as that.<br/><br/>",

RBPs may move in several directions, fire a laser, swing their snout, rest, or regenerate.  When an RBP is damaged, it loses one programming step.  When 5 points of damage have been received, the RBP is destroyed.  Last pig standing wins.<br/><br/>",

Your band of adventurers teleports to his treasure to claim it, but you must evade traps and battle monsters to escape. Just when you think you have reached the exit, Firethrax returns to stop you! Which adventurer among you will defeat the dragon to claim victory?<br/><br/>Dice &amp; Danger: Dragon's Lair is a board game designed to introduce younger children to the basic concepts of fantasy role-playing games. It is a simple race game in which players try to be the first to defeat the dragon at the last space on the board. Players take on the roles of various fantasy characters and start the game with three treasure cards, which allow them to perform actions or add to their combat die roll. A ten-sided die determines movement and combat. The spaces on the board are either free spaces or encounter spaces. The encounter spaces can be traps, monsters, or the single Holy Fountain treasure space. The monsters become progressively more difficult to defeat along the track, culminating in Firethrax the dragon. Defeating a monster rewards the player with a new treasure card, but losing to a monster means losing the next turn. The first player to defeat Firethrax wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the first half of the game, players are building a pyramid on their side, starting with the base. Whenever a player adds a card to the 2nd level or higher, they can activate that card's trading ability, and then trace that back to the base of the pyramid, activating any cards along the way that they desire.  Ultimately the path will trace back to some ship boards in the middle which hold both the cards the players will refill their hands with, as well as a cost to buy the ship board.<br/><br/>Once the players' are finished building their pyramid, the looting begins.  Players will form 3-card poker type hands on each of the ship boards.  They can choose from the cards remaining in their hands or the cards in their pyramid; however, to choose cards from the pyramid, they must &quot;unbuild&quot; the pyramid from the top and can only access uncovered cards.  Once the players have both added 3 cards to each board, the boards are evaluated and points are awarded.<br/><br/>The player with the most points from the boards acquired during trading and the boards acquired during looting wins.<br/><br/>",

It won't be an easy task. The station itself is constantly changing as you move through it, making every step a challenge.<br/><br/>As you explore the station, you'll find all kinds of strange souvenirs the aliens have collected on their travels. Gadgets, weapons, clothing, food and even a few mysterious specimens that can only be loosely defined as creatures. Collect what you can and trade it away to afford your ride back home. But beware the others and what they might do with the things they find, and never go near anyone who has just eaten a Neutron Burrito...<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>Be the first player to buy your way onto the space taxi to get home.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The board is modular and made up of 24 square tiles which are randomly placed in a pre-configured shape at the start of the game. One tile will be labeled sleeping pods, which is where all players start the game. On your turn, you have 4 moves. Each move allows you to rotate your room or an orthogonally adjacent room clockwise one turn, or move one space. Exploring a new room spends all remaining movement, but also allows you to draw an item card. Item cards represent clothing, specimen, food, or occasionally an event.<br/><br/>When you end your movement on a tile, you may perform the action depicted on that tile once. Most tiles allow you to trade in an item of a specific type for 1 credit, 2 credits, or 2 more cards. Some tiles allow you an additional movement, some allow you to draw a card if your hand is empty, and others have no effect at all. Once you have 10 credits, you need to race to be the first player to the escape pod to escape and win!<br/><br/>",

And the addition of danger would only make the adventure all that more exciting. One of the young frogs said he had heard of a dangerous game called Crocodile Hop that was played by the frog knights to prove one&rsquo;s froghood in the olden days. A game where a frog knight would display his agility and bravery by taunting Young Croc while hopping from lily pad to lily pad. A game that occasionally ended with the loss of limb and sometimes even life. A game that was no longer played.<br/><br/>&quot;Although one of the young frogs was a little hesitant to play such a reckless and dangerous game, comments were made about him being a tadpole and &ldquo;Do I see still see a tail back there?&rdquo; that eventually peer pressure won. &ldquo;Besides Old Croc is now so old he can barely move and he is quite predictable&rdquo; another one of the young frogs said. With that the young frogs headed out to the other side of the swamp looking for Old Croc.<br/><br/>&quot;Once they arrived at the other side of the swamp they started to splash and make noise trying to rouse Old Croc. &ldquo;Look there he is, there he is&rdquo; said one of the young frogs &ldquo;and he moves about as fast a slug in the mud&rdquo;. Then Old Croc came up and with his huge mouth swallowed up a whole lily pad with just one bite. The young frogs started hopping from lily pad to lily pad as they yelled at old Old Croc &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get me you old slug&rdquo; and the game began. Old Croc was popping up out of the water chomping down lily pads while the young frogs hopped from pad to pad before he could get them.<br/><br/>&quot;Then one of the young frogs noticed something, there seemed to be less and less lily pads to jump to and the ones that were left were getting harder to reach. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s running us out of lily pads&rdquo; he yelled and that was when the young frogs realized what they had gotten themselves into.&quot;<br/><br/>A mad hopping game for the piecepack -- hop your foolish young frogs to victory, while avoiding being eaten by Old Croc.<br/><br/>",

The British player has to march towards Flushing fortress in order to avoid a strong occupation by enemies. In order to do so he risks attrition and diseases. In effects there was fighting with the French, but the worst casualties were inflicted by diseases. Dysentery and other infectious illnesses arising from the unhealthy swampland killed thousands and incapacitated many more, causing the abandonment of the inglorious expedition.<br/>The British lost over 4,000 men to a disease called &quot;Walcheren Fever&quot;, thought to be a combination of malaria and typhus.<br/><br/>The French player has two options:<br/>1- attack the British columns try to delay their advance<br/>2- retreat inside Flushing and flood the area nearby (mining the dams)<br/><br/>Victory is assigned to the British player by controlling the fortress of Flushing. The French player wins if  he has the control of Flushing while having eliminated 10 British units. Any other outcome is a draw.<br/><br/>",

Comes with five characters and five sealed scenarios; stands up to replaying well.<br/><br/>The boss stays in an octagon in the centre, and is surrounded by eight spaces that may be occupied by players, or in higher levels fire or minions. Each turn consists of a player phase and a boss phase.<br/><br/>In the player phase, the player on turn rolls 4d6, and rerolls up to 2d6 once. The dice serve two functions: first, they designate through character-specific tables which actions (move, draw spell cards, heal, etc.) or spells you can take; second, the largest set of identical dice determines how much damage you do to the boss.<br/><br/>In the boss phase, the boss rotates either two 45&deg; steps or to face a player. The current player rolls 3d6, discards the high die, and looks up the two lower dice in a table to determine which octants take how much damage.<br/><br/>",

But when you open the door, you cannot see the food because the light is out, so you draw out food randomly. Everyone at the table needs a full meal, but you can try to make your meal have all your favorite (highest scoring) foods and try to give the spoiled (negative scoring) foods to your opponents.<br/><br/>There are 5 food groups (suits): Fruit, Vegetable, Entree, Beverage and Dessert<br/><br/>You'll get a better bonus the earlier you can play (meld) a full meal, either on yourself or someone else. You can exchange good and bad foods between your hand and meals on the table to improve your score and decrease the score of your opponents. You can also &quot;eat&quot; one item at a time to protect it from getting taken by someone else.<br/><br/>An important choice is what to do with your &quot;leftover&quot; cards; should you get rid of them to decrease negative score at the end of the round, or keep them longer to exchange and/or create more meals?<br/><br/>This game was the first place winner of the 2004 KublaCon Game Design Contest.<br/><br/>",

The first player to find their Goal card and return their Ship Token back to their Home Planet, residing there for one full rotation of players, wins the game! It sounds easy but you&rsquo;ll want to collect Fuel Cells along the way, upgrade your Ship, take the occasional long route to avoid the Inquisitor Probes roaming the hyperspace lanes, complete jobs to earn rewards, ward off the Syndicate, and constantly be alert to the danger of other players attacking you.

        "description": "Lingolandia is a family game that fosters creativity and vocabulary. You can play in various languages!<br/><br/>In Lingolandia, players draw a random letter from the bag and roll the die to determine what kind of round this will be. There are two different types of rounds - a player's own round or a crazy joined round where all players play together. All players are always involved even on another player's turn.<br/><br/>Then players use their imagination as well as observation to find words on displayed cards. Each card provides various interpretations while also providing visual objects to allow players to focus on searching and observing the illustrations.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing a random letter from a bag and rolling the die. The die will determine if they are going to play an individual round or a joined round where all players guess the words simultaneously.<br/><br/>The die roll will also indicate the number of words that a player has to find on the face-up illustrated cards. Words must start with the selected letter and can be actually present on the cards, or players can use their imagination based on the illustrations.<br/><br/>If the die roll shows a balloon (the Lingolandia logo), then all players guess at the same time--providing a very interactive round of play.<br/><br/>Correctly guessed words are awarded points which are recorded on the road to the finish line on the board. The first player that gathers enough points to cross the finish line is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The object is to capture or check the opposing Hydra, the King / Queen piece.<br/><br/>Played by two players on a 7x8 square board with a bay cell on each end, and with each players controlling movement of 10 tiles. Of the 10 titles, one is a Wall, that can block movement of opposing tiles. Another is the King / Queen, which can move in any direction. All other tiles have restricted rules of movement, for example, one tile can only go forward and to the right.<br/><br/>In a turn, a player may either move a tile as allowed by that tile, or can rotate by 90 degrees the square tile, so that in a following turn, the player can move the tile in a different direction.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player sucessfully surrounds the opposing King / Queen and prevents its movement.<br/><br/>",

As with dominoes games, players take turns placing tiles on the board. Scoring is based on completing circles on the game board, at which point they score (with the minimum score being 6 and the maximum score being 15 -- scores are determined by adding up the three different numbers that make up the circle).<br/><br/>",

The player takes the side of the U.S./West and must choose one of the offered strategies. Operations include military, diplomatic, and intelligence. Economics have been added and interleaved as an important factor.<br/><br/>Initial strategy in the Historic game is set and one must follow through with it until allowed to change strategy. This presents both opportunity and difficulty. Terror operations are governed by Random Event and various rules. While the terror side may not seem too active, it's very existence constitutes a tremendous threat to the U.S./Western position in the world. Players will feel the pressure and frustration of achieving the right balance of strategy to means. A half dozen or so different strategies are available to play with.<br/><br/>The game spans 20 one-year turns, from 2001 to 2021. By the end of this time the U.S. side must either bring off a victory, or lose.<br/><br/>This is a tough, strange war and the game reflects that reality.<br/><br/>Download rules, map, counters, etc at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@153.EuETbiw6OXw.45@.1dd43f4f/0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@153.EuETbiw6OXw.45@.1dd4...</a><br/><br/>",

During the very same day, a battle took place, the battle that after many years later became a symbol of clash of old cavalry formations with modern tank units. Poles from Wolynska Cavalry Brigade bravely resisted the German attack of 4th Panzer Division. Regardless of concentrated tank assaults supported with artillery and airstrikes, Germans hadn`t achieved their objectives. Defenders suffered heavy casualties but retained fighting capability and continued to fight in the days to come.<br/><br/>Mokra, 1st September 1939 allows not only to recreate those events but also to check different hypothetical scenarios. Players decide about their forces` movement and they organize attacks or defense. Both sides enjoy certain advantages. Germans have large number of motorized units and strong air force. Poles need to make use of wooded terrain and an element of surprise - as Germans haven`t expected to encounter a such large cavalry formation in their way.<br/><br/>Players use basic rules of &quot;Great Battles of Small Units&quot; system - the same one that was used in &quot;Primosole Bridge: 14-17th July 1943&quot;. The same mechanic are employed to represent a different battle of World War II. Few special rules were added to represent specific elements of that battle, like for example - an armored train &quot;Śmiały&quot; or German motorized infantry.<br/><br/>",

After a countdown, the game begins and players must discard their cards in the centre of the table in the following order: Skeleton - Skull - Devil -  Skeleton - Skull ...<br/><br/>Each player must look at cards from their deck one by one and see if they can place it in the centre of the table continuing the sequence or not. If they can, they place the card on top of the previous cards and announce which card they have placed. On the other hand, if the card is not valid for the sequence, he must place it at the end of his deck and draw the next card.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player runs out of cards, and that player opens the portal to the afterlife and can be reunited with the souls of their loved ones.<br/><br/>Durante el D&iacute;a de Muertos, las &aacute;nimas de quienes han fallecido tienen la oportunidad de volver junto a sus seres queridos.

The game is played with 2 players. Each player has 7 building elements in the form of different tetrominos which are the be placed onto an 8x8 game board. The player who can place the last building on the board wins.<br/><br/>To make sure the board is variable, there are 3 trees which are freely placeable onto the board before starting. According to the author, that makes for over 4000 different variations. The game also comes with 6 play variants.<br/><br/>Additionally to the regular sized edition, there's also a smaller version of the game which is about half the size of the regular version.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Jijbent.nl (Dutch: turn based)<br/>     YourTurnMyTurn.com (English: turn based)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This year, 2017, marks the 20th birthday of Splotter as a company. We started in 1997 by going to the Essen games fair, not knowing what to expect. We had 20 handmade copies each of 3 simple games, in videoboxes. We sold about half of them. Since then, we have come a long way! We wanted to celebrate this history somehow with our fans. We considered printing T-shirts or making a book about our history, but we felt a game to be more appropriate!<br/><br/>KIEK, 20 years of Splotter is a special anniversary edition of the game KIEK. Kiek was originally developed in 1997 and published in 1998. As a game, it is much, much simpler than what we design these days. We are republishing it as a fan edition to celebrate Splotter's 20th anniversary.<br/><br/>KIEK, 20 years of Splotter features pictures of our games, prototypes and prizes made by our long-time friend, game photographer Henk Rolleman; in addition, we have added a number of historical photo's from Splotter's past. Although it is playable as a game, it's mostly fun if you've been following Splotter for a while. As we feel this is more a fan item than a Splotter game, we have printed a very limited quantity only.<br/><br/>The game was announced as a special surprise at Essen 2017. And yes, the box has a flavour text:<br/><br/>The key turns slowly in the heavy door. The lady leading the way lowers her voice: &quot;We are now about to enter the Splotter vault. It contains all the games they published in the past 20 years; those they didn't; prototypes, game pieces, demo games. Please be very careful, because everything is exactly where it needs to be.&quot;. The door opens, and it reveals.... &quot;Joris!!!&quot; (she is shouting now), &quot;you promised to clean up all this old Splotter junk!&quot;. Everything is everywhere... can you help to sort out 20 years of Splotter history?<br/><br/>KIEK, 20 years of Splotter is a re-edition of a game we published in 1998 (the second year of Splotter). It is also a set of 60 pictures that celebrate our Splotter years, the people who make and made Splotter to what it is now, and of course, all of our games. Be aware thatKiek is a completely different type of game from the ones that we publish today: it is short and simple. We invite you to see it more as a Splotter memorabilium than as a Splotter game. Or, if you like our set of rules, use them with your own set of pictures!<br/><br/>Changes from the first edition: made-up categories like &quot;non-blue&quot; etc. are no longer allowed (unlike in the earlier edition). It also has double the amount of photos, all new and with a common theme.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns drawing as many cards as they want from the deck, scoring a range of 1-5 Baby Points for each card drawn. There is no limit to the amount of times a player can draw cards, but as soon as she draws a Monster Parent, she loses all her cards in her Baby Zone and is forced to end the turn.<br/><br/>But wait, it is not as easy as it sounds. First of all, cards drawn are secretive and only known to the player drawing them. Players can guess at the total Baby Points of each other by the number of cards they drew, but not the exact Baby Points acquired. A player with 8 cards might only have an actual total of 9 Baby Points while a player who drew 5 cards could already be sitting on 10 Baby Points! This is where players try to match the amount of cards by drawing at least as many cards or more than their opponents in order to ensure their victory.<br/><br/>Play special abilities, sabotage other players' turns and store items to help you pave your way to the top of the Hill.<br/><br/>",

The safe and protected treasure are considered locked if a lock icon appears on the safe card.  A locked safe blocks opponents from stealing the treasure, but prevents you from extending it on future turns.  An unlocked safe allows you to later extend the treasure for big points, but leaves it vulnerable to steals.<br/><br/>Bluffing about the state of your safe cards is encouraged, particularly if it increases the uncertainty in your opponents&rsquo; minds as to which of your treasures are locked.<br/><br/>Points are awarded at the end of the game based on the size of each banked treasure.  Press your luck to create large melds and a huge score.  Players earn bonus points for Gold treasure, blocked steals, and unlocked safe cards.

Players take on the roles of Thorgal, his wife Aaricia, their son Jolan, and Kriss&mdash;a deadly female warrior&mdash;, and go on a series of adventures.<br/><br/>The game consists of 7 stand-alone scenarios, each taking roughly 90-120 minutes of play. Scenarios do not form a campaign nor have any legacy features, so they can be played by different playgroups and over an extended period of time.<br/><br/>Thorgal: The Board Game comes with a book of maps. Each scenario is played on a different map that players explore while fulfilling scenario goals and promises completely different adventures, hidden opportunities, and vivid characters. Players are free to choose whether they travel in one group or split to cover more areas at the same time. They also perform side quests that might help them win a scenario.<br/><br/>Another important feature in the game is the storybook containing narrative descriptions of the encounters that Characters make in each scenario. The adventures described in the book are specific to each scenario and Character, yet a lot of them are randomized within a scenario, offering higher replayability and allowing for repeated play. There are also Side Plots players can pursue to gain benefits and reveal additional pieces of the story.<br/><br/>Thorgal: The Board Game, while having a strong narrative element, offers a brand new, unique action selection mechanism. In this new mechanism, actions have varying power depending on which other actions have already been taken. Players carefully plan their strategy and sequence of actions taken, as this directly impacts the strength of the effect of each action. This creates an interesting decision space and makes each turn important for everyone at the table.<br/><br/>Another important mechanic involves Character development. Each character gains experience during the game and advances their abilities. This dynamic progress allows players to make meaningful decisions about how to develop their hero in the game. Characters gather resources and craft objects to help them survive in the dangerous world.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the start of each hand, the dealer deals 10 cards from the Shot Deck to each player and flips over the top two cards of the Target Deck.<br/><br/>Each Target is worth a number of points and players take turns playing a Shot card on each. The team that plays the highest valued Shot will win the Target and score the points, but you must play carefully, because shooting the wildlife might lose you points!<br/><br/>In addition, if a team wins both Targets, they might receive bonus points. A hand lasts five rounds; then points are tallied and recorded, and the deal passes to the left. Play continues in this fashion until one team scores a set number of points.<br/><br/>",

The game ends when a pirate with at least one treasure chest sails across the finish line. That pirate gets a bonus for finishing first but does not automatically win the game. The winner is the pirate with the most gold. The decision to end the game is a risky one and the game remains exciting right up to the last move when all the pirates reveal how much treasure they have recovered and the winner is determined. In this 'nautical' game, each pirate must 'sail' his ship to where the treasure chests are. Each pirate chooses the direction to sail his ship on the hexagonal board and which treasures to go after. How many spaces he can move in each direction depends upon the direction the wind is blowing. He can sail more spaces if he goes with the wind and less if he sails on an angle into the wind. Since the direction of the wind changes according to the roll of the dice, and is somewhat predictable, a good part of the strategy of the game is learning how to use the wind in order to sail your ship to where the treasure chests are. No special prior knowledge of sailing is needed.<br/><br/>",

It teems with new villains like the contemptible Cheese Wiz, Gothzilla (with earthquake-causing platform boot action!), and the Ratwoman. And lest you feel overwhelmed by villainy, this expansion also features new items, new Powers and a new Class: the Brain!<br/><br/>This game combines Super Munchkin and Super Munchkin 2.<br/><br/>Fr&uuml;her war es ein niedliches Munchkin-Spiel. Aber dann wurde es in mysteri&ouml;sen Energien gebadet, von einem radioaktiven Chihuahua gebissen und fasste ein uraltes G&ouml;tzenbild an. Nun fliegt es durch Super-City und k&auml;mpft f&uuml;r eherne Werte wie Wahrheit, Gerechtigkeit und noch h&ouml;here Boni! Schl&uuml;pf in die Rolle eines Superhelden und sei ein Mutant, ein Exot, ein Mystiker, ein Techno oder ein Superhirn. Je h&ouml;her deine Stufe ist, desto mehr Superkr&auml;fte kannst du haben. Bek&auml;mpfe niedertr&auml;chtige Teufelsgenies, verheerende Monster und aus anderen Dimensionen einfallende Au&szlig;erirdische &ndash; vom l&auml;ppischen Explodoman &uuml;ber J&uuml;rgen von der Grippe bis hin zum Gro&szlig;en Alten Planetenfresser &ndash; UND NIMM IHR ZEUG! Wenn du deine Unterw&auml;sche dr&uuml;ber tr&auml;gst, eine Lizenz zum Verw&uuml;sten hast und alle mit deinen Monologen langweilst, kann kein Feind vor dir bestehen!<br/><br/>Die Erweiterung Coole Capes ist in Super Munchkin bereits enthalten.<br/><br/>",

No shaker, no score pads--everyone rolls at once, makes as many combos as possible, and keeps track of their matches on their Dice Tracker card. Once a player has locked in a matching combo, they shout the fun name shown on the card such as &quot;The Spicy Burrito&quot; or &quot;Pair of Threeves&quot; -- and slap it before anyone else can. Power Up cards like &quot;Clumsy Roller&quot; and &quot;Dice Thief&quot; keep players on their toes with game-changing actions such as stealing a die from another player, or having opponents play with one hand behind their back. The Yahtzee game is easy to learn and quick to play, making it a great board game for family nights.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
