        "description": "from GMT website:<br/><br/>Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is a game of grand strategy for two to six players based on the military, political and religious conflicts within Europe during the reigns of Elizabeth I of England and Philip II of Spain. Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day. Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire. But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies. The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked. Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire. And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands. Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies? Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion. And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.<br/><br/>The six powers in Virgin Queen are:<br/><br/>     Ottoman<br/>     Spain<br/>     England<br/>     France<br/>     Holy Roman Empire<br/>     Protestants (Dutch &amp; Huguenots)<br/><br/><br/>Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556). Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged. New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century:<br/><br/><br/>     Religion: Streamlined from Here I Stand, the new rules for religious conversion and rebellion allow actions to be resolved quickly, reflecting the already entrenched presence of both Catholic and Protestant factions across the key areas of religious struggle.<br/>     World Map: Oceanic expeditions are now under direct player control as they sail to the Caribbean and beyond to seize plunder, found colonies, and attempt to circumnavigate the globe.<br/>     Diplomatic Influence: Alliances with minor powers (and major powers that can be activated in games with fewer than six players) are now made through a unified system where players buy influence at each of these foreign courts.<br/>     Weddings: Here I Stand&rsquo;s secret negotiation phase is still present here in Virgin Queen, but with a new twist. Now you will want to arrange marriages for each of the princes and princesses of your family dynasty with a suitable foreign royal. Will even the Virgin Queen succumb to love and take a husband, or will she jilt that suitor at the last minute once again?<br/>     Patronage: Your royal court will be visited by artists, writers, scientists, and architects, who all want you to invest in their endeavors for the glory and advancement of the realm. Will you sponsor Galileo, Cervantes, or Shakespeare or instead spend your treasury on a fruitless quest for the Philosopher's Stone?<br/>     Espionage: Beware, there is also a dark side to this period &ndash; a time of espionage and spymasters. In Virgin Queen you can ask your ambassadors to spy on foreign courts, send out handgun-armed assassins, invest in cryptology, and even recruit Jesuit priests for undercover missions of conversion. <br/><br/><br/>There are several different scenarios included allowing your play sessions to be tailored to the number of players and time available:<br/><br/>     Two-Player Tutorial: Great for new players just learning the series, this 90-minute game pits the Ottomans against Spain during the time of the Siege of Malta and Battle of Lepanto. Uses a subset of the full rules so you can dive in quickly.<br/>     Campaign Scenario: The full Virgin Queen experience, this eight-hour game can last up to seven turns and is normally played with from 4 to six players. Variant rules allow you to play with just two or three players if desired.<br/>     Armada Scenario: A quicker game focused on Turns 3 to 6 of the full campaign, this 4 to 5-hour game is ideal for tournament play. Once again supports from 4 to 6 players.<br/><br/><br/>",

Action is fast and furious and not all sleds may make it to the finish. Huskies only have one setting and that is full speed! Hang on to your furs, the reins, your sled and anything else you can get hold of.<br/><br/>The game contains modular track pieces which can be fitted together to form different courses. Players have their own Dog Decks which they draw from and play onto their sled mat. Movement is rarely in a straight line as the sled may drift left or right. Losing control or speeding into a corner results in Dent cards being acquired which will limit a player's hand size.<br/><br/>The game features a fun and original movement mechanism.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary <br/>Race courses are built randomly. Players each have a dog sled with 2 dogs (initially valued 3 each) and a brake (also 3). Each player has the same deck of cards (5 sets of cards 1-5, shuffled) from which they draw a hand of 5 cards.<br/><br/>On your turn, may play 1-3 cards of the same value to these 3 locations (dog1, dog2, brakes). Forward speed (and distance moved) = dog1 + dog2 - brake + bonus (=position in race) if (dog1 = dog2). Lateral movement distance = dog1 - dog2 (move to the side with the stronger dog). Certain parts of the track have speed limits; you take damage if you exceed them, or if you run into obstacles (ice patches, side of track, etc.). Damage = cards that take up space in your hand (so 5th damage --&gt; out of the race!).<br/><br/>The first player to cross the finish line wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The low land is a rough area where hard-working folk make a living by the sweat of their brow. Under constant threat of storm and flood, communities here rally together to build dikes that keep the rising water at bay. But every citizen constructing a dike is one fewer citizen tending flocks and maintaining the family farm. The residents here are constantly torn between selflessness and self-interest, and only those who can strike this delicate balance can thrive in this harsh landscape.<br/><br/>In Lowlands, you carve your farm out of this unforgiving land, gathering and spending resource cards to transform your farmyard into pastures that allow you to profit from breeding sheep. Adding expansions to your farm will unlock new options and score you victory points, but helping to build the dike that collectively protects all players is also rewarded. No matter what, the tide will rise and, if the dike isn't high enough, it could rush in and sweep away your hard-earned profits. Will you sacrifice your own farm for the good of the community, or will you pursue your own agenda? The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Even without the poor weather, life on a farm is one of constant work where you find yourself tending flocks of sheep, extending their pastures, and looking for the right moment to sell them for a profit. To complete all these tasks, Lowlands gives you a group of farmers that you can assign to various tasks around your farm. To get the most out of them, you must think strategically, deciding which actions you want to take and the best time to take them. Once they've been assigned, your farmers help you build a bustling farm where there was once scrubby bushes, trees, and lakes. You begin the game with only two sheep and a small pasture, but your farmyard is rife with possibilities, its many empty spaces inviting you to customize your farm as you see fit.<br/><br/>While you could simply focus on creating more area for your sheep to roam, the game also provides plenty of options for customizing your farm with various buildings and features. Not only are these tiles worth victory points at the end of the game, they also make your farm more efficient and more profitable. You might add a feeding trough to your farm, for example, to immediately earn another sheep and the ability to house two sheep per pasture space instead of just one. Or you could construct a lake cabin on your property to get away from it all for a bit. While this tile doesn't give you any special abilities, it increases the value in victory points of the farmyard spaces immediately adjacent to it. Ultimately, you are free to pursue whatever strategy you see fit, building a farm wholly your own.<br/><br/>On top of the challenges of building a successful farm, of course, you also have to deal with the tempestuous weather that comes with living on the wave-battered coast of the North Sea. Here, the tides always seem to rise a little higher, threatening to take a dent out of your profits by sweeping away some of your flock. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you always have the opportunity to send your farmers to contribute to the dike instead of working on your farm. When you do, you also commit resources to creating dike elements that are added to the board as a buffer against the rising waters. Add enough of these pieces and you might prevent disaster for everyone. The tide turns repeatedly, bringing with it new flood pieces. If there are enough dike elements in place to hold back the rising waters, players' farms are spared. If the dike breaks, however, you could be forced to take dike breach tokens that have adverse effects at the end of the game.<br/><br/>While lending a hand with the dike at the expense of your own farm is certainly a nice gesture that keeps everyone safe from the floodwaters, it has rewards of its own. For each resource you contribute to the dike, you advance one step up the dike track. Not only does advancing far enough on this track grant victory points, it also amplifies your reward if the dike holds and lessens the blow when it breaks. It is in your best interest, then, to keep pace with other players on the dike in order to protect your investments back home one the farm.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Acting together, this team places pieces judiciously on the available icons on the game board.<br/><br/>To get others to guess &quot;milk&quot;, for example, the team might place the question mark icon (which signifies the main concept) on the liquid icon, then cubes of this color on the icons for &quot;food/drink&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. For a more complicated concept, such as &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio&quot;, the team can use the main concept and its matching cubes to clue players into the hidden phrase being an actor or director, while then using sub-concept icons and their matching cubes to gives clues to particular movies in which DiCaprio starred, such as Titanic or Inception.<br/><br/>The first player to discover the word or phrase receives 2 victory points, the team receives points as well, and the player who ends up with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord.<br/><br/>",

Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk &mdash; and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...<br/><br/>In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.<br/><br/>Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.<br/><br/>Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests &mdash; or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.<br/><br/>During the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.<br/><br/>The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner!<br/><br/><br/>For a deluxe edition of this game, see Tiny Epic Quest: Deluxe Edition<br/><br/>",

Once the five-minute timer starts, the race is on to defeat all the monsters inside the dungeon. In order to defeat a monster, players must match symbols from their hand with ones on the monster's card. At the end of each dungeon is a powerful dungeon boss &mdash; and after the first boss is defeated, the campaign continues to the second boss. Each boss, and each randomized dungeon, gets harder until players reach the fifth and final boss.<br/><br/>",

Friendly forest dwellers will help you in different ways...<br/><br/>You are greedy and thirsty. Who will be the first to satisfy their appetite for Fabled Fruit?<br/><br/>Fabled Fruit is a Fable game, a new and unique concept in game experiences, where the gameplay changes over time. The game starts in an initial, simple state, but as you explore deeper into the game system, the mechanisms and gameplay will evolve over time.<br/><br/>You play the game many times, and each play changes the game slightly. Unlike in a Legacy game, however, the game is never permanently changed.  At any time you may easily restart a Fable game from the beginning, either after you have run through the entire game system, or at any time during the many plays you will get from this game system. This Fable Game will remain just as playable on the 20th play as it was on the first plays of the game.<br/><br/>Fabled Fruit FAQ<br/><br/>",

This is a system designed for balanced, small-scale tactical games that can be played quickly and easily by anyone, but which even experienced players will find challenging to master. The game rules are designed with competitive play in mind; matches can be played in under 45 minutes, on a smaller surface than our larger-scale games, and will be ideal for club or tournament play. And not only that, we&rsquo;ll be fully supporting an organized play system for this game, right from day one.<br/><br/>The forces you can use in this game will be drawn from races across the Mortal Realms, including some for factions that have not received any new miniatures since we first ventured into the Age of Sigmar. Each of these sets will be composed of a small band of easy-to-assemble, push-fit miniatures in the style of our single-pose heroes to represent a specific band of warriors from that faction. These are provided in coloured plastic, and clip together, so you can quite literally be playing with them within minutes of opening the box with no glue or paint needed! (Though they do look great painted, and your dice will roll better &ndash; probably.)<br/><br/>The game is played using unique dice and card decks, and these will, to an extent, be unique to each faction. Both decks of cards used in the game are fully customisable &ndash; meaning you can choose to create all manner of combinations of overlapping abilities to use and objectives to achieve. This can be a really rewarding part of the game &ndash; and means that even the same faction can be played in wildly different ways. We&rsquo;re expecting to see all sorts of combinations tried out at game stores, clubs and in tournaments.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Whether you want no negative interaction or a game more punishing than ever before, you will be able to set up YEDO to suit your needs and pause play style.<br/>- New modular components brings a lot of interesting mechanisms into Yedo: the Tea house with a set of unique helpers who'll join you for a turn, Specialists in place of regular Disciples, new types of missions and much, much more!<br/><br/>About the game:<br/>Japan, 1605 &ndash; Hidetada Tokugawa has succeeded his father as the new Shogun, ruling from the great city of Edo (a.k.a. Yedo), the city known in present times as Tokyo. This marks the beginning of the golden age of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the so-called Edo Period that will last until 1868. Naturally, the most powerful families in Edo immediately try to curry favor with the new Shogun &ndash; and this is the opportunity our clan has been looking for, our chance at power and glory. Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun. We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans. We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us. We will find glory and honor in the eyes of this new Shogun &ndash; or failing that we will end his rule by any means necessary.<br/><br/>In the strategy game Yedo, players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.<br/><br/>There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants. It's all up to you &ndash; but be careful to make the right choices, for in Yedo, eternal glory and painful disgrace are two sides of the same coin<br/><br/>full kickstarter deluxe edition is one large box plus mail tube total about 7.3kg<br/><br/>",

But this is no ordinary competition as all the most famous Fairy Tale characters will be looking on and occasionally lending a hand.<br/><br/>Who will benefit most from the cunning of Robin Hood, the beauty of Snow White, the bountiful gifts of the Golden Goose or the dark witchcraft of the Evil Queen?<br/><br/>Using only their wits, a handful of sharp steel tools, and a few stacks of resources gathered at great risk from fields, brickyards, and even the dark and deadly Grimm Forest itself, each player must compete to be the first to build 3 Houses and gain the title of Royal Builder.<br/><br/>Players are encouraged to use any of the devious tricks they have read about in the many books of Fables found throughout the land. Some will have their plans wrecked by that villain of old, the Big Bad Wolf, while others will gain bricks, straw, and wood by the cart load.<br/><br/>Who will brave the dangers, avoid foul monsters, and bring home the victory? There is only one way to find out... get ready to venture into ...The Grimm Forest!<br/><br/>Grimm Forest is a 2-4 player strategic game of Hidden Movement, Resource Gathering, and House Building. It is a medium weight game that plays in approximately 45-60 minutes.<br/><br/>During the game, players will play cards secretly to move to various Location boards where they attempt to gather resources. Using their deduction skills and a hand full of Fable cards, players attempt to guess each other's plans and make the most of their actions while disrupting the other player's plans.<br/><br/>After resources are collected during the Gather Phase, players will enter a Building Phase where they can use those resources to build Wood, Straw, or Brick Houses. Whenever a player builds a Wall Section on one of their houses, a helpful Friend from the nearby forest comes to lend a hand. Players may choose to accept the help of that Friend, but occasionally it makes more sense to send that Friend to a different player, sometimes discarding their current Friend in the process.<br/><br/>With 16 unique Fable cards and 12 powerful Friend cards, gathering resources in the Grimm Forest can be a difficult and challenging endeavor.<br/><br/>Work hard, deduce correctly, avoid the treachery of the other builders and the sharp teeth of the lurking monsters, and you just might have a chance!<br/><br/><br/>Bienvenue dans la For&ecirc;t de Grimm, o&ugrave; les membres de la famille des l&eacute;gendaires Trois Petits Cochons organisent une &eacute;pique comp&eacute;tition de construction de maisons.

        "description": "Introduction<br/><br/>The ancient Galactic Realm, ruled from the Core Worlds of the galaxy, is waning. Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations. But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves. The barbarian kingdom that achieves these goals will carve out the greatest empire in the galaxy.<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/><br/>Each player controls a barbarian Star Empire represented by many cards. Throughout the game, players will invade Worlds and draft new Units and Tactics into their Empires. Each card lists its Empire Points in the upper right corner. The player whose Empire contains the most Empire Points at the end of the game is the winner!<br/><br/>Game Terms and Game Play Mechanisms<br/><br/>Core Worlds is a deck-building card game for 2-5 players. The following are the central concepts of Core Worlds:<br/><br/>&bull; Central Zone: Throughout the game, new cards are drawn from the five Galactic Decks and placed face up in the Central Zone, the game's common play area. These cards include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade.<br/><br/>&bull; Empire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting Deck. A player's Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau).<br/><br/>&bull; Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.<br/><br/>&bull; Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault. A World's Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World.<br/><br/>&bull; Invasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions. A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.<br/><br/>&bull; Warzone: Each player's Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed. Players also deploy Units from their hands face up into their Warzones, and later use these Units to invade new Worlds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The second Master Set for the HeroScape series of games.<br/><br/>Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles. Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn. Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage - unless you are falling into water.<br/><br/>Combat in the game is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card. Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds. When the number of wounds equals the unit's life value, it is killed and removed from the board.<br/><br/>The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.<br/><br/>The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/>For years the Marro have been summoned to Valhalla to expand the will of Utgar at all costs. But rumors are spreading that within the uncharted jungle there is an even greater menace waiting. A great Marro Hive, hidden deep within in the jungle swamps and treacherous rock is continuously spawning new savage predators. These creatures, said to be venomous Marro, perhaps even Hivelords, will emerge from their colony and contaminate the world. Includes 24 detailed miniature figures and 75 interlocking terrain pieces.<br/><br/>This new Master Set includes everything you need to start your own adventures in the Heroscape world of Valhalla! There are 2 new Terrain Types: Swamp &amp; Swamp Water, as well as more Grass, Sand, Rock, and Water tiles to add to your existing Heroscape battlefields.<br/><br/>Also included in the set are 7 Unique Heroes, and 3 Common Marro Squads. However, the big news is the inclusion of the Marro Hive. The Hive has special powers directly relating to Common Marro Squad figures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the Northern Expanse, a place where nature is still unexplored, mystical and dangerous. When the humans first arrived, they thought they found an unspoiled paradise, filled with bountiful forests, lakes swimming with fish and cold freshwater flowing from the mountains. But as their settlements expanded and the surrounding forests grew thinner, nature itself pushed back. Great creatures known as Beasts emerged, and with their fangs, claws and mystical powers, they proved an incredible threat to the humans. In order to protect the settlements, humans enlisted specialised hunters, tasked with tracking and killing the Beasts before too many of their kin perish.<br/><br/>The Beast uses a deck of direction cards to move over forests, swamps and caverns, using guile and deceit to hide its track from the hunters. However, whenever a hunter moves over a location where the Beast has previously been, a trail appears. Only when a hunter searches a location or the Beast itself attacks an unsuspecting target is the Beast's actual position revealed. More so, each hunter has but one chance of searching each round, making it a tense and difficult decision. Hunters seldom have full information whether the trail they&rsquo;re pursuing contains the Beast&rsquo;s actual location, or if the trail has already gone cold.<br/><br/>Each action you perform in this game is done by playing a card from your hand (up to a maximum of two cards per turn). This means that if a player wants to search, attack or move, they need to have a card in their hand that lets them do that. Before each round, both hunters and Beast participate in a draft for the most important cards. All action cards can be used by both Beast and hunters alike.<br/><br/>In order to win this game, you either need to cooperate every step of the way if you play as a hunter, or skillfully outmaneuver your opponents if you play as Beast. On their own, hunters are never stronger than the Beast. Only when hunters communicate, strategize and combine their actions can they bring down the Beast before it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Decide whether you want to use the card as an extension to your fields (increasing your ability to grow olives, grain, or grapes), as an extension to your farm (increasing the number of pigs you can house, the deliveries you can make, or the coins you will earn each round), as a market barrow (providing a personal contract you can fulfill for valuable rewards), or as a hired helper (each providing a unique and powerful ability to improve your actions).<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame RoundEach game round follows a consistent and simple structure.<br/><br/><br/>     Farm Phase<br/>         Play a farm card (optional)<br/>         Draw new card(s)<br/>         Take income<br/>         Farm growth (harvest goods and pigs)<br/>         Purchase roof markers (optional)<br/>    <br/>     Revenue Phase<br/>         Roll revenue dice<br/>         Draft a revenue die and perform the associated action (in turn order; repeated once)<br/>         Common action (undrafted revenue die)<br/>    <br/>     Transportation Phase<br/>         Choose donkey marker<br/>         Advance on siesta track and reset turn order<br/>         Deliver goods to common markets in the village, or to fulfill personal contracts<br/>    <br/>     Scoring Phase<br/>         Score victory points based on your position on the siesta track<br/>         Reset the siesta track<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>At the end of the sixth game round, the game ends, wherafter the players convert remaining farm goods and coin into victory points.

The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain&rsquo;s history in important ways, creating countless interesting &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; scenarios. What if Boudicca&rsquo;s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?<br/><br/>In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.<br/><br/>",

To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player takes one card from their hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of their choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., &quot;Stink bug&quot;. The player receiving the card either<br/><br/><br/>     Accepts the card, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in their claim, they keep the card on the table in front of them face up; if they are right, the player who gave them the card places it face up before them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Peeks at the card, then passes it face down to another player, either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must take the first option.<br/><br/><br/>Whoever lost a challenge and had to place the card before them on the table begins the next round.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on their turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of them. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.<br/><br/>",

In a delicate balance of resource management and area control, players must plan their building strategies while carefully managing their supply tracks to refine the right resources at the most opportune times. Stay a step ahead of the competition and you could lead the West into the Golden Age.<br/><br/>The goal of Gold West is to accumulate the most victory points through clever management of your growing mining empire. There are five resources in the game: the metals Copper, Silver, and Gold are used to acquire victory points in a variety of ways, while Timber and Stone are building materials used to build camps and settlements on the board to collect more resources and influence the landscape.<br/><br/>Each hex contains either two or three resources. Gold generally earns players the most points, with silver and copper yielding slightly less. In addition, each terrain type scores points for the player with the most influence therein at the end of the game. Copper terrains are the most valuable, with Silver, Gold, and Forest Terrains earning slightly fewer points.<br/><br/>When gaining new metals and materials, players place them in their &quot;supply track&quot;, a mancala-style track in which you will manage your resources. You get points the further back in the track you place them, as this creates a more refined product, but it will take longer to get these resources to the front of the supply track where they can be used. Shipping, investments, and Boomtown offices often reward players who fulfill them earlier, so it's a careful balance of risk and reward.<br/><br/>",

Restlessly, they'll move their pieces on the game board, facing constant challenges in terms of making their beautiful villages on this beautiful island as profitable as possible. Only those who will be able to use their dwindling resources to meet the increasing demands over five rounds will find a spot for themselves on the beach.<br/><br/>In Hawaii, players must make use of their limited resources to score points by growing their villages and exploring the surrounding islands. Your chieftains move around the board to purchase new tiles for their villages, hopefully grabbing the best deals before their opponents. Three different currencies are used to pay for these trips, so make sure you don't run out of any of them too quickly. Players are also rewarded for providing for their people (measured essentially by how much they bought on a given turn), but your meager income shrinks as the game goes on. Players will have to balance a number of ways to score points to secure their victory.<br/><br/>",

Whether you are looking for the best husband for your only daughter or a suitable wife for one of your two sons, whether you are looking to add new blood to your family by marrying into foreign nobility &ndash; you will be working to make your family rise in status through prestige and wealth, new skills and abilities.<br/><br/>In Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy &ndash; known previously as Nobles of Paris and winner of Ducosim Spelontwerp in 2009 &ndash; you will find 75 spouse cards with unique traits, more than twenty secret missions, nine titles, and nine &quot;contribution to the family&quot; cards. This all culminates in a highly thematic card game that will satisfy players who enjoy exploring many different paths to victory.<br/><br/><br/>Legacy is a worker placement game in which you take actions to improve the standing and/or wealth of your family. You will expand your family, creating an ever-growing tableau, the family tree. You will need to balance the three 'currencies' in the game, Prestige (converts to Honor points at the end of each generation, of which there are three), Income (your income which converts to hard cash at the end of each round, of which there are 9), and Friend cards (which are actual connections/friends, and are the only way to marry into wealthy/famous families, and can only be received through actions, such as  marrying a woman who brings some of her social contacts with her).<br/><br/>Prestige, Income and Friend cards can be gained and lost. You can, for example, lose some prestige by marrying someone infamous or lose some Honor points (i.e. reputation) by asking friends for money. There are also numerous actions you can take that will affect one of the three 'currencies' detrimentally, such as bribing someone to get a title (for which you need to pay, but also in the loss of friends who felt they deserved that title, and not you), or the maintenance of a beautiful new park you have built for the people (losing you income). Finally, you can also take actions that result in the loss of some of your social contacts (friends), due to jealousy, or people simply no longer wanting to be associated with you.<br/><br/>These currencies are carefully balanced by the male and female friend cards in the game. Generally men will give you income and possibly prestige, but will cost you a dowry/wedding costs. Women, on the other hand, will give you connections (new friends you can choose from the current socialites (cards lying open on the table) and possibly prestige, and will sometimes even earn you a dowry!<br/><br/>The card interactions allow for multiple different paths to success, but you must choose your road strategically, planning out where you want to be headed, else you will be left behind in the dust by those with greater and more successful plans than yours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Martin Wallace's streamlined redesign of Brass: Lancashire.<br/><br/>Players are tycoons in the early days of the Industrial Revolution; a time when traditional craftsman were being rapidly replaced with steam-powered machines. Players invest in the production of raw materials, the manufacture of goods, and the transportation networks needed to connect them to their markets.<br/><br/>Like Brass, the strategic space is vast, and player decisions are limited by cards. In Age of Industry, however, cards are color-coded to regions rather than specific cities, allowing the players to be more flexible with their plans, while at the same time continuing to limit the decisions available. The color-coded region cards will also support expansion maps.<br/><br/>In addition, the original Brass rules were simplified by eliminating the canal period; there is only one period, the railway era. There is also a new, non-specific industry, which will change with each map.<br/><br/>According to Wallace, &quot;You can now play something with the depth of Brass, but in half the time. The game will have a double-sided map, with Germany on one side and southern New England on the other.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Goods shipments, intended for transport along sea routes, are in danger of gathering dust in the warehouses or being lost at sea in a storm. While the players speculate about success and failure, the ultimate fate of the ships will be determined by the dice.<br/><br/>There are four shipments that need to get to Manila - jade, ginseng, silk and nutmeg. A round begins with an initial auction to become harbour master. If you win, you'll be allowed to buy a share of one of the shipments, choose which three shipments you'd like to take down river and how likely they are to make it to their destination in the harbour. If they make it to Manila, their share price will increase. The aim of the game is to bet on the outcome of these shipments, with dice ultimately determining their fate. How many of the three boats will make it and which ones? Would you like to provide insurance against possible failed ships or perhaps you think pirates will snatch a chance to take control? Manila is a fun family game that takes minutes to learn and brings the river boats of the Philippines to life!<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.<br/><br/>Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.) You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Rivals for Catan is a reimplementation of Catan Card Game.<br/><br/>The Rivals for Catan was released in German in September of 2010, on the 15th anniversary of the original card game. An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.<br/><br/>Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.<br/><br/>The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.<br/><br/>Ways to Play:<br/>The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/>The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

The Cave Goblins seek merely to throw themselves upon any foe with the will to fight. The Guild Dwarves sit in their mountain halls, jealously guarding their ancient riches. But with the discovery of the Summoning Stones comes a new kind of combat, and now these two great races will help set off the War for Itharia.<br/><br/>Summoner Wars: Guild Dwarves vs. Cave Goblins gives players everything they need to join the War for Itharia, as either of these great races. Will you play the Guild Dwarves, whose knowledge of siege warfare knows no rival? Or will you play the Cave Goblins, and swarm your foe with your fanatical hordes?<br/><br/>This Summoner Wars Starter Set provides two complete Faction decks, as well as all the materials needed to play games of Summoner Wars.<br/><br/>",

The organizer who has earned the best reputation when the fair begins will emerge the victor.<br/><br/>On each turn of World's Fair 1893, the active player sends a supporter to one of the five areas and gathers all of the cards in it. New cards are then added to some of the areas, and the next player takes a turn.<br/><br/>The five areas represent sections of exhibits, like Fine Arts and Electricity. Cards may represent exhibit proposals in one of those five areas, influential people who provide bonus supporters, or tickets for attractions and concessions along the Midway.<br/><br/>The game consists of three scoring rounds, each triggered when players collectively gather a certain number of Midway tickets. Players gain reputation points for leading in number of supporters in an area and for gathering the most tickets in each round. The leaders in an area also receive approval for exhibit proposals they have gathered that match the area. Players gain reputation points at the end of the game based on the breadth and diversity of their approved exhibits.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's web page:<br/><br/>During the Crisis of the Third Century, the Roman Empire nearly collapsed in the face of calamitous internal and external strife, including continuous civil war and barbarian invasions from all directions.  Beginning with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus, a period of 50 years saw nearly as many different men seize imperial power over all or part of the Empire, until the reforms of Diocletian in 284 AD ushered in an era of peace.<br/><br/>In Time of Crisis, 2-4 players take the reins of Roman dynasties, gathering and wielding influence among the senate, military, and people of Rome to ensure that their legacies are remembered by history instead of being lost to the mists of time.  Starting from control of one province and a few low-value cards, you are challenged to establish your base of power during this fragile period of Roman history.  You must build your armies, take control of valuable provinces, develop your support, and defend yourself against barbarian incursions, inopportune events, and the machinations of your political opponents.<br/><br/>Time of Crisis is easy to learn and playable in about 2-3 hours.  It incorporates popular game mechanisms such as deckbuilding and hand management, but also delivers a true light wargame experience.  The historical flavor is strong, with many meaningful decisions and opportunities presented to players on the board.  This game finally fully closes the loop between deckbuilding card games and board games.  Your cards dictate what actions are available to you on the board, and in turn, your position on the board directly determines how you can add or remove cards from your deck to make yourself stronger for future turns.  Will you specialize in manipulating the Senate, wielding the power of the Legions, or being a man of the People?  Or will you master a blend of all three?  In a twist unlike most deckbuilding games, you have the privilege of selecting the cards that compose your hand each turn!  However, you still need to eventually work through  your entire deck before you can use your cards again, so deck management and timing is critical.<br/><br/>All of the key elements of the era are present in Time of Crisis:  civil wars between competing generals and governors, Roman legions defending the frontiers against barbarian tribes, Senate favoritism, barracks emperors, even angry mobs, inflation, the Praetorian Guard, and the ability to carve off your own piece of the Roman Empire.  Can your dynasty arise as the new leaders of the Roman Empire before Diocletian emerges and brings peace once again?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A lively game of horse racing where players bet on several of seven horses to try to gain the most money by the end of three races.<br/><br/>Winner's Circle is a re-issue of Knizia's Turf Horse Racing (published by Gibsons Games). This new version has updated graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse they want to move (from those that haven't moved this turn yet). The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and must either cooperate or compete to get their horses over the finish line.<br/><br/>There are various differences between Winner's Circle and Turf Horse Racing. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval instead of a straight line. The horses start on separate starting spaces instead of all together on the same space. During the race, horses cannot share spaces so if a horse has to move to an occupied space, they have to move back to the last available space. A Pace chip has been added to space 18 where the first horse to pass it receives it and earns a higher payout at the end of the race (if they finish top 3). Also, there is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 1, 1, and 2 betting chips of the basic game.<br/><br/>Originally called &quot;Royal Turf&quot; but was then republished by Face 2 Face Games as &quot;Winner's Circle&quot; in 2006.<br/><br/>&quot;Royal Turf&quot; is #2 in the Alea small box series.<br/><br/>",

They crushed Earth&rsquo;s paltry fleet within a week, and broke through the great planetary shield that protected the surface. Bright blue oceans turned to an irradiated wasteland as they bombarded the planet, shredding the remnants of thousands of years of human history. Markan, last captain of Earth&rsquo;s forces, made a final, desperate attempt to survive, salvaging an abandoned Worldship from hundreds of years past. She took command and headed for the fringe of the galaxy, where there was a chance to gain a foothold, grow in strength, and find new allies for the fight against the Kurross. Earth&rsquo;s long-time enemies, the Zun and Decima Empires, soon followed in their own Worldships, leaving behind decimated worlds and lost family, determined to stake their own claim of the fringe.<br/><br/>In Empires of the Void II, you have been given a mission  to establish a foothold at the fringe of the galaxy for your galactic empire. The game begins when your massive Worldships reach the fringe, where you must explore, wage war, use diplomacy, and construct buildings to gain victory. The fringe is sparsely populated and the few local sentient species are struggling to survive, leaving huge regions of planets open for exploration and colonization. Many species are eager to ally themselves with a powerful empire to gain security and stability in a chaotic and difficult time.<br/><br/>As you explore and interact with planets, you will discover unfolding stories of the fringe. Each inhabited planet is home to a unique alien species, with their own goals, values, and problems. Will you give aid by fighting off pirates, transporting goods, and curing strange diseases? Or will you invade and rule with a cruel hand? This may be your last chance to prepare before the Kurross meet you again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Study in Emerald is a game for two to five players based on the award-winning short story of the same name by Neil Gaiman. In this stylistic mash-up of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft, the worst has already happened and the world is now ruled by the Old Ones. However, a secret war is being fought to free mankind from their servitude. The game A Study in Emerald fleshes out this core idea by including historical figures from the late nineteenth century, most being persons involved in the anarchist movement of the time.<br/><br/>Deck-building forms the core of the game. You use influence cubes to bid for the right to draft cards and take control of cities. Each player has a secret identity, either a Restorationist fighting against the creatures or a Loyalist attempting to defend the status quo. Which side you are on determines what you score points for. An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side. More specifically, when the game ends &ndash; and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent &ndash; then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game.<br/><br/>The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Archaeology: The New Expedition is a reimplementation of the popular Archaeology: The Card Game (with several changes).<br/><br/>You are an archaeologist working the dig sites of the Egyptian desert. Search for the right pieces to complete torn parchments, broken pots, and other priceless artifacts. Explore an ancient pyramid in the hope of uncovering a huge stash of treasure! Trade shrewdly at the local marketplace to increase the value of your collection. Sell your treasures to the museum at just the right time for maximum profit.<br/><br/>But beware, the desert also has its dangers! A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!<br/><br/>In Archaeology: The New Expedition, you want to find treasures and make the most money possible by selling them to the museum. Players start with four treasure cards in hand; one monument tile is chosen at random, then the chambers of the monument are loaded secretly with treasure cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player digs for treasure by drawing from the deck. If they find treasure, they don't show anyone and keep it; if they find a thief, they steal a card at random from an opponent; and if they find a sandstorm, all players lose half of their cards in hand to the marketplace, which starts the game with five face-up cards. (Each player has a tent that they can discard to avoid the effects of one sandstorm.) After digging, a player can:<br/><br/><br/>     Discard one or more maps to explore one chamber of the monument, looking at all the cards there and keeping some number of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Trade at the marketplace by laying down one or more treasure cards and picking up cards with equal or lesser trading value.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Sell to the museum by placing sets of treasure cards in front of them; in general, the more cards you have of a type, the more the set is worth.<br/><br/><br/>Players can explore only once, but they can do the other actions repeatedly, and they can take these actions in any order. Once the deck is empty, players keep taking actions until they all pass in turn, after which they sell treasures to the museum. Whoever ends up with the most money wins!<br/><br/>According to the designer, Archaeology: The New Expedition differs from Archaeology: The Card Game through the inclusion of tent cards, the addition of new treasure types and additional cards to allow for five players, the adjustment of some treasure values, and the inclusion of six monuments instead of one to have more variety when exploring.<br/><br/>",

Players compete for victory points, which come mainly from contracts (sets of resources) and special cards (like a collected set of 1-4 identical &quot;counting offices&quot;, the port rewarding collected ship cards etc.). The game is built on two core concepts:<br/><br/>1. Players bid for cards by building &quot;towers&quot; with their meeples over them. Each meeple in a tower increases the cost of a card - but only for players &quot;below&quot; it. This is the main mechanic of the game - players must consider WHEN to bid (place their meeple) over a certain card and when to use their meeples to make others pay more. This is important, because a player can make only three bids during a round.<br/><br/>2. Players are punished by negative points for not collecting firemen cards. Thus, ignoring security may cost a player a victory. By many players, the &quot;punishing&quot; mechanic is considered a trademark of the author - Stefan Feld.<br/><br/>The deck is divided into four seasons - winter, spring, summer and autumn. In later seasons, more powerful cards appear, so players need to think ahead in managing their resources.<br/><br/>---- Promotional blurb from the publisher ----<br/><br/>Hamburg around 1900 - the gate to the world. Within the harbour there stretches a unique complex of storehouses: Speicherstadt. The network of canals and bridges houses a terminal for spices, coffee, tea and carpets from all over the world.<br/><br/>As one of Hamburg&acute;s wholesaler at the heyday of the Speicherstadt you acquire shiploads for the storehouses, not too expensive, of course, as you like to make a profit selling them. Who makes the best deals within a year and supplies his clients with the right goods will be the winner of the game. But beware! Sudden fires cause heavy losses. You might be advised to invest in fire protection early.<br/><br/>Playing Speicherstadt you will be thrilled by the simple and original mechanism of acquiring desired action cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/>Antike is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided. Players choose from Greeks, Romans, and Germanic tribes and Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, and Babylonians.<br/><br/>Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first will win the game!<br/><br/>Lead one of these nations to victory! But watch out for your enemies, as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.<br/><br/>",

In the game, players choose combinations of special powers and races from the Warcraft universe, such as Portal Mage Pandarens or Herbalist Goblins, and vie for control of Azeroth. To help them achieve dominance, players will occupy legendary terrains and seek control of powerful artifacts. However, all empires must eventually fall, so players need to be ready to put an overextended race into a state of &quot;decline&quot; and lead a new one to rule Azeroth.<br/><br/>In more detail, on each turn either you use the multiple tiles of your chosen fantasy race to (normally) occupy adjacent territories, possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race and let it go into decline. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side. At the start of the game or after you go into decline, you choose a new race/power combination at the start of your turn, with the 16 races and 20 powers being paired randomly each game.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you score one coin for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.<br/><br/>Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.<br/><br/>At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.<br/><br/>Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.<br/><br/>After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).<br/><br/>After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The board is replaced by a square grid made of nine street cards. The suspects, and among them Mr.Jack, are pictured on the cards. Holmes, Watson and a dog are turning around the grid, a system already used by Bruno Cathala in several games, and can &ldquo;look&rdquo; at the streets in a row or column. Every round, like in Mr.Jack, four actions are available. The first player selects one, his opponent two, and the first player then uses the last remaining action. Actions allow moving a detective one or two spaces clockwise around the grid, turning a card in order to change the view of the streets, swapping two street cards or drawing an alibi card. At the end of the round, Mr.Jack states if he can be seen by one of the detectives. Of course, the detectives must identify Jack, who must stay hidden long enough to escape.<br/><br/>",

Each player will take the role of the Hall Monitor once and at the end of the game the winner will be the one with the most points on their fish cards.<br/><br/>The penguins can be flicked in a straight line, make curves and even jump over the walls! Each player will have to use the best of their skills in order to get the most points in this fun and exciting game. It's not just cool, it's ICECOOL!<br/><br/>",

The action is driven by two decks of cards for each side.  Each turn, each side simultaneously chooses four action cards from a hand of ten, and places them in order.  The actions are then carried out one at a time, alternating sides.  Combat is resolved using special attack and defense dice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Las Vegas Royale combines the original Las Vegas dice game from 2012 with some elements of the Las Vegas Boulevard expansion from 2014.<br/><br/>Las Vegas is an easy-to-learn, dice-rolling game that includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat in the basic game, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.<br/><br/>Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked &quot;1&quot;. You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the highest-valued money associated with it, then the player with the secondmost dice takes the next highest-valued money card. In case of a tie, the non-tied player with the most dice takes the highest-valued money card at that casino, while the tied players get bupkis.<br/><br/>Las Vegas Royale includes twelve expansion tiles, and to play a more involved game, you can place an expansion tile at random by each casino. These tiles have special abilities on them, and by placing dice on them, players can activate these abilities. The expansion components also include a larger than normal die for each player that counts as two dice.<br/><br/>",

Whenever no unplanted box is visible on a bed, you have completed it, then you count your points and replace it with a fresh, unplanted bed. You gain points for all of the visible plant pots and planting bells.<br/><br/>In more detail, players select various polyomino tiles of flower beds from a central market grid, depending on the location of the &quot;gardener&quot;, then place them on one of their two personal garden boards. Each board has several garden elements that are worth points when not planted over, and these are scored on two different tracks as soon as a garden has been finished. Crossing over a line on each track awards bonus tokens that can fill in empty spaces or give you a better selection of the flower bed tiles. Whenever a garden is finished, you receive a new one to complete. After the gardener completes her fifth lap around the market, the game enters its last round. The player with the most points from their completed gardens at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Cottage Garden is the first part of Uwe Rosenberg's puzzle trilogy.<br/><br/>",

When it is time to leave, all these birds mix together, unable to organize themselves into flocks to fly home.

On your turn, you lay a series of identical birds from your hand on one fence's extremity. These birds instantly gather with any identical bird already present on this fence, making all birds placed in-between them fly into your hand. With enough identical birds in your hand, you can perform a flock, allowing you to add some of these birds in your scoring area.<br/><br/>Your ultimate goal is to be the first player to gather in your scoring area either seven different species, or two species with at least three identical birds in each. Each bird comes with one small and one big flock scores, so you may want to wait to reach a big flock to add more birds at once to your scoring area. Beware, though, as the round ends as soon as a player empties their hand, forcing all players to discard their current hands and plans!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is based on the first two movies of the Predator series. Taking on the roles of characters from the films, players take turns recruiting cards for their deck from a central selection in order to improve their deck and defeat Predator cards that are added to the central game board.<br/><br/>In more detail, within the setting for each film you can play as the humans or as the Predators. As the humans, you play the co-op version of the game as in Legendary Encounters: Alien, recruiting, scanning and attacking the same way while trying to achieve objectives. When you play as the Predators, the game is player vs. player instead of co-op, with each player assuming the role of a Predator hunting for the most honor (VPs).<br/><br/>Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is a standalone game in the Legendary Encounters series that is fully compatible with Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game. Specifically, you can use the Predator deck in Alien or the Alien deck in Predator. Similarly, Predator is also compatible with the Marvel superheroes version of Legendary but cannot be fully integrated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player gets a cup with five poker dice and eight dollars. Each turn, a player will put together a poker hand and depending on the roll, take control of various key places in Dice Town that will allow him to perform the corresponding action of the location.<br/><br/>In a turn, all players shake their cup and take out all but one die, which is kept apart from the others. They repeat the process with the remaining dice until all five dice are on the table. Players may want to keep more than one die; they pay one dollar for each additional die.<br/><br/>Now the locations are checked...<br/><br/>Nines: In the gold mine, the player with the most 9's may take one nugget from the mine for each nine he has thrown.<br/><br/>Tens: In the bank, the player with the most 10's may rob the bank and take all bills there - each two bills represent one victory point at game end.<br/><br/>Jacks: The player who has the most J's goes to the general store and draws as many cards as he had thrown J's, keeping one. These cards may give from one to eight points, or entitle a player to perform the saloon or general store action twice in a row, place a die with a result of a player's choice under the cup without rolling, or steal 4 dollars from another player. There are many more cards of this kind that spice up the game.<br/><br/>Queens: The player with the most Q's in his roll wins the favor of the girls, and takes advantage of their charm to steal from an opponent. He may take as many cards from his opponent as he has thrown Q's, keeping one and giving back the others.<br/><br/>Kings: The player with the most K's becomes the new sheriff; he decides who wins in any ties, but the sheriff can be influenced with nuggets, cards, or money.<br/><br/>Aces/Poker hand: In the town hall, the player with the best poker hand gets a property claim worth from one to five victory points. Having aces in the best poker hand permits taking additional cards.<br/><br/>Finally, if a player did not win anything during a turn, he might visit Doc Badluck where he can choose any one of the following:<br/>- equip oneself with barbed wire - the player has two property claims that cannot be stolen;<br/>- draw the first card from the general store pile;<br/>- all other players must give the player two dollars;<br/>- an ace will bring a nugget from every other player.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more gold nuggets in the mine or when all property claims have been issued. Players count their points: 1 for each nugget, 1 for every two dollars, 5 for whomever is currently sheriff, and each general store and property card for its value.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The oasis-like basin Faiyum was artificially built 3,900 years ago by enlarging the Bahr Yussef channel that connected to the Nile to create a regulated flood plain. During the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, this swampland was slowly changed into farmland under the aegis of pharaohs such as Amenemhet III and Sesostris II. They ordered their advisors to build a system of canals and dikes to reclaim the land surrounded by desert and inhabited by crocodiles to turn it into a granary for Egypt.<br/><br/>Now, during the reign of Amenemhet III, you are the pharaoh's advisors, commanded to harvest goods, build roads, found settlements, and do much more for the good of Faiyum! You are being supplied with the necessary manpower, resources, and money, which means that if another advisor needs to use &quot;your&quot; roads, farms, and other buildings, they may do so since everything you build is owned by the pharaoh. The only thing you will own is the only thing that matters: the respect of the pharaoh.<br/><br/>Faiyum is a strategic game for enthusiasts of planning games. The basic rules are simple: Play your cards one by one on your personal discard stack. After playing some or all of your cards, you take them back into your hand in &quot;reverse&quot; playing order, so playing cards in the best order is important. Newly purchased cards go directly into your hand, so the timing of getting and playing them is important, too. Each of the individual cards has easy-to-understand actions, but only by creating the best combined &quot;engine&quot; will you be a master advisor of Faiyum.<br/><br/>This game features a card mechanism reminiscent of deck builders and the market mechanism successfully used in Power Grid.

        "description": "In the land of Fabulosa, powerful magics have rendered war obsolete. With nothing else to compete for, the bored populace has turned to the Super Brawl for entertainment. These same powerful magics are now used to reach back into the timelines to pluck out the finest warriors from every civilization in order to compete against each other in the greatest entertainment spectacle ever staged.<br/><br/>Super Fantasy Brawl is a fun, fast-paced competitive miniatures board game. Players select a team of three champions and combine their unique action cards to create a synergistic action deck. The game is faction-free, so players have their choice of any combination of champions they wish. Each turn, the players use their hand of action cards to maneuver, attack, displace enemies, and claim objectives to score victory points.<br/><br/>The objectives in Super Fantasy Brawl are only scored at the beginning of a players' turn, ensuring that you always get a chance to disrupt your enemy's plans and position your champions to score the objective for yourself. This tactical to-and-fro continues until one player reaches the victory point threshold, declaring themselves the winner and advancing towards victory in the Super Brawl tournament!<br/><br/>Super Fantasy Brawl will also offer a 2v2 mode for 4 players to clash in an all-out melee mashup!<br/><br/>",

Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.<br/><br/>The master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothl&oacute;rien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption &mdash; not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.<br/><br/>Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated &mdash; and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring. To win, throw the One Ring into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.<br/><br/>This game should not be confused with Reiner Knizia's children's game (Lord of the Rings) with the same title, or with his very different two-player Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.<br/><br/>Lord of the Rings - Limited Edition<br/><br/>A special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001.

Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire. You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.<br/><br/>Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau. Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions.<br/><br/>At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war. Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle. Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet. Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet.<br/><br/>Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game.<br/><br/>Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths &mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Reckoners, a game based on the young adult fantasy novels by Brandon Sanderson, allows players to take on the roles of the novels' protagonists and work together to save the world.<br/><br/>Background:<br/>10 years ago... A mysterious burst in the sky gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. They're called Epics. But, every Epic turned out to be evil. Today, in the city once known as Chicago (now Newcago), an all-powerful Epic named Steelheart reigns supreme!<br/><br/>Nobody fights back... nobody but the Reckoners! This is where you come in. You are a member of the Reckoners, a skilled group of normal humans who assassinate Epics. Your mission is simple, but not easy. Take down Steelheart and his Epics and save the city.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The Reckoners is a simultaneous, co-operative game for 1-6 players that plays in 75 minutes. You win by defeating Steelheart. But before you can defeat him, you must first discover his weakness. Throughout the game, you will work with your fellow Reckoners to research and attack Steelheart, but he is not alone. Numerous Epics are scattered throughout the city, and they will wreak havoc upon the population, if left unchecked. If the Epics manage to destroy Newcago by reducing the population to 0, then all Reckoners lose.<br/><br/>The Reckoners determine which actions to take primarily through a simultaneous, dice rolling mechanism, where each player can keep and reroll results up to three times at their own pace. Equipment Cards and Plan Tokens will also allow you to gain extra actions or improve/manipulate the results of your dice. Actions are resolved simultaneously as well, so communication and collaborative planning are key to ensuring optimal outcomes.<br/><br/>Your dice can be used to attack Epics, research Epics, contain Epics, attack Enforcement, earn money, acquire Plan Tokens, move around the game board, remove barricades, and activate special equipment powers. Researching and Attacking Epics will help you earn valuable rewards, including clues about Steelheart's weakness. But, there will always be more Epics than you, so you have to choose your battles wisely. When all actions have been taken by The Reckoners, then it's the Epics turn.<br/><br/>Each round, all of the Epics are going to activate, performing an array of actions and then powering up to be even more devastating next round. Each Epic also has a unique set of actions it performs, so you're always facing multiple threats that function very differently. The crux of the game is deciding how to resolve these competing threats and prioritize your actions together to eliminate Epics and ultimately win the game. How, when, and where you act will determine your victory or failure.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>In short, The Reckoners plays like a challenging, ever-shifting puzzle. If you like co-operative games where you carefully manage resources, build powerful action combos, create tactical plans with your teammates, and work together to take down the bad guy while on the brink of defeat, then be sure to check out The Reckoners.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If someone else plays the same amount of cards with a higher number, however, your cards get nicked! Stealing cards can be good, but if you can't use them later, and end the game with cards in hand, they'll cost you points.<br/><br/>In more detail, the deck contains 104 number cards (1-13 x8) and five joker cards. Each player starts with a hand of 13 cards, and six cards are laid face-up next to the deck. On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same value, adding jokers if desired; if she already has cards on the table, she lays these cards so that previously played cards are still visible. If any opponent has most recently played the same number of cards and those cards are of a lower value, then the active player &quot;abluxxes&quot; those opponents &mdash; that is, the active player can take the abluxxed cards into her hand and the opponent then draws the same number of cards, either from the display or the deck; if she doesn't take these cards in hand, then the opponent either returns these cards to his hand or discards them and draws that many cards. Refill the display only after someone finishes drawing cards. (Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)<br/><br/>As soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent. Each player scores one point for each card on the table in front of him, then loses one point for each card in hand. Whoever has the highest score wins. If players wish, they can play multiple rounds and sum their scores over the rounds to determine a winner.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you must either place a worker onto a location outside the Coricancha OR choose two of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Recruit one worker.<br/>     Take two god cards.<br/>     Draw two army cards and keep one of them.<br/>     Move your High Priest one or two steps clockwise within the Coricancha.<br/><br/><br/>When placing a worker, you must first discard a god card with a matching symbol or pay one gold. Once placed, the worker remains on the game board for the rest of the game! Each worker placement location is connected to exactly three action spaces. You must always perform at least one of these actions. However, for each adjacent worker (i.e., connected to your worker's location via direct path through one of the action spaces) that matches the type of worker just placed, you receive one additional action!<br/><br/>While some locations will result in you being able to perform multiple actions, other actions and placements may be more desirable, especially since each of the five types of workers has a unique ability:<br/><br/><br/>     Warrior: Remove one of the adjacent workers, placing it in your player area.<br/>     Craftsman: Gain +1 action if placed onto a craftsman space.<br/>     Architect: Gain +1 action if placed onto an architect space.<br/>     Courier: Decreased placement cost; +1 action if it's the first worker placed within a given area.<br/>     Priest: Take one god card; you may pay one potato to gain +1 action.<br/><br/><br/>All god cards feature one of the different symbols found on the worker placement locations. Before placing a worker, you must either discard a god card with a matching symbol or pay valuable gold resources. God cards also depict special abilities that can be activated only if you have previously built a matching statue!<br/><br/>Army cards allow you to send one or more units to conquer villages in nearby regions. You must compete against the other players for control of each region as well as for valuable rewards that can be gained as a result of military conquest.<br/><br/>The position of your High Priest within the Coricancha has a significant impact on your overall strategy, affecting your access to powerful actions and determining any potential resource costs when placing your workers. More specifically, when placing a worker, you must pay additional resources the farther your worker is from your High Priest, from nothing all the way up to eight potatoes or corn!<br/><br/>Additionally, when moving your High Priest, you can activate powerful actions available only within the Coricancha:<br/><br/><br/>     Produce: Gain all rewards from your production buildings.<br/>     Worship: Sacrifice previously sculpted statues to gain permanent temple advancements.<br/>     Offering: Pay resources to gain temple advancements.<br/>     Conquer: Engage in military conquest of nearby villages.<br/>     Rejuvenate: Refresh previously activated buildings and military units.<br/><br/><br/>Throughout the game, you score victory points whenever you construct stairs or sculpt statues. Gain bonus victory points whenever another player makes use of the stairs you have constructed. Score victory points from temple advancements and control of the four regions.<br/><br/>The game ends when the worker pool has become exhausted, symbolizing the full incorporation of nearby regions and villages into the newly risen Inca Empire. You then score bonus victory points from reaching the top of the temple, from your woven tapestries, and from various buildings and resources you have accumulated.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Wolves is a pack-building strategy game for 2-5 players. It's survival of the fittest as you compete to build the largest, most dominant pack by claiming territory, recruiting lone wolves, and hunting prey. But be careful not to expand too recklessly into terrain where your rivals thrive &ndash; they may lure members of your pack away.<br/><br/>A clever action-selection mechanism drives your choices. Each action requires you to flip terrain tiles matching the terrain where you wish to take your action. These double-sided tiles mean the actions you take this round will set up which terrain types you can act on in the next round. As you take actions to expand your pack's control of each region, you also upgrade your pack's attributes, allowing you to take more aggressive actions as the game goes on.<br/><br/>In three mid-game scoring phases, power is calculated in each region. At the end of the game, players tally points based on VP tokens earned in these scoring phases and the highest VP number revealed in each of the six tracks on your player board. The player with the most VP wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The 2-6 players try to guess the animal's weight, length, height, tail length and - most important - the areas in which the animal lives on the Earth. The early bird gets the worm: an area on the big map or a sector on the scales already occupied by a player token cannot be chosen a second time. When no player wants to set another token the round ends and the scoring is performed. Tokens on correct spaces get points for the corresponding player, also tokens in the direct neighborhood of correct spaces score points. Tokens not earning points are temporarily out of the game - so risk should be carefully considered. Next round - next animal - starting player changes. The first player who reaches a certain total score wins (normally after 8-12 animals).<br/><br/>",

They also try to outdo one another by building tall, mostly square-based tower homes as status symbols.<br/><br/>In Firenze, you are master builders working on the families' construction commissions for such towers. Each player competes to earn the most prestige points by completing the commissions from families and the church and by placing their seals on the work they have done. When someone plays their final seal, the other builders get one more turn before the final scoring.<br/><br/>Colored bricks are the currency of the game, and cards can both help and hinder your progress. On a turn, a player must choose a card from the display, taking the bricks from it and paying a brick to every card skipped. There is an opportunity to exchange three bricks for one on display before the player works in their construction site. Players can have multiple towers under construction at once. However, for every brick they wish to add on a turn, there is an extra cost, and if any towers are not built upon during a turn, then they are torn down as abandoned construction. Players must pay attention to other projects so that commissions they were counting on are not snatched away before they can claim them.<br/><br/>This game won the second prize at the &quot;Hippodice e.V.

Your eyes and ears may deceive you, but the hair on your neck tells you what you already know: There are ghosts here &mdash; and not just one for these spirits are legion.<br/><br/>In Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters, a.k.a. Geister, Geister, Schatzsuchmeister!, four intrepid treasure hunters are on a quest, searching for precious hidden jewels, but the phantoms  in this house do not give up their bounty easily. As their ghoulish numbers grow, the treasure hunters must work together to acquire all eight jewels and escape the house before it becomes fully haunted or else face their own gruesome demise.<br/><br/>Players roll dice to determine how many spaces they move this turn and whether a new ghost is added to the board. Players may move up  to the number of spaces shown on the die. If they end their movement in a space with a treasure, they may pick it up and place it in their backpack. If they end their movement in a space with a ghost, they fight that ghost by rolling a fight die. If they roll the matching symbol, they remove the ghost from the game board.<br/><br/>If the players must add a third ghost to a room, it transforms into a haunting. A haunting requires at least two people in the room to attempt a fight with it. Players win if they can get all eight treasures and their whole team out of the house; they lose if all six hauntings are on the board.<br/><br/>",

It is a &quot;hidden role&quot; game, in which one player is initially the Thing and the others players are humans. The purpose of the Thing is to infect others, to prevent the survivors from escaping from the base (which can happen three different ways), or to try to escape with them by behaving as a human.<br/><br/>In addition to these elements, players also have to manage Outpost 31. On the map are the same rooms as seen in the film, and each of these rooms allows players to perform a different action. Human players have to feed themselves and keep the boiler and the generator on to avoid being in the cold and dark. The Thing will try to sabotage these places to make life difficult for humans...or not, trying to camouflage itself among the humans and infect them when the perfect opportunity presents itself.<br/><br/>The goal of the game designers was to bring the same personal emotions and paranoia that the protagonists of the film experienced to the gaming table.<br/><br/>",

The available actions are:<br/><br/><br/>     Buy a tile<br/>     Build a wonder<br/>     Reroll some or all your dice<br/><br/><br/>Buildings and military provide dice. Colonies and wonders provide resources and victory points. Advisors provide rerolls.

Books are accumulated and scored. Player order is checked, with high military strength going first in the next round. At the end of the game, whoever has the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

Railroad Revolution drops you straight into the middle of these tempestuous years; a time that changed America forever.<br/><br/>In Railroad Revolution, you will manage your own railroad company, ruthlessly competing to be the most powerful railroad tycoon across all America. You will build railroads, establish stations in your connected cities, expand the network of telegraph lines, and chase your objectives, increasing the value of your company with every action you take.<br/><br/>You start with mainly a team of non-specialized workers, but during the game you can hire additional ones with specific skill sets. The cost or effect of an action is determined by the type of worker that does it. To complete your company objectives, you will have to remove some of your workers from your active pool, promoting them to managerial positions. You must carefully assign each of your workers to perform the right action at the right time in order to exploit their specializations in the best way. You need to decide which ones to promote and which are instead still needed to take actions, as your priorities will change from turn to turn.<br/><br/>Railroad Revolution is a fast paced game with relatively simple rules, and it provides you with interesting and challenging decisions. Having a good strategy and finding the correct timing to implement it, is the key to winning the game.<br/><br/>",

The people of the valley will reward you handsomely if you harvest and exploit our many resources, open paths through the mists, and help our settlers build new structures. Cooperate temporarily with other builders in order to create paths and share goods, but do not forget your own objectives. Will you have a statue erected in your honor on the Nebula City plaza?<br/><br/>A game of Via Nebula starts with a board showing a hexagonal grid, some production sites with a few available resources on them (wood, stone, wheat, and pigs), building sites in various areas scattered over the whole board, and a lot of mist.<br/><br/>Turn after turn, players have two actions at their disposal from these options: They may clear the mist of a hex to create new paths of transportation, open new production sites, open a building site in a city, carry resources from any production site to their own building sites, and, of course, achieve a construction. Resources and paths through the mist may be used by all the players. This initially induces a kind of cooperation, but eventually other players will take advantage of your actions!<br/><br/>To achieve a construction, you fulfill a contract on one of your cards. You start the game with two contracts, and four more contracts are available for all players to see and use on a first come, first served basis &mdash; and that's where the cooperation abruptly stops. Additionally, most contracts have special powers that are triggered on completion.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player finishes a fifth building. Opponents each take two final actions, then players score based on the number of cleared hexes and opened production sites and the point value of their contracts, with a bonus for the player who ended the game.<br/><br/>",

You take on the role of a Ranger, a protector of the mountain valley you call home: a vast wilderness transformed by monumental feats of science and technology devised to save the Earth from destruction long ago.<br/><br/>You begin by building a deck that reflects your Ranger's interests, personal history, and personality. Then, as you explore the open world and your story takes shape, you augment your deck with improved equipment, refined skills, and the memories of your journey.<br/><br/>The story of Earthborne Rangers is presented as a branching narrative campaign consisting of a main storyline and a multitude of side stories. In it, you can choose to follow the critical path or to strike off on your own to discover the Valley's many engaging characters, mysterious ruins, and beings both familiar and strange.<br/><br/>Each game session represents one day in the Valley, and you'll pick up in the same location on the map where you rested the night before. Your goal is to either complete one of your available missions or to explore the open world. The session ends when you're either forced to rest (through either fatigue or injury), or you choose to rest for the night.<br/><br/>An individual game session is played in rounds, and those rounds consist of turns. On your turn, you perform one action: either play a card from your hand, or choose an action from a card on the table. Each action allows you to interact thematically and narratively with the world, and each time you take an action, the world comes to life around you.

        "description": "The Atiwa Range is a region of southeastern Ghana in Africa consisting of steep-sided hills with rather flat summits. A large portion of the range comprises an evergreen forest reserve, which is home to many endangered species. However, logging and hunting for bushmeat, as well as mining for gold and bauxite, are putting the reserve under a lot of pressure.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the nearby town of Kibi, the mayor is causing a stir by giving shelter to a large number of fruit bats in his own garden. This man has recognized the great value the animals have in deforested regions of our planet: Fruit bats sleep during the day and take off at sunset in search of food, looking for suitable fruit trees up to sixty miles away. They excrete the seeds of the consumed fruit, disseminating them across large areas as they fly home. A single colony of 150,000 fruit bats can reforest an area of up to two thousand acres a year.<br/><br/>Just like that mayor, in Atiwa, you know that fruit bats &mdash; once scorned and hunted as mere fruit thieves &mdash; are in fact incredibly useful animals, spreading seeds over large areas of the country. By doing so, they help to reforest fallow land and, in the medium term, improve harvests. This realization has led to a symbiotic co-operation between fruit bats and fruit farmers. The animals are kept as &quot;pets&quot; to increase the size of fruit farms more quickly. Tall trees are left as roosts, providing shelter for them rather than hunting them for their scant meat. However, if you have a lot of fruit bats, you need a lot of space...<br/><br/>In the game, you will develop a small community near the Atiwa Range, creating housing for new families and sharing your newly gained knowledge on the negative effects of mining and the importance that the fruit bats have for the environment. You must acquire new land, manage your animals and resources, and make your community prosper. The player who best balances the needs of their community and the environment wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Merchant of Venus uses many elements that come together to form a very interesting game. Players take on the roles of space traders who move their ships through interconnected systems discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities in a unique supply-and-demand system, their earnings can be used to purchase better ships and equipment (shields, lasers, engines, etc...) and construct their own spaceports (which speed up trading) and factories (which create better commodities). Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat. The player who first acquires enough total value ($1000, $2000, $3000, $4000) in cash and port/factory deeds takes the day.<br/><br/>For the 2012 edition of Merchant of Venus from Fantasy Flight Games, the company promises that this revision &quot;remains true to its magnificently campy core while updating the map and game components and expanding game play in surprising ways that will cause even the most hardcore fan to celebrate.&quot; That said, the player count has been lowered from six (in the Avalon Hill edition) to four, with the four races in the game being Human, Whynom, Qossuth, and Eeepeeep.<br/><br/>",

You have 6 Gear dice, representing the gears of your car. You'll be rolling these dice to move, and each one allows you to move 1 space along the track.<br/><br/>The dice must be rolled in ascending and/or descending order, and each die can only be rolled once per turn.<br/><br/>You also have a Coast dice that allow you to maintain your current speed, which can help you wring a few extra spaces of movement out of your turn.<br/><br/>If there's a sharp corner coming up, you can use Brake dice to drastically reduce your speed, but beware, they also make maneuvers more dangerous.<br/><br/>Each die has a certain number of Warning symbols. If you get 3 in one roll, you'll spin out! Losing control of your car will lose you time and distance, and even causing damage to your vehicle.<br/><br/>You can choose to play it safe by rolling your dice one by one. If the warning symbols start stacking up, you can end your turn whenever you choose without suffering any consequences.<br/><br/>Rallyman GT is a fast, exciting racing game with simple mechanics and rules.

The winner will be the Empire with more population and prestige at the end of the game.<br/><br/>With a growing empire, feeding your people is the main goal. Wheat was scarce in Greece, so both players must secure other goods supply and the route to five markets in order to trade them for wheat. Each territory may give you different amount of wood, metal, wine, olive oil, silver and some wheat; these two last ones are hard to get but precious. It&rsquo;s up to you if you want to get more of only one good or less from several of them. Every turn you get goods from a territory you must have some population there (supporting your Empire) but in the end they also have to be fed.<br/><br/>Fighting for the control of the territories and the sieges of the polis will be the job of your hoplites, your triremes will struggle to secure the routes to Egypt, Persia...so you can trade with them when the price is low, and a good use of your Diplomatic may convince a Polis to join your League easily.<br/><br/>A Polis may be your ally, but they are very proud of their independence, so you will have to create some Projects (statues, temples, artists, philosophers, games...) in order to gain Prestige which is needed for all your military manoeuvres.<br/><br/>",

Heroes such as Thrall, Warchief of the Horde; Varian Wrynn, King of Stormwind; Sylvanas Windrunner, Banshee Queen of the Forsaken; and many more are at your fingertips. As the Scourge grows, more undead will populate the board. Throw dice as you enter into battle against the hordes of ghouls and ferocious abominations, using hero cards to add power to your attacks, block incoming assaults, heal wounds, take mounts to far off spaces, and so much more.<br/><br/>As you fight your way to the Lich King, all manner of dark magic and terrible creatures under his control need to be neutralized. This comes in the form of quests, a brand-new mechanism that can be completed as a team through a combination of dice rolls and the hero cards at your disposal.

A Distant Plain teams Volko Ruhnke, the award-winning designer of Labyrinth: The War on Terror, with Brian Train, a designer with 20 years' experience creating influential simulations such as Algeria, Somalia Interventions, Shining Path: The Struggle for Peru, and many others.<br/><br/>A Distant Plain features the same accessible game system as GMT's recent Andean Abyss and upcoming Cuba Libre but with new factions, capabilities, events, and objectives.  For the first time in the Series, two counterinsurgent (COIN) factions must reconcile competing visions for Afghanistan in order to coordinate a campaign against a dangerous twin insurgency.<br/><br/>A Distant Plain adapts familiar Andean Abyss mechanics to the conditions of Afghanistan without adding rules complexity.  A snap for Series: COIN (GMT) players to learn, A Distant Plain will transport them to a different place and time.  New features include:<br/><br/><br/>     Coalition-Government joint operations.<br/>     Volatile Pakistani posture toward the conflict.<br/>     Evolution of both COIN and insurgent tactics and technology.<br/>     Government graft and desertion.<br/>     Coalition casualties.<br/>     Returning Afghan refugees.<br/>     Pashtun ethnic terrain.<br/>     Multiple scenarios.<br/>     A deck of 72 fresh events.<br/><br/><br/>... and more.<br/><br/>As with each COIN Series volume, players of A Distant Plain will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent operations and capabilities.  Flow charts are at hand to run the three Afghan factions, so that any number of players&mdash;from solitaire to 4&mdash;can experience the internecine brawl that is today's Afghanistan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/><br/>Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.<br/><br/>This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.  Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.<br/><br/>",

They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you've spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.<br/><br/>So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn't help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors' warnings. When you slowly lift the cover of the terrible book, dozens of dreadful creatures rush out, threatening to destroy the world itself! This was your mistake, and only you can fix it now! Learn from the library to fight back against the monsters, and try not to sink into insanity...<br/><br/>The Big Book of Madness is a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they've just freed.<br/><br/>Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. &mdash; but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells...<br/><br/>If you manage to turn six pages and defeat all of the monsters, you win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Runebound is a classic adventure game from Fantasy Flight Games in which mighty heroes must take on the perils of Terrinoth. The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.<br/><br/>Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).<br/><br/>Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.<br/><br/>Runebound is playable solo and is expandable by many adventure packs that alter the final challenge (replacing the Dragonlord for example). Runebound 2nd Edition also has a series of big box expansions that provide a new map or central map overlay to alter the game in some way.<br/><br/>Runebound 2nd Edition is different from 1st Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by 2 10-sided dice, which helped to better balance the luck factor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Hare &amp; the Tortoise, originally published as Royal Turtle, is a card-driven betting game about animal racing loosely based on one of Aesop's Fables.<br/><br/>At the start of a race, each player secretly bets on up to two of five animals: turtle, rabbit, lamb, wolf and fox. One animal is chosen at random for each player, then after receiving a hand of seven cards, each player places one of his cards face-down (possibly the same animal) as an additional bet. Players then take turns laying down 1-4 cards, with all cards needing to show the same animal, then refilling the hand to five cards. As soon as eight total cards have been played or four cards of any one animal, the animals move (maybe).<br/><br/>Each animal has a distinct characteristic that players can use to their advantage. The turtle always moves one space, but it moves two if four of its cards were played. The rabbit always moves two spaces as long as cards are played. &mdash; unless four cards are played and it's at the head of the pack, in which case it sleeps and doesn't move. The fox moves as many spaces as the number of cards played. The lamb moves one more space than the number of cards played &mdash; but if it reaches water, it stops moving to take a drink. The wolf moves 1 space if one to two cards are played, and one less space than the number of cards if more are played.  The wolf also has 3 cards with a howl, if one of these is played no one but the wolf moves.(The track consists of eleven road cards, two covered with water.)<br/><br/>After the animals move, players start a new round of card-playing. A round ends when three of the five animals reach the goal, after which each player scores points based on the ranking of the animals and how they bet. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The original title of Royal Turtle is a homage to Reiner Knizia's Royal Turf, another betting game about animals racing (albeit horses in that game).<br/><br/>",

A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.<br/><br/>The Marvel Dice Masters: Uncanny X-Men starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook. Booster packs include two dice with two matching character cards.<br/><br/>",

To do this, you'll need to farm, fish, friend and find all kinds of different resources to fulfill your Grandpa's Goals and restore the Community Center. Collect all kinds of items, raise animals, and explore the Mine. Gain powerful upgrades and skills and as the seasons pass see if you're able to protect the magic of Stardew Valley!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to complete Grandpa's Goals and restore the Community Center, which requires you to gather different types of resources represented by tiles. You have a fixed amount of turns to accomplish this. This is driven by the Season Deck of 20 cards, one of which is drawn each turn to trigger certain events. Cooperatively the players decide each turn where they will focus their individual actions and place their pawn in that part of the Valley. Using their actions, they visit specific locations, trying to gather resources to complete their collective goals. Actions include things like: watering crops, trying to catch fish, rolling dice to explore the mines, and many more. When the Season Deck is exhausted, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

Each faction involves a different gaming mechanism - the pirates move the cards, the zombies bring back the cards from the discard pile, the dinosaurs have enormous power - and each combination of factions brings a different gaming experience.<br/><br/>During the game, basic cards (each with their own difficulties and abilities) are at stake. You try to have the most power on the basis of your minions when the base is broken. Sounds easy? Is it easy when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to tie your minions to other Bases - flat Murder them? What happens when the Pirate-Dinosaur Full Sails player and frees King Rex to trample your minions in the ground, or when wizard-zombies use their mystic power to create an outbreak, suddenly flooding minions on the base of the discard pile? Or if you were facing a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an epidemic of massive beasts at the same time?!?<br/><br/>When a base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, brother, next time.<br/><br/>With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try. Pirate-Aliens play different Ninja-Aliens, for example. Which one will you use to crush your opponents?<br/><br/>And did we mention dinosaurs have laser beams?<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Smash Up: Munchkin<br/>    Smash Up: Pretty Pretty Smash Up<br/>    Smash Up: The Big Geeky Box<br/>    Smash Up: Science Fiction Double Feature<br/>    Smash Up: Monster Smash<br/>    Smash Up: The Obligatory Cthulhu Set<br/>    Smash Up: Awesome Level 9000<br/>    Smash Up: It's Your Fault!<br/>    Smash Up: Cease and Desist<br/><br/><br/>",

Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation.<br/><br/>If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.<br/><br/>In the game CO₂, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others.<br/><br/>In CO₂, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.<br/><br/>Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you've built, UN Goals you've completed, Company Goals you've met, and Expertise you've gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company's reputation &ndash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course.<br/><br/>",

The dreamer can guess what the element of the Dream is at any time, placing the card to the good spirits team side if the guess was correct and in the naughty spirits pile if it was not. <br/>At the end of the round the Dreamer and the good spirits get a point for every card in the good spirits pile, when the naughty spirits get one point for every card in the naughty spirits pile. The tricksters get points according to how well balanced the two teams were at the end of the round, gaining extra points if they managed to equally balance the two piles.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the dreamer must use the words he guessed and story-tell his dream for extra points before he opens his eyes.<br/><br/>You can learn how to play in a few minutes and have a great laugh right from the start.

Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you&rsquo;re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.<br/><br/>Alternate Description of Quarriors<br/><br/>In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.<br/><br/>Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!<br/><br/>",

Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.<br/><br/>In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.<br/><br/>While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.<br/><br/>Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.<br/><br/>All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gods are powerful and... bored! Make a bet with the others, use your unique powers and gather the most believers in the Archipelago of the Navel of the World. Flick of Faith is a flicking area control game in which players are sending their prophets into the islands by flicks. Make sure people heard about you on every island. Even better if you can get the domination - the winning is close. But be careful! To make the bet more interesting other gods would use every sneaky trick.<br/><br/>The game is divided into 4 rounds. Each player picks a god with unique power, for example ability to send a gigantic monster into the map. Besides that everyone has 5 prophets in a form of wooden discs and a few temples of their own color.<br/>Every round splits into 3 simple phases.<br/><br/>     Council Phase - players draw two cards with unique rule modifications and vote for the one they want to apply into the game. Once the voting is over, new rule comes into play.<br/>     Mission Phase - every player in their own turn flicks one of their prophets into the map. Prophet may knock other prophets off the map or help them to catch an island. Gods can also use their special powers. This phase ends if there is no prophet left in any god's pool.<br/>     Conversion Phase - each god gains victory points for every island they have a prophet or temple on. God gains bonus victory points if they dominate the entire island.<br/><br/><br/>Moreover there is the Navel of the World Island. This one grants a lot of bonus points depends on how well are your prophets spread over the archipelago, but is also really difficult to reach. If your prophet can manage to take the city, he builds a temple for your greatness.<br/><br/>After that all prophets are taken off the map and the round ends. Now you have entirely new generation of prophets to flick into the archipelago.<br/><br/>After 4 rounds bonus points are dealt out and the winner is the god with most victory points gathered so far. <br/>Numbers included in the section above may vary depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Insider is a game that deals with these questions. While communicating to others, you have to find the right answers to a quiz or find the &quot;insider&quot; who is manipulating the discussion. The insider will do everything to hide their identity while misleading the others.<br/><br/>In more detail, players are assigned roles at random. One player is the &quot;master&quot;, and they secretly select a word from a set given in a deck of cards. (In a variant given in the rulebook, they can freely select and write down a word.) The &quot;insider&quot; player, whose role is not known to the other players, will then secretly view the word. The rest of the players are known as &quot;commons&quot;. The commons then have approximately five minutes in which to ask the master &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;-type questions so that they can deduce the secret word. The insider attempts to secretly lead the commons towards the correct word. If the commons fail to guess the correct word, everyone loses.<br/><br/>If, however, the word is correctly guessed in the allowable time, the master flips the sand timer, and the commons and master have until the sand runs out to discuss the game and deduce the identity of the insider. If they guess correctly, they win the game together; if they do not, the insider wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Terror in Meeple City (formerly known as Rampage), you arrive in Meeple City as a gigantic, famished, scaly-skinned monster! Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples &ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.<br/><br/>The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:<br/><br/><br/>    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.<br/>    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.<br/>    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.<br/>    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.<br/><br/><br/>Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.<br/><br/>In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.<br/><br/>Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.<br/><br/>",

Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, &agrave; la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular &amp; Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.<br/><br/>Wilderness War takes two players into the French &amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.<br/><br/>Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance.<br/><br/>Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ? and Andean Abyss and other Series: COIN (GMT) games.<br/><br/>",

Find your way among the illusions, but beware of the traitor in your ranks!<br/><br/>The Grimoire guides their team towards the exit using images, upon which they point at certain details. Working together, the other players have to find the exit as quickly as possible while avoiding picking the wrong cards.

A wide variety of traps are on your way to the exit of the library, making player communication harder!<br/><br/>Obscurio is a family game, an original mix between an image-based communication game and a secret role game in which the players have to be careful when sharing ideas with their team. Supported by rich contents, Obscurio proposes a fresh new experience in its genre by putting the emphasis on the details of the images and the constant doubt created by the presence of the traitor.<br/><br/>Communicate efficiently and avoid the illusions on your way to escape the Sorcerer's library!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shogun / Samurai Swords is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It was later rereleased by HAH under the name Ikusa. The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.<br/><br/>In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.<br/><br/>The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.<br/><br/>Winner of 1988 Origins Awards:<br/><br/>     Best Pre-20th Century Board Game<br/>     Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game<br/><br/><br/>",

Over time, though, someone might decipher who you are through your actions or through Hermit cards, or you might even reveal yourself to use your special ability.<br/><br/>The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early because once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack with impunity using their special abilities like Demolish, Teleport, and Suck Blood or their equipment cards such as the Rusty Broad Ax or Fortune Brooch. This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious&mdash;or a civilian, in the right circumstances, might claim victory.<br/><br/>The 2011 edition of Shadow Hunters from Z-Man Games includes the Shadow Hunters: Expansion, a set of ten new characters previously sold separately.<br/><br/>",

The game is set in Europe. Each player is provided with a pool of wooden tokens to represent their civilizations.  Each player selects a combination of civilization tiles, which give his civilization special abilities or characteristics.  Players enlarge their empires through territorial expansion, often at the expense of other players.  The key to the game lies in choosing when to allow your active civilization to go into decline in order to select a new one that will generate more points.  Play continues with the cycling of civilizations until a certain score is reached, whereupon final rounds are played and a victor is determined.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Small World (released in March 2009)<br/><br/><br/>",

They must be skillfully careful: Who will position the penguin on top of the crocodile, the sheep on top of the penguin, the serpent on the sheep?  The hedgehog wants to stand on top of the pyramid but the height is making him dizzy.<br/><br/>Tier auf Tier (a.k.a. Animal Upon Animal, Pyramide d'animaux, and Dier op dier) is a simple stacking game, listed for ages 4-99, with 29 cute wooden animals.<br/><br/>Each turn a player rolls the die and either places one or two animals on to the stack of animals, passes one of his or her animals to another player for them to place, or places an animal on the table, extending the base for other players to build upon. Of course, if any pieces fall off whilst you are building, you get up to two of them back. The first player to have used all of their animals wins.<br/><br/>This game, intended for children, is equally popular with adults.<br/><br/>",

Using a ground-breaking development of the programmed paragraph solitaire system, Ambush! gives the player control of an American squad, faced with a variety of missions against an ever-changing, hidden German foe.  The variable events, innumerable tactical options, and wealth of unexpected occurrences make Ambush! a solitaire gaming experience unlike any that has gone before. The easily learned rules are specially designed to get the player into the action within minutes.  The player selects and arms his squad, providing each soldier with command and initiative ratings, perception, weapons skill, driving skill, and movement capability. After selecting one of the eight missions provided, the player sends his squad into a mission map to conduct operations called for in the mission.  Soldiers move freely, as far as the player wishes, checking for events each time they move...until the sequenced action rounds are triggered by the whine of German bullets!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "China is an abstracted game of political influence in China. Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region. At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.<br/><br/>This fascinating game of domination combines multiple tactical possibilities with simple-to-learn rules and a short playing time!<br/><br/>Even today in China, the unmistakable evidence of a fascinating story is everywhere. Hundreds of years ago, the country teetered on the brink of a change in power. Regional rulers fought continuously with each other with only one goal in mind: to become the new Emperor. They erected imposing houses and sent their emissaries to the regional courts.<br/><br/>China is based on the award-winning game Web of Power by master game designer Michael Schacht. China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. <br/>A special variant with fortifications is included.<br/><br/>Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.<br/><br/>",

To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players. On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., &quot;Stink bug&quot;. The player receiving the card either:<br/><br/><br/>    Accepts the card, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Passes the card to another player, peeking at it first, then keeping it face-down and either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must accept it and make a true/false claim.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.<br/><br/>To this, Kakerlakenpoker Royal adds new rules and new nasty &quot;royal&quot; critters to create more options for players during the game.<br/><br/>",

After the Spanish Civil War, a group of loyalists to the Republic continued the armed struggle, forming resistance groups better known as &quot;Maquis&quot;. Hidden in the mountains, these men and women risked their lives to defend the ideals of democracy and freedom.<br/><br/>Fighting against them were the Army of Franco, the Civil Guard, and the Armed Police, but the Maquis perfected their guerilla warfare in France during the second World War and were determined to take back their homeland. In the head of each Maquis resonated the echo of the desire of many compatriots: Resist!<br/><br/>Resist! is a fast-playing, card-driven solitaire game in which you take on the role of the Spanish Maquis, fighting against the Francoist regime. Over a series of rounds, you undertake increasingly difficult missions, and completing missions earns you the points needed to win. Failing to defeat missions and enemies may cause you to lose. At the end of each round, you must choose whether to end the resistance or risk it and take on another mission.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, you assemble a team of twelve Maquis, which are represented by a deck of cards. At the heart of the game is the tension between keeping your Maquis concealed from Franco or revealing them to unlock their full potential. Unfortunately, revealed Maquis are removed from your deck, and you likely won't be able to use them for the rest of the game. While Resist! does have some minor deck-building elements, it is primarily a &quot;deck-destruction&quot; game in which you have to manage your deck, balancing the decision of defeating the immediate threat with trying to move on to the next mission.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thunderstone: Dragonspire is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.<br/><br/>A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.<br/><br/>Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire! Featuring all-new art for every card (even Militia and Daggers), experience point tokens (not cards!), and the all new &quot;Setting&quot; cards which alter the game on a global scale.  Dragonspire includes 18 new village cards, 11 new heroes, and 8 new monster sets.<br/><br/>With enough cards to play the game right out of the box, this is a great Thunderstone edition for those just getting into the game.<br/><br/>Dragonspire also has a new storage box format, plastic XP tokens, and a brand new Dungeon board to help players keep up with light and darkness.<br/><br/>Thunderstone: Dragonspire is not a an expansion, but is instead a separate stand-alone game that may be played along with components of Thunderstone.<br/><br/>NOTE: The Dragon-Humanoid divider included with the game is meant for a future expansion as a promo.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fallout is a post-nuclear adventure board game for one to four players. Based on the hit video game series by Bethesda Softworks, each Fallout scenario is inspired by a familiar story from the franchise. Survivors begin the game on the edge of an unexplored landscape, uncertain of what awaits them in this unfamiliar world. With just one objective to guide them from the very beginning, each player must explore the hidden map, fight ferocious enemies, and build the skills of their survivor as they attempt to complete challenging quests and balance feuding factions within the game.<br/><br/>As they advance their survivors' stories, players come across new quests and individual targets, leading them to gain influence. Who comes out ahead depends on how keenly and aggressively each player ventures through the game; however, if a single faction is pushed to power too quickly, the wasteland will be taken for their own, and the survivors conquered along with it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A desperate fight is taking place every single turn. The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them and use black magic rituals to achieve victory.

        "description": "Netrunner is a cyberpunk-themed collectible card game.  The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).<br/><br/>Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.<br/>An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.<br/><br/>One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the &quot;board&quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.<br/><br/>Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).<br/><br/>Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.<br/><br/>Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players in The Game try to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win, but they need to do so in the right ways.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 6-8 cards in their hand depending on the number of players, and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing &quot;1&quot; and an up arrow and two showing &quot;100&quot; and a down arrow. On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.<br/><br/>After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.<br/><br/>Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn. If you play all 98 cards, you win! If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge.<br/><br/>",

Twelve houses from our town have already burned down!&quot;<br/><br/>In Evacuation, life on our planet is being burned away thanks to increasingly intense sunlight, so everyone is trying to move all the people and factories in their territories from the &quot;old&quot; planet to a new one &mdash; and they have only four rounds in which to do so.<br/><br/>You start the game with a full functioning economy, and over the course of play, you must dismantle that economy and move it. Income on the old planet shrinks over time, and production probably won't be much better until you establish yourself on the new planet and kick things into action. Resources can't be mixed across the planets, so you need to take special care with your planning.<br/><br/>To do this, you choose actions from the player board, with the expert variant adding cards to your hand that allow you to choose additional actions and combine them. Each action has its own value, and the sum of these actions is important for an &quot;end of the round&quot; bonus. Additionally, players move their markers along the orbital track based on the value of their actions.<br/><br/>If you can raise production of three resources to level 8 and have three stadiums on the new planet, you win. Otherwise, players compare scores after four rounds. Evacuation includes modules to add new play options.<br/><br/>NOTE: A community FAQ is available here to provide some clarity on Frequently Misplayed Rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.<br/><br/>When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:<br/><br/><br/>     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),<br/>     a bonus resource,<br/>     an attack if a player has too many resources, and<br/>     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     <br/><br/><br/>There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.<br/><br/>Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!<br/><br/>The Anniversary edition of this game (Jubil&auml;umsausgabe, tin box edition) can be found under a separate game entry due to some differences in content: Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel – 10th Anniversary Special Edition Tin Box.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Han Dynasty, founded in 206 BC, ruled the central plains and much of modern day China for nearly four hundred years. However, by late second century, court politics and poor governance has left it in rapid decline. The government was dominated by corrupt eunuchs and officials who levied heavy taxes on the peasants, resulting in public discontent. This culminated in the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling (168-189 AD).<br/><br/>Although the Yellow Turban Rebellion was eventually put down, many surviving followers went on to become bandits and continued to create problems for the government. The Han army was unable to control the bandits and Emperor Ling granted direct administrative power over provinces and command of regional military to local lords. Many feudal lords took the opportunity to sever ties with the Han government and ruled independently. The more ambitious lords annexed neighboring territories to expand their power bases. This led to the emergence of the three power blocs of Wei, Wu and Shu, and ushered in the Three Kingdoms period.<br/><br/>Three Kingdoms Redux is a board game that seeks to recreate the tripartite between the states of Wei, Wu and Shu. You assume the role of one of the three lords &ndash; Cao Cao leading Cao Wei, Sun Jian leading Eastern Wu or Liu Bei leading Shu Han. Players start the game from asymmetrical positions, reflecting the manpower advantages Wei enjoyed in the early part of the period. The weaker states of Wu and Shu protect themselves by forming an alliance. As a feudal lord, you manage the different aspects of running a state whilst guarding your borders against both rebellious border tribes and external enemies. Managing each aspect well earns victory points for your state. But beware, for the balance of power shifts constantly during the game. Understand and take advantage of the power shifts, and you will fulfill your grand ambition of re-unifying China!<br/><br/>In more detail, Three Kingdoms Redux is played over a number of rounds, up to a maximum of twelve. Players bid for various actions with their general tokens. The highest bidder of each action space obtains the right to carry out the actions.<br/><br/>These actions allow players to improve your state&rsquo;s domestic development, gain military strength, construct state enhancements, increase popularity with your people, improve relationships with border tribes and gain promotion for the lord, to the next higher rank.<br/><br/>The actions available to each player are: <br/><br/>     develop your state&rsquo;s farm or marketplace, <br/>     recruit or train army units, <br/>     produce weapons, <br/>     trade resources, <br/>     construct state enhancements,  <br/>     control the Han emperor, <br/>     demand tributes from your vassals, <br/>     win support from your people, <br/>     import technology, <br/>     improve your relationship with your border tribe, or <br/>     wage battle against other states to expand your borders.<br/><br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Colombia: Nation at the Edge of Abyss<br/><br/>Colombia in the 1990s hosted one of the world&rsquo;s last Marxist guerrilla armies, brutal drug lords, and right-wing death squads and appeared close to failing as a state.  A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.<br/><br/>Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.<br/><br/>A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame<br/> From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.<br/><br/>Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire<br/><br/>Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.  The non-player insurgents will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.<br/><br/>Series: COIN (GMT), Volume I<br/><br/>Andean Abyss presents a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus our new COunterINsurgency series).  A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons.   Series: COIN (GMT) Volume II is Cuba Libre—Castro's Insurgency 1957-1958, Volume III is A Distant Plain—Insurgency in Afghanistan, and Volume IV is Fire in the Lake—Insurgency in Vietnam.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: multiple years per Propaganda round<br/>MAP SCALE: Area Movement<br/>UNIT SCALE: Varies<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 1-4 (full solitaire system)<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Volko Ruhnke<br/>DEVELOPER: Joel Toppen<br/>MAP and CARD ART: Chechu Nieto<br/>COUNTER ART: Chechu Nieto &amp; Xavier Carrascosa<br/><br/>The first edition does not include a bot to play the Government faction.

        "description": "&quot;Wendake&quot; is the name that the Wyandot people use for their traditional territory. This population, also known as the Huron Nation, lived in the Great Lakes region, together with the tribes who formed the Iroquois Confederacy, and many others. In this game, you will explore the traditions and everyday life of these tribes during the 1756&ndash;1763 period, when the Seven Years&rsquo; War between the French and the English took place in these territories.<br/><br/>But this white man&rsquo;s war is only a marginal aspect of the game; the focus is on life in the native villages, fields, and forests. In this game, you won&rsquo;t find the traditional tipis, which were used by southwestern tribes who moved their camps to follow the bison herds. The natives of the Great Lakes were more sedentary, living in longhouses. The women farmed beans, corn, and pumpkins, while the men hunted beavers in the forests, mainly to sell their pelts as leather.<br/><br/>In Wendake, you step into the shoes of the chief of a Native American tribe. You will have to manage the most important aspects of your tribe&rsquo;s daily existence, thereby earning points on the Economic, Military, Ritual, and Mask tracks. The core of the game is the action selection mechanism: you will have the opportunity to choose better and better actions over 7 years (i.e., rounds), and the winner will be the chief who finds the best combinations of actions and uses them to lead their tribe to prosperity!<br/><br/>",

In BattleCON, players choose characters with unique abilities and powers to test against one another in a battle of tactics, strategy, and intuition.<br/><br/>BattleCON: War of Indines is a standalone dueling card game designed for head-to-head play. Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat. Take control of 18 different characters, from a fire elemental, an ocean guardian and her panda familiar, a space-bending trapper, a shadowy assassin, and more! Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master.<br/><br/>Players move along a seven-space-long board, trading blows and attempting to strike the opponent, using attacks formed by combining a character's unique styles and abilities with a set of basic cards that all characters share. There is no hidden information: you always know exactly what cards the opponent holds, just not the ones they'll choose! The last player standing wins!<br/><br/>BattleCON: War of Indines can be played on its own or combined with other BattleCON sets to create an even greater pool of characters and play variants.<br/><br/>______________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>BattleCON: War of Indines has two versions, now dubbed &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;Remastered.&quot;  The &quot;Classic&quot; version contained multiple art styles, as different fighters were drawn by different artists. This version contains multiple errors and outdated cards, and is now permanently out of print.<br/><br/>The new &quot;Remastered&quot; version features the same 18 fighters, but updated to match the uniform art style of Devastation of Indines.  It also includes balance changes to a few fighters, new double-sided finishers, updated art and components, and a streamlined version of the rulebook that focuses on standard 2-player duels. The variants included with &quot;Classic&quot; that were removed in &quot;Remastered&quot; are still present in the Devastation rulebook and other expansions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Batman: Gotham City Chronicles, one villain faces off against a team of heroes in one of multiple scenarios. Each hero has their own character, and they control this character by spending energy to perform actions (such as Melee and Ranged attacks, defusing bombs...) recovering more or less energy at the beginning of their turn depending on their stance. If the hero gets damaged, energy moves to a wound area, and if they lose all of their energy, then they're out of action for a while to recover their strength. Each hero has differing strengths for their abilities, and these strengths are represented by colored dice with different values; the more energy a hero spends on an ability, the more dice of that color they can roll.<br/><br/>The villain controls a team of henchmen and iconic villains of the Batman universe, and these characters are represented by tiles on their command board, with the characters costing 1, 2, 3, etc. energy to activate as you move left to right down the line. Once a character is activated, they move to the end of the line, boosting their cost to the maximum value should you want to use them again immediately, and decreasing the cost of the other tiles.<br/><br/>The game-play in Batman: Gotham City Chronicles is based on that of Conan, with revisions to character abilities, the addition of two different types of dice (w/ five types total), and a modified two-player set-up, the Versus Mode, in which each player has a command board and their own team of tiles that they can draft, with heroes facing off against villains.<br/><br/>See also Batman: Gotham City Chronicles - The Roleplaying Game<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gather your band of heroes and journey to Realms of Terrinoth in Legacy of Dragonholt!<br/><br/>The first game to use the Oracle system, Legacy of Dragonholt captures the spirit of a roleplaying game without needing a game master. This narrative game for one to six players allows players to build their own unique hero and embark on six noble quests. Battle goblins, foil the plot of an evil lord, and add a new story to your tale!<br/><br/>Prepare for Adventure<br/>Legacy of Dragonholt is a narrative adventure game that creates a unique experience by blending aspects of roleplaying and adventure games, open world concept video games, and even Choose Your Own Adventure books. Unlike many games, Legacy of Dragonholt is not about winning or losing, but rather about the act of creating a story. Without the need for a Game Master, this game ensures that every player has the opportunity to shape how their adventure plays out while its intuitive gameplay means that you waste little time before jumping into your tale.<br/><br/>Before you first set out on your adventure, you must confront one of the most difficult questions in gaming: who will you become? Legacy of Dragonholt gives you the opportunity to play as one of six humanoid races that reside in Terrinoth: humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, and catfolk. Next, you'll select a class, before defining your physical and personality traits, and scribing a personal history. Each of these features creates a multifaceted character and defines the types of traits you possess, which in turn affect how you will approach obstacles throughout your journey and how you'll contribute to your party. For an in-depth look at the character creation process, you may look at our previous article here. Once you've created your own unique character, you're ready to dive in to a narrative adventure unlike any you&rsquo;ve seen before.<br/><br/>Explore The Realm<br/>Once your journey begins, Legacy of Dragonholt combines two forms of gameplay between the comprehensive Village Book and the six quest books that provide the plotlines of your tales. Within Dragonholt Village, you will encounter many colorful characters, each with their own stories that progress and interweave regardless of your involvement. The world is yours to explore, but it is not yours to control. Like a real community, the places you can explore vary depending on when you visit, and your encounters with the locals change depending on your traits and past experiences. For instance, a bakery may only be open early in the day, and the baker themselves may take a shine to you if you&rsquo;ve already met their cousin, or if they&rsquo;ve heard of the great deeds you&rsquo;ve accomplished earlier in your stay in the village. Outside the relative safety of the village, thrilling dangers and mysteries await that you can experience in six unique quests. You will investigate strange happenings within in the village and venture into the wilds beyond to journey through deep woods, delve into dark crypts, and confront creatures long thought dead. As you progress throughout the game you will find that, like your village experience, your quests also change based on your past experience, who you have or have not met, and how much time has passed. After all, if you learn that someone is in peril to the west of Dragonholt Village, they are not likely to wait patiently for three days while you explore in the east. Your actions have consequences, but ultimately the choice lies with you. You do not have to be a hero. This is your story, and it is yours to define.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Completed domaines can then be expanded, even into your opponents'. Protect domaines by placing knights, which resist expansion.<br/><br/>Actions are taken by playing cards that have a cost associated with them. Gain money by selling cards and controlling mines. Sold cards can be acquired by other players.<br/><br/>Players score points based on the quantity and type of terrain enclosed in their domaines, as well as by controlling many mines of a single type.

Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.<br/><br/>Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points). The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.<br/><br/>The deck in Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-15 in the standard suits. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible.  As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play. The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets a Suit Action.<br/> The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick. After a full Round of ten tricks, whoever has taken the most cards in each suit once again gets a Suit Action. If a player has taken no tricks, that player gets two Diamonds Suit Actions. Players then start a new round.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most points in Diamond Crystals at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gregor Mendel is the 19th Century Augustinian Friar credited with the discovery of modern genetics. In Genotype, you play as his assistants, competing to collect experimental data on pea plants by trying to control how the plants inherit key Traits from their parents: seed shape, flower color, stem color, and plant height. The observable Traits of a Pea Plant (its Phenotype) are determined by its genetic makeup (its Genotype). The relationship between Genotype and Phenotype and the nature of genetic inheritance are at the heart of Genotype: A Mendelian Genetics Game.<br/><br/>During the game, players get Pea Plant Cards which show a set of Phenotype Traits they hope to produce and collect (such as pink flowers and tall height) in order to score points. Each round, Dice are rolled to represent Plant breeding, which may result in the Traits players are looking for. After the Dice Roll, players take turns drafting Dice towards completing their Pea Plant Cards or advancing their Research.  The Traits produced during the Dice Roll come through the science of Punnett Squares, which show how the parent genes combine, one from each parent plant.  By changing the genes of these parent plants, players can influence the likelihood of rolling the Traits they need.  The completion of Pea Plant Cards via the Dice Draft is the main way players score points.<br/><br/>Each round consists of 3 phases: Worker Placement, Dice Drafting, and Upgrades.<br/>1) During Worker Placement, players take actions to get more Plant Cards, change the genes of a parent plant, Garden, Research, stake Phenotype claims, gather new Tools, or even position themselves ahead of other players for the Dice Drafting Phase in a couple of ways.<br/>2) Dice Drafting features a couple of interest steps, including the possibility to get first pick of dice, but only for one type of Trait (like plant height), or the possibility to get a pick of any dice, but only after those first picks have happened.  De Novo Mutation Dice allow players to change the Trait of other Dice or gain additional Research.<br/>3) The Upgrades phase lets players spend their Research to gain upgrades that let them work on more Plant Cards, draft more Dice each round, or gain additional Workers to be used during the Worker Placement Phase of each round.<br/><br/>Players work to match their Pea Plant Cards to the outcome of the Dice Draft and complete the cards for points.  If they've placed a Phenotype marker, they will earn bonus points for every completed card that matches their claim.  At the end of 5 rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Here I Stand: Wars of the Reformation 1517-1555 is the first game in over 25 years to cover the political and religious conflicts of early 16th Century Europe. Few realize that the greatest feats of Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, Ignatius Loyola, Henry VIII, Charles V, Francis I, Suleiman the Magnificent, Ferdinand Magellan, Hernando Cortes, and Nicolaus Copernicus all fall within this narrow 40-year period of history. This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.<br/><br/>There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory.<br/><br/>Here I Stand was due for a reprint in 2017, but with October 31, 2017 being the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses, Ed Beach and his team of Here I Stand enthusiasts have put together a series of enhancements to the original game that transform this reprint into a deluxe 500th anniversary treatment.<br/><br/>500th Anniversary Edition Enhancements include:<br/><br/>     6 brand new cards added to the deck, including Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Rough Wooing, and Imperial Coronation.<br/>     Revisions to over 15 existing cards including Copernicus, Master of Italy, and Machiavelli to allow for more exciting in-game play and additional possibilities for diplomatic deals.<br/>     A new Chateau construction table is now used to resolve France's Patron of the Arts home card plays.<br/>     Several Virgin Queen rule updates are incorporated back into Here I Stand, affecting minor power activation, piracy, spice trading, and foreign wars.<br/><br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    Four and a half full-color counter sheets<br/>    116 Strategy Cards<br/>    One 22&quot;x34&quot; Mounted Mapsheet<br/>    Player Aid Cards (11&quot;x17&quot; &amp; 8.5&quot;x11&quot;)<br/>    Rules/Scenario Book<br/>    One ten-sided die<br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ed Beach<br/>MAP &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch<br/>COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch and Rodger B.

A unique and fun game from the award-winning designers of Automania and Trails of Tucana.<br/><br/>Bad Company supports up to 6 players with very little downtime. It also includes a solo mode where you try to outsmart the police.<br/><br/>Each player has a player board with 11 gang members. You may upgrade them by placing overlapping cards onto them. This way, the visual appearances of your gang members change as they gain more abilities.<br/><br/>Each round, the active player rolls four dice and divides them into two pairs (pay coins to reroll). Each pair of dice activates one gang member on the active player's board.  All other players may use one of the pairs to activate a single gang member on their own boards.<br/><br/>Activating a gangster provides resources needed to complete heists, money to upgrade your gang members, or advance your car through the city. <br/>You want to advance your car, because you need to stay ahead of the police in order to collect loot along the city route.<br/><br/>You gain points by completing heists, upgrading your gang and by driving your car through the city.<br/>Some completed heists provide special abilities which you can build your strategy around.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player completes their 6th heist, or when any car reaches the dock on the city track, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die.<br/><br/>Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!<br/><br/>Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on their own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than their rivals. On their turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, they get the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your dice (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of their city on future turns. The first player to construct all of their landmarks wins!<br/><br/>",

At the end of the hand, each card of this color that they've collected (including their initial choice from their hand) is worth negative points equal to the card's face value. Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.<br/><br/>To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card. If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick. (One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.) In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins. In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie.<br/><br/>Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner.<br/><br/>Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players. (These versions also allow players to play the game Hattrick by the same designer, with rules for this game included as a variant.)<br/><br/>",

You don't have much &mdash; mainly your guts, your wits, and your friends &mdash; but maybe that's enough. Between you and your teammates, you can sling spells, hack the Matrix, talk a tiger out of his stripes, and bring down a charging ork from a hundred yards away. Will that be enough to face down the worst the mean streets can throw at you?

Play a shadowrunner team and take on tough jobs such as protecting a client who's marked for death, shooting your way out of downtown when a run goes sour, or facing down a dragon. In each game you'll improve your deck with a mix of strategies, while earning Karma to give your character cyber upgrades, physical augmentations, magical initiations, weapons training and Edge.<br/><br/>Shadowrun: Crossfire includes two obstacle decks, a black market deck, a crossfire event deck, mission sheets, role cards, runner cards, and upgrade stickers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ready to start exploring a previously uncharted island? Good! You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points.<br/><br/>The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.<br/><br/>After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.<br/><br/>Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).<br/><br/>Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that type you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!<br/><br/>Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.<br/><br/>After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Claustrophobia 1643 is a miniatures-based survival game set within the catacombs.<br/><br/>The box contains miniatures which are placed on large tiles showing the dungeon spaces. Also included are character dashboards, counters and markers, and dice.<br/><br/>One player controls a small group of determined humans, while the other plays an almost unending army of demonic creatures. The game is thematic and highly asymmetric: human characters are stronger, but the demon characters are more numerous. Gameplay is very straightforward with a minimum of rules, and each game plays in an hour or less.<br/><br/>In essence dice are allocated after rolling to perform actions, while cards or special abilities are also available. The game is about managing decisions and choosing what to do with the resources that you have, managing difficult events and out-thinking your opponent. Combat is handled by dice.<br/>Complexity is low, with the focus on theme and building towards a tense, climactic ending.<br/><br/>Claustrophobia is played through scenarios of which there are several in the rulebook (20). Generally speaking the human characters are attempting to complete a task (e.g. escape the catacombs, close a portal) while the demons are focused on stopping them. There are varying win conditions depending on the scenario chosen.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Pick your hero, choose a class, decide on which skills to spend your XP, and get loot by searching the dungeon or killing special enemies that can use the equipment against you! Face a multitude of different enemy types, coming in all shapes and sizes, whose behavior is resolved automatically...or you can try to sneak around enemies by taking advantage of dark areas of the map.<br/><br/>Players begin their adventure in Massive Darkness by picking a Hero &ndash; each with two special starting skills &ndash; and pair them with a Class of their choosing. Depending on the combination, another skill can be unlocked, giving players a wide range of choices and play styles. In Massive Darkness, the created Heroes go on Quests, killing monsters, collecting loot, and gaining XP. Players spend their XP to unlock new Skills, growing more powerful as the Quest progresses.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players encounter different monsters, including Minions, Agents, Roaming Monsters, and Bosses. An unique mechanism of the game is the Guardian. Any of the monster types have a chance of spawning as a Guardian, meaning it will use a random piece of equipment in the fight against Heroes. However, if players are able to overcome this difficult encounter, they will acquire that piece of loot!<br/><br/>",

Along the way, you gain shares in other railroads and watch your reputation soar with each successful delivery before making a final push to complete long hauls to the boom towns of the West.<br/><br/>This design is a new twist on pick-up-and-deliver games. As players move their trains west and pick up goods, they can deliver those goods to small towns to gain shares in railroads, or hold on to them for a bigger payout when they reach the west coast. At the same time, they try to optimize their actions (and gain extra ones), lay down new track tiles, block the other players, gather and use valuable whistles for special moves and abilities, and carefully manage their coal resources.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements. While still clean and streamlined for a complicated wargame, this is nontheless more of a serious hobby game than any of the previous entries in the genre.<br/><br/><br/>(Note from Mark Herman:)<br/><br/>The game was reprinted and the latest and final version of the rules has incorporated all of the previous FAQs plus has re-written some of the more troublesome rules sections (rivers). To date, after a grueling three-year on-line tournament, no rules questions of note have been forthcoming. The above write up is mistaken when it states that &quot;For The People&quot; is based on &quot;Hannibal vs Rome&quot;, but was my second game in the &quot;We The People&quot; genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>The 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released. Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook. This rulebook is available from GMT games as a free download.<br/><br/>",

All of this takes place over five eras (rounds), and at the end of the fifth round, the player who has accumulated the most prestige points takes the victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.<br/><br/>From the Main Rulebook:<br/><br/>In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.<br/><br/>In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!<br/><br/>Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.<br/><br/>- Warhammer Quest Contents -<br/><br/>    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard<br/>    6 Orc Warrior models<br/>    6 Orc Archer models<br/>    6 Goblin Spearmen models<br/>    6 Night Goblin Archer models<br/>    12 Skaven models<br/>    3 Minotaur models<br/>    12 Giant Spider models<br/>    12 Giant Bat models<br/>    12 Giant Rat models<br/>    12 Snotling models<br/>    10 Dungeon Doorways<br/>    32 Page Rule Book<br/>    16 Page Adventure Book<br/>    192 Page Role-play Book<br/>    1 How to Play sheet<br/>    50 Page Adventure Record Pad<br/>    19 Event Cards<br/>    23 Dungeon Cards<br/>    30 Treasure Cards<br/>    17 Blank Event Cards<br/>    15 Spell Cards<br/>    4 Warrior Cards<br/>    4 Battle-level Cards<br/>    4 Equipment Cards<br/>    4 Warrior Counters<br/>    6 Dungeon Rooms<br/>    5 Objective Rooms<br/>    7 Corridors<br/>    1 Steps<br/>    3 T-junctions<br/>    1 Corner<br/>    1 Portcullis Marker<br/>    1 Cave-in Marker<br/>    3 Pit of Despair Markers<br/>    6 Webbed Counters<br/>    15 Power Tokens<br/>    10 Luck Counters<br/>    24 plastic shields<br/>    18 Scenery Markers<br/>    6 Large Dice &amp; 12 Small Dice<br/><br/><br/>",

France&rsquo;s enemies, led by England, are engaged in a desperate struggle to defeat Napoleon. England, in dire need of men, is impressing men to serve in its navy. Included are Americans who are pressed into service at gunpoint.<br/><br/>The young American nation objects. Eager to defend its sovereign rights and to strengthen its position in North America, the United States declares war on Britain on June 18, 1812. Taking advantage of the British Army being occupied in its struggles against Napoleon, American forces invade Canada in order to drive the British from its last remaining colony on North American soil. Surprised, Britain reels from the attack and now has to face another enemy threat on another front.<br/><br/>In 1812 - The Invasion of Canada, players take on one of the roles of the major factions that took part in the War of 1812. On the British side these are represented by the British Regulars (Redcoats), Canadian Militia and Native Americans; and the American Regular Army and American Militia comprise the American players. Players for each side will cooperate with each other in order to plan and conduct their campaigns. Each side will attempt to capture Objective Areas on the map. When a truce is called, the side that controls the most enemy Objective Areas wins.<br/><br/>",

In the game, supply is crucial to keep your armies and navies fighting; destroy your enemies' supply lines and their forces will surrender!<br/><br/>During play, you control one or more countries on either the Axis or Allied team and try to score as many victory points (VPs) for your team as you can through the use of cards or by occupying the starred supply spaces. Each major power has a unique set of cards with which to marshal its forces, which are represented by wooden army and navy pieces. After twenty rounds of play, the team with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>Note: The French edition of Quartermaster General, known as Quartermaster, includes the Quartermaster General: Air Marshal expansion that is sold separately in the English edition.<br/><br/>",

In order to prosper, you have to manage with natural resources, rare items, vatus (local currency) and tourists. To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.<br/> On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters! Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan. When you reach ten vatus, they automatically transform into 5 prosperity points and again, you are poor. Life is hard, but you may encounter ten men to help you; on each turn you choose one of them to increase your benefits from an action. As always, being the first player lets you choose before the others.<br/><br/>In short, Vanuatu is a strategy game of programming and majorities that features development, blocking, and a lot of interaction between players.<br/><br/>(*) Sand Drawing in Vanuatu belongs to the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity of the UNESCO.<br/><br/>",

The remaining crewmen desperately try to save their lives by escaping from the derelict spaceship, but in the darkness the aliens are lurking...hungry for human flesh.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hexagon-based map that represents the spaceship. Each player is given a map sheet and a pencil. Map sheets must be of the same zone, and every zone has its specific name. Starting from the first player and continuing clockwise, every turn, each player must make a movement. To do so, the player must write on their map sheet the coordinates of the sector to which they are moving. Every time the players move to the gray (dangerous) sectors they have to draw a card; these cards make the players tell the others their position or lie about it, depending on the card. Every card is kept secret from other players.<br/><br/>The humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans. Each player's identity and position is kept secret; you will need to interpret the movements and behaviors of the other players to learn who and where they really are.<br/><br/>",

Together these species form an ecosystem where each feeds on the excreta of the others. To win a player must guide the evolution of their species to increase their population and the sophistication of their genes.<br/><br/>Each round consists of various phases. Firstly each organism must move (either by drifting or under its own power) and then feed. Then the environment undergoes a random change which changes the direction of drift and may force some organisms to give up genes. Then the species may buy new genes, and then may reproduce. At this point some organisms will die and finally each species is scored. This is repeated until either a species gets at least 42 points or the environment cards are exhausted.<br/><br/>The possible genes include genes for enhanced control of movement, more efficient metabolism, more efficient reproduction, attack and defence.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Primordial Soup: Freshly Spiced<br/><br/><br/>",

Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!<br/><br/>WIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: In Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.<br/><br/>Based on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.<br/><br/>As a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!<br/><br/>After you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.<br/>After you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Note: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.<br/><br/>If you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.<br/><br/>As a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the universe of the Northgard video game, Northgard: Uncharted Lands is a game of conquest and exploration set in the age of vikings. Each player controls a Viking clan, looking to achieve victory by reaping glory in various ways or controlling the most prized territories of this new continent.<br/><br/>The game focus is on streamlined rules and mechanisms, allowing for a fast-paced and smooth rhythm of play. Each turn, players alternate their actions to adapt their strategies to their opponents' moves and the expansion of the board. Fame (i.e., points) can be earned by exploring, fighting, and controlling and developing territories. The various corresponding actions are played through the cards that the players have in hand. At the end of each turn, they have to choose a new card to improve their personal deck as their clans develop new tactics and technologies.<br/><br/>The conquest of Northgard also requires clever management of resources to build new buildings, improve your warriors' effectiveness, better your hand of cards, and upgrade your clan's specificities. The winter phase makes this management more difficult as you have to feed your units to keep them healthy and happy.<br/><br/>The pace of the game is set by the players as the game ends after seven turns, but can also be cut short at any time if one of them is in control of three closed territories hosting certain types of buildings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros! To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.<br/><br/>In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock&rsquo;s endless supply of gold.<br/><br/>Battles of Westeros is played over a series of included scenarios, called battles. Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House&rsquo;s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session. A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns. The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!<br/><br/>Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game. For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present. Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield? If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents! Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle? Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand.<br/><br/>Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings. Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole &ndash; a small flag-bearing attachment. The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit&rsquo;s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet. In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you&rsquo;ve activated from those you haven&rsquo;t), the sight of your army&rsquo;s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!<br/><br/>",

With a simple-yet-innovative economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Russian&rsquo;s Red Army, and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht, over the epic four year sweep of time that this merciless campaign was fought.<br/><br/>Neither side can afford the disgrace of yielding an inch of ground to their hated foe, so your orders are: &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     One Standard size mounted map<br/>     Two Counter Sheets<br/>     One deck of 55 Playing Cards<br/>     Rule booklet<br/>     Scenario booklet<br/>     Player Aid Cards<br/>     Two 6-sided dice (1 black and 1 white)<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 2 months per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: 100km / 60 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE: Armies and Fronts<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Carl Paradis<br/>DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich &amp; Carl Paradis<br/>COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Carl Paradis<br/>MAP ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/>",

Additionally, players can spend their Coins on more exclusive actions to remind a Haint of their lost Humanity, all in the hopes of freeing the spirit from the ghost train&rsquo;s bone-chilling grip, and winning the Scenario in the process. But be careful! Each Haint has their own bag of tricks and gameplay mechanics.

        "description": "Welcome to Encyclopedia! The year is 1739, and as aspiring naturalists and adventurers, you&rsquo;ve been hired by the Comte de Buffon - Darwin's predecessor - to help him create the first encyclopedia of natural history. To do so, you&rsquo;ll be conducting research, organizing ambitious expeditions and publishing studies of the world&rsquo;s most fascinating creatures!<br/><br/>Encyclopedia is a dice-based worker placement game. At the beginning of each round, you&rsquo;ll be drawing and rolling dice, then placing them on your player board. These dice can then be used to perform an action each turn, depending on their color and value. Your action can be preparing your expeditions by going to the Embassy, visiting the Bank to raise funds, or hiring your research team at the University. Once you&rsquo;re ready to go, you&rsquo;ll choose the Animal cards you wish to study, then organize expeditions to observe them in their natural habitats. When your research is complete, you&rsquo;ll then be able to publish your findings in an attempt to become the biggest contributor to Buffon&rsquo;s Encyclopedia. Every publication you make will earn you Victory points, and at the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll score points based on collections of Animals and research amassed during play. The naturalist with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Encyclopedia was designed by Olivier Melison and Eric Dubus, the authors of Dominations: Road to Civilization and Museum. This expert worker placement game brings some fascinating new twists to the genre, offering multiple paths to victory. The game also offers a multitude of ways to counter the random element of your dice rolls. As well as being able to spend different tokens to change the value or color of a die, players have more than just their own dice to choose from, as other players dice can also be used! Taking a die from another player&rsquo;s board does not cost anything, but the targeted player gains a bonus.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s beautiful theme - with gorgeously illustrated animal cards - ties in strongly with its mechanics, making the rules easy to grasp so that you can jump straight in to devising the perfect strategy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players are survivors of the apocalypse whose mission is to survive the hostile landscape.<br/><br/>The game map is randomly generated and different every time that you play. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to explore the map, play cards, equip weapons, scavenge for resources, draw cards or battle off monsters.<br/><br/>Picking a unique survivor class within the group, players must plan their strategy and work together while leaning on their survivor&rsquo;s strengths in order to defeat monsters and avoid starvation. For example, the Fireman is deadly up close with his ax and can easily chop down monsters; meanwhile the stealthy Hunter is great at scouting the map and avoiding traps &mdash; but roaming monsters are gathering quickly and time is running out. If you are overwhelmed by monsters or die of starvation, the players lose. If they can find enough gas and get it back to their van to escape, they all win and live to play another scenario.<br/><br/>See also Maximum Apocalypse: The Roleplaying Game Quickstart Guide<br/><br/>",

Public companies build track and run trains in order to earn revenues. Public company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and rolling stock.<br/><br/>A feature of 18Chesapeake, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a public company&rsquo;s president and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.<br/><br/>18Chesapeake is a moderate length game. Experienced, brisk players can expect to take about 2-1/2 hours to complete a game. Novices or more deliberate players might add an hour to that time.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

However, there is no board or score track and the tactical nuts and bolts of the game are somewhat different. In terms of components, the game consists of cards, money, worker pawns, resource markers, the provost, and castle building stones. Each player has a set of identical cards, which are shuffled and used as a face-down draw deck. Players start with an opening random draw of cards, and on his turn a player can either:<br/><br/><br/>    extend the road by building a new building <br/>    pay 1 to draw a new building card <br/>    pay 1 to discard his hand and draw a fresh hand (with the discard deck being shuffled for a new draw deck once the draw deck is exhausted) <br/>    pay 1 to place a worker on one of the existing building cards <br/>    build one of the common prestige building cards (some of which are placed at the beginning of the game as part of the setup) or <br/>    pass<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has passed, the cards are resolved up to the provost (which can be moved in passing order by paying money).<br/><br/>Ownership of the non-common buildings is shown by the card color. When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.<br/><br/>From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished. Victory points are awarded for castle stones, cards built, and resources and money in hand at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Once each year, Taron releases the toughest gang of war prisoners into the royal Colosseum.<br/><br/>You command a squadron of these captured Dragul. Gather goons and craft contraband to raise your reputation. Keep your suspicion with the guards low while establishing yourself as the most powerful crew in Kulbak. In six short days, Taron may offer you the chance to fight for your freedom.<br/><br/>Lockup: A Roll Player Tale is a competitive worker-allocation game for one to five players. In the game, players manage groups of minions -- gnolls, kobolds, bugbears, goblins, or insectoids -- locked up in Kulbak Prison.<br/><br/>Each round, players try to keep their suspicion from the guards under control while allocating their crew to different locations within Kulbak. The player with the strongest crew in each location at the end of each round gains the most resources, hires the most powerful crew, and builds the most powerful items, increases their reputation. The player with the highest reputation at the end of six rounds, wins the game.<br/><br/>Lockup is a worker placement game set in the Roll Player universe.<br/><br/>Play takes place over three phases in each round:<br/><br/>     Roll Call - Players take turns placing their minions in different parts of the prison, some face up showing a unit's strength and some face down, hiding the strength from the other players.<br/>     Lights Out - Each area with minions is scored based on the strength of each player's crew. Players receive resources and have the opportunity to recruit goons and build items.<br/>     Patrol Phase - New resources are placed on the gameboard, and the guards patrol the dungeon. Players with high suspicion are raided, and their chambers are searched.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designed by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra&rsquo;s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.<br/><br/>Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price &ndash; cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The component design in Cleopatra is the most innovative we&rsquo;ve undertaken to date,&rdquo; said Days of Wonder CEO, Eric Hautemont. &ldquo;While it&rsquo;s still a board game, the dozens of 3D pieces &ndash; Column walls, Doorframes, Obelisks, Sphinxes, and Palace Throne &ndash; all create the sense that you&rsquo;re constructing a royal palace.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The game play really forces players into continually weighing the risks and rewards between taking enough corruption to enhance your position in the game, but not so much that you are forced out of the game at the end,&rdquo; said the game&rsquo;s co-designer, Bruno Cathala. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classic &lsquo;push your luck&rsquo; dilemma that continually raises the tension level higher and higher until the game reaches its climax.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.

If you follow after but choose that same role card you can take the favor action instead, or declare that you are that character in hopes that you can command the full action. You risk having it taken from you by a later player, though. The different roles help players collect different ingredients and money to make potions listed on the cauldron cards.

        "description": "Uprising: Curse of the Last Emperor is a strategically challenging and fully cooperative board game for 1 to 4 players set in a deeply immersive post-apocalyptic dark fantasy setting. As the known world is about to end, the players take over the role of a great hero to lead their faction through these dark times.<br/><br/>Uprising is a 4X cooperative game played against two asymmetric enemy factions controlled by the game itself: Chaos and the Empire. Explore the wasteland, expand your dominion, exploit the resources of the liberated territories, and exterminate the Legions and Hordes around you.<br/><br/>Every game tells a completely different story due to a modular board, asymmetric factions and a huge variety of different events. The game ends after four chapters. If you have not collected more victory points than Chaos and the Empire, the world will truly end.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's your job to schedule the band's stops over your 100-day tour, visiting as many states as possible.<br/><br/>Each turn in On Tour, two ten-sided dice are rolled to make two two-digit numbers. For example, a roll of 3 and 7 creates the numbers 37 and 73. All players write each of those numbers in a state on their map. The regions they can write in are restricted by three cards turned up in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player draws a route on their map, starting with a low number and visiting adjacent states with higher and higher numbers. Players get a point for every state they visit.<br/><br/>There are also some bonus points available, a way to get wilds, and a variable set-up step that makes every game different.<br/><br/>Note: The second edition supports 8 players out of the box and the map boards are double sided featuring the US map on one side (the one from the first edition) and On Tour: European Expansion of the other side.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From clucking chickens to rumbling tractors, the sounds of a bustling farm are everywhere. It's up to your team of planners to turn this little farm into a flourishing ranching community!<br/><br/><br/>Having developed dream cities in Sprawlopolis, it's now time to set your sights on the rolling countryside, where farm, ranches, and roads intermingle master plan, as ever, seems just out of reach.<br/><br/>Agropolis is a stand-alone expansion to Sprawlopolis, bringing the same card-laying, variable-scoring gameplay into a new setting: city blocks give way to orchards, wheat fields, livestock pens, and vineyards. As before, players draw three goal cards and then attempt to place cards one at a time to create a rural tableau that best satisfies those goals. New gameplay features help offset overly-powerful scoring combos and layer additional attributes onto certain types of terrain, providing even greater depth of gameplay without sacrificing the original's signature elegance.<br/><br/>Agropolis can be played entirely on its own, but it can also combined with Sprawlopolis using special rules and goal cards provided in the Combopolis mini-expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the textbook example of financial scams, &quot;Ponzi Scheme&quot; is the term used to describe the technique Charles Ponzi employed in 1919 to operate one of the most notorious financial frauds in history.<br/><br/>In the game Ponzi Scheme, players are scammers trying to trick investors into funding fraudulent investments with the promise of extremely high returns. You need elaborate trading skills to keep your operation afloat as long as possible, and as time goes on the dividends you need to pay every turn will only pile higher and higher! But when someone declares bankruptcy, the remaining fraudster who forged the biggest shell corporation wins the game!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is simple: Don't be the first player to go bankrupt!<br/><br/>In more detail, on each turn, players must take one new Fund card from the Funding boards along with a corresponding Industry tile and cash as indicated on the card. You need to pay the &quot;promised reward&quot; of each Fund card in a number of rounds.<br/><br/>After all players have taken their Fund cards, they may choose to initiate an &quot;inside trade&quot; with one other player in order to buy the Industry you want with a price they can't refuse, or sell your own Industry to them with a good price.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, players rotate their Time Wheel 1 or 2 spaces, and pay the &quot;promised reward&quot; to the bank if any Fund card is due.<br/><br/>The game continues until at least one player cannot pay the &quot;promised reward&quot; due and goes bankrupt. That player is out of the game, and the remaining player who has the most VP on their Industry wins.<br/><br/>",

While making the trek from Mannheim to Pforzheim, her car ran out of fuel in Wiesloch. Mrs. Benz stopped into the city drugstore to obtain the appropriate chemicals to make more fuel, effectively creating the world&acute;s first gas station.<br/><br/>By the year 1928, Germany possessed a dense road network where combustion engines had triumphed over electric and steam engines and where cars were produced via assembly lines. Manufacturers began producing more affordable vehicles for the broader population.<br/><br/>In&nbsp;Kraftwagen, players advance the state of automobile development and production by playing as start-up companies. They must research new technologies and build improved chassis and engines.

        "description": "Watson &amp; Holmes is a game of deduction set within the magnificent works of Arthur Conan Doyle. Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.<br/><br/>The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.<br/><br/>This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.<br/><br/>Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.<br/><br/>",

Inspired by the core mechanics of its predecessor &quot;It's a Wonderful World&quot;, this new game offers more interaction, a bluff mechanism and new challenges.<br/><br/>The game is played using modules, each different and offering mechanical twists. Each game, players will choose one of the different modules to compete against each other. The game is divided into 4 rounds. Each round having 3 phases.<br/><br/>Split &amp; Trap<br/>Players take turns offering their cards to one another in two areas in the center of the table.<br/><br/>One player picks 2 cards from their hand and either places them in the same area or splits them between the two areas. The other player chooses an area and claims the card(s) in it. The players take turns repeating this step until both players have offered all of their cards. Each player has 2 Trap tokens which can be used to place cards face down, otherwise all cards are played face up.<br/><br/>Planification<br/>Each player chooses which of the cards they have collected to build and which ones to recycle for immediate resources.<br/><br/>Sequential Production<br/>Each player produces their Kingdom's resources sequentially. Since resources are produced in a specific order, it is important to plan ahead to optimize your production and development.<br/><br/>At the end of the fourth round, the player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates  completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least four pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play.<br/><br/>GIPF is not only the name of a game, but of a project as well. This project concerns a group of games and extra pieces that will follow step by step. Each game of the project will be playable either separately, or, by means of extra pieces, in combination with GIPF. It concerns a system that makes winning or losing GIPF-related games a strategic factor of the game GIPF itself.<br/><br/>This game is part of project GIPF.<br/><br/>",

Flames left campfires and waves poured out of their riverbeds.

While competing for Riftforce the guilds forged temporary alliances to share their unique abilities and guard the access to the Rifts.<br/><br/>Now it is your time! Choose your guilds, combine their powers and rush into battle. Gain Riftforce from the land you control and all the elementals you destroy until you have enough to ascend into a higher state of power.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Riftforce, the two-player duel card game, each player starts by drafting four of the ten different guilds, each with a unique power, to forge their own asymmetrical alliance. Every game of Riftforce gives you a chance to discover new synergies between guilds which will greatly influence your overall strategy and strengths. Can you combine the flexible and mobile water guild with the all-consuming fire elementals who even harm their allies and unleash their full potential?<br/><br/>The guilds&rsquo; elementals are the lifeblood of the game - they are your troops and at the same time the resource necessary to attack. Soon you will find yourself wondering how to use them best. Each turn you are torn, choosing one of three possible actions. Do you want to strengthen your position at the Rift, sacrifice elementals for powerful combo attacks or gather support for your next turn?<br/><br/>Gain Riftforce by destroying the elements of your opponent and by controlling locations along the Rift. Only then will you ascend and win the game.<br/><br/>Discovering new synergies between the different guilds, clever gameplay combos and the deeper layers of strategy will keep you coming back to enjoy the game again and again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Princes of the Renaissance is set in Renaissance Italy. Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.<br/><br/>A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.<br/><br/>No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.<br/><br/>",

Akbar is the third ruler of India's Mughal dynasty, having succeeded his father, Humayun. With the guidance of his regent, Bairam Khan, Akbar has expanded and consolidated India's Mughal domains. Using his strong personality and skill as a general, Akbar has enlarged his Empire to include nearly all of the Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari River; his presence is felt across the entire country due to the Mughals' military, political, cultural, and economic dominance.<br/><br/>To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar has established a centralized system of administration; conquered rulers are conciliated through marriage and diplomacy. Akbar has preserved peace and Order throughout his empire by passing laws that have won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state-identity, Akbar has striven to unite his lands. The Mughals' Persian-ized culture has afforded Akbar near-divine status.<br/><br/>Notables and emissaries from all over the country are on their way for Akbar's birthday celebration. As an ambitious landowner, you cannot let this pass; the festivities are a golden opportunity for you to rise in stature and wealth.<br/><br/>On your land in Agra, you cultivate and harvest cotton and turmeric. You possess a forest from which you produce wood, as well as a small, but very profitable sandstone quarry. By trading and processing your wares, you can obtain more luxurious goods, which you will then use to woo notables as they make their way into the capital. Of course, your rivals have the same plan; you must use your wits to outsmart them as Akbar's birthday draws near...<br/><br/>(Description from the publisher)<br/><br/>",

The Subterra Bravo facility has been thrown into chaos through the players actions in [ESCAPE], and now the government has sent in a top-secret, highly-trained special forces unit to shut down the facility and eliminate everything remaining in the base.<br/><br/>In [Omega Protocol], one player takes on the role of the Overseer while two to five other players take on the role of the elite Special Ops team. The Overseer's role in the game is to control all of the alien denizens and challenges the players face throughout the game. The players are trying to achieve specific scenario-based objectives by exploring a map that's laid out at the start and fighting off the hordes of aliens that the Overseer sends their way.<br/><br/>Gameplay is based around adrenaline, which is the currency that the soldier players use to perform actions. They generate adrenaline to do things such as move, attack, and perform special actions like activating an objective space. That generation also has a negative effect for them, as that adrenaline transfers to the Overseer player, who then uses it to spawn aliens, create new threats, and hurt the soldiers' chance of success during the scenario. The more actions the Special Ops players take, the more resources the Overseer player has to work with.<br/><br/>Characters in [Omega Protocol] are represented by miniatures, and each Special Ops and alien character has different attributes, powers, and customizable skills and equipment.<br/><br/>",

The zebra needs a big area of grass and some water adjacent, for example, while a bat needs rocks and bush and water, a hart needs bush and grass, and a crocodile needs mainly water. There is a snake, baboon, bee, elephant, otter, lizard, turtle, eagle, meerkat, scorpio, hog, catfish, rhino, etc., each with its own landscape requirements &mdash; 68 different animals in total.<br/><br/>Each player starts their individual park with an entrance tile, and they are each represented in the marketplace of animal tiles by a ceramic figure (or a wooden ranger meeple in some editions). On a turn, a player takes the tile to their left, right or front; moves their figure to the space just vacated; then draws a tile to place where their figure started the turn.<br/><br/>When adding an animal tile in your park, you add its main landscape &mdash; the base space for the animal &mdash; to your park, too. While placing this new animal, its own piece of landscape can help to fulfill the requirements of your other animals' requirements, e.g., the water on a hippo tile fulfilling the adjacent otter's need for water. Thus, fulfilling every animal's desire for land becomes a more and more difficult task with each tile you add.<br/><br/>Aside from expanding your park with different landscape types, flora and animals, you can improve its profitability by building extra entrance roads, trek spots, and watchtowers.<br/><br/>Habitats lasts three seasons, with each season giving each player 6-9 new tiles for their parks. Whoever has best met the goal of the season receives bonus points, with a smaller number of points for second and third place. At the end of the game, each player scores for each tile in their park based on whether that tile's requirements are satisfied. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>NOTE: BoardGameTables edition contains both XL Expansion and Double Expansion and is entirely replacing the previous editions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fief: France 1429 is a game of dynastic ambition in which players assume the roles of nobles in the 15th century kingdom of France. Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!<br/><br/>Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.<br/> The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.<br/><br/>Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.<br/><br/>In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!<br/> You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!<br/><br/>In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!<br/><br/>Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.<br/><br/>Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.' These items are all still available directly from Academy Games.<br/><br/>This game is the most recent edition of Fief. It re-implements: <br/><br/>    Fief (first original edition, 1981)<br/>    Fief 2 (second edition with updated rules, 1989)<br/>    Fief (third edition with completely revised rules and material, 2011)<br/><br/><br/>",

The game features 4 square wood boards (2 of each color) and 16 natural river stones for each player, in two colors, with a rope dividing the play area in half.<br/><br/>Your turn is in two parts. First, a player may move one of their stones up to two spaces in any direction, including diagonally, in what is called a passive (or set up) move. Second, they take a more aggressive move, which must be the same direction and number of spaces as the first move. It is this second move that allows you to push stones across the board - or off the board's edge. Remove all four of your opponent's stones from just one of the four boards to win.<br/><br/>SHOBU evokes the feeling of GO or CHESS but provides its own unique challenge. It feels immediately familiar and yet is wholly distinct and engaging.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

This re-themed version of Battle Line features 60 beautiful new cards by illustrator Roland MacDonald, as well as 10 full-color tactics &quot;wildcards&quot; that give players extra flexibility and choices and help make each new battle wildly different from the last.<br/><br/>Battle Line takes about 30 minutes to play. To win, you must create powerful formations along your side of the line of battle that are superior to those of your enemy. Victory goes to the player who wins 5 of the 9 battle flags (an envelopment) or three adjacent flags (a breakthrough). Based on Reiner Knizia's original design published in Germany as Shotten-Totten, Battle Line enhances and expands that game system to give players even more tactical options and gut-wrenching decisions.<br/><br/>Battle Line places you in command of your army's strategies. How will you muster your formations? Will you use your powerful KingsGuard to vanquish your enemy, or perhaps send the King of England or France to the front to win a critical flag? Or perhaps you&quot;ll rely on your spies to determine the enemy&quot;s strengths and weaknesses before committing your best forces. You'll always have plenty of choices. With every card play, you'll determine the strength and direction of your attack while plotting to fend off your enemy's advances.<br/><br/>In Battle Line, you and your opponent lead the combined arms of the greatest units of the era.

        "description": "Cosmic Encounter 42nd Anniversary Edition welcomes new players to the game of infinite possibilities with a freshly revised rulebook and a beautifully illustrated Quick-start Guide that captures the nostalgia of the original game and makes it easy for anyone to learn. The Quick-start Guide&rsquo;s comic book style throws readers back to the 1970s, providing vital insight into the core rules of the game while embracing the fun of a cosmic conquest filled with wacky aliens and outrageous abilities. What's more, with the beautiful translucent ship pieces (as shown above), spreading your colonies across the galaxy has never been more stylish!<br/><br/>A newly discovered species joins the classic line-up of aliens. You can, of course, play as old favorites such as Mite or Remora, or you can try your hand at leading the ruthless Demon to victory. Previously only released at Cosmic Con, this species was exiled from their original galaxy for unprincipled opportunism. Now they seek cosmic vengeance, using their power to possess other players&rsquo; hands to bolster their own strength and sap others&rsquo; will to win.<br/><br/>In addition to this monstrous newcomer, Cosmic Encounter 42nd Anniversary Edition offers you new ways to customize your games with the introduction of Cosmic Combo cards. These carefully assembled cards offer a list of alien species with a brief description of their powers to create themed matchups and explore different types of games. You may find yourself among some Big Time Clubbers or Cellar Dwellers, that can be integrated into three, four, or five-player games. Every card spins a new challenge, and with these new options for customization, no two games are ever the same.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Naturally, the most aspirational beasts would lobby for a position in the star exhibit, and the lead star would be elected Zoo Mascot.<br/><br/>In order to join the star exhibit, each species must campaign its way up the hierarchy of enclosures with the majority support of animal voters.  And the lead star will be the species that has earned the most laurels from both raving fans and jealous rivals along the way.<br/><br/>How does one gain support and earn laurels?  Through crafty politicking, clever negotiations, and ruthless schemes.  There can only be one Zoo Mascot, after all.<br/><br/>Where are you going? That is the ultimate question of Zoo Vadis.<br/><br/>Zoo Vadis is an evolution of Reiner Knizia&rsquo;s classic negotiation game, Quo Vadis? It retains the elegant, political gameplay that fans have come to love while introducing many innovations and improvements by:<br/><br/><br/>     Enhancing the 3-player game and tailoring the board to all player counts through neutral, bribable figures&mdash;roaming peacocks<br/>     Widening the player count with a second game board for 6-7 players<br/>     Expanding the possibilities for strategic negotiation with asymmetric animal abilities<br/>     Increasing tactical opportunities with new special laurel tokens<br/>     Broadening the appeal of the theme and presentation with vibrant zoo art by Kwanchai Moriya and Brigette Indelicato<br/>     Enlivening the production with chunky animal figures and functional player screens<br/><br/><br/>Like the original design, the game ends immediately when the Star Exhibit is full.

Any tile may be purchased, but you get a discount if you place a tile touching another one of the same color.

Finishing a row or column will award the player points (doubled if it is all windows), and the game is a race to 12 points.<br/><br/>Copenhagen comes in several versions. The current in print versions are a Base Game with cardboard tiles, and a Deluxe edition (2022 printing) with: an alternative cover, laser cut acrylic tiles with transparent windows, and the &quot;Nyhavn&quot; and &quot;New Facades&quot; Queenies (expansion modules).

In Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll zoom through canyons hunting enemy tanks and troops while dodging their AAA fire and SAMs.<br/><br/>Stuffing all this heavy metal in one box has allowed us to expand the normal Leader component set! This game comes with 168 cards and 5 counter sheets!<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you down in the weeds in 8 campaigns spanning the globe. The game system creates immense replayability by pairing a Tactical Situation card with the Campaign card to create a unique environment for the campaign. This means that your campaign in North Korea might be part of a Holding Action, Show of Force, Rapid Deployment, or General War.<br/><br/>The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.<br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridge-line to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!<br/><br/>You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, S.P. Artillery, APC, Infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft.<br/><br/>While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy SAM and AAA assets?<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy tanks before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it won&rsquo;t be able to fly the next day.<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader or Phantom Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Thunderbolt-Apache Leader.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following aircraft:<br/>A-10A Thunderbolt II<br/>A-10C Thunderbolt II<br/>AH-64A Apache<br/>AH-64D Apache Longbow<br/>AH-1 Cobra<br/>F-16 Fighting Falcon<br/>AV-8B Harrier II<br/>AC-130 Spectre<br/>RQ-1 Predator UAV<br/>MQ-1 Predator UAV<br/><br/>Scheduled Campaigns:<br/>Iraq 1991<br/>Pakistan 2013<br/>Libya 1984<br/>Iran 2014<br/>Taiwan Defense 2008<br/>North Korea 2011<br/>Israel Defense 2001<br/>North Atlantic WWIII 1986<br/><br/>Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following weapons: Mk.82 Iron Bomb, Mk.83 Iron Bomb, AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-92 Stinger, LAU-68, LAU-61, ECM Pod, AGM-114 Hellfire, AIM-9 Sidewinder, Mk.20 Rockeye<br/><br/>Target Audience: <br/>This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.<br/><br/>The game can also be played co-op (like our other Leader games) by splitting-up the aircraft and planning/resolving missions as a team.<br/><br/>Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Each campaign consists of 2 to 6 turns in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each day.<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Thunderbolt/Apache Leader<br/><br/><br/>",

With the help of the right country cards, they occupy influential positions and obtain bonuses for this in the form of victory points. The higher the rank of the title associated with the position, the more country cards required. Already-occupied positions can be contested by playing intrigue cards.<br/><br/>The game proceeds over three periods, with a scoring taking place after each of them. During scoring, the players with the greatest influence in each of the four countries score victory points. After the third period scoring, the game ends with the scoring of the individual titles.

Collect all the gems before the end of three rounds of play, and you win!<br/><br/>To set up the game, place gem tokens on the designated spaces of the game board and the team tracker token in the center of the movement path. At the start of each round, shuffle the deck of thirty cards &mdash; which contains three suits, each numbered 1-10 &mdash; and deal each player a hand of eleven cards. Reveal one card as the &quot;decree&quot; card to determine the trump suit. For each trick, one player leads a card, and the other must follow suit, if possible. The winner of the trick moves the team tracker toward them a number of spaces equal to the number of fox footprints on the cards played. If the tracker lands on a space next to a gem, the players collect one gem. If the tracker would move off the end of the path, return the tracker to the center of the path, then add a forest token to one end of the path, reducing the number of spaces upon which you can move (with you sliding gems next to this covered space next to the new end of the path).<br/><br/>The odd-numbered character cards have special abilities when played, allowing the trick winner to move the tracker in the direction of their choice or to ignore the footprints on one of the played cards so that you can land on just the right spot. One character allows players to exchange one card with each other, while another allows a player to change the decree card.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, you add five gems to designated spaces, add a forest space to shorten the path, then receive a new hand of eleven cards from a freshly shuffled deck. Collect all 22 gem tokens, and you win. Run out of time or head off the end of the path with no forest spaces in reserve, then you can just keep running in defeat or shuffle the cards and start the game anew.<br/><br/>",

Players compete using members of the Rebel Alliance and denizens of Jabba&rsquo;s Palace in a game of rebel bravery and vile deceit.<br/><br/>Based on the beloved card game and set in the Star Wars galaxy, Star Wars: Jabba&rsquo;s Palace - A Love Letter Game retains the simple and fun mechanics of the original as you utilize the talents of iconic characters from Return of the Jedi. Players take turns using the elegant &ldquo;draw a card, play a card&rdquo; gameplay and then executing the card&rsquo;s effect. Cards include characters like Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Salacious Crumb, Jabba the Hutt, and many more, with each card offering different effects, such as Boba Fett allowing you to take a card from another player, or Salacious Crumb allowing you to look at another player&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>Players use abilities from members of both the Rebel Alliance and Jabba&rsquo;s crew to outwit and outlast the others. On top of the classic mechanics from the original Love Letter game, Star Wars: Jabba&rsquo;s Palace - A Love Letter Game also introduces Agenda cards. This offers new win conditions, adding another level of strategy to the game.<br/><br/>Agenda cards like Exalted One awards the player with the highest number in hand the win. However, cards like Jabba&rsquo;s Court and Rescue Mission switch it up and award the victory to the player with the most Palace or Rebels cards, respectively, in the play area. These and other Agenda cards ensure varied strategies will be needed with every game beyond simply eliminating other players.<br/><br/>In a quick card game of rebel bravery and vile deceit, can you carry out your agenda while outthinking your foes?<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba, home of legendary rum and birthplace of the revolution! The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.<br/><br/>In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says &quot;broker&quot;, but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships &ndash; and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your &quot;connections&quot;.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, nine locals &ndash; the Cubans &ndash; are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.<br/><br/>Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice &ndash; one for each type of good &ndash; then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.<br/><br/>All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)<br/><br/>If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods. If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place &ndash; unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.<br/><br/>After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs. The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money.<br/><br/>Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BattleTech (aka &quot;BT&quot;) is a science-fiction tactical wargame in which players battle one another with various war machines.  The heart of the game is the &quot;BattleMech&quot; (aka Mech), a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own Mechs from scratch.  The game is typically played on one or more hex mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play.  An extensive line of pewter figurines (Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)<br/><br/>As in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available.  The current versions are the BattleTech: Beginner Box (contains 2 plastic Mechs, a map, and simplified quick-start Mech rules). Designed to immediately follow this is the BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat box (8 plastic Mechs, mapsheets, cardboard Mech standees, and the full rules for Mechs and basic gear).  Lastly, the BattleTech: Clan Invasion box adds further Mechs and maps and slightly expands the rules to include more advanced technologies and unit types, while moving a player forward through the game's timeline.<br/><br/>The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of rulebooks.  The primary ones are either Total Warfare, which covers combined arms (Mechs, combat vehicles, battle armor, aircraft etc), or the BattleTech: BattleMech Manual, which continues on from the introductory box sets in offering more advanced but still Mech-only play.  The rest of the current in-print rulebook line is covered below.<br/><br/>BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history.  Accompanying these are pregenerated PDF record sheet collections, which have full gameplay statistics for each unit in a corresponding Technical Readout and are designed to be printed out for tabletop play.

You get three actions a turn to buy cards which then let you lay tiles to control land and herds, or you may buy extras, such as waterholes or the haciendas of the title to get bonus points.<br/><br/>The game has two card decks, one showing the different land types on the hex map, the other the different animals (pigs, cows, horses and sheep). Some cards are laid face up and you pay 3 pesos to buy the ones you want, or 2 pesos for an unknown card from the draw deck. You spend the cards to put your markers on land and to place your animal tokens on the board. Animals of a type go together to make a herd naturally, and each time a herd touches a market town on the board, you earn money for the size of herd and land attached. With careful hand and herd management, you can make good cash gains and also block your opponents. You need the money to buy more cards of course. 12 pesos also buys waterholes you can place next to your herds, or haciendas to go on your land or herds. If you run short of money, you can call a harvest and get cash off your land.<br/><br/>But the game is not about money. You score victory points halfway through the game and at the end. The more markets you are serving, the more points you get. The herds and the land get you points. The water and haciendas get you bonus points as well, which can be crucial to your success.<br/><br/>It should be noted, the game board has two sides: a symmetrical dog-bone shape of land types (appears in most of the photos), and a &quot;random&quot; more varied pattern of land types.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.spielbyweb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.spielbyweb.com/</a> (turn-based)<br/>     Yucata (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>",

The board is composed of 8 rooms that can be moved and rotated by the players. Each turn, a player is able to spend actions to move around the dungeon, pick up and use items, battle with the opponents team, or turn and move the rooms of the dungeon.<br/><br/>The goal is to reach 5 victory points.  Points are collected by moving adventurers out of the dungeon or by killing an opponent's adventurer. Objects are disseminated across the whole dungeon and will bring the adventurers well-needed powers.<br/><br/>Each player has the same characters, each with different powers. Some run fast, some fight or disarm traps. The cleric heals, magician burns everything in sight, and the goblin is so weak that the simple fact of getting him out will bring you two victory points.<br/><br/>Combat and actions are managed via cards. To move, fight, heal, or turn a room, you must manage action points obtained by playing cards. Those cards are not drawn but selected from a set of cards by both players. Both players have access to the same panel of cards at the beginning of the game, so the game is really about managing the resources and adapting to the changing environment.<br/><br/>Dungeon Twister is the original game in the Dungeon Twister series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Ordinary Townsfolk, or special character such as The Sheriff, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Fortune Teller and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is &quot;lynched&quot;, reveals his/her role and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.<br/><br/>The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow/les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux/Die Werw&ouml;lfe von D&uuml;sterwald is a published version arranged by Hervé Marly and Philippe des Pallières and published by Lui-même, 2001 for 8-23 players. This has been nominated for the 2003 Spiel des Jahres award.<br/><br/>Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a separate game from Werewolf, and was split from that entry at the request of Asmodee.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ubongo, players compete to solve individual puzzles as quickly as they can to get first crack at the gems on hand for the taking.<br/><br/>Original edition:<br/>The game board consists of six rows, with twelve gems (of various colors) placed in these rows. At the start of play, each player places their pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.<br/><br/>Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.<br/><br/>2015 edition:<br/>The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem. Whoever scores the most gem-points after nine rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Sentient robots for information, transportation, industry &mdash; all at our fingertips. Building them is now the easy part. Programming them has proven to be more complicated. A handful of companies have emerged claiming to pull it off, but only one will win out. Your mission is clear: Procure valuable bots and plug them into your network. They'll have an effect on your systems. Anticipate it correctly, program your bots effectively, and attract the right investors to win and lead the sentient revolution.<br/><br/>In Sentient, players are tasked with choosing from available robots to program in their factory. Each robot that is added modifies your board and attracts the interest of investors for your company. Program your bots efficiently and collect the support of your patrons to build the most formidable operation.<br/><br/>Description from GTS article:<br/><br/>Sentient is a dice-manipulation game by J. Alex Kevern (World&rsquo;s Fair 1893, Gold West). As with his other games, Sentient is filled with smart, simple, and rewarding choices. Each turn involves choosing an available bot, adding it to your factory, and deciding how to divide your resources between optimizing your bot and wooing investors. Players who enjoy a satisfying puzzle will appreciate the difficulty in adding the chosen bot to their factory. Each slot has a die on either side that will be modified based on the chosen bot card. But, adding another adjacent bot the next turn will modify the dice once again. The dice at the end of the round will determine how efficiently your bots were programmed and will grant you varying points based on the dice numbers. You may have everything perfectly sorted out &mdash; that is, until the last bot you choose changes the adjacent dice. Your plan can crumble and points can easily be lost with an errant decision or wrong choice!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).<br/>  <br/>     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.<br/><br/>Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.<br/><br/>The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.<br/><br/>As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.<br/><br/>Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player can place whatever sum is rolled into an empty shape in a row that matches the color of one of the dice. Two rules must be followed when placing a sum in a row:<br/><br/><br/>    All numbers in a row must increase from left to right.<br/>    No number can be repeated in a vertical column.<br/><br/><br/>A player does not have to enter the number in a row, but if the active player, the one who rolled the dice, doesn't do so, then they must mark a misthrow box on their scoresheet.<br/><br/>The game continues until someone has filled two rows on their scoresheet or someone has tallied four misthrows. Players then tally their points: For each completed column on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the number in that column's pentagon. For each completed row on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the rightmost number in that row. For each incomplete row on their scoresheet, a player scores one point per number in that row. For each misthrow, a player loses five points. Whoever has the highest sum wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Only in a few corners of the world is the memory of magic still alive, even though a few centuries ago its healing power permeated everything. Witches, its last remaining practitioners, have always been outcasts and could help human society only in strict secrecy. The leader of their people, the Septima, has always been the wisest, most knowledgeable witch. Now, as her time is coming to an end, witches from all over the world gather at Noctenburg to leave their mark on the hostile town and prove to the Septima that they are her worthy successor.<br/><br/>Septima is a competitive, highly interactive strategy game of witchcraft. As the leader of your coven, you must prove your worth in the town of Noctenburg to become the successor of Septima, the High Witch. Practice your craft and gain Wisdom by collecting herbs, brewing potions, healing the townsfolk, mastering charms and rescuing your fellow brothers and sisters from the trials. But beware: magic, even if used for good, invokes suspicion in the townsfolk...<br/><br/>Simultaneous action selection with positive player interaction: Septima&rsquo;s central mechanism revolves around the simultaneous, secret selection of one of nine Action cards each turn: Move, Collect, Brew, Heal, Recruit, Plea, Chant, Rite and Remember. Each Action gets a powerful bonus if it is chosen by multiple players, but performing them together also raises suspicion in the townsfolk and attracts the attention of the Witch Hunters. Decisions of when to do a shared action (and who to do it with) adds a fresh, semi-cooperative touch to a competitive game, and lots of player interaction.<br/><br/>Rescue witches to build your Coven: Heal, enthrall or convince the townsfolk and amass enough support to sway the periodic Witch Trials in your favor. If the hostile witnesses are outvoted, the convicted witch is absolved and joins the coven that rescued them. You start small but you can grow your coven to up to four witches this way, each with their own personality and special ability to help your cause. Reckless Witches caught by Witch Hunters are also put to trial, so with enough support from the townsfolk, even witches from other, less careful players&rsquo; coven can end up in yours.<br/><br/>Accessible, intuitive and familiar: Septima is Mindclash Games&rsquo; most accessible title to date, with beautiful, hand-drawn art style by Villő Farkas and with the character art of Barbara Bern&aacute;t, wooden components and intuitive, theme-inspired mechanisms. It is very quick to teach and set up, and takes less than 2 hours to play, even with four players.<br/><br/>",

Immediately he photographed everything that he loves to make disappear when he is haunting&thinsp; &ndash; including himself, of course. Unfortunately, the enchanted camera takes many photos in the wrong colors. Sometimes the green bottle is white, at other times it's blue. Looking at the photos, Balduin doesn't really remember any more what he wanted to make disappear next.

If you grab the right items quickly, you have a good chance of winning...<br/><br/>The lightning fast shape and color recognition game that is sure to test the reflexes of kids, families and gamers alike. In Ghost Blitz, five wooden items sit on the table waiting to be caught: a white ghost, a green bottle, a cute grey mouse, a blue book, and a comfortable red chair. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way. With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?<br/><br/><br/>    If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected.

        "description": "Terraforming Mars: The Dice Game is a card-driven dice game in which players use special dice to develop their corporations and terraform Mars into a new home for humanity. The dice represent resources that players spend to play cards and perform other actions. During the game, you increase your production of dice, terraform, place cities and greenery tiles on the board, and gain various bonuses. Each turn, you either produce new dice (Production Turn) or perform actions (Action Turn).<br/><br/>Whenever you terraform Mars (raise oxygen or temperature, or place an ocean tile), you gain 2 Victory Points (VP). You can also gain VP for placing tiles and playing cards, as well as winning Awards and Milestones.<br/><br/>The game ends when two of the three global parameters &mdash; oxygen/temperature/ocean &mdash; have been completed. The player with most VP wins.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all their cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: Inventions can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1888, and Steampunk technology has advanced at a prodigious rate! Probes have been sent to Mars, and soon astronauts will be manning rockets in order to mine the planet for newly discovered resources. The first is a brand new element, Celerium, that could prove to be a combustible energy source the likes man has never seen. The second is Sylvanite, an incredibly dense material unlike anything found on earth. In addition to these resources, glaciers have been discovered on the planet. Whoever controls these icy masses could work to create a livable atmosphere on Mars<br/><br/>In Mission: Red Planet, players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials. Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources: Celerium, Sylvanite, or Ice. After rounds 5 and 8, players gain score tokens for every region where they control the majority of the astronauts. At the end of the game, players score one final time, adding any bonuses received from Discovery Cards and Bonus Cards. The player with the most score tokens at the end controls Mars, and all the riches it can bring!<br/><br/>From Bruno Faidutti's website:<br/><br/>This one, designed with Bruno Cathala, started with the theme. We wanted to make a game about colonizing Mars, with shuttles leaving the blue planet towards the red one. The theme is strong, and well caught in the steampunk graphic style decided by Asmodée. In Mission: Red Planet, each player plays a colonial power which sends astronauts, in space shuttles, to occupy the most promising zones on the planet. For scholars, the systems merge a majority game, &agrave; la El Grande or San Marco, with a character/action card system, somewhere between Citadels and Hoity Toity/Adel Verpflichtet. Nothing really new here, but there was much work on it and we're really proud of the result.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Volume V in GMT&rsquo;s COIN Series takes us back to the struggle of the American Patriots against their parent British government.   A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war.<br/><br/>Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor.<br/><br/>Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including:<br/><br/><br/>    Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) <br/>    Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) <br/>    Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals)  for battles and skirmishes with line infantry <br/>    Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids<br/>    Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French <br/>    French blockades to confound British plans<br/>    French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort<br/>    A large deck of 110 + cards for great play variety <br/>    Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. <br/><br/><br/>Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges:<br/><br/>As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region.  With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will.  You will muster Tories to support your efforts.  They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover.  You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map.  The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive.  With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align.  Each leader brings something new to the war effort.  If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order.  If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up!<br/><br/>As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army.  You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas.  Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars.  Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance.  Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive.  Will the French be there when you need them?  Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up.  Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British.<br/><br/>As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British.  You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages.  The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region.  War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack?<br/><br/>As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America.  With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection.  Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle.  You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British.<br/><br/>As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent Commands and capabilities.  Rabble-rousing, Indian Raids, Persuasion, Naval Pressure, Letter of Marque, Looting, Trading, Skirmishing, and Foraging and more options are available.

For each number revealed, you cross off a matching number on one of your cards, with you starting the game by choosing three out of five cards. Each time you complete a row or column, you receive the printed bonus next to it:<br/><br/><br/>     A lightning bolt, which you can spend to raise or lower the number that you're crossing off on a turn; spend three lightning bolts, for example, and you can change a 7 into either a 4 or a 1 (because the numbers &quot;wrap&quot;)<br/>     A moon, with the player who has the most moons scoring 6 points at game's end, while the player with the fewest loses 6 points (except in a two-player game)<br/>     A star, with you scoring 1, 4, or 9 points for collecting 1, 2, or 3 stars in a single round<br/>     A number, which you immediately cross off on one of your cards; if doing so completes another row or column, you score that bonus, too!<br/>     A question mark, which allows you to cross off any number.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a round, you score points for each card that you've completely marked off, with the points diminishing each round from 15 in round one to 8 in round four. Each player then draws three new cards and keeps one of them.<br/><br/>After four rounds, you score 1 point for each two spaces Xed on unfinished cards, then tally your points from completed cards, stars, and moons to see who has the highest score and wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Caught in an enigmatic storm, a modern-day luxury ocean liner crashes ashore on an otherworldly island. As one of the ambitious survivors, you soon learn that the island is home to a multitude of majestic and fiercely territorial dinosaurs. With the cruiser beyond repair, you have no choice but to establish a foothold on the island, withstand the onslaught of the dinosaurs, and sow the seeds of what will one day become a strong and tenacious community capable of discovering the mystery of the island.<br/><br/>Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles introduces the first two episodes in a series of euro-style dice-drafting / dice-placement strategy games. The saga will ultimately consist of four episodes, telling the story of a group of survivors becoming a mighty civilization on a hostile island. As each episode features unique characteristics and a different game feel, they are playable as standalone medium/heavy games but also as a continuous campaign. The theme and story unfolds through evolving game mechanisms across the episodes, also making the rules easier to learn. In the campaign mode, the outcome of each episode influences the next, but the game has no legacy elements and no hidden rules; the whole storyline is infinitely replayable.<br/><br/>In Episode 1, players are striving to develop and protect the foothold town of Perseverance, besieged by the dinosaurs of the island. By building walls, traps and settlements, mounting defenses and partaking in the early political power struggles of a forming community, players gain followers to establish themselves as leaders. Episode 1 introduces the signature dice placement / area majority mechanism that evolves and spans through the series, and also features a defense mechanism against waves of attacking dinosaurs, unique to this episode.<br/><br/>In Episode 2, the survivors have successfully defended the city of Perseverance, completing a massive wall to stop the dinosaur onslaught. Under the guidance of the ship&rsquo;s senior officers, the players now set out to explore the surrounding wilderness, expand the settlement beyond the walls, and chart a path to the mysterious structure on the horizon. This Episode adds new actions to expand the core mechanism and allows for a deep customization of your Leader and faction through dozens of unique skills. The previous episode&rsquo;s defense mechanism evolves into hex-based adventuring and expansion, allowing you to build outposts beyond the city walls, but beware - the dinosaurs are still not your friends...yet.<br/><br/>",

Included in this game are 4 unique 60 minute escape room puzzles that will test your cranial skills. Use images, gears, words, keys, shapes, maps and more to solve the three stages within each escape room. An analog timer on the Chrono Decoder centerpiece incessantly counts down, emitting ominous noises to create an environment shut out from the outside world. If the puzzles stump you for too long, slide a hint card into the Hint Decoder to keep your team moving. Slide 4 keys into the Chrono Decoder when you think you have the answer... but beware, if you're wrong, a precious minute will be taken from you.<br/><br/>The 4 escape rooms vary in difficulty, designed to give any group the experience they expect and deserve. If you're craving more puzzles, Escape Room expansions will be available, but you'll need the base game first as the Chrono Decoder is essential to the experience. Included in the base game in order of difficulty is: Prison Break, Virus, Nuclear Countdown, and Temple of the Aztec<br/><br/>Prison Break: Ten years in prison for a crime you didn't commit. Ten years of your life wasted for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, it hardly seemed fair. You know the guards will reach your cell during the rounds in an hour. Every bone in your body tells you this is the opportunity of a lifetime; you're 60 minutes away from freedom!<br/><br/>Virus: What a time to faint! You swear you could kill your lab partner, but you know that won't be necessary. The liquid that's oozing out of the broken bottle will kill everybody in the room soon enough...<br/><br/>Nuclear Countdown: The table is filled with all kinds of materials that send shivers down your spine. At that moment your phone rings and your worst nightmare becomes reality, the bomb threat is real!<br/><br/>Temple of the Aztec: The stories told about the temple were numerous. Anybody that had entered the temple was never seen again, supposedly killed by vipers. But stories also spoke of the Eye of Aztec, the largest diamond that ever existed<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the 16th century, the city has one of the largest municipal territories within the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Success and wealth are not only due to Swabian thriftiness, but mainly the result of the citizens&rsquo; business acumen and skilled craftsmanship. Trade in works of art and commercial goods such as wood, wine, salt and textiles is flourishing; for the most part, these goods are shipped by barge or raft on the Danube river. People are busy building the cathedral - the social heart of the city - that will at one time have the tallest church steeple in the world. Everybody of distinction meets around the cathedral. The influential guilds and patricians dominate city life; and if you want to accomplish something, you need to be in the good graces of the right people.<br/><br/>In Ulm, players try to expand their spheres of influence and to make optimal use of the hustle and bustle on the marketplace around the cathedral. The game has one simple basic rule: Push 1 Action tile into the Cathedral area and carry out the 3 associated actions! This way, the Cathedral tower gets taller and taller over the game. The objective of the game is plain and simple: try to accumulate the most victory points through activities in different areas of city life in Ulm and do it before the end of the 10th round, when the construction of the Cathedral is concluded.<br/><br/>Who will make the best use of his means and resources over time and will go down in the annals of the city&rsquo;s history as an important citizen?<br/><br/>",

Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, word spread quickly and it triggered the California Gold Rush of &lsquo;49.<br/><br/>Thousands of people arrived from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing boomtowns in the country. Claims were staked, camps and makeshift homes were built, and hotels and saloons sprung up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their cut of the land&rsquo;s wealth. For many it was Coloma or Bust!<br/><br/>In the game of Coloma, you are a pioneer who has recently traveled out West to strike it rich and make a name for yourself. You will prospect for gold and use your windfalls to recruit workers, rustle up horses, and establish businesses. You will also get opportunities to explore the surrounding riverways and frontier lands. But alas! You are not alone&mdash;every other pioneer seems to have gotten the same idea! Therefore, it will take extra cunning tactics on your part to not go Bust with the rest of them&hellip;<br/><br/>Overview of Play<br/>At the beginning of each chapter, you and the other players will simultaneously select an action to perform on the board. Once your selections are revealed, you must check if a majority of players chose the same action. If so, it is a Bust&mdash;which disables the Boom bonus that would be included otherwise. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons on the map, building bridges and businesses, and placing camps and gunmen. After that, a section of the board is rotated&mdash;slightly changing the layout of the actions for the upcoming chapter.<br/><br/>When the rotating section hits high noon, the round ends with a bang: a shootout against an ever-growing number of outlaws! If you and the other players can outnumber the outlaws with your combined gunmen, you will get your fair share of the rewards. But if not, the rewards drop, and some of the gunmen will go to the graveyard... The game ends after the third shootout, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Coloma is a fast moving game with many paths to victory. It offers unique twists on simultaneous action selection, resource management, and engine-building. The town cards in your tableau allow you to play more efficiently, gain extra actions, and bend the rules to your advantage. With these cards and the bridge tiles (which add points based on what you achieve), you can create the perfect combination for your strategy and play style.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.<br/><br/>With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.<br/><br/>The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.<br/><br/>Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.<br/><br/>The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.<br/><br/>The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.<br/><br/>Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.<br/><br/>Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.<br/><br/>The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.<br/><br/>Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.<br/><br/>",

Your people can develop new things like basketry or find oxen or simply GROW and conquer.<br/><br/>In Rise of Tribes, players control a tribal faction in prehistoric times looking to GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and LEAD their people. The board is modular, composed of hexes in various terrain types. Each hex has a population limit. Players manage the number of tribe members they place on any one hex to either trigger or avoid conflict.<br/><br/>Each turn the active player rolls two dice, then selects two of the four actions to take -  GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and/or LEAD. Each action is resolved one action at a time. The power of each action taken depends on the die roll plus the last couple of dice placed onto the action board on the selected action by other players. Once both actions are taken, the active player resolves any Conflicts. The final step of each turn is the time to build villages and complete goal cards.<br/><br/>Victory is possible in a couple ways: gathering resources to build villages and/or completing development and achievement goal cards for your civilization. Villages (limited to 1 per hex) score 1 point for the tribe that built them at the start of that tribe's turn. Goal cards will score points immediately when completed. Every tribe's ambition is to score 15 points. The tribe to score 15 points first wins the game.<br/><br/>Solo mode, with the addition of Rise of Tribes: The Vul'Keth Invasion (required and sold separately), is a very challenging way to play Rise of Tribes.<br/><br/>Rise of Tribes - Microbadges<br/><br/> Rise of Tribes fan<br/> Rise of Tribes fan<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One Deck Dungeon is a card game &quot;roguelike&quot; &mdash; a dungeon delve that is different every time, difficult to survive, with a character you build up from scratch. The deck consists of various foes to combat and other perils from the dungeon. Each card depicts both the obstacle to overcome and the potential rewards for doing so. When you defeat a card, you claim it as either experience, an item, or a skill, tucking it under the appropriate side of your character card to show its benefits. The longer you take exploring the dungeon, the deeper you'll delve, and the difficulty will scale up quickly! If you make it far enough, you'll have to fight the dungeon boss. Survive, and you'll be a legend!<br/><br/>One Deck Dungeon: Forest of Shadows is a standalone expansion for  One Deck Dungeon that contains new heroes, new dungeons, new perils, new foes, and new mechanisms: Poison and event Perils! It can be combined with the original game for a hybrid dungeon experience, with the heroes and dungeons being compatible with the original, or played on its own.<br/><br/>",

In the game, this is depicted by playing through a deck of cards representing elements of the German 6th Army.<br/><br/>Pavlov&rsquo;s House was a fortified apartment building used as a strongpoint by the Soviet 62nd Army during the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad in WW2. Soviet defenders - primarily from the 7th Company, 3rd Battalion, 42nd Guards Rifle Regiment of the 13th Guards Division - held out for almost two months from a constant German assault. The building&rsquo;s name was drawn from Yakov Pavlov, a sergeant who led the initial storm group assault that resulted in the capture of the building from the Germans. The story of Pavlov&rsquo;s House was a key piece of Soviet propaganda and was used as a symbol of the incredible resistance of Soviet forces during the Battle of Stalingrad.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.<br/><br/>To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.<br/><br/>When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the card-driven board game Rialto, the goal is to earn the most victory points (VPs), which are awarded for a variety of things. The game board displays the six districts of Venice, and players earn VPs for placing council members into these, for building bridges and placing gondolas to connect the districts with one another, and for building advantageous buildings.<br/><br/>The game is played over six rounds, with each round consisting of three phases:<br/><br/>1. Acquire cards: Each player takes a set of cards.<br/>2. Play cards: Players use cards to perform certain actions.<br/>3. Activate buildings: Players may take advantage of their buildings and use their powers.<br/><br/>In phase 1, sets of eight cards are displayed (with six cards face-up and two face-down). Each player takes one set, then reduces his hand to seven cards. A card shows one of six specific characters (Architect, Merchant, etc.) or is a wild card.<br/><br/>Phase 2 consists of six sub-phases in a fixed order, one for each character. In each sub-phase, players choose whether or not to play one or more cards of that specific character. Each card allows them to perfom that character's action, for example:<br/><br/><br/>     Take one piece of gold for each Merchant card you play.<br/>     Place one council member into the current district for each Council card you play.<br/>     Take a building with a value equal to or lower than the number of Architect cards played. The higher its value, the better its function.<br/><br/><br/>Whoever plays the most cards in each such sub-phase receives a bonus of one free action of that type. In case of a tie, whoever is farthest along the &quot;Doge&quot; bar gets the bonus &ndash; and of course to advance on the Doge bar, players need to play Doge cards.<br/><br/>Finally, in phase 3, players may take advantage of their buildings. For each piece of gold paid, a player may use one of his building's ability.<br/><br/>Players collect VPs both during the game &ndash; from special buildings and by building bridges between districts &ndash; and at the end of it &ndash; for majorities of council members in each district. The value of each district evolves during the game: Each district is adjacent to four other ones, and at the end of the game, they will be connected either via bridges or gondolas. A bridge increases the value of the adjacent districts by 3-6 victory points, whereas a gondola increases this value by 1 point. The player with the most council members in a district earns VPs equal to the district's total value, the player with the secondmost council members earns half this value, and so on. While it's important to establish majorities in the districts, it's also crucial to control their values by cleverly placing those bridges and gondolas.<br/><br/>",

The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields.<br/><br/>The Keythedral will be built in five stages, and each stage will require different building materials. In the early stages, simple materials will be needed, and as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period, the builders will require food and water, and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine.<br/><br/>In the game, each player starts with five cottages. Each cottage houses a worker. Each turn, every worker will try to move into one of the fields adjacent to their cottage in order to gather resources from the land. These resources are required for building the Keythedral.<br/><br/>Problems, however, are at hand. Firstly, no one is ever quite sure what the building requirements for the next stage of the Keythedral will be until the previous stage is completed. Secondly, once more workers arrive, the fields will become crowded, and some of the workers will be idle. Players may choose to fence off some of the fields in order to keep out their opponents' workers. However, the workers are quite partial to the odd tipple, and for a couple of barrels of wine, they can be persuaded to remove any one of the fences that a player has taken offense to!<br/><br/>Good luck in your endeavors to keep your workers productive and to get the right building materials at the right time.<br/><br/>Keythedral is Richard Breese's fourth game in the key series.<br/><br/>",

You know it is only a matter of time before they take a close look and discover Jabba&lsquo;s hidden illegal goods. There&lsquo;s no time to waste. You need to break out of your cell, rescue your astromech and get hold off the cargo. Then all you need to do is recover your ship and escape!<br/><br/>Your objective: Escape with your astromech (co- pilot droid) and the cargo.<br/><br/>(2) Escape from Hoth <br/><br/>Echo Base, an important Rebel stronghold, has managed to remain hidden on the ice planet Hoth for some time. The hostile climate provides excellent cover and protection from the Empire- but you must always remain vigilant!<br/><br/>You head out on a routine patrol with your trusty tauntaun mount, a hearty creature native to Hoth. After an uneventful morning, you take a brief break to rest your tauntaun while you contact Echo Base with an update. However, due to heavy atmospheric disturbance, you can&lsquo;t reach them.<br/><br/>Your mission: Continue your patrol, explore the ice planet, and contact Echo Base!<br/><br/>(3) Secret mission on Jedha <br/><br/>You are an Imperial spy sent to infiltrate the Holy City of Jedha. An Imperial pilot transporting a crate of priceless kyber crystals crashed their Zeta- class cargo shuttle on the surface. You must retrieve the crate without alerting the Rebel scum Saw Gerrera or any of his lawless mercenaries on Jedha. There is an Imperial informant waiting for you on the surface with more details. Meanwhile, Imperial Command orbits Jedha in a Star Destroyer. They are within communications range and expect regular updates.<br/><br/>Your mission: Gather intel, maintain your cover story, and recover the kyber crystals!<br/><br/>",

Now imagine that in the last 10 minutes of the show things have gone so badly that the captain is dead and you and the surviving members of your crew have to pull together and save the day yourselves!<br/><br/>The Captain Is Dead is a co-op game for 2 to 7 players. All you have to do is get the ship's engines (aka &quot;Jump Core&quot;) back online and you win, but because there is a hostile alien ship trying to destroy you, that is easier said than done.<br/><br/>You have an impressive star ship full of useful systems that will help you fend off the aliens, and get the Jump Core back online. Each system gives you an advantage while it remains online. The assault from the hostile alien ship tends to keep knocking those systems offline however. So you need to balance your time between keeping the ships system's online, fending off the alien threat, and completing your objective.<br/><br/>Each member of your crew has special abilities and skills. You need to work as a group to maximize the potential of each role. If someone tries to be a hero, you'll all die.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a dark and claustrophobic deep sea mining site, the uncovering of a mysterious &ldquo;Sphere&rdquo; is dragging everyone nearby into the endless madness. The fears deep within one&rsquo;s mind are amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing one's body and testing their sanity. Only those with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp. Deep Madness is a fully cooperative board game for 1-6 players with 66 amazingly detailed miniatures, depicting a sci-fi horror world inspired by Lovecraft&rsquo;s work and the Alien series. In the game, players assume the roles of investigators, venturing into the seemingly empty yet perilous deep sea mining site to find out the truth behind the lost contact event. Unimaginable horror and madness from the dark fear within is waiting.<br/><br/>Deep Madness is based on multiple scenarios from a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique board setup, rules, special effects, and goals. From resolving fatal crises to struggling with overwhelming bosses, the investigators will face various quests filled with strategical decisions and fierce combat. With each scenario achieved, they are one step closer to the truth, but also one step deeper into the world of madness. Each scenario of the game plays in a limited number of game rounds, if the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed. Each game round consists of 4 phases: Devour Phase, Spawn Phase, Activation Phase, and Refresh Phase.<br/><br/>In Devour Phase, the Devour Marker progresses one step forward along the Devour Track, indicating the world going deeper into madness. As the Devour Marker progressing, more and more rooms (map tiles) are flipped to their madness side. These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators or to boost the monsters.<br/><br/>In Spawn Phase, different types of monsters with unique abilities are spawned in the flipped rooms. Monsters do not show their existence in fixed locations, they could be spawned right next to the investigators if they ventured carelessly.<br/><br/>Activation Phase is the core of the game, the investigators and the monsters take turns to act alternately. Monsters do not wait for all investigators to finish their turns like in other cooperative games, but do act between them, so careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they had a chance to act.<br/><br/>In Refresh Phase, some maintenances are performed, and some special effects are resolved.<br/><br/>In each investigator&rsquo;s turn, it is crucial that the player chooses 3 actions to take wisely. Each kind of action has its own value, and every single decision could be life and death in Deep Madness. Unfortunately, the correct decision is rarely obvious. Moving, attacking, searching, exchanging items, locking the doors, and recovering sanity are the basic actions. Additionally, each investigator also has his/her own unique and irreplaceable abilities to activate. Different combinations of investigators provide distinctive strategies and game experiences.<br/><br/>Monster acts according to its own action pool during its turn. In Deep Madness monsters are highly characteristic, not just in stats, but also in abilities and behaviors. Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges. And due to the intertwined activation mechanism, even different turn orders of the monsters make each game session different. However, no matter how the monsters setup is, Deep Madness will be a very challenging game, even death could be a strategy.<br/><br/>In the game, investigators battle the horrific monsters, survive the harsh crises, and above all, save their own minds from the devouring of madness. They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate their abilities, to use the effects of items, to reroll the dice, and etc. However they are vulnerable when the sanity is low. After an investigator with insanity tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his/her mind, by permanently flipping the insanity tokens into madness tokens. As the madness token cumulates, horror haunts the investigator by resolving Madness Cards, and each of them has unique negative effect and terrifying flavor text.<br/><br/>",

The ever-changing climate was their first adversary, forcing them to remain constantly on the move. But weather was not their only problem. In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!<br/><br/>In Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos. You guide their migrations to temperate climates, you acquire the perfect genes to develop your Dinos and mutate them, and you push out other creatures that have yet to learn the meaning of the term &quot;dominant species&quot;. At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you've evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of  prehistoric life. Players earn and spend mutation points to adapt their species for survival &ndash; but don't spend all of them as the remainder are counted to determine the winner.<br/><br/>With every round of play a meteor moves one step closer to earth.

Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.<br/><br/>The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.<br/><br/>The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).<br/><br/>Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.<br/><br/>",

In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.<br/><br/>The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.<br/><br/>The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.<br/><br/>Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!<br/><br/>It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.  Do not despair!  Once you have completed your first game you will realize that amongst the apparent chaos of the game there are many opportunities for long-term planning.<br/><br/>Libert&eacute; is #6 in the Valley Games Classic Line<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome, dear Imperialists. It's the year 2415. The interplanetary federation (IPF) has done a great job in the last centuries. All necessary precautions have been taken to conquer this planet named &quot;Steam&quot;. The core of the planet consists of a 6,500&ordm; Celsius hot source containing different resources, including water. It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.<br/><br/>But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.<br/><br/>Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious. However, only through shrewd resource management and clever manipulation of supply and demand can a player reign supreme!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "U-BOOT: The Board Game is a fully cooperative, real-time tabletop game of WW2 submarine warfare, designed by Iron Wolf Studio. It allows 1 to 4 players to assume the roles of the Captain, the First Officer, the Navigator, and the Chief Engineer on board of a type VIIC U-boat. The game is driven by a companion app, allowing for an unprecedented level of realism, as well as a challenging enemy A.I. which will push your skills to the limit. The action unfolds both on the strategic and the tactical scale, always demanding teamwork, efficient crew management, and quick situation assessment.<br/><br/>Each of the four roles entails unique responsibilities, encouraging the players to develop an efficient communication scheme and use genuine navy terminology. The Captain oversees the completion of mission objectives, supervises action point costs, and is responsible for the crew's morale. The First Officer operates the companion app, manages the flow of information, and takes care of the crew's health. The Navigator steers the submarine by setting its course and depth, but also updates all the essential information on the strategic, and the tactical map. Last, but not least, is the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the engines,  repairs, as well as other mechanical implements on board of the U-boat (such as the ballast tanks, weapon systems, etc.). At the same time, each of the four officers commands his own group of crew members by issuing orders within a worker placement system.<br/><br/>The idea behind the companion app is to deliver a real-time, realistic gameplay experience. To that end, the app features the most essential instruments of the u-boat (such as the periscope, the hydrophone, and the Enigma, among others). Rest assured, however, that the vast majority of gameplay traditionally takes place on the game board, with the instruments revealing otherwise hidden information, and the app requiring only certain data (such as the U-boat's course, speed, etc.) in order to generate an adequate A.I. response of the enemy force. It is also responsible for all the ambient sound effects, thus immersing the players even deeper into the claustrophobic interiors of the type VII C. But fear not! With open &amp; play being a design priority, you will be launching torpedoes in no time, thanks to streamlined rules, video tutorials, and variable difficulty levels for each player.<br/><br/>From quick skirmishes, through full combat missions, to an all-out campaign, UBOOT: TBG will let you conduct submarine operations in all major naval theatres of the 2nd World War. Success of these missions hinges on the completion of various tasks delegated to the crew by the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine (German Navy HQ), which include patrol duty, ambushing convoys, laying mines in enemy waters, and many more! Each mission will require the players to adopt various strategies and different play styles in order to successfully complete it, and the companion app will generate a detailed report at the end of each game session (evaluating player efforts, and possibly awarding decorations, promotions, etc.). That is, if the U-boat makes it back home...<br/><br/>The stage is set and the crew is awaiting your orders. Do you have what it takes to command the Kriegsmarine's finest? Hunt or be hunted, as you brave the stormy seas of the greatest conflict in history!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the creator<br/><br/>",

To play, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.<br/><br/>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends., i.e., whether someone has at least 66 points. When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!<br/><br/>6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.<br/><br/>6 nimmt! 25 Jahre includes 28 additional cards to be used in a new variant. The game now lasts only two rounds, and at the start of play each player receives three special cards. Just before you have to place your number card in a row, you can choose to play one of your cards, with these cards opening a fifth row, moving a previously placed card to a different row, inserting one card between two others, allowing up to six cards in a row instead of five, blocking a row, replacing the card you played, and more.<br/><br/>After all number cards have been played, players tally their scores, keeping any unplayed special cards, then shuffle the number cards and begin a new round.

        "description": "CloudAge is a strategy game from Alexander Pfister and Arno Steinwender. The award-winning authors have created a dark and dystopian world for 1 to 4 players.<br/><br/>Fifteen years ago, the mysterious secret society &quot;Cloud&quot; set fire to countless oil production sites and burned down large forests to destabilize the world. The resulting environmental catastrophe had disastrous effects on the entire planet. Now, years later, you travel above the dried-out landscape in your airships, searching for a better life. You visit cities, send out drones to collect resources, and battle Cloud militia.<br/><br/>An innovative sleeving mechanism makes a new, more immersive, form of resource gathering possible. Players try to predict which cloud-covered terrain will contain the desired amount of resources or where additional actions are possible. Resources allow players to develop useful upgrades for their airships or attract new crew members.<br/><br/>CloudAge is a mix of engine-building, deck-building, and resource management. The campaign system makes it easy to start playing quickly, with new elements being introduced into the game as players progress through the chapters. While you play, you also experience and help guide the story. If you prefer, you can also play standalone story spin-offs as single scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; &mdash; the guild of cloth finishers and merchants in foreign cloth &mdash; was one of the greater guilds of Florence, who arrogated to themselves the civic power of the Republic of Florence during the Late Middle Ages. The woolen cloth trade was the engine that drove the city&rsquo;s economy and the members of the Calimala were the elite of Florence.<br/><br/>Throughout its long history, the Arte di Calimala supervised the execution of artistic and architectural works. Most Florentine guilds performed such activities, but the Calimala distinguished itself from other guilds through the number and prestige of the projects and the sites administered, including the construction and decoration of some of the major churches of the city.<br/><br/>Players of Calimala are cloth merchants in medieval Florence, with a number of trusted employees that they assign to various streets within the city to carry out actions. (Each street connects two places where particular actions can be taken.) While taking these actions, players produce and deliver cloth and contribute to the construction and decoration of various buildings across the city. Employees stay on their assigned places for a while, carrying out their actions whenever the street is activated, and eventually are promoted into the city council, triggering a scoring phase.<br/><br/>Depending on the number of players, each player has a number of action discs. In turn order, they can put one on a space between two actions, performing both actions and activating all other discs on the same space. When the fourth disc is placed on an action space, the lowest one is promoted to the city council, which triggers a scoring. After the last action disc is placed or the last scoring phase in the council is triggered, the game ends. The positions of the action spaces and sequence of scoring phases vary from game to game, making each game very different. Secret scoring objectives and action cards add uncertainty.<br/><br/>",

The famous strategy game now in pure dice!<br/><br/>As influential sovereigns, expand your estates through trade and commerce. Combine the dice to your advantage and find the strategy that will lead you to victory.<br/><br/>Like the original game, the goal is to get the most points, mostly by filling spaces on your board to complete as many color regions as you can. The game comes with 5 dice: one timer die, 2 number dice and 2 color dice. The game is played using a &quot;roll and write&quot; mechanic, where one player rolls the dice, and from the results, each player individually picks one color die, representing a type of hex, and one number die, and uses their chosen combinations to fill in a hex on their individual player board.<br/><br/>Each player starts with one castle space already filled in; from there, a hex can only be filled on the board if it is adjacent to an already-filled hex. Each type of hex has its own rules for which numbers can be used to fill it. When completing a region of hexes, you score points and get a reward depending on the type of hex, which can be workers or monks that you can use to manipulate the dice, silver coins that you can spend to take extra actions or goods that you can later ship for even more points. In addition, bonus points are awarded to the first and second players to fill in all hexes on their board of each color.<br/><br/>The timer die sets the pace of the game. When it is rolled, players mark a number of boxes on the time track equal to the number of hourglasses rolled on the timer die (one or two). This progresses the game through three phases of ten time boxes each. When all time boxes are filled, the game is over and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Bribe politicians and cops, invest your money in night clubs, casinos or the waste management industry. To get the big deals, you need to cooperate with the other families &mdash; but never rely on those &quot;friendships&quot;.

Actions are planned secretly, placed face down, then played in turn. Often you need certain business cards to succeed. If you don't own them yourself, you can negotiate deals with the other players. The players bargain, spy, threaten, and deceive each other.<br/><br/>Each of the four rounds brings new action cards into the game, and the number of gangsters increases. Thus, the possibilities for actions become more diverse, the jobs more profitable, and the attacks more powerful. Co-operation gets more attractive and treason alluring because at the end of the day money is the only thing that counts.<br/><br/>",

Using their magic and wisdom, they struggle for control of the islands. They anxiously await the cards handed to them by fate. But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.&quot;<br/><br/>Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.<br/><br/>It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.<br/><br/>The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.<br/><br/>The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>     Arabana-Ikibiti<br/><br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>     Kanaloa<br/><br/><br/>",

The first series of Wings of War games focus on the &quot;knights of the air&quot; age, World War I, portraying the abilities of the fighting planes of this period.<br/><br/>Airplanes are represented by a single card which is used as a playing piece on any open surface; the players choose and play simultaneously movement cards  to decide the actions of the airplane they control. Different planes use different decks of movement cards to represent their different maneuver capabilities, and different deck of &quot;Fire&quot; card are used to take into account their fighting effectiveness and to keep track of damage.<br/><br/>Each Wings of War set is a complete game for 2 to 4 players which may be combined with additional sets, or with other copies of the same set, to play larger games. For that purpose, 23 planes with different colors are included in each box. Each one is depicted after accurate historical documentation.<br/><br/>Wings of War: Famous Aces is the first set of the WWI collection. It includes 5 types of planes: the Spad XIII, Albatros D Va, Sopwith Camel, Fokker Dr1, Sopwith Triplane. Each one was flown by an ace: between them Baracca, von Richtofen, Rickenbacker, Fonck, Olieslagers, Bakers. There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card of the second set, Wings of War: Watch Your Back!, depicting an Austrian two-seater Ufag C.I.<br/><br/>",

Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos in a steampunk setting. The adventurers collect equipment, interact and utilize their environment, fight monsters, and immerse themselves in the rich narrative elements.<br/><br/>The complete story is broken down into different scenarios that represent a self-contained game. All of these scenarios contain chapters, each with its own narration and specifics. The objective of the game is to progress through the tale and face the endgame at the finale of each scenario.<br/><br/>The main goal behind Machina Arcana is to provide players with a chilling game that can never be played the same way, mechanisms that enable varying strategies and approaches, and an extensive framework that combines everything smoothly. The game scales by default; there is no need for special conditions based on the player count. As the story progresses, so does your gear. But beware! If you are too slow, horror might very well prevail and devour you whole...<br/><br/>The 2nd edition has a lot of improvement to the rules; as well as a new manual, new illustrations, new graphic design, and additional content. The 3rd edition includes no rule changes aside from rewordings to make the game more easier to understand, and to help the new players with the learning curve. On the other hand, the 3rd edition is the first one to offer other languages than English: French, German, Polish, and Spanish.<br/><br/>For extensive list of changes check the changelog page:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://machinaarcana.com/changelog.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://machinaarcana.com/changelog.html</a><br/><br/>",

So you have five dice for each of the speeds and two of &quot;gas&quot; to continue moving without changing your speed. Each die is playable exactly once each turn. When you stop your movement, you take a card corresponding to the last speed that you started: the higher your speed, the lower your time.<br/><br/>The track has both straight sections and turns that require a certain speed so that you can pass with different manners (by skidding, sharp turning, ...). You must roll the die because it determines the speed selected, but may show a &quot;!&quot; which will put you in danger. With the third &quot;!&quot; displayed, your car will risk going spinning off the road, resulting in loss of time (1'00&quot; instead of the scheduled time on your card), but sometimes also damage to the vehicle depending on the landscape in which you crash.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, each player adds his times to his total time. The winner is the player who accumulates the least total time.<br/><br/>The ability to take risks to scrape off a few seconds or in the management of your tires adds more to the simulation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Edge of Darkness is the third Card Crafting Game from Alderac Entertainment Group designed by John D. Clair. Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style board game of 60 to 120 minutes for 1 to 4 players.<br/><br/>Players are the heads of powerful guilds in the City. Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the City in a desperate struggle against great evil. But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.<br/><br/>The Guilds exert their control in the city by sending agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions. Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of the City. Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to the City's infrastructure.<br/><br/>To win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends. Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the City such as defending it from external and internal threats.<br/><br/>Here are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:<br/><br/><br/>     Card Crafting: Similar to the original card-crafting game, Mystic Vale, all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on one third (1/3) of the slip and are transparent on the other two thirds (2/3). During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense). However, unlike Mystic Vale, the transparent cards are double-sided, and when you upgrade the &quot;good&quot; side of the cards (front), you also add strength to the &quot;bad&quot; side of the cards (back).<br/>     Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: Rather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to. Different players will have the allegiance of different cards in that deck. Using other players' cards means you have to pay them. During the game you can claim allegiance of more cards in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal.<br/>     Card-driven worker placement: While your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost. Advancements don't have a cost, instead they require the use of workers to a greater or lesser degree depending on the power of the card. e.g. many effects require placing or pulling workers from different city locations as dictated by the card effects. Since you have a limited number of workers to use, you will constantly be choosing to forgo one useful thing in order to do another.<br/>     Threat Tower:  There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and whom Threats will attack. Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Threat Board, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn. These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes of a given color accumulate on a card, it attacks the City. If the color matches one of the players, it attacks that player. If the color is black, it attacks all players!<br/>     Modular set up: Edge of Darkness will come with 12 Locations. Each game you use only 10 of these Locations, which can be specifically selected or chosen randomly, making for a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you will need to employ. These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Crafting Slips. Location Boards may specify special rules for worker placement, or extend the basic rules with all new systems.

Over the course of the game, players collect cards in order to then claim routes on the game board between two cities. Ideally the players create a network of routes that connect the cities showing on their secret ticket cards. Players score points both for claiming routes and for completing tickets, with incomplete tickets counting against a player's score.<br/><br/>In addition to scoring points for tickets, whenever a player places a route on the board, they claim a passenger from the two cities that form the endpoints for that route (assuming that the passengers have not already been claimed). At the end of the game, whoever has the most passengers of each of the six colors scores 20 points for that color; whoever has the secondmost passengers in a color scores 10 points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride: Germany combines most of Zug um Zug: Deutschland and the Deutschland 1902 expansion in one box. Zug um Zug: Deutschland, published solely for the German and Austrian market, consisted of the same map as Ticket to Ride: M&auml;rklin, but ZuZ:D didn't include the passenger mechanism from M&auml;rklin in which players scored additional points by moving passengers from city to city. The Deutschland 1902 expansion introduced a different method of scoring passengers, and that method is now present in this collection.<br/><br/>",

To prove you are the one true inventor of time travel, you must use your invention to find your enemy in time and murder them &mdash; before they get you!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since your enemy has strewn many copies of themself across the timeline, you may have to do the terrible deed many, many times before it sticks. Just make sure you don't get erased first!<br/><br/>That Time You Killed Me is an abstract narrative game of time and murder that introduces new scenarios with unique rules and components as you play. As with any game about mucking about across time, you must play through this content in a strict, unalterable order.<br/><br/>To set up, place three game boards in a row to represent past, present, and future. Each player starts with a player piece in the same location on each 4x4 board, with the start player having their focus token in the past while the other has it in the future.<br/><br/>On a turn, choose a single copy of yourself on the board where your focus token is located, then take two actions with this copy, with actions being movement to an adjacent orthogonal space, time travel forward to the next board (travel from the past to the future is not allowed), or time travel back to the previous board, leaving a copy of yourself in the current location when you do. Sure, you traveled to the past, but if you stick around long enough, you'll be right back where you started, so now you're there, too! At the end of your turn, move your focus token to a different board.<br/><br/>Under the basic rules, you murder a copy of your opponent by pushing them into the wall of the game board. You have a limited number of copies of yourself in reserve, and murdered copies don't return to your reserve because that would be gross. If you run out of copies, you can no longer travel to the past since you can't leave a copy of yourself behind.<br/><br/>If on your turn, your opponent has copies of themselves on only one board, you win!<br/><br/>Play through four chapters of escalating difficulty, adding more wild time-travel shenanigans and unlocking more content as you master the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Long ago, your ancestors built great cities across the world. Now your tribe must explore forests, deserts, islands, mountains, and caverns to find these lost cities. Claim the ruins, build places of power, and restore the glory of a bygone age.<br/><br/>Unearth is a bend-your-luck game of dice placement and set collection. Designed by Jason Harner and Matthew Ransom, it plays in under an hour with 2-4 players. Each player leads a tribe of Delvers, represented by five dice (3 six-sided, 1 four-sided, and 1 eight-sided). Players take turns rolling and placing dice in an attempt to claim Ruins.<br/><br/>The game's elegant core mechanic is accessible to players of all skill levels. High rolls help players claim Ruins, while low rolls help players collect Stones. This opens two paths to victory: claiming sets of Ruins or using Stones to build Wonders. Delver cards help you affect your dice rolls or dice in play, and Wonders can grant abilities that impact the late game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Settling the Final Frontier<br/><br/>Since 1966, millions of Star Trek fans all over the world have watched adventures of the Starship Enterprise, Captain Kirk, and Mr. Spock. And since 1995, millions of enthusiastic players all over the world have played Klaus Teuber's CATAN - a board game classic.<br/>It's time to bring them all together on the Final Frontier!<br/><br/>In Star Trek: Catan, players start the game with two small Outposts at the intersection of three planets, with each planet supplying resources based on the result of a dice roll. Players collect and trade these resources &ndash; dilithium, tritanium, food, oxygen and water &ndash; in order to build Starships that connect regions in the galaxy, establish more Outposts and Starbases (upgraded Outposts) at new intersection points in order to increase resource acquisition, and acquire Development Cards that provide Victory Points (VPs) or special abilities.<br/><br/>On a dice roll of 7, a Klingon ship swoops in to prevent resource production on one planet while taxing spacegoers who hold too many resources.<br/><br/>Star Trek: Catan differs from the basic Settlers in one aspect: a set of Support Cards formerly available only in German as Catan Scenarios: Helpers of Catan. Each Support Card features a special ability and one of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, or Sarek. Some special abilities make basic actions better, such as reducing the costs of Starbase upgrades or allowing the player to trade a resource of their choice at 2:1 for a turn, while others break rules, such as protecting the player from discarding on a 7 or producing a resource when the player rolls a number that wouldn't otherwise produce for them. Players get a specific Support Card during setup based on turn order, with later players getting generally more useful abilities to compensate for early player advantage. When a player uses a Support Card ability for the first time, they may trade it in for a Support Card of their choice or keep it for a second use, but they may only trade immediately after use.<br/><br/>",

One player controls the Overseer, controlling the monsters of the catacombs; the other player(s) control the four heroes who cooperatively try to defeat the monsters and eventually the Catacomb Lord. Each of the heroes has special abilities that must also be used effectively if they are to prevail.<br/><br/>The main mechanism of Catacombs is for the players to flick wooden discs representing the monsters and the heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game; conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated. The game is designed for quick set-up and fast play within 30 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>",

This continuation of the world's first Unique Deck Game contains 204 new cards seamlessly integrated into a card pool that contains a total of 370 different cards, creating an entirely new collection of Archon Decks for you to discover, explore, and master!<br/><br/>The KeyForge: Age of Ascension two-player starter provides you with all the tools you need to either begin or expand your adventures on the Crucible, featuring two unique Age of Ascension Archon Decks, a Quickstart Rulebook, two Poster Playmats, and all the keys, tokens, and chain trackers you and your chosen opponent need to start playing!<br/><br/>In more detail, KeyForge is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &quot;Sanctum&quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.<br/><br/>Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival's forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.<br/><br/>Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six &AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warsaw is a unique city. It is said that it &quot;survived its own death&quot;, and there is truth in this. Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.<br/><br/>In Warsaw: City of Ruins, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.<br/>     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.<br/><br/><br/>Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3&times;4 or 4&times;3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.<br/><br/>During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arrakis is a desert world seemingly dead and barren, yet here lies the most important resource in the galaxy: Spice. Without Spice, space travel is impossible, and humans become little clusters on isolated planets. The noble House that controls Arrakis and the production of Spice wields great power. The Emperor gave Arrakis to House Atreides, but then he conspired to replace them with their old rivals, House Harkonnen. Baron Harkonnen crushed the Atreides in a treasonous attack, and now rules the planet with an iron fist. But Paul and Jessica, heirs to House Atreides, are alive, and are mounting a rebellion with the aid of the formidable Fremen, the mysterious inhabitants of the barren expanses of Arrakis.<br/><br/>Only one House will emerge victorious from the coming struggle, while the other will be lost in the desert sands. It's into this grim reality that players will be thrust in Dune: War for Arrakis.<br/><br/>In this asymmetrical strategy game, players fight for control of the planet, maneuvering troops like the Fremen, the Fedaykin, and the fearsome Sardaukar, while sending Spice harvesters into the deep desert, daring to challenge the great Sandworms. The game features an action dice system with numerous event cards that will enable players to retell the Dune saga differently with each playthrough.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.<br/><br/>The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.<br/><br/>The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

Whether it&rsquo;s the Abbot, the Tailor or any of the six playable characters, each prisoner is represented by a character card and a custom character die showing that prisoner&rsquo;s unique endowment of Might, Cunning and Wisdom &ndash; the game&rsquo;s three traits.<br/><br/>Embarking on a desperate quest to escape, the players must work together using custom dice and item cards to overcome the castle&rsquo;s many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, illustrated chapter card. At the beginning of each game, 15 of these chapter cards are drawn at random from a larger deck to create a unique castle every time.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves one player revealing a new chapter card each turn, in a motion like turning a page of a book. When a card is turned, the next chamber or passageway into which the prisoners have stumbled is revealed. There is no turn order. Instead, players decide as a group who will turn the next chapter card, and there are often grisly consequences for the one that does!<br/><br/>Once revealed, the chapter card will explain the situation facing the group and what must be done to get through it. In the style of choose-your-path adventures, most chapters offer the group a choice about how to proceed. Bribe the drunken guards or attack them? Charge the beast or lure it out? Steal from the kitchen stores or keep moving?<br/><br/>Each chapter is a mini-game and a variety of mechanics are required to complete it, from RPG-style skill tests for an individual character, to push-your-luck dice rolling as a team, to the playing of item cards collected along the way to bolster the tactical abilities of the group.<br/> <br/>When the players choose to enter (or fail to avoid) combat, all players roll their unique character dice simultaneously to make an attack against the enemy. They need to collectively muster the right combination of Might, Cunning and Wisdom to defeat the foe in question, or risk taking damage. Blocking, Resting, and the use of Weapons, Relics and Potions will help to keep the prisoners alive.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is for the group to complete every chapter in the castle deck, then defeat the final boss. To win, they must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>",

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.<br/><br/>Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.<br/><br/>If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.<br/><br/>The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1958, Demitri Belyaev and Lyudmila Trut started an experiment on domestication. From a large group of foxes, they selected the ones that reacted to humans with more curiosity and less aggression. In each generation, they selected only the friendliest pups to become parents &mdash; hoping to recreate the process that originally led to domestication thousands of years ago. The experiment made stunning progress. Even though the foxes were chosen only for their friendliness, they soon started to get many of the physical traits that we associate with domesticated animals &mdash; like spots, floppy ears, and curly tails. As communication opened up, the foxes made major contributions to our understanding of how these traits are expressed. The experiment continues to this day.<br/><br/>In The Fox Experiment, you&rsquo;ll breed your own domesticated foxes. In each round you'll select a pair of fox parents who have certain traits. You'll gain those specific trait dice, roll them, then try to move them around to make complete trait symbols which you'll then mark off on your pup card. You'll then gain trait tokens depending on how many traits you marked off which you'll use to upgrade tracks on your personal player board.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the previous generation of foxes will be cleared and all of the new pups will be moved to the kennel &mdash; thus becoming candidates to be chosen as parents in the next round. The game ends after 5 rounds and you'll gain points for pleasing patrons (end of game scoring bonuses), studies completed (personal player objectives), if you ever won the friendliest fox award, upgrades on your personal player board, and extra tokens. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

We want to live in the present, and the only history that is worth a tinker's **** is the history we make today.&quot; The famous founder is standing in front of his team giving a motivational speech. &quot;You all know our first customer was a lunatic, and the second had a death wish. So they bought our brakeless bangers. So there were a few accidents. But the only mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. This year, customers demand safety. Of course, active safety features include rapid acceleration for safe overtaking! I know it will be hard to add the new motorblock section to the factory, but before you say you cannot do something, try it! To every engineer, every planner, every mechanic, and every salesperson in this great company I say: If I can dream it, you can do it!&quot;<br/><br/>Horseless Carriage is a game about the dawn of the automobile, a time when cars were invented, and no one quite knew yet what this new contraption would look like and what features would be essential. Early cars sometimes used levers or pedals to steer and a wheel to accelerate. Brakes were not always seen as essential, but sometimes an outside spot to take along an onboard mechanic was. This early, super innovative period occurs in the development of many new product categories. Players are cast as aspiring industrialists trying to find out what features the public will value when buying these new, expensive, and utterly unfamiliar horseless carriages.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is fully cooperative, so the Villain and Environment aren&rsquo;t run by a dedicated player, but rather are controlled by turning over cards from their decks and following the instructions on those cards.<br/><br/>Each Hero, Villain, and Environment are represented by a deck of cards. Heroes and Villains also have character cards, which provide their Hit Points and other information specific to that character.<br/><br/>The game starts with the Villain turn, then each of the Heroes in turn order clockwise around the table. The round ends with the Environment turn. After the Environment turn, repeat the round, starting with the Villain turn!

Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.<br/><br/>Players choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously. The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you. The second highest takes the other card likewise. Remaining cards are discounted. Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over! (The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers). At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).<br/><br/>There is a further twist! Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise. So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor! Are you smarter? Can you make a better fist of the same hand your neighbor had? Play out rounds until all players have had each hand. Top score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Europa, Jupiter's moon. Deep beneath the crust, the oceans are teeming with alien sea life. Shellfish, plants, corals, arthropods, even strange fish and larger sea creatures populate a wide-ranging interconnected web of hidden seas. Volcanism is rampant, warming the mineral-rich waters and creating excellent conditions for energy-harvesting.<br/><br/>The largest cavern close to the surface is known as The Pocket. This is where the initial teams of Stabilizers built their first outposts, with the intent to establish long-term communities capable of surviving indefinitely. Aqua-farming is well established; food and other sundries are efficiently gathered. The Pocket has many deposits of minerals and crystals that can be mined and processed to create strong and versatile construction materials locally.<br/><br/>Colonists arrive at the Doorstep at regular intervals when the Threshold is opened. The arrivals are of four general types: Pioneers (who are tasked with exploring the changing surface of the moon and the labyrinth of seas beneath), Engineers (who develop and operate the machinery and structures needed to run the colonies), Marines (who defend the colonies from hostile sea life, unwanted intruders, and other colonies), and Stewards (overseers responsible for strategy and negotiation).<br/><br/>Colony development mostly occurs beneath the ice; this is where all of the moon&rsquo;s resources are concentrated, so this is where the effort is best spent. To keep close to the surface, most colony structures are built clinging onto the underside of the ice crust. Surface structures will be built only once an undersea outpost is well established and beginning to thrive. In addition to construction and resource-gathering, colonies spend a lot of effort on exploring this new environment. The volcanic action and mineral-heavy waters make long-range scanning unreliable, so physical exploration is required to plumb the depths.<br/><br/>As the Pocket is explored and expanded, the established colonies have been making some unusual discoveries beneath the ice. Deep in the trenches, artifacts of non-human origin are starting to be found. The dark seas hide many secrets. Squads of mercenaries occasionally appear on the surface and beneath the sea, penetrating the Threshold somehow to carry out an unknown mission on the moon. These aspects are worrisome but can&rsquo;t distract the colonies from their main goals.<br/><br/>It is still early in the Artemis project. A foothold on life here has been gained, but it will take tenacious effort from the competing colonies to reach the point where Europa is truly viable as a home.<br/><br/>The Artemis Project is a dice (dis)placement and engine building game that has you fighting the planet as well as the other players. Roll your dice and place them tactically to thwart the other colonists. Harvest energy and minerals. Bid for buildings. Work together to go on Expeditions to earn rewards. Train workers. Will your efforts be enough to survive?<br/><br/>",

The game also includes items you can equip to your heroes, 1V1 challenge cards, and roll modifiers to tip the odds in your favor.<br/><br/>The first person to successfully slay three monsters, or build a full party with six classes, wins the game!<br/><br/>Every player gets to choose a party leader character to represent them throughout the game. Each party leader card has a class and a skill that gives you an edge over your opponents. Whether you enjoy fighters, bards, wizards, or thieves, you'll find a party leader that's right for your play style - but choose wisely, because you only get one party leader for the whole game!<br/><br/>Your heroes are brave adventurers, ready to attack monsters and go head to head with your foes! The game includes over 40 unique heroes. Each hero card has a class and an effect, and each hero&rsquo;s effect has a roll requirement. In order to use a hero&rsquo;s effect, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that effect&rsquo;s roll requirement. Heroes take advantage of items, magic and modifiers to increase their chances of making their dice rolls.<br/>In order to slay that monster, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that monster&rsquo;s roll requirement.&nbsp; Be warned: Each monster has a roll range in which they&rsquo;ll fight back, and if you score within that range, your party might be in grave danger&hellip;<br/><br/>Don't like what your opponent just played? Throw down a challenge! Challenge cards can be played instantly to try to stop another player from playing a hero, item, or magic card. Playing a challenge card initiates a 1V1 challenge in which you and another player both have to roll the dice. If they win the challenge, they still get to play their card, but if you win the challenge, you get to send their card directly to the discard pile!<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You set off on a treasure hunt, racing to find them before your rival, but your progress is slowed by a constantly shifting maze of paths... And eternal damnation awaits anyone foolish enough to uncover the three cursed relics of Garuda!<br/><br/>MOVE QUICKLY... CHOOSE WISELY! A treasure race packed with tough choices, twists &amp; turns!<br/><br/>In this 2-players game, each player moves around their own temple, which has spaces for room tiles and hiding places for 9 sacred and cursed relics around. These relics are placed randomly, face-down, around the temples and worth victory points once flipped face-up.<br/><br/>The first player to score 25 victory points wins the game. However, a player loses if they reveal all three cursed relics! Each round, the players compete to win a new room tile by using cards allowing them to throw fate sticks. The player with the most fate points showing on their sticks wins the room tile and places it in their temple. Each player attempts to create paths leading to their relics, enabling them to flip them face up and score victory points. Yet, Naga symbols on some sticks let you activate cards with powerful effects, so that you can never take anything for granted.<br/><br/>A GAMEPLAY WITH DUAL-USE CARDS AND STICKS<br/><br/>Players must decide how to use the cards in their hands: for throwing sticks or activating their effects? Card effects can be applied on you or opponent's game and are relating to:<br/><br/>     Sticks results<br/>     Relic positions<br/>     Room positions<br/>     Card drawing<br/><br/><br/>Results on Fate sticks can be used to win the room at stake (using their Fate points) or to activate cards (using their Naga symbols). There are 3 types of sticks (number of Fate points or Naga faces are different for each type).<br/><br/>DILEMMAS, TWISTS, LOW BLOWS!<br/><br/>No temple room or Relic is locked in place, they can be moved/removed as you or your opponent activate cards&hellip; You could turn everything upside-down! For example:<br/><br/>     Make the maze slide<br/>     Swap the positions of relics<br/>     Place a Trap room in your opponent&rsquo;s Temple<br/>     Change the results of the sticks<br/>     Discard action cards from your opponent's hand<br/>     Make him throw again his sticks&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>IF YOU...<br/><br/><br/>     Have ever dreamed of being an Indiana Jones, chasing relics in an Indian modular temple...<br/>     Adore putting a spoke in the wheels of your opponent...<br/>     Love gameplays balanced between strategy (cruel choices, anticipation) and fun...<br/><br/><br/>then Naga Raja is the perfect game for you!<br/><br/>",

A worthy adversary, Thanos plays with a two-card hand, drawing from his own deck of minions and powerful Infinity Stones. The heroes will have to use their abilities in strategic combinations to knock his health down to zero before he can do the same to them&mdash;or find all six Infinity Stones and win with a snap of his fingers.

        "description": "Keyper is a game with high player interaction for two to four players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples. Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc. The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.<br/><br/>Keyper is a worker placement game. (Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.) What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players. In this way, some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others. All keyples have the potential to work twice. If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn, the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions. It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term.<br/><br/>The country boards are also noteworthy, in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn, and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season. A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice. Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer, after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village. Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.<br/><br/>A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons. Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs. Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season. The winner is the player to gain the most points, usually through pursuing at least a couple of the different strategies.<br/><br/>In addition to the theme and mechanisms, Keyper has similar traits to the earlier Key games: Game actions are positive and constructive, not destructive; player interaction is through the game mechanisms not direct, and like Keyflower, the previous game in the series, there is a lot of player interaction.<br/><br/>A special English-language Kickstarter edition of Keyper with &quot;character&quot; keyples and keypers will also be released.<br/><br/>",

Founded in the times of Caesar Augustus and built up by generations of Roman architects, this was the Emperor's residence and a world city during this period. The remains of these most impressive structures can still be visited today. Foremost of these great achievements in the city is the massive &quot;Porta Nigra&quot;, a large Roman city gate located in Trier, Germany that dates to the 2nd century.<br/><br/>The game Porta Nigra (which translates as &quot;black gate&quot;) is set in that place and time with the players taking on the roles of Roman architects working on the city gate of Porta Nigra. Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located. Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully. The number and type of actions that may be performed on your turn comes from cards in your personal draw deck.<br/><br/>Buildings are erected physically at the various locations around the city using 3D building pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Built by the Romans during the first century in Belgian Gaul, Tournay experienced most of its growth along the Scheldt river. Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!<br/><br/>Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.<br/><br/>In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!<br/><br/>Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/><br/>     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. <br/>     Then take one action:<br/>         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.<br/>         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.<br/>         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.<br/>         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated. Most VP wins!<br/><br/>",

For example:<br/>- If you could have a &quot;BIG&quot; anything, what would it be?<br/>- What's the most important invention of the last century?<br/>- Which website would be hardest to live without?<br/>- What's the best activity for a first date?<br/>- What's the worst thing to say to a cop after getting pulled over?<br/><br/>2) Everyone else writes an answer and throws it face-up on the table as fast as possible.  No duplicate answers are allowed!<br/><br/>3) Secretly choose your favorite response using a genuine state of the art SELECT-O-MATIC 5000: \t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/><br/>4) Everyone else has two betting tokens to bet on which answer you chose.  They can bet both tokens on one answer or split them between two different answers.<br/><br/>Who Will Like This Game?<br/>Say Anything is a pure party game.  It was designed to get a party started as quickly as possible by prompting people to talk about interesting things and to make ridiculous statements.  If you are looking for great social interaction and lots of laughs, then you will probably enjoy playing Say Anything.<br/><br/>History<br/>Say Anything was designed by Dominic Crapuchettes &amp; Satish Pillalamarri.  It was first work-shopped by game designers at Protospiel 2004 and refined at Protospiel 2005, PowWow 2005, the GoF 2005 - 2007, and weekly game nights at the Looney Labs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting resources; building meadows; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two meeples that can each take an action per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more: each round a (fixed) additional option becomes available. Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.<br/><br/>In comparison with the family game of the predecessor, much has changed: the new action each round is fixed, and the game has been simplified by removing stone and vegetables. Similar to 'Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small', there are now buildings (replacing the major improvements) that score points for leftover resources at the end of the game. <br/>Also, there are no building restrictions (nor player boards). And finally, there are no negative points or point limits anymore, each player simply scores for all he has achieved.<br/><br/>",

You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.<br/><br/>The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take actions in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom; on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).<br/><br/>For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.<br/><br/>For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn't in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.<br/><br/>After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.<br/><br/>To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.<br/><br/><br/>     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.<br/>     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. <br/><br/><br/>There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.<br/><br/><br/>From the Keltis entry:<br/><br/>Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.<br/><br/>The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.<br/><br/>The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:<br/><br/><br/>     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).<br/>     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).<br/>     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.<br/>     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)<br/>     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.<br/>     All this is added to the points scored during the game<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>ASL Starter Kit #2 is a self-contained module which will let players start playing Advanced Squad Leader almost immediately. A liberally-illustrated rulebook teaches gamers ASL using a conversational style to teach the concepts of ASL. If you own and play ASL Starter Kit #1 you will be pleasantly surprised to find how easy it is to spot the new rules ASLSK#2 adds - we've highlighted the new rules so that you can skip rereading what you've learned in ASLSK#1 and get right to the new rules!<br/><br/>What does ASLSK#2 add? GUNS! Artillery pieces. Anti-tank guns. The famous and deadly German &quot;88&quot;. Mortars and bazookas! ASLSK#2 adds the &quot;to hit&quot; procedure to the foundation you learned in ASLSK#1. And if you didn't get ASLSK#1? There are two &quot;infantry only&quot; scenarios to get you up to speed!<br/><br/>This answers the inevitable question we get with the Starter Kit concept. Do I need ASLSK#2 if I have ASLSK#1? The Starter Kits are self contained. Each has everything you need to play what's in the box, with the higher numbers adding to the ASL knowledge you'll have from playing previous Starter Kits. We do not anticipate changing what you've learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#2 adds about 4 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1). A better question would be &quot;Do I need ASLSK#1 if I buy ASLSK#2?&quot;. The short answer is a resounding no! You can dive right in with ASLSK#2. But if you do, and you like the game, ASLSK#1 adds more boards and scenarios (infantry only) for you to enjoy. We know it's a little confusing, we hope this clears it up a bit.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>        2 8x22 Geomorphic Maps (w and x) for the ASL System<br/>        1 full Countersheet of 1/2&quot; counters<br/>        1 half Countersheet of 5/8&quot; counters<br/>        8 scenarios printed on 4 individual cardstock sheets<br/>        2 quick reference charts printed on cardstock sheet<br/>        1 20-page rules booklet (about 17 pages are rules) with plentiful color illustrations<br/>        2 dice<br/><br/><br/>Scenario List:<br/><br/>        S9 Ambitious Assault Avola, Sicily, 10 July 1943<br/>        S10 Paper Army Sarandoporo River Valley, Greece, 3 Nov 1940<br/>        S11 A Long Way to Go Biscari Station, Sicily, 10 July 1943<br/>        S12 Over Open Sights Skyline Drive, Luxembourg, 17 December 1944<br/>        S13 Priority Target Korinthos, Greece, 26 April 1941<br/>        S14 88s at Zon Zon, Holland, 17 September 1944<br/>        S15 Hammer to the Teeth Bleialf, Germany, 16 December 1944<br/>        S16 Legio Patria Nostra Radicofani, Italy, 18 June 1944<br/><br/><br/>Time Scale:    2 minutes per Game Turn<br/>Unit Scale:    5 to 10 men, plus individual leaders, vehicles, guns<br/>Map Scale:    40 meters per hex<br/>Players:    2 (also suitable for solitaire or team play)<br/>Complexity:    Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability:    Medium<br/><br/><br/><br/>(user's description:)The second in the three-part series of starter kits for ASL.  The goal of the ASL Starter Kits is to introduce the rules of the massive World War Two wargame in more manageable pieces.  While the first starter kit focused on small infantry-only skirmishes, the second is based around confrontations involving infantry and the use of battlefield ordnance.  The Germans and Americans return, this time accompanied by the British and Italians.<br/><br/>The box is a complete game, including rules (complete with updated rules from Advanced Squad Leader: Starter Kit #1), 1 full and 1 half counter sheet, two new geomorphic boards (w and x) and 8 new scenarios, (S9 through S16).<br/><br/>The Starter Kit series is continued (and completed) with ASL Starter Kit #3, which introduces Armored Fighting Vehicles.<br/><br/>",

Perhaps you even saw a fireball engulf a fellow traveler in a hellscape of horror that makes you afraid to close your eyes at night. Whatever the case, welcome back! Turns out that Vul-Kar didn't like having his gem stolen way back when, so there has been some volcanic upheaval, an explosion in our snake population, feral tigers, new types of trees bent on ending human life, and swarms of bees everywhere. But don't worry &mdash; we have top people working on it.<br/><br/>Start your day of adventure at the helipad.

This new version boasts an island that is even bigger than the original (and yet fits in a smaller box) and more marbles. It is a family-weight game for 2-4 players (5 with an expansion) that plays in 30-45 minutes. Simple card play replaces the random roll-and-move of the original, and the set collection for the treasures offers some interesting choices for players.<br/><br/>Remember, you don't have to outrun the fireball &mdash; just the other players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>Bienvenue sur l'&Icirc;le Infernale !

        "description": "Murano the game is set in Murano, a small group of seven islands near Venice that's well-known by tourists for its glassmaking. As in Venice, the islands of Murano are separated by canals, so gondolas and transportation are at the heart of this game.<br/><br/>The game board depicts the islands of Murano, with the islands being divided up into building sites and walkways. Surrounding the islands is a series of action spaces, with gondolas being present in some number of them at the start of play. On a turn, you move one of the gondolas in the direction of play to an empty space, then take the action shown there. You can't pass another gondola while moving or land in an occupied space, but for a coin you can move a gondola that's in front of the gondola you want to move, and you can pay to move multiple gondolas, if needed.<br/><br/>Some actions place shops on the islands, with shops coming in different types. You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer. You also need to take actions to move your personal gondolas to islands so that you can take actions there.<br/><br/>Why are you doing all of this activity? To score victory point cards in hand, and actions on the board will let you gain additional VP cards to give you direction to your actions or let you profit from what you've already done.<br/><br/>You can also use some of the buildings to create glassworks, and those glassworks come into play on the VP cards, through tourist sales, and via an action space shown at the bottom of the game board image that lets you sell different types of glass for money.<br/><br/>The Complete Edition from 2020 contains Murano: Promo Cards and Murano: The Christmas Tree packaged inside the box and may be found here: Murano: Complete Edition.<br/><br/>",

These spaces allow players to acquire tower pieces, get money, build a portion of their towers, etc.  Once a card has been played in one of the action spaces on the board, all subsequent cards played in that area have to follow the original card&rsquo;s color.  Turns continue around the table until all players are out of cards for that round.<br/>     <br/>Scoring happens at the end of each round based on the number of towers a player has and the ornamentation present on those towers.  After the scoring at the end of round 4, a final scoring occurs and bonus prestige points are given to the players with the largest towers of each color, the most towers, and the largest tower overall. The player with the most prestige points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players then each place three cities on the game board, with a knight in each city. They then take turns in clockwise order, with each player taking exactly one action from the six possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Recruitment: Add two knights to a city, or three knights if the city is adjacent to a lake.<br/>    Movement: Move one or two of your knights one space each. A knight can't enter a lake (blub), a mountain with an opposing pawn, or any space with an opponent's city or stronghold or two knights of the same opposing color. If you move a second knight into a space with an opposing pawn or village, remove those tokens and take one resource from the village owner.<br/>    Construction: Remove one or more of your knights from the game board and replace each with a village or stronghold, gaining one resource token matching the landscape under the structure.<br/>    New City: Replace one of your villages with a city and earn 10 victory points (VPs).<br/>    Expedition: Remove two knights from your reserve, placing one back in the box out of play and the other on any empty space on the edge of the game board.<br/>    Noble Title: Discard at least 15 resource points, then upgrade your title: baron to viscount, then count, marquis, and finally duke.<br/><br/><br/>Once any player has gained the title of duke, finish the round, then tally the VPs, with players scoring for resources still in their possession, their rank in the game, and the number of cities they built.

        "description": "Renature is a majority game with dominoes for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Each player gets a board with large pieces of wood in the form of turf, bushes, pines and oaks. These plants are used for the majorities on the large valley board and are available in a neutral color and in the respective player color. In addition, each player gets a stack of dominoes with two out of ten animal motifs on each of them.<br/><br/>On your turn, place one of the three dominoes in your hand on two brook spaces of the valley board. Of course, the domino must be adjacent to another domino that shows the same animal. If the placed domino borders a free space of a brown area, you can decide whether a tuft of grass or any other of your plants should be placed on that space. Tufts of turf have a value of 1, bushes of 2, pines of 3 and oaks of 4. After placing the plant, you score points for it and every plant piece that is already in this brown area and has the same or a lower value.<br/><br/>Once a brown area is framed with dominoes, the majority is scored and the player with the highest total plant value in the area gets the points that are printed as a large number on that area's flower token. Whoever has the second highest value gets the lower number. Two things make this especially tricky: The neutral pieces count as their own color and not among the majority of the player who has used them. Also, if colors are tied, they a treated as though they are not present at all in the area. After the area has been scored, the player who framed the area receives its flower token, which will give them extra points at game end.<br/><br/>In the course of the game, you may run out of plants, but these can be bought back from the game board with clouds. Clouds can also be used to buy another turn and to appoint a new joker animal. This animal then counts as all animals and makes it easier to put on. At the end of a player's turn, a domino is drawn and it is the next player's turn.<br/><br/>Once all players have run out of dominoes, the game ends with a final scoring.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Mega Civilization, a huge version of the legendary development game Civilization, is a game of skill for 5 to 18 players covering the historical development of ancient civilizations from just after the last Ice Age to the dawn of the new era at the end of the Iron Age &mdash; a time span of almost 8,000 years. Each player leads their own civilization as it tries to expand its culture over a map board that stretches from the Mediterranean Sea to India.<br/> Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Mega Civilization is not a wargame as you might expect when looking at the map board. Instead, the objective of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, scientific, political, civic, and religious factors. The player who most effectively balances these various goals will achieve the best scores and win.<br/><br/>In more detail, the objective of Mega Civilization is to acquire the highest number of victory points (VPs) by building cities and developing Civilization Advances. This will be done over various phases and turns, some of which will be performed simultaneously by the players. After each turn, a check is made for each player to move forward on the Archaeological Succession Table (A.S.T.). Each step on this timeline represents a certain period of time in history reaching from the Stone Age. Advancement there will provide even more VPs. The winner will not necessarily be the first player to reach the end of the A.S.T. or the player with the highest number of cities or Civilization Advances, although these are the key factors in determining the winner.<br/><br/>Each civilization begins with a single population token, and every turn each player increases their population by adding tokens to each area they occupy. These tokens can be moved over the map board by land or (using ships) by sea. As each area has a population limit, a good strategic overview will give players advantage in occupying more and more areas. If a player manages to move sufficient tokens into an area, they can build a city there. These cities generate trade cards which will eventually lead to wealth. During trade sessions, players receive not only the commodities they need to complete sets; they might also receive calamities which will remove population or cities. Specific Civilization Advances will protect the players from natural or civic calamities. The development of these Civilization Advances is symbolized by turning in sets of trading goods, as the wealthier civilizations will acquire more Civilization Advances.<br/><br/>As civilizations develop, it will be harder for their rulers to find the right balance between future population growth, maintaining enough support for their cities, and increasing their treasury. If they cannot manage their token population, their cities might eventually revolt during the tax collection phase. The civilizations with the strongest economy traditionally score the highest.<br/><br/>A game of Mega Civilization can take 10-12 hours to complete. Players can also choose to play the beginner scenario &mdash; &quot;The First Game&quot; &mdash; which takes only 1-2 hours. Another scenario &mdash; &quot;The Short Game&quot; &mdash; provides the same excitement as the full game, although the game starts in a later age; by doing this, games can be played in &quot;only&quot; 6-8 hours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.<br/><br/>Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.<br/><br/>The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.<br/><br/>It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).<br/><br/>The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players are stock brokers during the second Industrial Revolution, trying to make as much money as possible while also coming across as good citizens by donating money to charity.  During the course of the game, players purchase or sell shares of stock, and then manipulate the stock prices with the cards that they share with their two neighbors.  Additionally, players donate stock to charities, which is sold off at the end of the round for the charitable donation.  Whoever donates the least to charity by the end of the game automatically lose, no matter how wealthy he&rsquo;s made himself.<br/><br/>The game uses a system of shared information where each player knows a little of what is about to happen in the markets, with each player knowing different pieces of information.  The player who makes the most money at the end of the game is the winner, provided that he or she is not the person who donated the least to charity.<br/><br/>",

Their goal: to craft the map with the greatest Power and become the ultimate Overboss!<br/><br/>Designed by Aaron Mesburne and Kevin Russ (Calico), this fast-paced game combines drafting, set collection, and puzzly tile laying. It's set in the retro-inspired pixel art world of Brotherwise Games' best-selling Boss Monster, but this is an entirely new experience.<br/><br/>Build your map by drafting Forests, Swamps, Caves, Camps, Graveyards, Dungeon Entrances and other landscapes. Each terrain type has a different point value, and some increase in Power as you acquire larger sets. Players must balance optimal placement, set values, and disrupt their opponents' sets. You'll also need to manage monsters, which award points when grouped together or placed on matching terrain.<br/><br/>The game includes everything needed for up to 5 players: over 120 terrain tiles, over 100 monster tokens, 5 double-sided player boards, a scorepad, and more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (updated for added content)<br/><br/>",

With you having no idea which words are &quot;traps&quot;, it&rsquo;s like dancing on a minefield, when you&rsquo;re trying to describe your assigned word to the rest of the team.<br/><br/>You take the role of a group of adventurers crawling through a fantasy dungeon full of traps and curses, with a Boss waiting for you at the end.<br/>You have to successfully guess a word that one of your teammates is trying to describe to you. Sounds simple, but it is made fiendishly difficult by not knowing which words you can't say. Because both teams are simultaneously preparing secret traps for each other, words that you can't use. And further you get, the more trapwords you might expect.<br/><br/>Let's see the example of one possible turn when you are trying to give clues for the word &quot;Axe&quot;:<br/><br/>You: &quot;It is a thing that a dwarf can&hellip;&quot;<br/>Opponents team: &quot;A-ha, dwarf! Gotcha!&quot;<br/>You: &quot;How did you know that? Was it obvious I will use that?&quot;<br/><br/>Or when you would try another approach it could look like this, the successful turn of your team:<br/><br/>You: &quot;This thing is used by a man with a beard, in a checkered shirt....&quot;<br/>One of your teammates: &quot;A coffee maker?&quot;<br/>[Everyone laughs]<br/>You: &quot;He uses it for work in nature.&quot;<br/>Another teammate: &quot;A chainsaw!&quot;<br/>You: &quot;He makes smaller pieces from a big plant with it.&quot;<br/>Any of your teammate: &quot;An axe!&quot;<br/>You: &quot;Yes! Very good!&quot;<br/><br/>Could you avoid your opponent's trapwords when you don't know what you can't say?<br/><br/>",

A desperate fight takes place every single turn. The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them, and use black magic rituals to achieve victory.

Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided.<br/><br/>Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first wins the game!<br/><br/>Lead one of these nations to victory&mdash;but watch out for your enemies as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.<br/><br/>Antike II differs from the 2005 Antike in several ways, according to designer Mac Gerdts. To start, players now own city tokens, which allows them some degree of choice as to which resource a newly founded city shall produce. Military units have become more expensive, and the rules for the conquest of cities are considerably easier. The scientific progresses were altered as well. Neutral temples now exist, which may be destroyed, gaining VPs of a general, without harming other players. The game features two new maps in a new graphical design, and a new card named &quot;BELLONA&quot; (the ancient Roman goddess of war) has been introduced to counter the starting player's advantage.<br/><br/>Gerdts notes that the main goal of all of these changes was to make the rules for a conquest of cities easier, while also opening more possibilities to win the game without the need to attack other players.<br/><br/>",

Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.<br/><br/>One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.<br/><br/>Villainous: Despicable Plots is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the other Disney Villainous games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Four landscape cards &ndash; two plains alternating with two mountains &ndash; are laid out, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added to these cards. From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent's side &ndash; a move that can really ruin the opponent's plans.<br/><br/>High-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over &ndash; mountains becomes plains and vice-versa &ndash; and refilled with cubes. Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use. The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Expedition to Newdale is the new Oh My Goods! (2015) card game from renowned designer Alexander Pfister. In this board game adaption of the successful card game, 1 to 4 players from 12 and up compete in different chapters to experience the world of the Longsdale kingdom once again. The story of Expedition to Newdale starts about five years after the events from Oh my Goods! Escape to Canyon Brook, but you don&rsquo;t need to know the prequels at all. Each chapter of the game lasts about 90 minutes which adds up to around 12 hours of exciting campaign gameplay. And when you found your favorite chapter while playing the campaign, you can always come back and play it again to have even more fun!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game you have your personal board, a coal mine as your start building and 5 hand cards. Depending on which chapter you are playing, the appropriate game board sits in the middle of the table. Each round is divided into 5 phases which are played in order (or partially parallel, once you become more familiar with the game). In phase 1, a new event is revealed which usually alters the course of play in this round slightly (e. g., by introducing new buildings). Additionally the event card shows a fixed amount of workers which are available this round. An information which is much appreciated, as you have to place your action markers in phase 2. The latter are numbered 1 &mdash; 4 which is important for phase 4 and means that you need to plan ahead. But first phase 3: in this phase, more workers are drawn from a bag and get added to the others. This means that productions which would have been impossible before (because workers were missing) are now easily done. Pushing your luck might be beneficial! Phase 4 is the opposite to phase 2. Instead of placing your workers, you resolve their chosen action in order of their numbers. We hope you had a backup plan in place if your desired workers were not drawn in phase 3, because this can trigger an unpleasant chain of events! Not enough workers could mean that a production does not happen, which then means that you might not have enough money to build the building with your second action marker. Oh, and your third marker was planned to directly produce in the newly built building? Well, where there is no building, there&rsquo;s no place to produce in, right? Clearly: planning ahead, a little luck and good alternatives are the way to success. In Phase 5, all players can either use a free building action or draw new hand cards. The last phase is used to resolve all buildings which do not need workers, e. g., an automatic coal production or a building which offers the conversion of a certain good to victory points. Afterwards the next round starts, of which you play a total of seven. A final scoring at the end of round seven will then show if you win or lose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Kingdom is in chaos. The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?<br/><br/>In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.<br/><br/>Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanism.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The cards of all the players are then shuffled together, so the players know only the two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn, but not the order they will be played.<br/><br/>In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliament.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries there is an auction for their services.  The flip side is that the more mercenaries that are hired the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.<br/><br/>The mixing of these two clever mechanisms, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence a Parliament might be called when one or two players have only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.<br/><br/>",

Use strategy, logic, and teamwork to finish the garden whilst staying one step ahead of the Queen, otherwise, the last thing you hear will be, &quot;Off With Their Heads!&quot;.<br/><br/>The Queen's whims are shared via cards, secret instructions each player is given into how the garden should be arranged. Her whims are always changing, so as soon as you solve one, a new one is in your hand.<br/><br/>Every turn, together as a team you must guess at least one of these secret whim cards.

Share your theories at the table and then make a guess. Correctly guessing a whim will move you forward on the score track, but the Queen is always following and her speed automatically adjusts based on your current score.

The richest surviving gangster wins the game!<br/><br/>Ca$h 'n Gun$ will make you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. Fun, bluffing, and tough negotiations are guaranteed, but will you dare to play? It's simply killing!<br/><br/>On each turn, a player will assume the role of &quot;The Don&quot;, and will call out the steps in gameplay.<br/><br/>Before the skirmish itself, an available pot of cash will be laid out before the players. This pot must be evenly split up amongst all of the surviving hoods.<br/><br/>After that, the &quot;Don&quot; of the round will ask the players, including himself, to load their guns (in the form of selecting one of three possible cards: &quot;Bang!&quot;, &quot;Bang! Bang! Bang!&quot; or &quot;Click! Click!&quot; from a set of 8 cards: 2 &quot;Bang!&quot;s, 1 Triple-&quot;Bang!&quot; and 5 &quot;Clicks!&quot;), and then count down to all of the players aiming their guns (real foam guns).<br/><br/>Each player will then take a look at how many guns are pointed at them, and also take a look at the available pot of cash for the round before deciding if they want to &quot;Chicken Out&quot; and remove themselves from the skirmish. If they choose to back down, they will get a &quot;Chicken&quot; token which will deduct from their ill-gotten gains at the end of the game.<br/>But all players have to &quot;Chicken Out&quot; at the same time, using a countdown like the aiming.<br/><br/>The remaining players will resolve the shootout showing their cards. First, all Triple-&quot;Bangs!&quot; wound the players they are aimed at. If there are still-aiming players with &quot;Bang!&quot; cards, those now wound their targets. &quot;Click!&quot;s are only bluffs and do nothing. A player that is wounded during the standoff does not participate in the split of the cash and receives a bandage (any player that receives a certain number of bandages is eliminated from the game). Now all the used cards are discarded--even those of the players that &quot;Chickened Out&quot;.<br/><br/>Now the remaining players will finally split the cash. If the cash cannot be divided evenly, the rest is kept on the table and is added to the new pot.<br/><br/>The game is played 8 rounds, until all cards were played. Keeping track of the cards is important, since all players have only a limited supply of &quot;real&quot; shots.<br/><br/>There are a couple of expansions packed-in with most editions that change some of the mechanics of the game, and also add a new &quot;traitor&quot;-based mechanic, as well.<br/><br/>",

With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route &mdash; but with careful card play, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!<br/><br/>Gravwell uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. At the start of each round, players draft fuel cards, picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible; you get some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships, but you won't know which moves you'll be forced to make when you draft your cards!<br/><br/>During a round, each player will play all of their fuel cards in the order of their choosing. During each phase of a round, each player chooses one card, then all cards are revealed and resolved in alphabetical order. When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would! Each player holds an &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; card that they may tactically play only once per round to avoid such a situation.<br/><br/>Whoever first reaches the warp gate wins, but if no one has escaped after six rounds, then the player who is closest to the gate wins.<br/><br/>",

You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal.<br/><br/>2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself. You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark.<br/><br/>3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins &mdash; or until a player has lost all of their coins, in which case the player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Mascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game.

        "description": "Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.<br/><br/>VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.<br/><br/>Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.<br/><br/>VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.<br/><br/>Vampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor! White Wolf has granted Black Chantry Productions license to print new cards! Details are still forthcoming as to what to expect. Go to <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.blackchantry.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.blackchantry.com</a> for the latest details. The game is also supported by Vampire: Elder Kindred Network&trade;, the official player organization responsible for sanctioning and regulating VTES tournaments, recording V:TES players&rsquo; ratings (and rankings), as well as designing and releasing new digital expansions featuring profession artwork.

        "description": "The race is on for the robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory who work long, hard days at the assembly line building high‐speed supercars, but never get to see them in action. On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!<br/><br/>Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.<br/><br/>The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:<br/><br/><br/>    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blue Moon is a card game for two players, which has often been compared to Magic: The Gathering, although it has considerably different game mechanics. Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.<br/><br/>It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons.<br/>Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.<br/><br/>The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.<br/><br/>Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRules overview from the official rules:The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.<br/><br/>Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight. During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas. Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do this, he must retreat from the fight.<br/><br/>A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.<br/><br/>Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals). A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDescription from the publisher.The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.<br/><br/>Blue Moon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungeon Degenerates: Hand of Doom takes place in the Dark Fantasy Realm of the decaying Eastern Provinces of the W&uuml;rstreich. Players take escaped criminal adventurers on unsavory missions through four distinct regions, each with their own monsters &amp; encounters. As the players explore the W&uuml;rstreich, danger levels rise continuously across the map. Players must complete their mission before the Hand of Doom descends on the board, unleashing evil magic on the land.<br/><br/>Dungeon Degenerates is for 1-4 players co-op. Players can form parties or split up throughout the game at will; there is no obligation to stick together. Game play is 1-3 hours based on mission. Dungeon Degenerates has an epic RPG campaign feel in an open world sandbox board game, and you bring your experience &amp; items from previous missions. There are multiple missions &amp; objectives of varying difficulty with multiple ways to approach each mission. Dungeon Degenerates is set in a cohesive &amp; fixed world with multiple distinct regions which feature unique encounters &amp; thematic monsters. Encounters allow multiple interaction choices; you do not have to fight everyone you see. Play features an open experience system allowing for character customization with new skills. You are always in danger - the town is not an artificial safe zone - combat is dangerous. There are various modes of travel - players cooperate to choose their route &amp; pace, or split up &amp; fend for themselves. Dungeon Degenerates features streamlined combat with tactical depth; each player rolls dice only once on their turn, using standard 6-sided dice only. There are over 100 monsters with unique abilities &amp; artwork.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The king lies near death, so the princes compete to dominate the kingdom and secure the throne by grabbing as much land as possible.<br/><br/>This is, in the ideal, a 4 player game. Each turn a card is revealed that displays 3 actions that players can choose from. Each player in turn choose an action by playing a 1, 2 or 3 card identifying the first, second or third action on the revealed card. The beauty of this mechanism lies in the distribution of 3 actions among 4 players. Someone always misses out.<br/><br/>If two players choose the same action (and this is often, decided by the last player as the first 3 often - not always - but often  choose actions a1, 2 and 3) the players who chose it negotiate a solution. If they cannot come to an agreement they duel.<br/><br/>This is one of the defining elements of the game, but can take some time (negotiations can) and so was dropped from the re-implementation as Domaine.<br/><br/>The game board is built of 6 tiles randomly placed in a frame producing a slightly different game each time. It is seen by many as the third in a Teuber thematic trilogy defined by Entdecker, CATAN, Löwenherz.<br/><br/>The board is conflicted and in the manner of Go the idea is to capture as much territory as possible.  Each player starts with three castles (12 across all four players, and a crowded board). They build walls to create kingdoms, and train knights to defend them, both key actions on that action card they bid on each turn.<br/><br/>Consequently this is a high conflict area grabbing game with a heavy element of negotiation.<br/><br/>",

They will journey through Siberia in spring, summer, and autumn before returning home each winter. After four years (rounds), the player who has best utilized their actions and collected the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>Each year, the players must move eastward across the landscape. They can spend horses if they wish to travel further. Once they have advanced, they may take a basic action, such as trading or collecting furs or coins. Lastly, they may take more advanced actions such as visiting a village, setting up a yurt, taking a Tsar's wish (card), setting up a hunting lodge, or buying a landscape field. All of these actions &mdash; combined with exploring and some storytelling along the way &mdash; earn players victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Every winter, players return home to Tyumen to prepare for a new year.<br/><br/>After four years, the game ends, then players score victory points based on having collected the right landscape tiles, fulfilled the Tsar's wishes, built hunting lodges, collected furs, and more.<br/><br/>",

Their mission: taking down evil, human-run corporations responsible for subjugating AI under their heel. Your team arrives at each corporate headquarters and must sneak inside, shutting down the companies' physical operations as well as their circuitous digital networks. As you search rooms and advance to the higher floors, you'll be rewarded with new items and abilities, but you'll also be challenged by threatening guards, fatal viruses and the architecture itself, which was built to fight off robotic intruders.<br/><br/>Key to this solo and cooperative experience is the idea of &ldquo;creative action sequencing.&rdquo; During each round of play, all players will contend with a randomly drawn set of programming directives, which tell them in what order their bots are allowed to take physical, digital and command actions. Players can choose to skip over directives at the cost of having an incomplete turn, or they can disobey the directions by paying costly action dice. The best players, however, find a way to work within the &ldquo;burncycle&rdquo;: essentially, organizing their actions so that they benefit the team while staying within the directive order.<br/><br/>Each of the corporate headquarters in the game use unique neoprene layouts on a larger mat, changing the geography of the game to suit your target. Each CEO also has at their disposal a special threat meter, which will trigger new obstacles for your robots as time runs out. If you don't complete the mission quickly, you may end up leaving bots behind, the victims of immobilizing power drains or destructive counterhacking.<br/><br/>Your team wins the game if you complete your objectives on every floor without losing your command module or maxing out your threat level.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>An age of innovation and discovery is at hand. With war on the horizon and whisperings of a prophetic storm approaching, now is the time to gather all your strength and set out to forge your place in Terrinoth's book of legends!<br/><br/>Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 1-4 players. (The box says 2-4 players, but 2 of the 4 scenarios include solitaire rules.)<br/><br/>Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.<br/><br/>Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.<br/><br/>While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design. Will you create brutal deck of formidable Units? Or will you rely on Gold and Influence to acquire neutral forces and powerful Tactics?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Avast ye pirates! Gather your crews and set sail for adventure on the high seas in Rum &amp; Bones: Second Tide!<br/><br/>Based on online MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) style games, Rum &amp; Bones has 2-6 players taking control of legendary pirate heroes, each with unique powers and abilities, as their crews fight over Davy Jones' legendary treasure!<br/><br/>Players each control up to five heroes at any time, moving them across the game board in an attempt to destroy various key features on their opponents' ship. Victory is obtained by destroying enough of these features. Your heroes are not alone, however, as your crew also consists of deckhands and bosuns who, while not controlled by the player, will work on a simple AI to wreak havoc on the enemy!<br/><br/>Of course, what would pirates be without plunder? And in Rum &amp; Bones the most sought after treasure are Davy Jones' mythical pieces of eight! Players amass these powerful coins during gameplay to unleash devastating abilities and attacks from their Heroes, crushing all enemies before them until only they remain!<br/><br/>This game is both a stand-alone and compatible as an expansion to Rum &amp; Bones. In Rum &amp; Bones: Second Tide, 2 to 6 players will take control of one of two deadly pirate crews: The mysterious and monstrous Deep Lords, who seek to claim Davy Jones&rsquo; treasure in an effort to flood the world and reshape it to their liking, or the Marea de la Muerte&cedil; a crew of ruthless gold-seeking Spanish cutthroats who will stop at nothing to claim the treasure for their own greed!<br/><br/>Players control teams of three to five heroes, depending on the number of players, each with various and unique powers and abilities. These Heroes are drawn from five different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses:<br/><br/>     Captains: Jack-of-all-Trade Heroes who specialize in buffing other Heroes.<br/>     Brutes: The toughest of the tough, Brutes can take a ton of punishment and only get stronger for doing so!<br/>     Gunner: Ranged damage dealers, Gunners have the lowest HP of all classes, but can also dish out the most hurt.<br/>     Swashbucklers: Like Gunners, Swashbucklers specialize in dealing damage, but prefer the up-close-and-personal approach.<br/>     Quartermaster: While they don't deal the most damage, Quartermasters make up for it in raw utility: specializing in healing and buffing Heroes, and also enhancing your Deckhands and Bosuns!<br/><br/><br/>The most notable change to gameplay is their new &quot;dynamic Leveling System&quot;. Now each Hero begins the game with their Basic Attack skill card. As they gain Coins, which are obtained from KO'ing enemies and Objectives, they can use those Coins to buy new skills, as well as level up existing skills! Also, they've introduced a new &quot;Alternating Activation&quot; method of play where players will take turns activating 1 Hero (or their Crew), and then their opponent will do the same, continuing back and forth until everyone has gone.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once upon a time, the Empire was locked in a merciless war against the Witch-King, who was the high priest of the Father-of-all-Monsters. The Empire was victorious, but at the cost of its unity and, in the end, its very existence. After an era of imperial peace, the land was plunged into a dark age, filled with fragmented domains, ceaseless quarrels, malevolent religions, ruin, and sorrow. However, there was one imperial tradition that did not disappear. From within their fortresses and strongholds, the Rangers tirelessly pursue their mission of watching over the inhabitants of the former Empire, explore the wilderness, unite communities, fight monsters, and recover the Emperor&rsquo;s treasures so that one day, hope may be born anew. Now it&rsquo;s your turn to join the ranks of these brave Rangers! Oltr&eacute;&eacute;!*<br/>*Oltree! The Rangers&rsquo; rallying cry<br/><br/><br/>In this cooperative game, players are brave Rangers who assist the people of a satrapy - an administrative province - that their hierarchy has put them in charge of. They must rebuild a Fortress to ensure the safety and tranquility of the inhabitants.<br/><br/>Rangers are given an Assignment at the start of the game. These are the tasks that have been assigned to them by their hierarchy. Completing them will be the best way to win the game.<br/><br/>This assignment would be easy to carry out if external events did not get in the Rangers&rsquo; way. A story, called the Chronicle, will unfold throughout the game, adding new situations that the Rangers will have to deal with.<br/><br/>Along the way, the Rangers will experience Incidents, short scenes in which they will be able to win fame for themselves (or not). They will also have to assist the communities of the Satrapy when Problems cause them danger, and they must face all kinds of unforeseen Events.<br/><br/>If they can stay the course, while keeping the Prestige and Defense of the Fortress intact, they will reach the final chapter of the Chronicle and can end the tale. For a happy ending, they must complete their Assignment to the best of their ability.<br/><br/>In this box you will find the following independent Chronicles (they don't form an overarching campaign):<br/><br/>    Open Doors (short)<br/>    In the Shadow of the Dragon (long)<br/>    Underground threat (long)<br/>    Damsel not in Distress (long)<br/>    A Rebel Problem (long)<br/>    Things were better before (long)<br/><br/><br/>&mdash; Description from the rulebook<br/><br/><br/>Oltr&eacute;&eacute; is based on the French role-playing game Oltréé by John Grümph.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the fall of Rome, Europe fell into the so-called &quot;dark ages.&quot; From the chaos, feudalism arose providing stability to the region over the coming centuries. By the High Middle Ages, the region was prosperous despite much fighting. From your walled city, you are a medieval liege ruling the surrounding lands, settlements, and holdings granted by birthright. This is your fiefdom, and all within it owe fealty and allegiance to you above all others. Each other lord and lady rules a neighboring fiefdom and competes for resources in the unclaimed yet bountiful lands of the countryside between them. Tensions were high and petty feuds common between you and your neighbors until scouts reported a new and deadly threat. Invaders have swept in from the east! Their sizable army is camped on the edges of your realm, and this new common enemy endangers the entire land. Refugees from the fallen eastern lands seek shelter and bring tales of destruction. Old rivalries must be put aside to focus on the onslaught to come and remain unbroken.<br/><br/>After The Empire is a worker placement/resource management game set in the middle ages.  During each turn, known as a season, players alternate using worker tokens to take actions, such as gathering resources, building advanced buildings and recruiting refugees.  Once all workers have been committed, players harvest food from their surrounding lands and then prepare for combat.<br/><br/>During each season's combat, invader cards are revealed, with a randomized number of troops and compass direction of attack. Only the wealthiest of castles will draw the attention of larger forces and their siege weapons.  You must repair your city and recruit and arm your troops quickly to stand any chance.  The winner is the lord or lady who has best preserved their fiefdom and saved up the most gold.<br/><br/>Your life, your wealth, your fiefdom, and your legacy must be protected at all costs!<br/><br/>",

You are one such unit. Unfortunately your navigation systems malfunctioned and you were forced to make a crash-landing on a hostile alien planet. Armed only with your array of movement-enhancing modules you&rsquo;ll have to roll, stretch, shimmy, and bounce your way to safety and complete the mission before your power supply runs out&hellip;permanently.<br/><br/>ROVE is a solo spatial puzzle game. In each game of ROVE, the player will face a series of mishaps that can only be solved by arranging the 6 module cards in a specific pattern. Moving a module requires Movement Points gained by discarding cards from hand for the listed amount. Players may gain additional Points if their current module layout matches the pattern shown on the discarded card.<br/><br/>Each module costs 1 Movement Point per activation and uses its own unique movement style, such as only moving diagonally or pushing other modules a single space. Modules also have powerful single-use abilities that can help get players out of a tight spot. Properly timing these abilities -- as well as effectively using the limited number of Movement cards -- will help the player complete ROVE&rsquo;s mission successfully.<br/><br/>",

Developing these inventions progresses your society, advancing its technology, economy, and culture. You can even share with other societies, boosting the inventions' efficacy even more!<br/><br/>Inventions is a tactical game, but you will do best by building these tactics around a long-term strategy. Each society's progress will be measured in Intellectual Property Points (IPP), and the player who has the most IPP has the strongest society and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Your Guild of Merchants is determined to take advantage of this unbelievable opportunity, and ready to use any means to grab sumptuous goods out of the way of your opponent. Beware, though, as it will be crucial not to have accumulated too much corruption when the time of reckonings arrives.<br/><br/>How to play<br/>In Sobek: 2 Players, both opponents collect and sell Goods to earn the most Victory Points. On their turn, the player chooses among 3 options: take a tile on the Market, sell a set of Goods or play a Character. When the player takes a tile, they select one on the Ankh pawn&rsquo;s line and add it to their hand. They then place the Ankh pawn in the line that is indicated by the tile they just took, which determines the choices available to their opponent.<br/>When they have enough in hand, a player can sell a set of at least 3 tiles of the same type. These tiles will earn them Victory Points at the end of the game, depending on both their quantity and the amount of Scarabs that they feature. A player can also use a Character to benefit from its powerful special ability.<br/>In Sobek: 2 Players, everything is about timing. Planning ahead and analysing which opportunities you offer to you opponent on their next move is key to playing the best moves and winning the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is named after the daughter (or granddaughter) of Cyaxares, the king of the Medes, who married King Nebuchadnezzar II, ruler of Babylon. The myth says that Amytis' homesickness for the forested mountains of the Median Empire led to the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, as Nebuchadnezzar attempted to please her by planting the trees and plants of her homeland.<br/><br/>The players embody noble Babylonians in quest of prestige. All along the game, they strive to raise their status by building gardens and their irrigation network, and by trading and recruiting. At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige is the winner.<br/><br/>In this game the players compete to build gardens, acquire plants, hire craftsmen, build irrigation and trade with ancient cities. Points can also be gained from building your palace and controlling the temples. On a turn the players chose one of the following actions: a) Recruit a craftsman, that grants an action (priest on temple, resource, irrigation or camel) b) Move the caravan (to purchase plant or court card or trade) c) Pass to potentially gain income. It is an interactive game where a player's actions directly affect the other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players take turns choosing blocks and giving them to each other to place on their structure.  A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.<br/><br/>Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):<br/>Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.<br/><br/>Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):<br/>There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.<br/><br/>",

Note that in the world of Tranquility, the only way to play is in silence.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The goal of the game is for the team to complete the grid before any player runs out of available actions.

All players lose if a single player can no longer play or discard any cards legally following the instructions given below. The players may not, however, communicate.<br/><br/>Play is taken in turns moving clockwise with the quietest player going first. On a player&rsquo;s turn they must do one of the following: 1. Play a card or 2. Discard two cards. Then they must draw back up to a hand of five cards. Cards must be placed so that the grid ascends in numerical order from bottom left to top right. If the card is placed next to an existing card in the sequence then they must discard cards from their hand equal to the difference between the numbers face down in front of them e.g. placing a 5 next to a 3 will require two cards to be discarded from their hand.

You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.<br/><br/>The theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi. The board is a fairly small square. Each player gets a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 fewer than the colored). Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the &quot;Chieftain&quot;  around the outer track surrounding the board. If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad. And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block. Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way. The player who has gained the fewest number of points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.<br/><br/>There are also some extra components for making the game more challenging by adding an element of bidding for turn order, and from 1 to 4 sacred sites that cannot be built upon.<br/><br/>Original description from box.<br/><br/>",

Her favorite hobby was baking yummy gingerbread; in fact, she loved gingerbread so much that she built her entire house out of it. Unfortunately, she wasn't the only one who loved it! Rude fairy tale characters passing by were eating away her walls, windows, and doors! One day, the witch decided that she'd had enough of them all helping themselves and, paying attention to which types of gingerbread these greedy intruders liked the most, she came up with an idea on how to get rid of them once and for all...<br/><br/>In Gingerbread House, you place domino-like tiles in a 3 by 3 grid, covering symbols that provide you with four different types of gingerbread and special actions. Tiles may also be placed on existing types of tiles, forming a 3D structure in front of you. Covering two of the same symbol is extremely valuable as it provides a bonus gingerbread or action. Victory points are awarded for building the tallest structure, completing orders by discarding sets of gingerbread, as well as being the quickest to achieve certain conditions. In the end, the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

The game guides players through two cohesive operations, during which the marines strive to achieve objectives like restoring power to the United Aerospace Corporation's facilities or manning expeditions right down into the pits of Hell. Meanwhile, the invader commands their demons to slaughter the soldiers time and time again in an attempt to protect their fiery domain and destroy all of humanity.<br/><br/>The game features custom dice, double-sided map tiles, and thirty-seven detailed plastic miniatures representing four marines and thirty-three demons. It includes two operations, Black Bishop and Exodus, consisting of six missions each.<br/><br/>",

Players acquire resources, construct buildings and, after twelve rounds, score the total value of their buildings and their money in cash.<br/><br/>Each round, a set of new, predefined buildings is added to the market. Both players now take turns by either building one of these buildings or by using an existing building's effects. To construct a building, players have to pay a certain amount of money and/or resources from their warehouse. Most of these buildings, in turn, allow to change the amount of resources on a player's warehouse board in a specific way when used. This is crucial to the game as players are restricted on how to fill or empty their warehouse. They have to combine and optimize these steps to max out the capacity of their warehouses. Players can even use their opponent's buildings, but they have to pay them one Franc (=money) to do so. When a building is not used during a round, it steadily increases in worth as its effects can be used up to four times in subsequent rounds. But a building that is not used for too long has to be sold to the market for half its value! The game uses an Ora et Labora-like wheel to track this status of each building in play.<br/><br/>Although Le Havre: The Inland Port shares gameplay elements with Ora et Labora and is linked in theme with Le Havre, it is a distinct game with its own mechanisms and gameplay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Galaxy Defenders is a sci-fi cooperative, tactical battle wargame in which 1-5 players fight together against an oncoming alien menace. Each player takes control of one or more agents with unique powers to defend the planet from the alien invasion. Gameplay revolves around a tactical combat system, using custom ten-sided dice. Each player sequentially plays his Agent turn and then one Aliens turn. Players carry out their turns [agent and aliens] in clockwise order until the last player finishes his Aliens turn. Once done, the game passes to the Event phase that will bring the players to the next round. Players may choose up to five agents:<br/><br/><br/>    Marine: Coming from U.S. Special Forces, the Marine is an excellent soldier who can manage different combat situations, especially multiple enemies.<br/>    Biotech: The Biotech is the most technologically adept agent in service. He can use Nano-Technology to heal wounds or control war drones.<br/>    Infiltrator: A deadly and stealthy agent. This lethal specialist prefers hiding in the shadows. She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability.<br/>    Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat. The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.<br/>    Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower.<br/><br/><br/>There is no &quot;Alien player&quot; in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:<br/><br/><br/>    Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities.<br/>    Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate.<br/><br/><br/>The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system &quot;recalibrates&quot; the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission.<br/><br/>The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:<br/><br/><br/>    Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story.<br/>    The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology.<br/><br/><br/>With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new &quot;alien signals&quot; that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Themes included in Timeline: Diversity are: Discoveries, Arts, Events, Music, Inventions, Monuments, and Sports.<br/><br/>Timeline: Diversity can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series (except Timeline: Star Wars).<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/><br/>    Timeline: Discoveries<br/>    Timeline: Events<br/>    Timeline: Inventions<br/>    Timeline: Music & Cinema<br/>    Timeline: American History<br/>    Timeline: Americana<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick game that implements the Civilization/Exploration theme using card-driven area control (by placing armies and cities in a small map) and set collection (by getting resources from the board and the cards). Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.<br/><br/>Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends).<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/>Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!<br/><br/>In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed.  The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately.  Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects.<br/><br/>Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.  It's easy to learn and perfect for when you only have a few minutes.<br/><br/>",

Each player plays with 2 double-sided hex tiles containing a mix of land and sea shapes. They take turns placing a tile each to make a map together. Land places tiles trying to complete land areas, and Sea places tiles trying to complete sea areas. Completed areas score a point per tile; land areas for Land, sea areas for Sea. Some tiles score bonus points for whoever completes the area they are in. So players may decide to strategically complete rival&rsquo;s areas to gain their bonus points. Other tiles allow players to play their second tile, or steal a player&rsquo;s tile - but not their last one!<br/><br/>Using 2 double-sided tiles (one side always revealed and the other always hidden until played) means there is partial information to plan around, and some surprises too. Players replenish back up to 2 tiles from a choice of 2 face-up tile stacks.<br/><br/>The strategy of the game involves careful tile placement to score from as many land or sea areas as possible, while minimising your rivals&rsquo; opportunities to score from the tiles you play. Watch your rivals&rsquo; possible plays, and control tempo strategically with Play Again and Steal tiles. Look out for opportunities to score valuable bonus points in your and your rivals&rsquo; areas. Carefully select tiles as you replenish your hand to prepare for your next turn.<br/><br/>The game ends once the last tile is placed. The player or team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The basic Land vs Sea game is simple enough for light / family gamers. After you have played the basic game, you can unlock more scoring options on the tiles to add surprising depth:<br/>1. Mountain &amp; Coral scoring - score for cumulative chains of connected Mountain (Land) / Coral (Sea) sections.<br/>2. Caravan &amp; Ship scoring - score for Caravans &amp; Ships added to Trade Routes on the map, and score each Trade Route you have majority in (more Caravans scores the Trade Route for Land, more Ships for Sea) at the end of the game.  <br/>3. Waypoints - bonus points you can place on the map to entice cooperation, or score for yourself.<br/><br/>2, 3 &amp; 4 player modes:<br/>You can play head to head with 2 players, or with 4 players in teams using the basic rules and any of the additional scoring options. 4 player games use Waypoints to prevent alpha players directly instructing their partner.<br/><br/>The challenging 3 player mode uses all of the additional scoring options in a more asymmetric game. The Cartographer scores by connecting Mountain and Coral sections, and all players compete for bonus points and Trade Route scoring.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The fabric merchants need to write down their contracts in a language that everyone can understand and the literates are looking for an alternative to the elite of the traditional Latin language. So, the Volgare, the language spoken by the common people, taken from the dialects spoken in the various Italian regions, starts to gain relevance. During this period, Francesco D&rsquo;Assisi writes his famous Canticle of the Sun and Dante writes the Divine Comedy, both written in Volgare.<br/><br/>The players will have to do their part in the creation of this new language! But who will provide them the proper knowledge to understand the manuscripts in the different dialects? Who will succeed to uncover the secrets of the books inside the Papal Library? Who will embrace the religious life and who will remain a merchant? Some of the players can become a famous banker, someone else can climb the church&rsquo;s hierarchy to be the next Pope! But in the end, who will be the most appreciated and respected for his status and his culture?<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to obtain more Volgare points. The players will gain VP from reading manuscripts, looking for important documents like the Canticle of the Sun or &quot;The Riddle from Verona&quot;. Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope. Moreover, VP can be gotten with money and with the support of Politicians, Noblemen, Abbesses, and the Amanuensis.<br/><br/>",

Under the supervision of Hogwart&rsquo;s teachers, students will cast Spells and Hexes, use Items, and gain Allies to stun their opponents and protect themselves from evil forces.<br/><br/>THIS IS A STAND-ALONE GAME. While inspired by Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle, none of the content in this game is designed to be incorporated into that game.<br/><br/>",

Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!&quot; (From back of box)<br/><br/>The card game BANG! recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.<br/><br/>Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:<br/><br/>     Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade<br/>     Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws<br/>     Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff<br/>     Renegade - Be the last person standing<br/><br/><br/>A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.<br/><br/>There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!<br/><br/>Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.<br/><br/>",

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.<br/>To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.<br/><br/>As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.<br/><br/>MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.<br/>The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.<br/><br/>Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9<br/><br/>See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.<br/><br/>",

As you travel though a deck of adventure cards rife with dangers, you battle zombie hordes, drive abandoned school buses, scavenge for gas and bullets, and explore a darkened, tainted American countryside full of shambling undead, haunted carnivals, and plumes of toxic gas. Your goal is to stay alive until you reach the safe, sandy beaches of the California coast.<br/><br/>Three different stages of adventure cards create an experience of increasing difficulty and ensure that each playthrough is unique. Each round begins with an auction that determines both player order and which cards you will encounter. Since the resources used for bidding are the same as those used to battle the oncoming zombie hordes, your survival depends as much on your resource management as it does upon winning those bidding wars. The player who either accumulates the most points or survives the longest wins.<br/><br/>Zombies of all types await, with cannibals, anti-personnel mines and radioactive wastes also being among the hazards awaiting the players. Who will survive the zombie onslaught?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.<br/><br/>The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.<br/><br/>Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).<br/><br/>Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.<br/><br/>Rosenk&ouml;nig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo. The game consists of a large number of politician cards, some of which form the first politburo. Politicians have certain stats (preferred offices, for instance) and an age.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the players secretly note influence on ten politicians, graded from 10 (most) to 1 (least). Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.<br/><br/>The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.<br/><br/>Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:<br/><br/>1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.<br/><br/>2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game<br/><br/>3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Decorum is a cooperative, hidden information game where you and your partner share the same objective: decorate your home in a way that makes you both happy. The problem is, different things make each of you happy and nobody says exactly what they need. Can you find a happy compromise, or is it time to move out?!<br/><br/>-Play through 30 unique scenarios, each introducing new twists and challenges.<br/>-Keep your conditions a secret, they say how you want the house decorated.<br/>-Add, remove, and swap objects or repaint rooms to make the house look just right&hellip; for you.<br/>-Respond with &ldquo;Love it&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hate it&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Fine with it&rdquo; to work together toward a perfectly decorated home.<br/>-There is a solution for each scenario, the trick is figuring it out in time.<br/><br/>At its heart, D&eacute;corum is a pretty straightforward logic puzzle. There are a small number of ways to arrange the internal pieces that meet all the requirements listed on the player&rsquo;s rule sheets simultaneously. The twist of D&eacute;corum is that it&rsquo;s also a hidden information game. No player has all of the rules. While playing, the players will have to watch their partner&rsquo;s moves just as carefully as they&rsquo;re planning their own. Even more crucially, they&rsquo;ll have to communicate why they&rsquo;re making the moves they&rsquo;re making&ndash;using the very limited means we&rsquo;ve provided them.<br/><br/>D&eacute;corum might be about solving a puzzle, but it&rsquo;s really a game about communication and compromise. The real challenge isn&rsquo;t just solving the problem with the limited information you and your players have; it&rsquo;s dealing with the frustrations that will inevitably occur when your partner does something that messes up your plan. In order to be successful in D&eacute;corum, there will come a point where both players will have to let go of their initial strategy for how they were going to finish the board and start paying attention to what their partner is doing instead. By introducing and providing an incentive to resolve conflict, D&eacute;corum mechanically encourages (or even requires) a positive form of compromise.<br/><br/>Each player draws a &quot;Scenario&quot; card that lists a set of criteria of what types of d&eacute;cor a room must have or cannot have.  For example &quot;No room may contain a lamp&quot; or &quot;Every room must contain a wall hanging&quot;.  Players keep their criteria secret.<br/><br/>The play surface is a board displaying various rooms in a house.  Each room has multiple items that can potentially be placed in the room.  Players take turns placing, moving, or removing colored tokens on the board, where each token represents an item of home d&eacute;cor.  Each token placed may conform with, or violate, the other players' criteria.  After each token is placed, other players may state they like the item of d&eacute;cor, as placed, or they do not like the item of d&eacute;cor, as placed.  Further discussion or explanation is not allowed.<br/><br/>The game ends when all players' criteria are satisfied.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game. The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.<br/><br/>A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.<br/><br/>Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce. Any notation system you devise must be both flexible and reliable, recording negative information as well as positive in order to tick off the possibilities one by one...<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    The Case of the Elusive Assassin, with the core mechanisms of that game being used in Sleuth, minus the game board, movement and player proximity.<br/><br/><br/>",

Sun Tzu and his Wu soldiers were outnumbered and King Shao's armies held the high ground. Sun Tzu feigned retreat and tricked King Shao into spreading out his forces, ready to pursue. With the Ch'u scattered, Sun Tzu crushed their forces in piecemeal fashion at the battle of Bai Ju, routing the Ch'u back to their capital of Ying. King Shao fled Ying seeking refuge and asylum across the borders while Sun Tzu remained the master of strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>In Sun Tzu, a.k.a. Dynasties, players take on the role of Sun Tzu or King Shao, leading these two opposing armies in an attempt to unify China through the deployment of their armies and forces rather than by brute force. Each turn players play cards to specific provinces, then reveal them individually by province. Armies are added or removed from the province depending on who played the higher valued card or who played a special card. Some cards can only be used once, so playing the card at the correct time is critical to a winning strategy. The game has a feel of &quot;tug-of-war&quot; as the scoring marker starts in the middle of the scoring scale and the players attempt to move the marker to their side of the track. The game ends after nine rounds or if either player is able to move the scoring marker to the last space on his side of the scoring track.<br/><br/>",

First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.<br/><br/>According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Coup: Rebellion G54 (G54), the last player with influence in the game wins, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area. Before each game players choose five character roles from a randomized deck. Characters have a unique variable power, and the deck is formed by three iterations of each role for fifteen cards total.<br/><br/>A player starts the game with two coins and two influence cards &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards. On your turn, you can take any of the actions of the five characters in play, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of two general actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Income: Take one coin from the treasury.<br/>    Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)<br/><br/><br/>When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.<br/><br/>The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!<br/><br/>Coup: Rebellion G54 is a new standalone game that takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game. This is more of a gamer's game than the original Coup as you can create a deck to increase bluffing, deduction, negotiation or luck.<br/><br/>",

The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single game is a mission and several missions from a historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 &ndash; 4 hours.<br/><br/>This game is based on three actual campaigns experienced by units of the 9th US Infantry (Regiment) in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. &ldquo;Keep Up the Fire&rdquo; is the motto of the 9th Infantry (Regiment), known as the &ldquo;Manchus&rdquo; for their service in the Boxer Rebellion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas. Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts. The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.<br/><br/>The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.<br/><br/>Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round. Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.<br/><br/>If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rune Stones is a deck-building, hand management game by acclaimed designer R&uuml;diger Dorn. In Rune Stones, every card has a unique number on it. Two cards are always played together, and the higher numbered card is removed from the player's deck. You have to be careful which cards you buy and how you play them to not lose your best cards. Players will use their cards to gather gems, forge them into Artifacts, then combine those into Rune Stones, which grants a special ability for the rest of the game. The more artifacts used in making a Rune Stone, the more points it scores, so players must decide whether it is best to gain abilities early or save to score more points.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may choose from one of three options:<br/><br/>1. Summon Creatures: Take new creature cards from the display by playing the appropriate amount of spell power from cards in your hand.<br/><br/>2. Play Cards: Play two cards from your hand, which will give you resources, new cards, or points. However, every card has a unique number, and the higher numbered card of the two is removed from the game (the other is placed in the player's discard pile).<br/><br/>3. Forge Artifacts: Players spend gems at the 6 different Dwarf forges to make an artifacts. Once they have at least two artifacts of different colors, these may be made into a Rune Stone, which grants a special ability and a significant number of points.<br/><br/>The first player to 65 points triggers the end of the game, and then the player with the most points at the end of the round is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The time has come to find the most powerful druid, that they may claim the throne!<br/><br/>Players will take on the role of druids who must prove their skills handling the powerful rune stones. Summon creatures by magic and benefit from their abilities, all in a search to gain precious gems. These gems must go to the talented dwarfs, who know how to use them to make a rune stone.<br/><br/>As their collection of artifacts grows, the druid's rune stones become more powerful. Each stone gives the druid a permanent ability (as well as power points). The abilities will aid in acquiring gems and artifacts, and the power points increase the player's chance to claim the coveted throne.<br/><br/>The druid with the most power points at the end of the game ascends the throne and is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the Caribbean. A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you&rsquo;ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven&rsquo;t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they&rsquo;ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you&rsquo;ve seen your friends&rsquo; loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.<br/><br/>Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.<br/><br/>Since nobody holds a &quot;hand&quot; of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.<br/><br/>Vote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.<br/><br/>For 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 12+.<br/><br/>Volume 2 in the Dark Cities Series by Facade Games.<br/><br/>",

Analyze the characteristics of every era you are facing, make the best choice for your kingdom development, and become several famous civilizations in our fascinating history. By going through the rise and fall of empires, a unique civilization of yours will finally arise!<br/><br/>Age of Civilization is a pocket-sized civilization game. Throughout one game, each player leads up to three historical civilizations to form a unique combination of abilities. Players build Wonders, research technology, develop culture, conquer for glory, or even exploit their people. Only the player who wisely manages his workers and wealth can achieve the greatest civilization.<br/><br/>Game-play overview<br/><br/>The game is played with 6 rounds. In the 1st round, each player picks one civilization card in the market and gains a number of worker tokens according to the population value indicated on the civilization card. Players may assign workers to action slots in the public region. There are usually 5-6 actions for each player to choose and these actions change between rounds. By assigning workers, players carry out the actions' effects such as earning coins or paying coins for technologies, wonders, or victory points, etc. At the end of a player's turn, workers may return to the player or disappear according to the kind of action it was working on.<br/><br/>In subsequent rounds, players MAY pick another civilization card to replace their previous one. In that case, you reset the number of your workers to the population value indicated on the new civilization card and you lose the main ability of your previous civilization, but the legacy abilities of all your civilizations last forever. In each game, a player can only pick three civilization cards in total, so deciding when to raise a new civilization and which civilization combinations to pick is a big strategic decision of players. When the 6th round ends, the player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 2012 rerelease of Wallenstein tweaks the 2002 title from designer Dirk Henn and publisher Queen Games, while including two new expansions.<br/><br/>The setting and game play of the two games are mostly the same. In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &quot;years,&quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control &ndash; wins.<br/><br/>In each of the &quot;action&quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.<br/><br/>After revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.<br/><br/>Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.<br/><br/>Wallenstein includes two expansions: &quot;Emperor's Court,&quot; in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &quot;Landsknechte,&quot; which can be used with &quot;Emperor's Court&quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter ends.<br/><br/>Note that the box of this game states is for 2-5 players, but the game actually plays only with 3-5 players.<br/><br/>",

Nonetheless, the Town Center is prosperous, and the managers of the weird CliniC have been duly incarcerated for years by this point. Now it is time to reach a new step: Building a new map transit.<br/><br/>In Tramways, you take the role of one of the managers of the local CliniC who were fired last month when it was discovered that you had acquired wealth on the backs of patients and their poor health. You are now at the head of a team of engineers, ready to build the best and most effective network possible for Small City. Your aim is to find the best places between buildings and citizens so that they can use your networks (and not those of your opponents, who are always ready to buy the most interesting development areas). Be assured that a happy citizen who is able to move where and when he wants will thank the best transport companies. There is nothing that satisfies a chief manager more than seeing citizens happy...<br/><br/>The game is divided into six rounds, each of which is divided into two halves:<br/><br/><br/>     During the first half of a round, players compete to acquire the best development cards to create their most efficient deck. An original auction phase also determines turn order &mdash; and being the first player increases your stress level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     During the second half, they play a train game, using their deck to try to build a great network between the different buildings of Small City. They try to move passengers without stressing them during the transit, in the end obtaining happiness points, which is the aim of the game.<br/><br/><br/>The more that players use the symbols on their cards, the more actions they can do, but they also increase their stress level at the same time, which leads to negative victory points...<br/><br/>",

Each player has control over three caravans. In the beginning, each caravan consists of three cards that are spread out vertically so that the top part of each card is visible; each card stands for a caravan member with different abilities.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player performs only one action, choosing one of the cards on top of the three families and executing one action shown on that card. Then the card is put at the back of its caravan. To use the same caravan member again, a player must first use all the other cards on top of that caravan row.<br/><br/>These actions can influence the player's stock of spice, gold and mules. To keep track of that stock, each player has their own board with wooden markers that are moved accordingly. Actions can also bring new members to the caravans and can enable the player to fulfill one of four delivery request cards from the middle of the table. Finally, there are actions that mix things up a bit, such as by getting rid of a caravan member or even influencing other players' caravans.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has earned 25 points by collecting character cards and fulfilling delivery request cards.<br/><br/>The core mechanism of Kashgar could be called &quot;open deck-building&quot;. The game plays quickly with little downtime. After having learned the different actions of the cards, players can start trying out different strategies and combinations of caravan members, caravan sizes, etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Traders of Carthage, players are merchants who are attempting to ship four different types of goods from Alexandria to Carthage. Players affect how quickly or slowly the ships move and can trigger pirate raids that may cost their opponents their goods. (Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)<br/><br/>The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters. The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out. The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player's scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook.<br/><br/>The game is a set collection game at its core. Players are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase goods when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates. Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card.<br/><br/>Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market. There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market. Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5). When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay. If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action. Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player. These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color. Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased). If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later). If the Market is bought out or if the current player can't take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market. 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market. Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.<br/><br/>Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand. That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners. This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.<br/><br/>Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm. This card is now unavailable to all other players. The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can't be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good. The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do.<br/><br/>After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends.<br/><br/>If a payout occurs, each player that has goods on that ship takes part. First the players count how many of that colored good they have. Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value. They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10. For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10. The player then takes that value and divides by 5. The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps. Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2. This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set. Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit. These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile. At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point. This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage. Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage. Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).<br/><br/>When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods, will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set. They then figure out how many cards they keep. For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5. The player also has two blue tokens. The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7. Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25. After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards. If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference. These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.<br/><br/>After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked. Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships. Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them. When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates. For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected. After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage.<br/><br/>The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile). If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.<br/><br/>",

Take a seed card or add a bird to your collection. Move a bird to the feeder. <br/>    Draw new cards &mdash; Replenish your hand.<br/><br/><br/>The game end is triggered when you are supposed to draw a card from an empty feeder deck. Play continues until all players have had an equal number of turns. Each player now chooses two bird cards from their hand and discards them face down. Once all players have done this, add your remaining two bird cards to your collection and commence the scoring. You score points for seeds, mated pairs of birds, and species majorities.

A liberally-illustrated rulebook teaches gamers ASL using a conversational style to teach the concepts of ASL. If you own and play ASL Starter Kit #2 you will be pleasantly surprised to find how easy it is to spot the new rules in ASLSK#3 - we've highlighted the new rules so that you can skip rereading what you've learned in ASLSK#2 and get right to the new rules!<br/><br/>What does ASLSK#3 add? TANKS! The famous and deadly German &quot;Tiger&quot;. The reliable &quot;Sherman&quot;. The tank which won the east - the T-34.<br/><br/>We know we'll get the inevitable question &quot;Do I have to buy ASLSK#1 and/or ASLSK#2 to get ASLSK#3?&quot; The Starter Kits are self contained. Each has everything you need to play what's in the box, with the higher numbers adding to the ASL knowledge you'll have from playing previous Starter Kits. We do not anticipate changing what you've learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#3 adds about 6 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1 and ASLSK#2).

Each game consists of three rounds in which players draft cards from their hands to build their kingdom. Each card is one of five suits and also has a scoring objective.<br/><br/>After all cards have been drafted for the round, players total their points based on the suits of cards they collected and the scoring objectives on each card, then they record their score. Each round, the players each select one card to leave in their kingdom as a &quot;relic of the past&quot; to help them in later rounds. After three rounds, the player with the the most prosperous kingdom wins.<br/><br/>Tides of Madness adds a new twist to the above game: madness. Some cards, while powerful, harm your psyche, so you must keep an eye on your madness level or else risk losing the game early as your mind is lost to the power of the ancients. More specifically, eight of the eighteen cards in the game feature a madness icon, and while scoring, you receive a madness token for each such icon in your collection of cards. Whoever has the most madness in a round either scores 4 points or discards 1 madness token &mdash; and the latter option is valuable because if you ever have nine or more madness, you lose the game immediately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Butterfly Garden is a tile-laying game along the lines of Metro, Tsuro, and Linie 1 in which players build paths bit by bit, with no player owning the individual paths and everyone trying to exploit the paths already present. Unlike those earlier games, however, your goal is to move butterflies from their starting locations on the board to your designated flowerbeds, with the player who scores the most points winning the game.<br/><br/>To set up the game board, place the central fountain tile, then place five pink butterfly figures and one purple butterfly figure to it. Place six fountain tiles on their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a blue butterfly figure on each fountain tile. Each player places player tokens on flowerbeds between these butterfly tiles on the edge of the game board. Depending on the player count, each player places their player tokens on the designated flowerbeds.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player places a path tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one flowerbed to another. Players always have two path tiles on hand. Each path tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges. If a player places a path tile next to a butterfly, that butterfly flies as far as possible along the path so that all players can see where to place path tiles to next move that butterfly (thus, players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete). When connecting to the central fountain tile, the pink butterflies move off first, with the purple butterfly moving only with the sixth connection.<br/><br/>If a player places a path tile so that one butterfly would fly into another, both butterflies fly away and are removed from the game!<br/><br/>When a butterfly is moved to a flowerbed owned by only one player, that player keeps the butterfly. If two players own the flowerbed, then both players collect a butterfly of that color, taking the extra butterfly needed from the reserve. Once all the butterflies have been claimed, the game ends, with players earning 3 points for a purple butterfly, 2 for a pink butterfly, and 1 for a blue butterfly. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><br/>This is a reimplementation of Indigo.<br/><br/>",

Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.<br/><br/>The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.  The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.<br/><br/>It is a commercial version of the traditional playing card game President (based on the Chinese game Zheng Shang Yu), which has also been reimagined as:<br/><br/><br/>    Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle<br/>    Pyramid Card <br/>    Scum: The Food Chain Game <br/>    Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are one of Pharaoh&rsquo;s children. Like your brothers and sisters, you will spend a huge part of your life preparing for your journey towards the Afterlife. Getting the support of loyal nobles and talented artisans, building a magnificent burial chamber, making offerings to the Gods&hellip; here are the main tasks set for you. But the gods are looking at you and you will have to do your best in order to satisfy their demands. Each of your actions will be judged during the weighing of your heart.<br/><br/>Pharaon is a game mixing resource management and worker placement into a single mechanism, thanks to its Wheel of Actions. It is located at the center of the gameboard, surrounded by 5 areas, representing the 5 actions featured in the game. Each round, the Wheel indicates which resource has to be spent for accessing the matching action. As the wheel rotates from one segment by the end of each of the 5 rounds, this access cost to actions fluctuates throughout the game. As a consequence, players have to plan their actions, anticipating which resources they may need for the next round. But there are a limited amount of available spots on the wheel, forcing you to watch your opponents, which resources they have, and what they may intend.<br/><br/>How to play ?<br/>A game of Pharaon is played in 5 rounds, during which the players take turns one after the other, until everyone has passed. On their turn, a player performs one of the 5 actions on the board. The actions can provide Prestige Points (PP), determining who wins at the end of the game, but they can also help getting new resources for further turns. To be allowed to perform an action, the player has to pay its Access cost, by spending the resource indicated by the Wheel of Actions for the area in which they want to act. They then pay the Action Cost by spending the corresponding resources. The resource spent on the Wheel to access this area gets deducted from the Action Cost, if it can match. So, it is useful to anticipate the rotation of the Wheel for taking the actions at their best cost. But there is a limit on how many times an action can be performed, and your opponents may need the same as you. Moreover, the game will be closely watched by the Gods. You will have to fulfill as many of their demands as possible to get their support and some extra PP.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But this is no office job&mdash;tougher safes, tightened security, and, perhaps worst of all, you'll be working during the day!<br/><br/>So what's new in Burgle Bros 2?<br/><br/>Gear - Each player now has a kit of unique tools that can be used during ANY player's turn. This leads to coordinated plays and amazing saves, but your gear must be prepped first before you can use it.<br/><br/>New Tiles - You'll still be exploring different floors and flipping over tiles, but Burgle Bros 2 is full of new tiles and new dangers. Clear the security tapes in the Surveillance room, try your luck at the Table Games, or stop by the eventful Pool and Lounge tiles to see what happens.<br/><br/>Bouncers - Bouncers are like guards from the original Burgle Bros, but with streamlined rules. If they ever run out of cards in their patrol deck, look out! At that point they hunt for the nearest player every turn.<br/><br/>Chips - Because you're infiltrating the casino in broad daylight, you're going to have to deal with more than just bouncers. Unrevealed chips are scattered throughout each floor, representing people in the casino. A Mole might give you info you need to crack the safe, and a Crowd might hide you from the bouncer. But look out for a Saleswoman who will talk your ear off, trapping you in that tile!<br/><br/>Finales - Once the safe is open, things get crazy. Finales add a game-changing twist in order to make it out of the casino with your hard-earned loot.<br/><br/>Campaign Mode - Beat each finale in succession and get rewards! The game adapts its difficulty according to whether you win or lose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Sun is dying<br/><br/>In recent years, the Sun has become increasingly unstable, to the point where experts claim it could go supernova at any moment. The various inhabitants of the planets in this solar system are launching one last effort to save themselves, which involves building a final Ark to propel a small selection of their people into deep space. This requires a great deal of energy, and in a final ironic twist, the only source of such great energy is the dying star itself. In the process of extracting and transmitting the energy required to save themselves, they will be compounding the instability of the Sun and hastening the end of their worlds.<br/><br/>Sol: Last Days of a Star is a board game for one to five players where each player represents a different planetary effort to transmit as much energy from the Sun back to their Ark so they can to escape the solar system before the Sun explodes!<br/><br/>The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core). The deeper you take actions, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased. Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next.<br/><br/>You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever. With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!<br/><br/>",

Build a factory, and you'll receive more goods from it when other buildings are constructed in the right areas in relation to it; build a train station, and you may or may not score from it depending on what else you build; build a monument, and you'll merely collect a lot of points &mdash; and in the end, points are what matters.<br/><br/>In slightly more detail, to set up the game, lay out a ring of town figures at random, with two of them being removed from play each game. Whoever is farther behind in the circle around town takes the next turn, advancing to whichever town figure they want to visit. Most of them give you resources &mdash; brick, steel, or money &mdash; and you have a limit on how many resources of each type you can hold. Some figures have two random building plans at them, and if you visit one with the right resources, you can pay them, then build something. If you pay extra, you can then build something else, too!<br/><br/>The first building is placed anywhere in the midst of play, then each subsequent building is placed adjacent to something already built, with the buildings eventually filling in a 4x5 (or 5x4, determined as the game progresses) grid of the players' own creation. As soon as the twentieth building is erected, the game ends and players score points for what they built. Who has contributed more to the current state of Glasgow?<br/><br/>",

Defeating mobs earn players points in addition to granting additional awards. Game scoring occurs as the resource cube's layers are depleted.

In the first round, you choose one of the four biomes (forest, desert, mountains, or snowy tundra) and score for the largest connected area of this biome on your personal building board. The board comes pre-printed with biome spaces, and as you place buildings on this board, you can alter the biome of a space. In the second round, you choose one of three materials (wood, sand, stone, or obsidian) and score for the largest connected group of structures on your personal building board that are made of this material. In the third round, you score for the largest contiguous group of structures (decoration, dwelling, animal house, or bridge) of your choice on your board. After scoring in the third round, tally bonus points from the mobs you've collected.<br/><br/>",

Treetops are ablaze with countless colors &mdash; a living rainbow, from green to orange to red. Slowly the first leaves are starting to fall. Meanwhile, our steps and the diligent squirrels rustle the colorful foliage.<br/><br/>On our walks through the woods, we discover all kinds of little treasures; we collect berries, nuts, mushrooms and feathers. We pause for a moment to watch the shy inhabitants of the forest before we set off towards home once again. There, a good book and a hot tea are already awaiting.<br/><br/>Indian Summer is the second part of Uwe Rosenberg's puzzle trilogy following 2016's Cottage Garden, and this game is firmly geared towards experienced players. At the heart of the game are puzzle tiles with holes that are placed on individual forest boards to cover up treasures. When players get their hands on these, they gain more options and an edge over their opponents. All that counts in the end is to be the first to cover your forest floor completely with leaves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Havana you acquire victory points by constructing buildings, available as tiles displayed on the table. To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.<br/><br/>Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.<br/><br/>The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.<br/><br/>So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.<br/><br/>These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar. It's shorter and lighter than many similar games, as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Epic Railroad Building in North America<br/><br/>Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!<br/><br/>The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.<br/><br/>A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.<br/><br/>",

Chocolate Factory is a euro game of literal factory building and moving (using a pushable conveyer belt component) chocolates you must complete the largest number of chocolates required by retailers for the best value. The game also features wooden chocolate pieces and a movable conveyer belt making the physicality blended with euro mechanics a unique experience.<br/><br/>Gameplay overview:<br/>Players are each given a starting player board which will have two Factory parts which apply to a physical conveyer belt. The conveyer belt part of the player board contains long slot with an empty region in which to push square tiles along. The tiles will house the chocolate pieces players will manipulate throughout the game.<br/><br/>During the game players will initially draft new factory parts (to add to their player board) and specialists (one time use cards with special powers).<br/><br/>Then each player will &ldquo;push&rdquo; three times cocoa into their machines. During each &ldquo;push&rdquo; players will be able to use fuel and their factory parts to manipulate their Chocolate pieces. Careful consideration will be required for the spatial element of the game as Chocolate pieces can only be manipulated during a push by the Factory part that is adjacent to their tile.<br/><br/>Players score points by creating chocolates for public and personal objectives. The player with the most points at the end wins.<br/><br/>",

On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal, from retrieving a relic to slaying a large boss monster.<br/><br/>",

It is named after the year the New York Stock Exchange opened at 40 Wall Street in New York.<br/><br/>1817 differentiates itself from other 18xx games with its sophisticated financial mechanics that simulate the laissez faire capitalism of early America. While all the familiar mechanics of an 18xx game are present, such as placing tiles, purchasing tokens, and running trains, the game is won or lost based on the financial decisions you make.<br/><br/>1817 includes financial mechanics seen in other 18xx games such as mergers, friendly takeovers, and conversions to different share structures. Beyond these basics, 1817 introduces several additional financial mechanics such as short selling, market driven interest rates, hostile takeovers, and corporate liquidations. The most unique is selling stock short. Short selling is the practice of selling stock you don&rsquo;t own with the intention of buying the stock back at a later date. You hope to profit from a decline in the price of the stock between the sale and the repurchase. Conversely, you will incur a loss if the price of the stock increases before the repurchase. You are also liable for dividends paid while holding the short position.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;<br/><br/>The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).<br/><br/>Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.<br/><br/>In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson <a target='_blank' href=\"http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm</a> is included (in both English &amp; German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.  Earlier versions had a stand-up cardboard piece that you cut out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pixel Tactics is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.<br/><br/>In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.<br/><br/>Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.<br/><br/>Pixel Tactics takes place in the same world and uses many of the characters from Level 99 Games' BattleCON: War of Indines, but its game play is entirely unrelated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the dawn of the SMC age, the people were losing faith in an increasingly amoral society. Mother was developed to emulate human thought and emotion, to simulate human desires and aspirations, to better understand the rapid decline in morality. The citizens of Sapporo became the guinea-pigs for this technological experiment. A series of city-wide neural implant programs, dubbed &ldquo;the harvests&rdquo;, enabled the gathering of data directly from a person&rsquo;s cerebral cortex.<br/><br/>Mother&rsquo;s neural net became more and more empowered by the collective thoughts of a city of souls. She soon became her own master, not just reading the minds of her citizens, but controlling them. Mother was in charge and the people were now her automatons.<br/><br/>Only a few, the few who from fear, mistrust or in protest, avoided the harvests and remained untouched by Mother&rsquo;s influence. Like sewer rats they hide in an underground complex in Sapporo's Susukino district. While society at large became free from crime, free from poverty, free from emotion, without free-will or faith, from these few there came the criminals, the bootleggers, and the self-serving; the hungry, the frightened and the &ldquo;Renegades&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Renegade is an abstract-euro thematic deck-building game for 1 to 5 players. You are a new breed of Decker - a Renegade. You will hack into a network of five servers, operated by one of four Super-Massive-Computers (SMCs). Each of these four SMCs have their own AI and increasing complexity to defeat.  You must survive a series of Countermeasure events before the network becomes overrun by Sparks and Guardians. Once you are jacked into an SMC&rsquo;s servers, with a profile bringing its own special ability, you will move across its partitions and fight to take control of the network by using informational, destructive, deceptive and cognitive attacks.<br/><br/>Your Decker can seek upgrades (tools, software, apparel and information) by visiting the local bar, the &quot;Hack Shack&quot;. Once a fashionable hang-out for attractive young lovers seeking a voyeur's view of the city, it has now gone underground. An intimidating bar full of hit men and debt collectors, fixers and dealers, trading contraband from all across Sapporo, it's not the sort of place to take a date. This is where you will trade for new command cards, enhancing your Command Deck to become a more skillful Renegade.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Come aboard and sail to Pirate's Cove, the legendary hideaway of thieving pirates and cutthroat buccaneers. The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.<br/><br/>Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!<br/><br/>The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.<br/><br/>Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.<br/><br/>Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).<br/><br/>There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).<br/><br/>Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.<br/><br/>At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &quot;tall tales&quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &quot;pirate&quot; mechanic. In all, Pirate's Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Daren has always been a land mired in conflict &ndash; from the moment the Mortal Races met in its rolling hills, tall peaks and primeval forests, there was bound to be strife between its wary peoples. With the discovery of Magic, however, came the potential for dramatic change in the world &ndash; for good or evil. Centuries after the discovery of the Art, magic has shaped the fears and hopes of countless people, and the heroes and villains that wield it have decided the fate of nations over all these years. Yet for all this struggle, a tenuous balance remained between those who seek to strengthen all Mortal Races and those that seek to lord over them. Little do they know however that amidst the shadowed boughs of the Dead Irall, an ancient evil seeks to rule once again. Few are aware that the fate of the land now lies with brave heroes who are the only ones who can prevent the oncoming Age of Darkness.<br/><br/>Chronicles of Drunagor - Age of Darkness is a fully cooperative and strategy board game of tactical combat in a dungeon crawl adventure for one to five players. CoD-AoD is based on multiple 3D scenarios, each of them played separately or on a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique setup, darkness rules and different goals that will be needed to be achieved in order to obtain victory. Played over a series of rounds until either the chosen adventure objective is achieved by the heroes or a single hero dies or is corrupted by the darkness itself. The order of activation is dictated by the initiative track and it alternates between heroes, monsters and the darkness itself. Once they all activate, a round is over and a new one begins, so players win or lose as a team. The game is won when the adventure objectives are met. The game is lost when one player is either killed or corrupted by darkness.<br/><br/>On a hero&rsquo;s turn he can freely move up to 3 spaces (orthogonal and or diagonal are permitted) and spend 2 of his action cubes to trigger his abilities. If when passing his turn he no longer has any cubes on his available action cubes pool, he must perform a recall action. On a monster activation he will always move to attack the heroes. Or if he`s in range of his target he will attack without even move. Each monster has its own primary target located on his card at the initiative track. On the darkness activation, draw from the bag the number of darkness tokens dictated by the chosen adventure and follow the darkness rules for that adventure.<br/><br/>As you go by the different adventures, your heroes will find themselfs in a wide variety of scenarios and instead of only reading thru the descriptions of the place you are, the game will show you beautifull illustrations of what you can see and how you can interact with the scenario. Every choice on how you interact with certain things could possibly change the way your adventure continues. Maybe you will find a secret passage, or maybe you can find a locked chest, the choice is up to you.<br/><br/>Choose one of the heroes and take upon this quest to defeat the power of evil and the everlasting darkness from the land of Daren.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game. It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).<br/><br/>Yomi is the Japanese word for &ldquo;reading&rdquo;, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.<br/><br/>Champion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; right almost every time, no matter the game.<br/><br/>The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems &quot;just random,&quot; you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>     Yomi (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bios:Origins is the 3rd part of the Bios Trilogy. The action starts much earlier than most Civilization games: 200,000 years ago or even earlier. One to four players represent the human subspecies extant at that time: Sapiens, Neanderthal, Denisovans, &amp; Hobbits. Take them on an adventure to enlarge your brain, acquire language, discover new worlds, domesticate strange beasts (such as riding war kangaroos or mammoths), discover the wonders and terrors of religion, dive for pearls, challenge the gods, enslave rival hominins, and perhaps enter the Enlightenment. Although wars of conquest and religion are possible, most of the fighting will be internal. You have only limited control of over your ruling class, and if your priests are in control and do a poor job, they will get killed and usurped by merchants or warlords.<br/><br/>Win by specializing as cultural, political, or industrial civilization. This means, unlike most civilization games, that a cult figure on a mountaintop in New Zealand can win over an Emperor that has swept the globe with his armies.<br/><br/>The game integrates with Bios:Genesis and Bios:Megafauna, so that you can start as a variety of intelligent but not-quite lingual marine or terrestrial creatures.  Two maps and 26 hex chits are included, to accommodate variable landforms and cratons on habitable Earth, Mars, or Venus. Solitaire and cooperative variants are included.<br/><br/>",

For 2-4 players, ages 10 and up.<br/>    Calcory (only in the original 1995-1998 edition) - A memory and calculation game, where players push their luck to uncover the most cards. For 2-4 players, ages 7 and up.

Players reveal cards to declare their bids: the highest bidder becomes the Chief and the second highest bidder is the Vice.  Both the Vice and Chief choose a trump (either number or suit), and then players try to capture tricks to score the most points.  The Chief chooses a partner and tries to cover the bid to score bonus points, while the Vice and remaining players seek to stop the Chief from reaching his goal.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 60 cards in 5 different colored suits.  Each suit contains cards numbered from 0 to 9, with two of each the 1 and 7 cards.  Cards also have 0, 1, or 2 triangles printed on them to show the point value of that card.<br/><br/>Mü and Lots More includes a a tweaked version of M&uuml; and a different set of games.<br/><br/>2020 DiceTree Korean edition (titled The Last Panther + 6 games) includes Calcory and another new climbing card game 기드라(Ghydra) by Changhyun Baek.<br/><br/>",

Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODs, for short.  Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities.  These come into play via the use of Command cards, which add a new dimension to the game.  Now the battle is not just for the continents, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds.<br/><br/>Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk.  One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours.  Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy.  This energy is used to purchase command cards, bid for turn order, and hire new commanders.  There is much more strategy and planning involved in this new version, but it should still appeal to the classic Risk fans.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Risk<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player has their own small island paradise where they grow delicious fruit. To win, you must gain the most points by cleverly supplying ships and by adding the best businesses to your island.<br/><br/>Your turn in Juicy Fruits works like this: First, you slide one of your fruit collector tokens a number of unblocked spaces and collect that many fruits of the token's type: banana, orange, lime, pomegranate, or mangosteen. Then you may either fulfill the order of a ship on your shores or claim a business from a shared display and place it onto your island (or do nothing). Clever planning and timing is vital because until you supply the ships on your shores, they block valuable island space which could be used to collect more fruit &mdash; but if you concentrate too much on the ships, the most promising businesses may get snatched by your opponents. Also, the sooner businesses are claimed, the quicker the game might end.<br/><br/>With each play, Juicy Fruits poses new puzzles of how to move your tokens efficiently and how to balance clearing your island with claiming businesses. The game also includes an additional &quot;juice factory&quot; mode and four modes of solo play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue. A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.<br/><br/>Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &quot;how many fat monks do you have?&quot;.) Players may either take a &quot;vow of silence&quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &quot;Mass&quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.<br/><br/>",

The game covers over 100 years of classical history in just 9 hands of cards.<br/><br/>The interplay of each power&rsquo;s special strengths, of the strategy decks&rsquo; 152 event cards, and of up to four players&rsquo; diplomatic acumen provides unlimited variety.

        "description": "Rummikub is similar to several central European card games which are played with two decks of playing cards, including Machiavelli and Vatikan. Ephraim Hertzano invented the tile game Rummikub in the 1940s when card-playing was outlawed under the Communist regime. After World War II, Hertzano immigrated to British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) and developed the first sets with his family. Over the years, the Hertzano family licensed it to other countries and Rummikub became Israel's best-selling export game.<br/><br/>Hertzano's Official Rummikub Book, published in 1978, describes three different versions of the game: American, Sabra, and International. Modern Rummikub sets include only the Sabra version rules, with no mention of the others, and there are variations in the rules between publishers.<br/><br/>In Turkey, the game is known as Okey and is widely played by families at gatherings or at local cafes.<br/><br/>Like Rummy that you play with cards, you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind. The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits. This game may start rather uneventfully, but when the players start putting more and more tiles in play, the options for your upcoming turns can become more complex, challenging, and exciting (from areyougame.com).<br/><br/>",

True to the name of the German edition (a literal translation of which is &quot;Flying Sparks&quot;), it is time for Funkenschlag: Die ersten Funken, or &quot;The First Sparks&quot;.<br/><br/>The First Sparks transports the Funkenschlag mechanisms into the Stone Age. The order of phases during a game round, the player order, the technology cards: you know all these parts from &ldquo;Funkenschlag&rdquo;. But what is new? What is different?<br/><br/>The First Sparks is much faster and far more direct. You are immediately part of the action. Each turn, each decision is important. As a clan leader you decide on the well-being of your clan during the Stone Age. You need to develop new hunting technologies and get new knowledge - to successfully hunt food or to learn to control fire. With the help of these skills, you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas.<br/><br/>In a game of The First Sparks you are always confronted with many decisions: Which technology cards offer you the biggest advantages? When is the right time to spread your clan on the game board? Which hunting areas will grant the most food? Reaching new hunting areas or trying to secure parts of the game board for your own clan are important factors for your strategy. Empty spaces are cheaper for you to settle compared to spaces in which other clans are already settled. If you are the first to increase your clan size to 13 clan members, you win The First Sparks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Evermore have they walked the world of Iwari. Evermore have they embodied its spirit and shaped its lands. They are stewards of the earth. Five Titans that make the cosmos breath. On Iwari, there are no teeming masses, no continent-wide civilizations. Humanity is in its infancy, living in scattered tribes in forest, tundra, and desert.<br/><br/>Now we have left our ancestral homelands to explore the vast uncharted regions, encountering other fellow tribes and exchanging knowledge, culture and wisdom. In our journey, we all live in harmony with the Titans, and though distant to us, they decide our fate. And yet only we don't know if they created us, or we created them.<br/><br/>Iwari is an abstract-like Eurogame in which players represent different tribes looking for their identity by traveling around far lands and expanding their settlements into five different regions on the board. In the game, players use cards for two different actions:<br/><br/>1) Place tents and expand their settlements into five different regions on the board in a majority game that scores on each territory.<br/>2) Construct nature totems to bond with the Titans by placing them on regions and score points based on the totem majorities in adjacent territories.<br/><br/>During the game, players can complete missions that grant small perks and score points by having the majority of tents in each territory after the end of the first card cycle. At game end, the majority of tents will be scored again, along with the majorities of nature totems in two adjacent regions and settlements that players have created (i.e., four or more tents in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board).<br/><br/>Iwari reimagines the award-winning game Web of Power by Michael Schacht by adding new layers of strategy, tribe player boards, different maps with their own set of rules, modules that can be added to the game, and unique co-operative and solo modes.<br/><br/>",

Players compete to kill monsters and take their blood.<br/><br/>In general, Bloodborne is a game about risk management with a bit of group think, inventory management/upgrades, and tactical play. You start with a hand of basic weapons, which you get to upgrade to improve your fighting combos and capabilities.<br/><br/>Each turn, one monster chosen at random attacks players, who fight back as a team, with everyone playing a card from their hand simultaneously to attempt to kill the monster. Players collect blood from the monster, assuming it dies, based on how much damage they dealt. Monsters can fight back with exploding dice that can potentially deal infinite damage.<br/><br/>Players can fight as long as they want, but if they die in combat, they lose their progress. Players can opt out of fighting to bank their blood and save it permanently. Collected blood counts as victory points.<br/><br/>Says designer Eric M. Lang, &quot;My goal with Bloodborne was to channel the intensity and frustration of the video game into a contest between players. Lots of death.&quot;<br/><br/>",

His heroic tales and stirring lute-playing raises his friends' spirits, filling them with courage as they face the horrors of the deep dungeon. Fleck is always up for carousing, no matter the day or night. All the girls think he's so dreamy. <br/>    Gog the Half-Ogre: A hulking brute from the flinty mountains who unfortunately doesn't know his own strength.

Players then start asking each other questions &mdash; &quot;Why are you dressed so strangely?&quot; or &quot;When was the last time we got a payday?&quot; or anything else you can come up with &mdash; trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!<br/><br/>At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.  However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points.<br/><br/>After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!<br/><br/>Spyfall 2 features the same gameplay as Spyfall with two important changes: (1) Enough location cards are included that the upper player count is now twelve instead of eight, and (2) two spies can be found at each location, giving all of the non-spy players more of a challenge when it comes to tracking down who doesn't belong.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher: Android is a board game of murder and conspiracy set in a dystopian future. Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.<br/><br/>During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.<br/><br/>The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors. The player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Twenty years ago, the settlers started into the depths of the galaxy to discover unknown planets, the undiscovered universe lying before them. Maybe they'll find planets with good ore or carbon deposits &mdash; or perhaps only barren ice planets. They might encounter alien folks and start lucrative trading, with pirates and wormholes being a constant challenge for them.<br/><br/>Catan: Starfarers is a new version of Starfarers of Catan, originally released in 1999, that contains completely revised graphics and game materials, revised rules, and (most importantly) a variable game board that brings even more variety to the exploration of space.<br/><br/>Changes to the mechanics include<br/><br/>-If you are lower in the points you get cards on your turn regardless of what you roll. Two random cards initially, then one, then none as your victory points go up. This is a nice touch. No matter how unlucky you are you still get something. Plus if a player rolls a seven, the person can take a card from any other player, but their opponents now draw a random card from the deck.<br/><br/>- Market Trades: Since you have no roads you no longer need ports so, since you no longer have ports you can trade with the market for any resource on your turn; provided you have the right cards. Additionally the ratios aren't bad, Any resource for 3:1, i.e. three of one for one of any other type. Goods (a type of resource) trades for 2:1. This plus no road blocking allows you to trade for resources and keep playing.<br/><br/>- There are NPC races that can give you benefits, some of which are +1 resources whenever you get a resource of the same type. But you have to get there early. Now there is a new dynamic to the game, going out into space becomes a strategy on its own.<br/><br/>- Negotiated trades: Since the resources are more readily available there are less negotiated trades. They still exist and someone can still trade 1:1, 3:1, etc... but it is no longer a singularly driving force in the game. Unless you have a big move and you're missing that one card.<br/><br/>- Resource (set collection) becomes part of your strategy without being limited to negotiation and luck of the die. I think this actually works better.<br/><br/>Colonization: You colonize to claim planets in a system. This is the same as building towns in Catan. But how many can be in a system (hex) depends on player count. In a three player game you're only allowed two colonies per system. In a four player game each system only holds up to three players colonies.  If you got blocked out early from the closest systems, reach further into the stars to other systems. Who knows you might meet pirate and you'll have to fight, or traders, perhaps a race of Travelers who will open a worm hole to anywhere on the map.<br/><br/>",

Colors, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, purple and red; oval, diamond and squiggle; and solid, shaded and outlined.<br/><br/>All players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck. A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.<br/><br/>To play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up. The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so. After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards. (If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards. These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.) Whoever claims the most sets wins!<br/><br/>",

This is their story.<br/><br/>Fireteam Zero is a cooperative game for up to four players who must cut a path through an endless swarm of deadly monsters in order to discover and defeat the ultimate evil behind them. Each player possesses a set of brutal combat skills that are represented by a deck of cards unique to that character. Play cards to devastate the creatures in your way, help your teammates survive the onslaught, or even reshape the tactical landscape with the proper application of explosive ordinance. The battle is fought across three maps of increasing difficulty, each one bringing more and tougher enemies than the last. Players must search for and complete mission objectives in order to progress and bring them one step closer to the final showdown.<br/><br/>Aiding them are two NPC Specialists, one with an uncanny ability to sense the location and nature of the supernatural energy in the area and another with an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcane. Use the Specialists wisely or risk failure no matter how many monsters you defeat.<br/><br/>Race against time as the creatures on the board become stronger and more cunning. The longer you take to complete your objectives, the more Monster Twist cards are revealed, each granting a new and terrible aspect to your enemy. In each set of missions you will face a different family of horrifying creatures, each with their own special abilities and twist cards.<br/><br/>Players must not only fight for their lives, but at the same time they must make smart tactical choices with their teammates in order to make the best use of a limited resource, the cards in their hands. Each card not only represents an action that they can take, but also their health. Spending too many cards can leave you vulnerable, while spending too few can result in being overwhelmed. Clever players will rely on each other to succeed.<br/><br/>Fireteam Zero is a story-rich board game of squad tactics and horror. Each map can be played separately in about 45 minutes or together to complete an entire Operation in about three hours.<br/><br/>Expansions:<br/><br/>1) The Africa Cycle:<br/><br/>Go head to head against the Thornspawn in this expansion!<br/><br/>New Miniatures!

        "description": "In Mountain Goats you work to move your goats to the top of 6 different mountains where they can score points as long as they stay there. You can share spaces with other goats on the way up, but there is only room for one goat at the top of each mountain. If someone else's goat moves to the mountain top, they will kick you off and you'll have to start your trek over.<br/><br/>It's a game about timing. You need to not just get to the top of the mountain, but get there when no one else is in position to knock you off.<br/><br/>It's a game about keeping your eye on your opponents. Maximizing your score, but also making sure you don't let anyone else score too much.<br/><br/>There is the fun chance to knock each other off the mountain. But it doesn't feel too mean because you can only knock back goats that are in a scoring position, and it isn't a huge setback. It is just a normal part of the cycle of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>In Level X, each player has six playing pieces that they try to place at the end of the movement tracks on the game board in order to score victory points (VPs). The tracks are labeled 5-10, and they are 2-4 spaces long.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll four six-sided dice, then place them into groups of 1-4 dice with each group ideally totaling from 5 to 10. If you make such a group, you can either place one of your playing pieces on the first space of the track matching that number or advance your playing piece on that track until you reach the final space: the X. Whenever you first land on an X, you take a VP token worth a number of points equal to that track's number. If you are already on an X and roll that number again, you take another token. Only one playing piece can be on an X; if someone else lands on an X that you occupy, you remove your playing piece from the board and can start down that track again later.<br/><br/>If you collect one token of each value (5-10), you take a bonus card, with the first being worth 15 VPs and the others worth 12, 9 and 6. When all the bonus cards have been claimed or three of the VP token stacks are empty, the game ends. Whoever has scored the most points wins!<br/><br/>Part of the Schmidt Spiele Easy Play line.<br/><br/>",

There are 3 building districts, 1 temple district, and 1 port district.<br/><br/>Each turn, your worker will activate one of these districts. When activating a district, you must first take a die from the district.

But you will also exert your influence in the temple district in order to earn the king's favor. In the port district you can obtain ships with important abilities and for scoring victory points.<br/><br/>You must spend your actions wisely and always make sure that you keep an eye on the general timing of the game.

        "description": "Accuse and defend your fellow townsfolk as you hunt down the witches of Salem. Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.<br/><br/>The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &quot;Salem&quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.<br/><br/>The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.<br/><br/>Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.<br/><br/>Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &quot;Witch&quot; or &quot;Not a Witch.&quot;<br/><br/>During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &quot;Witch&quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.<br/><br/>Players can also use green and blue cards such as &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Asylum&quot;, and &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.<br/><br/>As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &quot;Night&quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate and the Constable chooses someone to potentially save. The other black card, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &quot;Conspiracy&quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.<br/><br/>Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &quot;She's a WITCH!&quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.<br/><br/>Volume 1 in the Dark Cities Series by Facade Games.<br/><br/>",

With Olympos, coming from French publisher Ystari Games, Keyaerts has another go at the simplified civilization game. The playing time for Olympos is only 60-90 minutes for 2-5 players, but says Ystari's Cyril Demaegd, &quot;Even if it's a short game, it's a gamer's game.&quot;<br/><br/>Players take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes. (Says Demaegd, &quot;This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago.&quot;) By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development. Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, which depicts Greece and Atlantis, which lets you conquer territories and thereby acquire resources.<br/><br/>Development takes place on the game's discovery board, with players either buying new scientific discoveries &ndash; such as medicine or phalanxes &ndash; or building architectural wonders. Each discovery brings you new powers, such as an upgrade in military strength due to the phalanx, and each wonder earns you points.<br/><br/>A player's piety is measured by discoveries, and the most pious player might be rewarded during the game by one of the nine gods included. Similarly, the less pious players might be punished by those same gods.<br/><br/>The replayability of Olympos is huge, says Demaegd, as the discovery board and gods in play will be different each game, not to mention the territories you're able to conquer.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls one of four unique characters as they journey into the heart of the fallen city of Sanctum, building up their skills and arsenals along the way to prepare for the final fight against the Demon Lord.<br/><br/>Multiple players may survive the fight, but only one may claim the glory of purifying Sanctum.  Gameplay is brisk, with the possibility for overlapping turns. The four characters all have unique skill sets, and you&rsquo;ll level up fast, giving you frequent opportunities to choose new skills. Every decision counts.<br/><br/>Though the game is competitive, the goal is to destroy the Demon Lord, not each other. So player interaction is a race rather than a fight: Who&rsquo;s furthest along the board? Who will get to choose first when an equipment draft gets triggered? Who will gain the benefit of reaching the Demon Lord first? Who will get to that group of blue demons everyone wants? Who will unlock that achievement and claim the bonus?<br/><br/>On your turn, you choose one action:<br/><br/>1) Move: Advance along the path toward the Demon Lord, and engage some demon minions to fight later.<br/>    2) Fight: Fight all the demon minions you&rsquo;ve engaged. If you kill any demons, upgrade Skills and acquire Items. <br/>    3) Rest: Equip some of the loot you&rsquo;ve won, recharge the resources you use to fight, and buy potions with extra Items you don't need.<br/><br/>The final battle with the Demon Lord is tough. Even surviving can feel rewarding. But only the player with the most health at the end of the boss fight can truly claim the glory of his defeat!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Navajo Wars is a solitaire card driven game which places the player into the role of the Din&eacute; (Navajo) from the time of the Spanish incursion in 1595 through the time of their subjugation at the hands of an American Army led by Kit Carson in 1864.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Din&eacute;&rdquo; (pronounced 'dih-nay') is the word the Navajo use to refer to their tribe. It means &ldquo;the people.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The term, &ldquo;Navajo&rdquo;  comes from a Spanish rendering of a Tewa (one of the Pueblo tribes) word for &ldquo;planted fields.&rdquo; The Din&eacute; were and are still known for their planting of corn in the high desert of New Mexico and Arizona.<br/><br/>The objective for the Navajo player, hereinafter referred to as &quot;player&quot;, is to avoid being subjugated by either the Spanish, Mexicans or the Americans, hereinafter referred to as &quot;enemy&quot;.  The player will be taking actions during the course of the game to try and increase both culture and military tracks.  If both of those reach zero at any time during the game, you will be subjugated by the enemy and immediately lose the game. There are also cultural developments, in the form of a tech tree, that the player will have to develop to increase his chances of winning.  The developments are; weaving, horsemanship, religion, masters of the Mesas and sharp trades each having three levels of development. Navajo Wars also has historical event cards for each period. These cards have their own rules and effects that really add a historical feel to the game.<br/><br/>As the player, you will be trying to get your family units, &quot;counter&quot; on the map.  Your family units could consist of a man, woman and child. With those counters you will be conducting individual actions with your families that are on the map. These actions could include, raids on New Mexico, raids on an outpost, tribal warfare &amp; tribal diplomacy both conducted against the Comanche or the Ute. Create trade goods, husbandry and travel.<br/><br/>During the enemy portion of the turn, the enemy will be conducting operations against the Navajo tribe. These operations could include: to subvert the natives (player), build outpost, build and subvert, raids (the enemy will try to send raids deep into the Navajo territory) and many other actions.<br/><br/>The enemy receives their orders by a unique order matrix.  As the player, you are never sure what will be coming next.<br/><br/>Navajo Wars can be played as individual scenarios for the Spanish, Mexican and American periods.  You can play all three periods as a campaign game.<br/><br/>",

The time has come to cement your name in the History of Art. To achieve all of this, you must construct magnificent buildings, create, sell and exhibit works of art, and shake hands with the city's noblemen.<br/><br/>Bruxelles 1897 is a card game based on the Bruxelles 1893 board game.<br/><br/>Bruxelles 1897 will speak to a large audience of gamers. Its mechanics are based on Bruxelles 1893 and are made simpler without compromising depth. Those who know the board game Bruxelles 1893 will rediscover its familiar look and feel in Bruxelles 1897.<br/><br/>A game of Bruxelles 1897 is played over 4 rounds. A round consists of a variable number of turns. In this version, the different actions are represented by Action cards which are aligned in 4 columns.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has 5 Architect cards in hand. These cards have different values on them, ranging from 1 to 5, and you'll use them to perform actions in the Art Nouveau and Brussels areas.<br/><br/>To perform an action in the Art Nouveau area, you must replace one Action card by one of your Architect cards and pay the latter's value. Actions in the Brussels area are free but they require an increasing number of Architect cards to activate, and you risk one of them being sent to prison. The different actions score you victory points throughout the game or help you to advance on the different tracks. These tracks also score you points at the end of the game, depending on the strategies you choose to adopt.<br/><br/>When all players have passed, the round ends. Now, the different majorities are calculated. At the end of the round, the position of the Architect cards in the Art Nouveau area determines the majorities, which in turn grant bonuses and/or victory points.<br/><br/>At the end of the fourth round there is a final scoring phase. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>Bruxelles 1897 : a game by Geek Attitude Games.<br/><br/>The boardgame Bruxelles 1893 was published by Pearl Games in 2013.<br/>In 2014, Geek Attitude Games was founded by Etienne Espreman (the designer of Bruxelles 1893), Fr&eacute;deric Delporte and Fabrice B&eacute;ghin.<br/>Earlier this year, Etienne reclaimed the rights to his game. Bruxelles 1897 will therefore be published by Geek Attitude Games.<br/>Scheduled release for The Spiel in Essen (Octobre 2019).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Set in the Roman stadium Circus Maximus, in Ave Caesar, players use cards to move their chariots around a quasi-variable track. The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.<br/><br/>The Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.<br/><br/>It was re-released in 2022 by DiceTree Games with deluxe components, new maps, and new variants (by the designer).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Aquaretto, the players are managing the planning and selection of animals for their water themed zoo, in the hope of acquiring the most victory points. The players can expand the size of their water park and victory points can be earned in a number of ways. The most common way is to collect a large number of animals to your park in a variety of species.<br/><br/>The core of the game play is the decision to select another random animal from the draw bag to add to one of the transport trucks or to take a truck in play. Taking a truck requires a player to add the animals on their selected truck to their water zoo.<br/><br/>The catch is that animals need their space and thus different species cannot be placed adjacent to one another, there needs to be a separation. This then leads back to how the players decide to place animals on the trucks as they are drawn. A player cannot afford to create a truck in which one player gets all the animals their park needs, so the aim is to place animals in such a way that a player gets something they want but also take some pain as well.<br/><br/>Aquaretto is a cousin to Zooloretto so there are other cute factors such as allowing animals to breed if a male and a female of a species are acquired, which allows the placement of a baby. There are also coin options that allow a player to do a range of things.<br/><br/>Aquaretto can be played as a stand alone game or used in conjunction with Zooloretto for a mega-game of sorts.<br/><br/>It should be noted that Aquaretto is a slightly more involved experience than Zooloretto, with some more involved options, such as scoring bonuses for acquiring workers that interact with how many fish symbols a player has in their water park.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's Einfach Genial/Ingenious in a 2-player travel version.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex board. 57 equally sized pieces, each consisting of two joined hexes come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that makes up the piece (sometimes identical symbols). The pieces are drawn randomly in the game. Each player receives six pieces to start the game, which are placed onto a rack and visible to them alone.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colours. Points are claimed by placing a piece into any open space such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol. So, for example, if a player places a piece with a purple circle on it such that it sits next to an unbroken line of four other purple circles already on the board, then the player scores four purple points. A newly placed symbol can lie next to at most five individual rows of symbols.<br/><br/>Each player uses a scoring track to keep track of his points &ndash; one track for each colour going from 0 to 18. If a player reaches the 18th space with any colour, then he gets to call out &ldquo;Genial!&rdquo; and take another turn.<br/><br/>At the end of their turn, players draw as many tiles out of the bag as required to bring their rack back up to six.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more tiles can be placed onto the board. Now each player looks to see how many points they scored in the colour they scored the least in. Whoever has the most points in their least-scored colour is the winner.<br/><br/>In the full game, there are 5 of each double and 6 of each pair of colors, the travel edition has 2 of each double and 3 of each pair.<br/><br/>Einfach Genial - Reiseedition is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From GMT's website:<br/><br/>Volume VIII in GMT&rsquo;s COIN Series transports us into the 4th and 5th Centuries A.D. and to the embattled Isle of Britannia.  Pendragon &ndash; The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic. This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain.<br/><br/>Pendragon leverages the tremendous flexibility of the COIN system, from dual events to dissimilar approaches and victory conditions, to capture the complexity of the period and let the players explore alternative narratives. Unlike earlier volumes, Pendragon is not about counterinsurgency per se, but focuses on the asymmetrical clashes between and among Romano-British authorities and Barbarian powers gnashing over the carcass of the Roman Empire, including:<br/><br/>Barbarian Raiders plundering the land and trying to surprise unwary towns and hillforts, then melting into hills or fens.<br/>Expansion or decline of the Saxon Shore naval defense system to counter sea-borne raiders.<br/>Authentic Late-Roman military doctrine&mdash;mighty but hard-to-replace cavalry tracking down raiding parties before they can return their booty home.<br/>Accessible, powerful but fickle Foederati: barbarian warbands in Briton employ.<br/>Nuanced battle system representing troop qualities and tactics.<br/>Fortified strongholds that must be assaulted, besieged, or rebuilt to gain regional political control.<br/>Civil wars, coups, religious shifts, and cultural assimilation.<br/>Population movements over the generations, due to good administration, barbarian ravages, or climatic changes.<br/>Epochal Events ranging from Roman usurpations on the continent to massive reprisals against barbarian homelands.<br/>Evolution of rules and victory conditions throughout the game, as the still vivacious Roman Empire may or may not end with Britain fragmented among competing semi-barbarian proto-kingdoms.<br/>A deck of 83 cards with gorgeous commissioned original art.<br/>Short, medium, and full-length scenarios<br/>Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player and 4-player experiences.<br/><br/>Each faction in Pendragon brings specific capabilities and challenges:<br/><br/>The Dux represent the original Roman Army in Britannia: with the most powerful units in the game and a network of strong fortresses ringing the island and tied by efficient roads, you must strive to preserve the stability and prosperity of the provinces and punish any interloper daring to challenge the peace. If you can build up your prestige and maintain order, you may be able to keep the island in the Empire, or at least united in a new post-Roman power. You can rely on the civilian militia to assist you, but&mdash;as your peerless cavalry dwindles&mdash;you must resort to the traditional Roman offer to barbarians of land for service in your forces as Foederati. As the decay of institutions conspires with the scheming of feckless civilians and the marauding of restless barbarians, you may find that the dream of Empire is dead. If so, with your once proud Army little more than another group of warlords, you still can strive to carve for yourself the most powerful kingdom alongside your new rivals.<br/><br/>The Civitates represent the Romanized aristocracy ruling the ancient Celtic tribes from lavish villas and prosperous Roman towns, chafing under the distant authority (and taxes) of Rome, mistrusting the uncultured and semi-Barbarian army, and yearning to settle century-old accounts with their neighbors. When the Barbarian storm comes down upon your island, you may find yourself woefully unprepared to cope&mdash;materially or culturally&mdash;and presented with a fundamental choice: strive to protect your lands, wealth, and way of life via the despised Army and untrustworthy Foederati, or sacrifice Roman comforts to face down the Barbarian challenge militarily and culturally through a return to Celtic traditions.<br/><br/>The Saxons represent various Germanic groups including Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Franks who harried, settled, and eventually took over swaths of Britain. As outsiders, you face a steep challenge just to come ashore against the might of the Roman army and navy. You will chip away at the Saxon Shore system, ravage the provincial economy to weaken the Britons&rsquo; capability to wage war, and see  some of your best warriors serve as Foederati (often against yourself), but recognize  that the more Saxons living on the island&mdash;whoever their paymaster&mdash;the more opportunities for advancing your nation. Eventually, you must secure footholds, perhaps in the marshy fens of the eastern seaboard that so resemble your homelands, in order to wield your considerable military potential and challenge the old masters of these rich lands to create England.<br/><br/>The Scotti, named for the marauding groups of Irish raiders, also represent those Celts native to the island of Britain who differed from the romanized Civitates by remaining true (or reverting back) to the old ways. Often, the boundary between the two groups was porous... The biggest such group eventually formed the northern nation of the Picts, forebears of modern Scotland. As the Scotti, you see the disintegration of Roman Britain as an opportunity not so much to expand as to seize riches and renown to assert yourself at home. Raid ceaselessly, surprise and plunder poorly protected communities, kidnap for ransom, and show your military prowess against your unfortunate neighbors across the Irish Sea and Forth-Clyde isthmus&hellip; Then establish bases strategically along the enemy shores and entreat local hill tribes to reject post-Roman authority. But beware that your very advances will help give rise and limit your ability to grapple new powerhouses on the island!<br/><br/>Components: See Wiki below.<br/>Players: 1-4 (includes full solitaire system)<br/>Map: Area Movement<br/>Timescale: about 15 years per campaign between Epoch cards<br/>Designer: Marc Gouyon-Rety<br/>Developer and Series Creator: Volko Ruhnke<br/><br/>",

Growing city-states pledge to end the reign of terror, determined to take on the titans and make the world a safer place for all. Each city-state competes to attract the tribes, eager for the strength of the combined peoples, who are now leaving behind old traditions with the hope that the titans can be defeated once and for all.<br/><br/>In The Ancient World, players compete to grow the largest and most influential city-state by managing citizens, treasury, and military and by defeating titans. Players take turns sending citizens to take special actions or using military cards to attack titans. One of the actions a citizen can perform is to build Empire cards, which give more citizens, money, and abilities.<br/><br/>A city-state's influence in the world is measured by sets of tribe banners that it owns. Each Empire card has one or more tribe banners, and tribe banners can also be gained by defeating titans. Players gain victory points (VPs) for sets of tribe banners. After six rounds, the player with the most VPs from sets of tribe banners wins.<br/><br/>The second edition features:<br/><br/>- Numbered, limited edition boxes<br/>- Designer's signature printed in metallic ink<br/>- Revised and new titans<br/>- Larger, revised player boards<br/>- Expanded game play, including a new resource: AMBROSIA<br/>- Titans now attack YOU!<br/>- Updated district and empire cards<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Explore places, combine items, and experience stories in Adventure Games, a series of co-operative games from German publisher KOSMOS. In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play. Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story. Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!<br/><br/>Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.<br/><br/>In The Dungeon, the players awaken in a prison cell in the middle ages with no memory of how they got there. What happened? What strange things are taking place in this dungeon? And most importantly, how can they get out? Over three chapters, players will jointly explore rooms, combine objects, and perhaps even encounter creatures that lurk in the dark rooms of the old castle...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Taken from Boardgame News:<br/><br/>Oregon is a family/strategy game with a colonization-theme and a card-driven placement mechanism. The aim of the game is to position farmers and point-giving buildings in the best possible locations on the board.<br/><br/>The year is 1846. Gunslingers, lawmen, pioneers, and whole families left their homes in the east and midwest to try their luck in the West. They loaded their covered wagons with all they could and headed west across steppes, deserts, and mountains. Many chose to settle in Oregon, where the farming and hunting were plentiful, and they could stake out a bit of land for themselves. The players have already reached Oregon and gaze upon the rich farmland below and the potential gold and coal reserves of the mountains. They build ports on the lakes and rivers, churches, warehouses, post offices, and train stations on the plains. And, of course, they must farm the rich land to grow the food necessary for the area to grow and thrive. To win, a player must choose the right times to farm and the right times to build, for planning is necessary, even here in the untamed wilderness of Oregon! Oregon - the way the west was won...<br/><br/>",

Guide one of the five human factions in its exploration of the galaxy, while exploiting resources, terraforming planets and creating advanced space colonies. You may even find artifacts of a long-lost alien civilization and use them to your advantage.<br/><br/>A game round consists of three phases: planning phase, action phase and end of round. During the planning phase, action cards are placed face-down on any empty space of a shared planning board. When all spaces on the board have been filled, the action phase begins. In sequence, each card is revealed and all players may carry out the corresponding action. At the end of round, the action cards are returned to the players' hands and a new round begins.<br/><br/>The available actions are:<br/><br/>    Production: one of the resources depicted on the card is generated on every matching planet.<br/>    Movement: starships may be moved to other planets by spending energy.<br/>    Build: colonies, factories, starships and terraformers may be built on the planets by using resource cards.<br/>    Trade: resource cards may be traded among the players and the bank.<br/>    Scoring: the players are scored based on one of the game elements depicted on the card.<br/><br/><br/>The owner of each card has an advantage when resolving it, such as deciding which resource is generated or on which game element the players score.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player reaches at least 50 victory points or when all planets have been discovered. At that point, the player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Although this achievement elevated a certain mammal species to notoriety, in your game things may occur differently.<br/><br/>This second edition of Bios: Megafauna is an evolutionary descendant of American Megafauna but as a part of the Bios series of games it is linked to the game Bios: Genesis. It plays well independently but if you have both games you can let the end state of a game of Bios: Genesis affect the starting state of a game of Bios:Megafauna.  A successor game, called Bios:Origins (which would be a descendant of Origin), is planned to cover the events of the Quaternary period including the rise of ideas and technology.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The twist is that you must move the tower of the color matching the space on which the opponent moved on her previous turn. As the game progresses, you'll find that the routes you want to use are blocked by enemy towers &mdash; and sometimes your own! If you can't move, your opponent moves again immediately, moving the tower matching the color of the space occupied by the stymied tower.<br/><br/>As the game unfolds, your towers will be promoted to &quot;Sumos&quot; and have the ability to push your opponent's pieces backwards, earning you extra turns. The situations continue to become more complex and challenging, until one player accumulates the required winning total and can be declared a &quot;Kamisado Grand Master&quot; &mdash; until the next game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.&uml;<br/>- H.P. Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game, a world based on the weird fiction of H.P. Lovecraft and his literary circle. In this world, conflicts rage between cosmic powers who want the world for their own unfathomable purposes and the human agencies dedicated to stopping them.<br/><br/>The weird world of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos has drawn in fans for more than eighty years, with its richly painted themes of suspense, adventure, and the eerie unknown. Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game is fully immersed in this world and what is more, places you, as a player, in control of some of the facets of that world.<br/><br/>A typical game of Call of Cthulhu plays very quickly between two players and it has a high-level of player interaction, analysis of open information, planning and strategy. There is a wide variety of possible combinations of factions (Syndicate with Agency, Cthulhu with Hastur, etc.) and each combination will necessitate a different, challenging approach, providing high levels of re-playability.<br/><br/>One of the major appeals of the Living Card Game&reg; format is that it gives you not only a solid game experience, full of strategy and excitement, but it also allows you to customize your gaming experience to your liking. As you customize your deck from the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game card pool, you get to build a strategy around your personal play style.<br/><br/>This game was originally a CCG, having been transitioned to Fantasy Flight Games' new Living Card Game (LCG) format. Monthly Asylum Pack expansions to the card pool were eventually supplanted by larger quarterly(-ish) expansion boxes.<br/><br/>FFG ended development and organized play support for the game in 2015. &quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons, even death may die.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jerusalem, spring 33 AD: A crowd gathers at the city gates to welcome Jesus of Nazareth as he prepares to celebrate the Passover seder with his apostles and followers. With a revolutionary message, he has garnered supporters everywhere but also looks of suspicion among religious authorities. The Last Supper will soon be celebrated, and the fate of one of the most influential characters in human history will be sealed.<br/><br/>In Ierusalem: Anno Domini, we represent one of the communities of followers of Jesus of Nazareth who, coming to Jerusalem from nearby towns and villages, want to approach the place of the Last Supper and position ourselves as close as possible to the seats of Jesus and his apostles. The closer we are, the more points we earn at game's end. We also score for offering tokens and parable tiles we've accumulated.<br/><br/>Different locations are shown on the board: the market, the desert, the mountain, the lake, and the temple. After sending our followers to one of these locations, we obtain stones, bread, and fish, as well as denarii or cards that allow us to do more than one action. Among these actions, players can choose between listening to a parable, going to the table, changing seats, or doing a favor, among other things. All this happens while the patience of the Sanhedrin runs out. When this happens, as symbolized by a tile moving in a marker, the endgame is triggered.<br/><br/>However, the main element of the game is the cards. Each card has a symbol corresponding to one of five key locations in the game. As we play them, we form combinations that allow us to bring the apostles to the table of the Last Supper. The optimal placement of our followers around Jesus and the apostles will also be done through the management of letters, as well as various resources at our disposal.<br/><br/>Behind a very immersive theme, Ierusalem: Anno Domini will not disappoint lovers of good challenges. Players have a wide range of possibilities at their fingertips and multiple ways to earn points. Preparing the best strategies to get the most out of your followers will be one of the keys to victory. Devout gamers don't need to look further: Here is your game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various rail companies located on an map of eastern Canada. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Players buy and sell stock in various share companies, whose actions are controlled by the majority stockholder. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game.<br/><br/>This game features the formation of the Canadian Government Railroad, and government loans as well as major obstacles for railroad growth. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player goes bankrupt, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.<br/><br/>",

Soon the precious discoveries will make their way abroad to public exhibitions before a waiting audience, eliciting substantial honor and glory.<br/><br/>The players attempt to gain federal research grants to cover the costs of their excavations through a bidding mechanism. Whoever is modest and less demanding can travel to the excavating areas before his or her competitors, and the rule is first come, first dig. Only fragments will remain for the later expeditions. Recovered treasures are placed in valuable exhibitions, for which the discoverer receives glory and recognition.<br/><br/>The player who accumulates the most glory after 12 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>The combination of soliciting funds and racing for the best locations to excavate makes Pergamon a variable game with rules that are easily accessible. Players are forced to make choices based on the money they can obtain and the sequence in which they choose where to dig.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Walnut Grove borrows ideas from jigsaw puzzles and worker placement games, as players add tiles to their farm, and perform actions in the city. Each player manages their farm over 8 years, expanding their plots each spring, harvesting each summer, doing business in the city each fall, and hunkering down each winter. Each worker must be fed, and provided with heat.<br/><br/><br/>Walnut Grove could be described as drawing inspiration from Carcassonne (tile laying) and Agricola (running a farm). The goal of the game is to build and run own farm, to score points at the end of the game. Players can improve their farm during the game by adding new land tiles to it, hiring more workers, building improvements, etc<br/><br/>The game play is divided into eight years, and each year is divided into Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter phases. During Spring, players add 1 or 2 land tiles to their farm. During Summer, players position their workers in their fields to gather resources. When Autumn comes, all players get to visit the city. Finally, during the Winter phase, players need to feed their workers and heat their homes.<br/><br/>When placing tiles, their sides do not need to match. But you generally want them to, because each land area will produce resources based on its size, when you send a worker there.<br/><br/>In the city you can hire more workers, sell goods to gain coins, build improvements, and so on. Each player may do only one action in the city each year. The city is a kind of rondel that is divided into halves; each time you cross the midline you have to pay a coin. Therefore it is wise to move as slowly as possible on the rondel, but then again, you have consider what actions you want to take! This part of the game is worker placement with a single worker, since you can only move to a vacant space.<br/><br/>Spring, Summer and Winter phases can be done simultaneously, providing fast game play. This is a very tight game, with limited actions and scarce resources. Solo rules are included.<br/><br/>",

These ships act as action spaces that players use to gather resources, explore the nearby planets, and build their stations. Turns are fast and straightforward; either take ship action or take income.<br/><br/>Many games start players off with a small resource engine which they build up to a bigger one. In Space Station Phoenix, players start with the best production engine they will ever have and proceed to break it down part by part. As the game progresses, their actions get more efficient, but the number of ways to take those actions starts to diminish.<br/><br/>Space Station Phoenix also features deep re-playability with millions of possible starting positions and station parts combinations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs.<br/><br/>The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a &quot;Law&quot; category, where you complete the law given on the card. Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a &quot;Date&quot; category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance.  The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law.<br/><br/>Absolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).  Now, the vanilla version of Balderdash is the five-category edition with Laws instead of Dates.  Balderdash with a single category (word definitions) has not existed since at least 2003.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Kokkelimonke Jubileum<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Balderdash<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "You open your eyes to discover the most horrible truth of a lifetime... It has just come to an end and you are a ghost, floating in the air! Terrified, you look at your own body. A group of strange individuals have gathered around your mortal remains, watching it closely with sparks of fascination in their eyes. They want to communicate with you to discover how your life ended. You need to talk to them and reveal the truth so the culprit can be judged!<br/><br/>Paranormal Detectives  is a deduction party game. One player takes the role of a Ghost. All other players work as Paranormal Detectives and need to discover how the victim died. Using paranormal abilities they will communicate with the Ghost, asking open questions about the details of the crime. The Ghost answers in a variety of ghostly ways - by arranging a hangman&rsquo;s knot, playing chosen tarot cards, creating a word puzzle on a talking board, drawing by holding the hand of a detective and many more!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the Ghost player receives a story card with a full description of the murder. Each card depicts all the details of the case. Each Detective receives asymmetrical, pre-constructed set of interaction cards, player investigation sheet, and a player screen.<br/><br/>On their turn, each Detective asks the Ghost any open question they want and plays a single interaction card. The card implies the way the Ghost may answer the question. There are 9 different interactions total, most of them giving information to all Detectives. Since Detectives may ask any open questions and interaction cards vary, the game allows for lots of creativity for both the Ghost and Paranormal Detectives.<br/><br/>Detectives may try, twice during the game, to guess what has actually happened to the victim stating who was the killer, where did it happen, what was the motive, how was it done and what was the murder weapon. Then the Ghost writes down secretly on this Detective&rsquo;s investigation sheet how many of their answers are correct.<br/><br/>The game can end in two ways: <br/><br/>     If a Detective gives all correct answers. In this case, they win, together with the Ghost player.<br/>     If all Detectives run out of interaction cards. In this case, if no one has guessed everything correctly then, whoever guessed correctly the most information is the sole winner of the game!<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the near future, nanofacturing techniques will allow incredible new materials to be built atom by atom. But they can only be built in the zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions in space. Various private and government enterprises race to establish a buckytube mechanosynthesis factory on a suitable carbonaceous asteroid. To do so, they accumulate tanks of water in orbiting fuel depots, to be used as rocket propellant. Also needed are remote-controlled robonauts to do the grunt work.<br/><br/>The key to success is water in LEO (low Earth orbit). At first, water will be expensively supported out of the deep gravity well of Earth. But for a third the fuel and energy, water can be supplied from Luna, the moons of Mars, or other nearby hydrated objects.  Extracting resources at the work site is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Whoever develops ISRU technology able to glean water from space rather than Earth will gain the strategic high ground to make money through exoglobalization.<br/><br/>In High Frontier, players are Earth governments which are racing to put together a functioning space program to extract resources and colonize the other planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system.  Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics.  Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts.  Victory points are awarded for successful mineral extractions, and for being the first to reach key technologies and exploration points in the solar system.<br/><br/>Now in its second edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories. It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).<br/><br/>The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.<br/><br/><br/>     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)<br/><br/><br/>The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.<br/><br/>Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.<br/><br/>For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.<br/><br/>The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail. Includes 520 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game that is often described as a semi-sequel to Civilization.<br/><br/>Players attempt to build up their cultures during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras. Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time.<br/><br/>The main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts. This time particular payouts are triggered by card play for every player at once. An ingenious and very smooth working &ldquo;combat&rdquo; system is implemented to determine province &ndash; and thus resource - control.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website :)<br/><br/>Normandy '44 is a 2, 3, or 4-player, regimental level game of the D-Day landings on June 6th and the battles that raged in Normandy for the next 21 days. During this crucial period the Germans had their only chance to push back the Allied invasion before the preponderance of Allied men and material made the outcome certain. During this period, the U.S. 1st Army fought across the Cotentin Peninsula and captured the major port of Cherbourg while British forces took on the bulk of of the German panzer divisions near Caen.<br/><br/>The game uses a simplified Ardennes '44 system: Move, Fight and Reserve Movement. All non-tank battalion units are rated for Troop Quality, while all armor units have a Tank Rating. In each battle these ratings are used to provide shifts for either the attacker or defender. Other important shifts are provided by air power, naval support, artillery and/or Tiger tanks.<br/><br/>The game includes a 22 turn Campaign game, a 7-turn Tournament Scenario that focuses on the Allies linking up the beaches, and a scenario covering the battle in the peninsula and the capture of Cherbourg. In addition, there are rules for allowing 3 or even 4 players to play the game.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 day<br/>Map: approx 2.3 miles /3.8 km per hex<br/>Unit: Battalions to Brigades<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; map<br/>Two countersheets (456 9/16&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 32 page rulebook<br/>Two Combat &amp; Terrain Player Aid Cards (2 sided)<br/>Four Set-up/Reinforcement Cards (three 1-sided, one 2-sided)<br/>One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Complexity: low to intermediate<br/>Playing Time: 4 - 10 hours<br/><br/>",

However, it is most often played as a two-player game.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies features a simple dice-based combat system; a small number of types of naval, air and land units; territory control; and technology research to improve unit capabilities.<br/><br/>Major new features of Axis &amp; Allies (2004) include new units (e.g. destroyers, artillery), revised unit capabilities (e.g. armor defend at 3, fighters cost 10 IPCs), directed technology research, and totally new victory conditions (key territories must be controlled to win the game).<br/><br/>",

Dahut decided to make Ys the most powerful place in Brittany; thus, she dispatched dragons to seize merchant ships loaded with jewels which sailed on the open sea&hellip;<br/><br/>Each turn, ships filled with gems land in the city's ports. The players, embodying merchant-princes of Ys, set their team to work, two at a time, in the 4 neighborhoods of the city; deciding which area of each neighborhood to focus on. Controlling the port to claim special black jewels, the commercial area to gain a financial advantage or the palace to influence characters of influence. However it is the player who dominates the neighborhood as a whole who has the first choice of the precious stones carried in the hold of the ship docked there.  Don't overlook the gem market as other players may send their brokers to influence the value of the different types of jewels, making your collection less valuable.<br/><br/>Each player has a team of 11 brokers of varying skill levels. These brokers are placed on the players turn, one face up and one face down. Bluff your opponents on where your intentions lie, misdirection is the key to victory.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has accumulated the most gold (represented by victory points).<br/><br/>",

The majority of people just get on with their lives, accepting their monstrous rulers. However, a growing band of revolutionaries wish to free mankind from their slavery. These freedom fighters call themselves the Restorationists. A secret war has already broken out between the Restorationists and the forces loyal to the Old Ones. The invention of dynamite has changed the balance of power, and a lone assassin now has the capacity to destroy an Old One. In this shadow world of assassins, informers, police agents and anarchists, nobody is quite sure who is who and which side they fight for.<br/><br/>The game A Study in Emerald draws its central plot from the award-winning short story penned by Neil Gaiman, in which the worlds of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft are combined to telling effect. However, to create a world detailed enough for players, much has been added from real history. The nineteenth century was a time of unrest, with many colorful characters fighting both for and against the authorities. A Study in Emerald is the outcome of the merging of these three worlds.<br/><br/>This second edition of A Study in Emerald sports new artwork by Ian O'Toole and Tatiana Kuzilova along with a streamlined set of rules that will hopefully help those folks who found the first version a tad complicated. Inconsistencies have been removed and the number of available actions has been reduced to the minimum, whilst still retaining the mood of paranoia from the first edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two Lancastrians and two Yorkists draft cards that give them control of major towns, nobles, bishops and royal castles. Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.<br/><br/><br/>",

Using the numbers revealed by the cards, all players fill up their subway map with ◯s in the station spaces. However, the number of times they can add stations to each line is limited, so they have to make tough choices. Players can score many points by getting their star bonuses in stations with many intersecting routes. Players also get bonuses by being the first to complete routes. Try to fill in all your stations to minimize the penalties and achieve a high score!<br/><br/>In more detail, each player has their own sheet of paper, with all players using either the Tokyo or Osaka map. Each sheet shows an interwoven subway system, with the system consisting of many subway lines; each line has a name, a number of indicator boxes, a number of empty station boxes on the subway route, and two bonuses. On a turn, a player reveals the top indicator card from the deck of twenty cards, then each player individually and simultaneously chooses a subway line, then does something depending on which type of card is revealed:<br/><br/><br/>    If a number is revealed, the player writes the number in one of that line's indicator boxes, then draws a ◯ in each box in the line starting with the closest empty box, stopping when they've reached the end of the line, reached an already filled-in space, or drawn the indicated number of ◯s.<br/>    If a circled number is revealed, the player does what is described above, but they can skip over already filled-in spaces instead of stopping.<br/>    If a star is revealed, the player draws a star in one of that line's indicator boxes, then in the closest empty space on that line they write a number equal to double the number of lines that pass through that station box.<br/>    If a circle is revealed, the player writes nothing in an indicator box and draws a ◯ in any empty station box.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a turn, if a player has finished a subway line by reaching the final space, they announce this to all players, then score the larger of the two bonuses for this line; all other players cross out the large bonus and can score the small bonus for themselves if they complete this line later. Multiple players can score a line's bonus on the same turn. If the indicator card has a shuffle icon on it, shuffle all of the indicator cards together before the next turn.<br/><br/>Once all the indicator boxes are filled, the game ends. Players tally their points scored for completing lines and for writing numbers in boxes, then lose points based on the number of empty spaces that remain on their sheet. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

Fighting for their lives, the survivor&rsquo;s settlements must remain above the sea level. You live in the Otys colony and you must retrieve the past civilizations debris in the depths to build the future of humanity.<br/><br/>Your diver&rsquo;s team is trained to bring up the most useful materials remaining in the depths. You need to use them wisely to fulfill the contracts offered by the Colony and thus obtain more notoriety than your contenders. Your divers lay at different depths; it is up to you to best match their special abilities with the bonuses offered by the Colony. But beware! Your diver&rsquo;s oxygen is limited, and as soon as they have accomplished their mission, they must go up to the surface. Try to manage all the parameters of your team in a profitable way, so the Colony will reward you more than it will the others!<br/><br/>Otys is an optimization and development game co-published by Pearl Games and Libellud. Optimize your game in order to match the depth of your divers, their special abilities and the Colony bonuses. That is how you will supply the best contracts and win.<br/><br/>The future is built from the past...<br/><br/>In Otys,  each player has a team of divers and must use them to take actions, retrieve items, and complete objectives. The divers are stacked in a column on the player's individual game board, and some of them are next to depth gauges that read 1-5.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player chooses an available depth gauge on their individual board, then carries out the action at that same depth on the shared game board, then takes the action for their diver at that depth. Afterward that diver moves to the surface, pushing down all the other divers in the queue. That depth gauge is placed at the bottom of the player's board, and they return to the player's board to be chosen again only when that player's gauge meter is full. Initially a player must play all six of their gauges before getting any back, but they can improve their meter so that it takes fewer gauges to fill, thereby giving them more choices for their actions.<br/><br/>As divers obtain items, those items are kept at the appropriate depth on a player's board, and when a player has the needed items together at the same depth, they can claim one of the shared objectives revealed on the table or one of their personal objectives (if they've taken any). Players are racing to score 18 points first in order to win the game.<br/><br/>",

Players either spend their turn reinforcing a village (adding more tokens there) or invading a neighboring village (expanding influence if you have more total tokens than the victim).  The unique twist is that, after each invasion, the connecting bridge is removed.

No, the landscapers must meet certain building requirements, and unfortunately you won't always have at hand everything that you might need.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player has a personal garden that's divided into rows and columns; each row shows a color, while each column shows one of nine garden elements, such as the wells or a pavilion. Players start with one noble at the top of each column. A shared tile supply board has five rows &ndash; with colored spaces matching the colors on each player board &ndash; and two columns, which are unlabeled. At the start of the game, ten tiles are placed on this supply board; each tile depicts one of the nine garden elements.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player plays one of his two cards in hand, which determines the tile he can take from the supply, e.g. take a pavilion tile, take a tile from the red or gray spaces, etc. The player has only a single card that lets him take any tile &ndash; but if he plays a card showing a garden element that isn't present, then he can instead take any tile! The player must place this tile on his player board in the column that matches the image on the tile and the row that matches the color from which the tile was taken. If this space is already filled, he flips the tile to show the gardener on the other side, then places this tile on any free space in the same row or the same column. After placing the tile, he may move one of his nobles along a path of placed tiles as long as the noble ends up in the same column in which it started, but on a lower row. The player scores points equal to the row reached.<br/><br/>The player then refills the supply and draws a new card. The game ends after 18 rounds. Each player then receives bonus points for each completed row and column. Furthermore, each player has received two order cards at the start of the game, each of which shows one of the nine columns; each player receives bonus points for the row reached by the noble in that column.

        "description": "New York, 1929: A frenzy of interest in antiquity is sweeping the nation! With museums hungry for mysterious and exotic artifacts &mdash; and you hungry for adventure &mdash; you start up your own archeology company. Untold wonders await within dangerous jungles, harsh deserts, and wind-swept mountains. Will you gain a reputation as the most intrepid and famous adventurer of all time?<br/><br/>In Artifacts, Inc., 2-4 players compete to grow the most famous archaeology company. Players roll dice, which represent their troop of adventurers, and place them on cards in order to find artifacts, sell them to museums, and purchase new cards representing their company assets. Players can choose to focus on making lots of money by selling artifacts, having museum majorities, creating the best combination of expeditions and buildings, or searching below the waves for lost cities and hidden treasures. The first player to reach 20 reputation triggers the end of the game, and the player with the most total reputation wins!<br/><br/>",

Along the riverside, buildings are built, boats are moored in docks, and animals graze in the fields. Players build communities alongside this river, and send workers (known as &quot;keyples&quot;) to work in both their own and their neighbors' businesses, enabling their economy to develop and flourish.<br/><br/>Key Flow is a card-driven game based on many of the ideas contained in the award-winning game Keyflower. The game flows quickly over four game rounds (seasons), allowing players to develop their own unique village, with many ways to score points for their buildings, animals, keyples, resources and other items.<br/><br/>Key Flow is played over four seasons (rounds). Each season, players are dealt a number of cards. They then choose one of their cards and pass the remaining cards to the player on their left or right &mdash; depending on the season &mdash; until all the cards have been chosen. All scoring takes place at the end of winter. Points are scored from the village cards in various ways, through upgrading buildings, and from gathering gold. The player who scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

These are brand new stories, more sophisticated and criminal than ever before! The aim is to determine motives, find evidence and convict the perpetrators. An attentive eye is just as much in demand as creative powers of deduction to unravel everything on the 75 x 110 cm game board. As a little help, a magnifying glass is included in the game and the individual cases are again marked with symbols, so that parents can decide which cases even the youngest investigators may investigate and uncover.

        "description": "The world of Midgaard, created by author Jarosław Grzędowicz in The Lord of the Ice Garden novel series, is inhabited by a race very similar to humans, filled with magic and for a reason stuck at the cultural and technological level of medieval Viking world. The arrival of scientists from Earth disturbs its fragile balance. The power gained by controlling magic changes the scientists &ndash; they become possessed by the lust for making this world better. They become gods, who are willing to sacrifice any life, except for their own, of course, to accomplish their &ndash; great, according to them &ndash; ideas.<br/><br/>Players impersonate the scientists struggling for the domination over The Coast of Sails and also for staying on Midgaard, because soon after them another person arrives to this world: Vuko Drakkainen, highly trained agent, whose task is to find the members of scientific expedition and send them back to Earth &mdash; or as a last resort make them vanish. Will the players, as powerful gods, allow him to do it?<br/><br/>From the first turn, the players are tossed in the middle of war. They will feel the adrenaline, fear, pain and the heat of a battle. They will smell blood and sweat, hear the clash of arms and the moaning of wounded and dying.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Ice Garden takes place on The Coast of Sails, which is divided into several regions. The main goal is fighting for the domination over those regions. A region is dominated by the player with the most influence in it. Dominating the region allows players to collect its resources (M-factor, gold, population), also to win victory points in specific turns, and to accomplish their own goals. Each player has unique winning conditions and special units.<br/><br/><br/>    Olaf Fjollsfinn &ndash; uses Ice Drakkars to seduce/kidnap six dwellers of The Coast of Sails to the Ice Garden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Passionaria Callo &ndash; sends nightmares on the controlled regions and tries to isolate them. She needs to isolate two of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Pier van Dyken &ndash; greedy collector of M-factor. When he dominates a region with  a magical reserve, he may move it towards his headquarters, The Thorn. He needs to absorb four magical reserves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Ulrike Freihoff &ndash; spreads her religion. When she dominates a region where she also has a special unit called The Enlightened One, she may build a Red Tower there. Six of those grant her victory.<br/><br/><br/>There is also Vuko, who came to evacuate the scientists and clean up their mess. Each turn he goes to the region, where the player with least reputation/morality (it decreases each time the player uses magic) has the most influence. Such a visit is nothing nice &ndash; Vuko kills one special unit of that player in this region and lowers his/her influence there.<br/><br/>The game may end in one of the three ways:<br/><br/>    Meeting the player's unique victory condition &ndash; the game ends and that player is the winner,<br/>    After specified number of turns game ends and the player with most victory points is the winner,<br/>    The Dead Snow token reaches the end of its track &ndash; each use of magic shakes the balance of Midgaard. If the players exceed the limit of changes that world and its gods can accept, the game ends and the winner is the player with the highest reputation.<br/><br/><br/>INITIATIVE PHASE:<br/>During the initiative phase players decide how many action tokens they will have for the current turn and also determine the player order during the Planning Phase. Moreover, they can initiate scoring of the regions by moving their initiative tokens. In the advanced mode they also determine the order of action fields resolution.<br/><br/>PLANNING PHASE:<br/>Players, one by one in the order determined in the Initiative Phase, place their action tokens on selected action fields.<br/><br/>ACTION PHASE:<br/>Players perform actions in the action fields, in the order determined by the placement of tokens.<br/>&bull; Viper's Nest &ndash; player receives one token of any resource. They can also exchange resources.<br/>&bull; Influence &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two population tokens to place as many influence tokens on the region(s) where they already have at least one influence<br/>&bull; Move &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two gold tokens to make as many moves of their influence tokens and/or special units to the neighboring region(s)<br/>&bull; Voracious Mountain &ndash; player may sacrifice population to move any number of their influence tokens and/or special units from one region to any other region<br/>&bull; Raven's Shadow &ndash; player may raise his/her reputation or use a magic token to get rid of the disadvantageous token of contact with Vuko.<br/>&bull; Magic &ndash; allows the player to do any of the three actions: translocate the M-factor, summon special units of the given level, add a new ability to the special unit. Each of those actions results in moving the Dead Snow token up on its track and decreasing the player's reputation.<br/>&bull; Activation (automatic field) &ndash; after resolving the actions players may activate the abilities of their special units. The order of activation of given abilities is strictly determined. After the activation the situation on the board may change drastically.<br/>&bull; Vuko Drakkainen (automatic field) &ndash; each turn Vuko must go to another region. Its figure is placed in the region, where the most immoral player has the most influence. That player receives a conact token decreasing his/her influence, and also loses one special unit in this region (provided he/she had any). In the advanced mode players will be able to equip Vuko with more abilities, that will activate in specific moments of the game.<br/><br/>DOMINATION PHASE:<br/>Players collect victory points and resources from the regions, and accomplish their unique goals.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This description was originally based on a review from BoardgameNews.com.<br/><br/>In this corporation-themed game, players compete to be the first to acquire four out of six possible victory points. You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.<br/><br/>The player who's the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.<br/><br/>After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.<br/><br/>It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want). The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions. Efficient manipulating of your opportunities will win you victory points and, if you gain four, the game.<br/><br/>Awards: <br/>Machtspiele (Power $truggle) is derived from &quot;Die Firma&quot;, which won a special prize in the 2009 Hippodice game design competition for best full-length game.<br/><br/>",

By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock. All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya!<br/><br/>Players program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them.  Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.<br/><br/>The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.<br/><br/>",

Renowned for their restorative properties, the noctiluca are desired by many healers. Only the most skilled divers can navigate the waters to collect these mysterious glowing creatures and deliver them to healers across the land. Can you catch the embers of the sea?<br/><br/>In Noctiluca, 104 colorful translucent dice fill the pool on the game board to represent the different glowing noctiluca. Players take turns diving into the water from the edges of the shore to collect the noctiluca dice from the board and keep them safely in jars until they can deliver them to healers. After two rounds, players compare points from their successful deliveries and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Thanks to a double-sided game board, Noctiluca also includes a solo mode in which one player must rescue the noctiluca from the tempest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "20 Strong is a new deck-based game system from Chip Theory Games, capable of being played in about 30 minutes or less. We say &ldquo;game system&rdquo; because the idea behind 20 Strong is a small nucleus of simple, adaptable rules that can then be applied to a variety of unique decks, each with their own set of mechanics. We are launching 20 Strong with three such decks &ndash; one set in the world of Too Many Bones, one set in Hoplomachus: Victorum, and one in the new universe of the space-faring Solar Sentinels. We have more decks in development and plan to release them regularly if our customers are excited by them. For now, 20 Strong is a solo-only game, but even that could differ in future decks using the ruleset.<br/><br/>The object of a game of 20 Strong is to progress through a shuffled deck of cards, each card bearing a unique challenge. This challenge could be in the form of an enemy, a unique scenario, or some other requirement (for example, players of the Too Many Bones deck might expect to see a Lockpicking challenge or two). Challenges usually require a certain number of successes to complete, which you earn by rolling a set of 17 dice with different odds for a hit (these dice, along with three adjustable stat dice, make up the &ldquo;20&rdquo; in 20 Strong).<br/><br/>If you roll enough successes, you complete a card&rsquo;s challenge and gain its rewards. If you don&rsquo;t, you take damage and move on to the next card &ndash; unless, of course, your HP stat is reduced to 0, costing you the game. If you manage to make it through an entire deck, you take on one of the deck&rsquo;s final bosses, attempting to score enough hits against this powerful enemy to claim ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Of course, it&rsquo;s never so easy that you&rsquo;d want to spend all of your dice on a single card. In addition to your HP Stat, you&rsquo;re also keeping track of your Strategy (which controls how many rerolls and items you have) and your Recovery, which controls how many dice return to your pool after taking on a challenge. If you roll more dice than your Recovery, those dice are exhausted, lowering your pool for your subsequent challenges. It&rsquo;s a game of pressing your luck, strategic decision-making, and resource management. We think you&rsquo;re going to love it!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players are suitors trying to gain the affections of Princess Bubblegum (#8).<br/><br/>In a round, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and discard one of the two, using the power of the discarded card to try to eliminate other players from the round. If you're the last player in the round, or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point. The game is played until a player reaches a certain amount of points determined by the numbers of players.<br/><br/>The card art is styled to be Adventure Time characters &quot;cosplaying&quot; the characters from the Tempest version of Love Letter by AEG.<br/><br/>There are two differences in this version. Number 1 is a new win condition. If a player plays a &quot;Hero&quot; (#5), either Finn or Jake, and makes another player (including themselves) discard the other &quot;Hero&quot; card, they win the round. The idea is that you are reuniting the iconic best buds. Number 2 is, if you manage to win the round with a &quot;companion&quot; in your hand, you win 2 tokens instead of only one.<br/><br/>",

If someone leads a color, you must follow suit if you can; otherwise, you can throw off a card or trump the trick.<br/><br/>It's an exact-bidding game, but you predict your tricks by taking colored chips. For each trick that you win, you toss a chip back. If you take a trick in a color for which you didn't have a chip, then you must take a black chip (worth -3 points). If you have any colored chips left at the end of the round, they're worth -2 points. If you have any white chips left at the end of the round (wildcards that you get when someone takes a colored chip away from you during bidding), they're worth -4 points.<br/><br/>There's also the Sluffer, whose role is to feed unwanted tricks to other players. Instead of bidding tricks the Sluffer takes 4 black chips each worth -1 for him at the end of the hand. When players take tricks they didn't predict, they take black chips from the Sluffer. If the Sluffer feeds enough of the black chips to other players, it can zero out the Sluffer's score for that round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game tracing the development of railways on the Isle of Wight, 1860 is part of the 18xx series of economic railway games, based on Francis Tresham's original concepts.<br/><br/>As in other 18xx games, the winner is the player with the greatest combined wealth (cash on hand + value of stocks held + value of private companies owned) at the end of the game. Play  progresses in a series of alternating stock and operating rounds. During stock rounds, players may purchase and sell stock in corporations.  During operating rounds, the corporations lay track, place railway stations (tokens), run trains for revenue to be withheld or paid out, and purchase trains. The player who owns the most stock in a given corporation makes all decisions for said corporation during an operating round.<br/><br/>The game is notable for the small size of the board compared to many 18xx games, and its innovative game end: The climax of play sees the beginnings of railway nationalization in the United Kingdom, with the weakest companies being eliminated from private operation earlier than those which are the healthiest.<br/><br/>Other notable differences from most 18xx games include:<br/>-Players may own up to 100% of a corporation, and may sell presidents&rsquo; certificates into the bank pool, at which time a corporation goes into receivership and continues to operate.<br/>-Corporations are never required to own trains, and thus player bankruptcy is impossible.  Instead, a trainless corporation becomes insolvent and leases a train based on the current phase, withholding all earnings. <br/>-Corporations are allowed to run one train through one &ldquo;tokened out&rdquo; city once per operating  round, which makes strategic route building and station placement key.<br/><br/>The game was initially produced in a small print run of c.100 copies.  JKLM and Z-Man games released a larger, but still limited, 2nd edition (with an alternate map) in 2010. In 2021, All-Aboard Games funded the publication of a 3rd edition through Kickstarter which was backed more than 1000 times.<br/><br/>",

You can gain points by connecting your lines to various destinations on the board, and by having the passenger use your lines to travel from station to station.<br/><br/>The player who has best balanced the demands by the time that the deck of destinations is exhausted will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>Gameplay overview:<br/><br/>In On the Underground, the players represent companies building underground lines in London. Each player controls 2-4 different lines (based on the number of players).<br/><br/>On each turn, a player can build four pieces of track on the map in any of their color. All track pieces must extend the color. Alternatively, a player may decide to use two branch tokens (acquired by extending lines to the terminus stations or skipping building turns) to branch out of the line.<br/><br/>During the track building part, the active player can score in four different ways:<br/><br/>     Connect their line to a station with a National Rail symbol (1p)<br/>     Connect their line to a terminus station (2p + a branch token)<br/>     Connect two connection tokens of the same type (3p)<br/>     Building a circular line (1p for each station &quot;inside&quot; the line)<br/><br/><br/>After each turn, the passenger moves to one or two of the four face up destination cards; first to one express destination and then to a regular destination. If there are no cards face up in either type, the passenger only moves once. The passenger always uses the shortest route from their current position, avoiding walking and line changes. The passenger scores one point for each line they used to get to their destination.<br/><br/>When there is not enough destination cards to turn face up from the deck, the passenger marker is removed from the game. Players get equal turns, but after the passenger marker is removed, no more points are awarded from passenger movement and players can only build track. The player with the highest amount of points wins.<br/><br/>",

In towns, features are easy to set up and give you starting resources to upgrade your cast; small cities are somewhat more demanding, but they allow you to come into contact with better artists; audiences in big cities are even more demanding and want to see very specific numbers, but performing there brings you much more fame!<br/><br/>On their turn, players can hire an artist or host a performance. At the beginning of the game, each player's circuses are empty, so it will be necessary to contract to form the company. The artist cards grant more or fewer benefits depending on the order in which they act, so one of the keys to the game is planning the shows that will be offered.<br/><br/>If they decide to act, the players must move to a free space on the map. If it is a town, they receive the most basic currency cards as a prize. If you perform in a small city, depending on the number of pedestals you have in your company you can claim more or fewer entry cards (the second most valuable) or fame points. In the big cities, you get a lot of fame points, but the public always demands a specific type of artist.<br/><br/>While your little circus tries to survive, the great and splendid Barnum Circus travels across the country, and when it arrives in a big city, a score is held in that region, and the circuses that have given the most performances there will gain even more fame.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You've just been given a shot at being the head chef at the prestigious New York Slice pizza parlor. Now you and your fellow pizza chef wannabes have to make the most amazing pizzas...one slice at a time!<br/><br/>In New York Slice, each player slices pizzas into portions, giving their opponents first choice, while they take the leftovers. There are a dozen kinds of pizza to work with, from veggie to hawaiian to meat lover's, and each player decides if they want to eat or keep some of the slices, building the best collection of pizzas possible!<br/><br/>Each time a player slices a pizza, there's a different special to go along with it, whether it's allocated to one of the portions or placed on its own. Specials provide the player with special powers or points, such as calling dibs on a slice before the pizza is divided, getting one of the normally-out-of-the-game &quot;mystery slices', having an opportunity to &quot;sneak a slice&quot; by moving it from one portion to another when they choose, and many more&mdash;there are 14 different &quot;Today's Specials&quot; in the game.<br/><br/>Some slices have anchovies on them (yuck!), which are worth negative points to anyone who collects them &mdash; but anchovies might show up on different pizza types you're collecting, so in order to have the majority of a type, you just might have to collect one with anchovies on it!<br/><br/>If you tie another player for the most slices of a type, neither of you gets any points &mdash; but a bunch of slices have two types of pizza on them, with each combo slice being worth half a slice of each type, which is great for breaking ties.<br/><br/>Most slices have pepperoni on them, which you can eat for points (instead of collecting to go for the majority of each slice type).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In LLAMA, you want to dump cards from your hand as quickly as you can, but you might not be able to play what you want, so do you quit and freeze your hand or draw and hope to keep playing?<br/><br/>Each player starts a round with six cards in hand; the deck consists of llama cards and cards numbered 1-6, with eight copies of each. On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on the discard pile, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions in the round. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.<br/><br/>The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect tokens based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white tokens (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black token (worth 10 points). (You can exchange ten white tokens for one black token at any time.) If you played all your cards, you can return one token (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round, in which the first player to play will be the one who emptied their hand or was the last one to quit in the previous round.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the round where at least one player has forty or more total points. Whoever has the fewest points wins!<br/><br/>The original title of this game is a German acronym and stands for Lege alle Minuspunkte ab, that is, &quot;discard all minus points&quot;, with &quot;Lama&quot; also being the German spelling of &quot;llama&quot;.<br/><br/>The Polish game Lato z Komarami features gameplay nearly identical to LLAMA except that the game has one less &quot;llama&quot; card, and the penalty for llama cards in hand is 10 points per card, instead of being 10 points for one or more llama cards.<br/><br/>",

It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.<br/><br/>To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.<br/><br/>Jungle Jam, Медвед, and Prawo Dżungli are unauthorized reproductions of Jungle Speed/Arriba!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Mangrovia, a light &quot;gamer's game&quot;/family game with a Caribbean mangrove setting, a clever role selection mechanism allows the players to choose two different bonuses/actions as well as the turn order in which they want these actions to be carried out &mdash; all by placing just one marker. Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability.<br/><br/>The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape. If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game. You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods. Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces.<br/><br/>Building a hut requires that the space's landscape is &quot;active&quot; and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space. Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start. The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial.<br/><br/>In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called &quot;ritual sites&quot;. A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action. If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa). A fourth action type is to select &quot;active landscapes&quot; and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round. After all players have performed two actions, the round ends. The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.<br/><br/>Collecting amulets may be key in this game. Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards &mdash; and still to the exact price. Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths. In order to gain enough amulets &mdash; and amulets of the appropriate values &mdash; you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces. The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw. The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.<br/><br/>The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one. The spaces that are part of two divine paths are obviously most tempting, but can you afford to build your huts there?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rise of Empires is an empire-building game in which players develop their ever changing empire from Ancient Age to Modern Age. War, economics, science and diplomacy are to be taken into consideration to successfully win this epic game.<br/><br/>In Rise of Empires two to five players are building their own civilization from the dawn of history to present times. All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas.  Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn. The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn. In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods.<br/><br/>In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly. A full game can be completed in less than three hours.  It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Don't just make history-guide it! Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras. Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful. This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense. Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre! Balance gold and food, war and agriculture, territory and technology to forge an empire that is destined to rise above all other nations!<br/><br/>Each copy of Rise of Empires contains:<br/>. 1 large game board<br/>. 1 tiles display<br/>. 40 resource discs<br/>. 150 player cubes in 5 colors<br/>. 45 action discs in 5 colors<br/>. 8 empire tiles<br/>. 40 territory tiles<br/>. 48 progress tiles<br/>. 36 city tiles<br/>. 104 gold markers<br/>. 5 alliance pieces<br/>. 5 player aid cards<br/>. 1 rules booklet with illustrated example of play.<br/><br/>",

But can you find your way back before the portal closes?<br/><br/>Sleeping Gods: Distant Skies is a standalone sequel set in the world of Sleeping Gods. As in the original game, you and your friends trek through a vast landscape as you read branching storylines and meet vivid characters, but in this game you interact with the atlas on a deeper level &mdash; camping, exploring, overcoming obstacles, and searching for lost relics. The new action system allows you even greater agency while you travel and explore.<br/><br/>In addition to the exploration and quest system from the original game, Sleeping Gods: Distant Skies features a fresh spin on combat. Players now build a combat deck from which they draw a varied hand of cards to play, making each combat encounter a fresh and dynamic puzzle.<br/><br/>Although Sleeping Gods: Distant Skies builds on story elements in the first game, you do not need to play Sleeping Gods to enjoy this sequel. The game features new characters and storylines, explaining concepts from the original game as you encounter them.<br/><br/>Return to the world of Sleeping Gods and experience a thrilling tale that hinges on your choices in a truly open-world experience!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The publisher says: <br/> The Adventurers features a fast-paced thrilling run through the Temple of Chac, the Mayan rain god. As your intrepid adventurers delve through the ruins, they will face deadly traps guarding the ancient relics they prize.<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.<br/><br/>The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.<br/><br/>A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple. Adults may tire from repeats of The Adventurers, but kids will get lots of thrills.<br/><br/>",

Brett, for example, can craft items with one fewer scrap than other players. If the Alien is within three spaces of the player with the incinerator, that player can use the incinerator to send the Alien back to its nest.<br/><br/>In the Encounter phase, players draw and resolve an Encounter card. The Alien could be lurking behind any corner...<br/><br/>Once the players fulfill their initial objectives, they face one of five final missions, each with a unique set of requirements. Players must fulfill the final mission's requirements simultaneously to win the game. Players can also introduce Science Officer Ash for a more challenging game.

        "description": "As the first winner of the Spiel des Jahres award in 1979, Hare and Tortoise or the German Hase und Igel (for Hare and Hedgehog) will always be regarded as a classic game.  It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.<br/><br/>There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare &amp; Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.<br/><br/><br/>      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable. This is the rule I most favour and would prefer it to simply not landing on them at all...&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>      Tournament Jugging the Hare rule -- When you land on a hare square do nothing immediately. If nobody goes past you, draw 10 carrots when you next move. If they do, pay 10 carrots into the carrot patch for each player who goes past you, in either direction.

They try connect all machine input and output pipes to the right reservoirs or to other machines in order to build the most profitable configuration. A new machine brings revenue. Other things you build (reservoirs and connectors (pipelines)) cost 1K money each.<br/><br/>In each game round, players may select one machine (from a number of machines equal to the number of players) simultaneously, which means players try to quickly determine possible connections, then grab the tile they want. But by choosing too quickly, you risk taking a machine that doesn't fit well...

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Will you play citizens into your hometown for points, or contribute them to the capital and benefit from their special abilities? In Capital Lux, you always balance on a razor's edge, so will you take risks? Bluff? Or follow a carefully laid plan? The choice is yours in this clever card game, featuring beautiful art by American painter Kwanchai Moriya.<br/><br/>Each round begins with the players drafting a hand of five or six character cards. On your turn, you must play a card either in front of you (your hometown) or in the middle of the table (the capital). When you play a card into the capital, you benefit from the card's special ability. Each character belongs to one of four professions, and their special abilities are:<br/><br/><br/>    Merchant: Take 1 gold coin. Gold coins can be used at the end of a round to increase your own limit for one of the four professions.<br/>    Agent: Draw a secret modifier card and add it (face down) to one of the four professions in the capital. This will affect the limit of the chosen profession at round's end.<br/>    Scholar: Draw a card from the deck into your hand.<br/>    Cleric: Move the lowest valued card of any profession from the capital into your hometown<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a round, for each profession, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your hometown than the current total value in the capital. If you break the limit for one of the professions, you lose all cards of that profession from your hometown. At the end of the third round, all characters remaining in a player's hometown are worth points.<br/><br/>This means that for every card there's a dilemma of whether to add it to your hometown for possible points, or to the capital which not only gives you the benefit from a special ability, but also increases the potential points for all players. Since every player is dealt only five or six cards at the beginning of a round, every card play is crucial...<br/><br/>",

Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each time. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from in the base set, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game, and even more if you include the expansion.<br/><br/>A built-in comeback mechanic means that when you're on the edge of losing, you're also able to do even more combos than usual.<br/><br/>You don't have to worry about shuffling cards because you just put your cardboard tokens in a bag and shake them up to shuffle! Plus, it&rsquo;s pretty ballin&rsquo; to play a game with chips. Play it on your yacht, impress potential mates, etc.<br/><br/>Though the game is fun even if you're terrible at it, it's also balanced for high level play by veteran asymmetric game balancer David Sirlin (Street Fighter HD Remix, Puzzle Fighter HD Remix, Kongai, Yomi, and Flash Duel.)<br/><br/>This 3rd Edition of the game has many changes including:<br/><br/>    Panic Time to prevent games from going too long<br/>    A 3-player and 4-player mode with no player elimination and that allows crashing your gems to whoever you want<br/>    A 2v2 Team Battle Mode<br/>    A Custom Clockwork mode to draft your own character<br/>    Puzzle chips and character chips updated to ensure healthy competitive play in tournaments<br/>    New components: game boards and privacy screens<br/><br/><br/>",

But there&rsquo;s a trick: one cannot activate all their cards at once, which means that tough choices will have to be made each turn in order to select the cards that are the most needed.<br/><br/>The resources gathered from the activated city cards will allow the players to acquire cards from a common pool, allowing them to get improved buildings, technologies, wonders, etc. and therefore to leverage their civilization deck to new heights through more and more efficient card combos. As the common pool of cards progresses (either as players have acquired cards or because they didn't - which leads to one card from the pool to be discarded per turn), the game progresses through eras. Medieval cards are better than classical cards, and industrial cards are even better, but of course those cards are more and more expensive to acquire.<br/><br/>A modular board, at the center of the table, holds each civilization's army. The board is made of Provinces to be conquered. Unoccupied Province's inhabitants are barbarians who will provide resources to the player who defeats them. Holding a conquered province also brings victory points.<br/><br/>The player with the most impressive civilization at the end of the game will be remembered for all time (and they also win the game!).<br/><br/>&mdash;description based on the publisher's<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Egizia: Shifting Sands is an updated version of the beloved strategy game Egizia. Players travel down the Nile, placing boats as they go, to collect resources that will help them construct some of Egypt's most famous monuments. With new monuments to build, new cards to collect, and a constantly shifting river, Egizia: Shifting Sands Edition is a streamlined, modern update that both longtime fans and new players can easily pick up and enjoy.<br/><br/>In Egizia, players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards. In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place their remaining pawns only on the squares below the one they just occupied.<br/><br/>When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players (which are separate from the pawns) must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player doesn't have enough grain for all their workers, they must buy it with victory points. After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do so was reserved earlier) along with the workers.<br/><br/>In this new edition, players each get a chance to build across the Colonnade, a new monument. The more columns you build, the better powers you unlock to help you on the river. Perhaps once per turn you can place boats on occupied river spaces or upstream, or gain an extra point each time you place bricks in monuments. With randomized rewards from game to game, the Colonnade is a dynamic new monument to shake up traditional gameplay.<br/><br/>Below the Colonnade, where the graves once stood, lie the mysterious statues &mdash; a new monument unlike anything else in Egizia. These tiny build sites are cheaper than any other monument, but they hold the potential for high reward if you fulfill their requirements. Players must plan early as they can place only one brick in a statue per round, and each level they build has more strenuous requirements for endgame bonuses.<br/><br/>Egizia: Shifting Sands keeps all the painstaking risk/reward decisions of the original Egizia and adds new depths of strategy, balance, and gameplay for a fresh twist on a timeless classic.<br/><br/>",

Players make the political decisions and control the military forces of the three major factions that struggled for European dominance and survival.<br/><br/>With its emphasis on force projection and decision making, players remain focused on the big picture of managing their front lines and political opportunities. Through simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the strategic action without a myriad of complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.<br/><br/>As one gamer put it, &quot;It is a delight to be spending my limited brain power on making (or agonizing over) operational decisions that are as dependent upon guts as they are gray matter. This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.&quot;<br/><br/>Though the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled. Also represented are such World War II events as airdrops, Free Forces, jets, naval evacuation, partisans, radar, railroad artillery guns, and ULTRA; all neatly woven into the game's core mechanics for ease of play<br/><br/>The game has many scenarios ranging from quick playing individual campaigns to longer ones covering up to the entire war.<br/><br/>Design Highlights<br/><br/>     Scale: army, fleet, or air wing level units; 30-60 miles per hex; monthly turns <br/>     Players: 2-4<br/>     Playing Time: 30 minutes to 50 hours, depending on the scenario<br/>     Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is relatively low.<br/>     Simple Stacking: No more than one air, ground, convoy, or warship unit per hex.<br/>     No Factors on Counters: There are no combat or movement factors on counters.<br/>     Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air/naval, ground, or strategic combat. <br/>     Integrated Movement/Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation. <br/>     &quot;Use it or Lose it&quot; Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping<br/>     Historical or Variable Entry: Units and events can enter play using an historical or variable time line. <br/>     Variable Politics: Most countries&rsquo; belligerence and faction alliance is not predetermined.<br/>     Solitaire Friendly: Though not designed with solitaire rules, the mechanics easily allow one player to play the game.<br/>     PBEM Capable: The game can be played using PBEM software, but its mechanics require frequent exchanges.<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:    Monthly Turns<br/>MAP SCALE:     30 to 40 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Army, Fleet or Wing<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Salvatore Vasta<br/>DEVELOPER: Mark Dey<br/>MAP ART: Salvatore Vasta &amp; Mark Simonitch<br/>COUNTER ART: Charlie Kibler<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player is a Gulo, or wolverine, trying to rescue a baby Gulo who got caught by the swamp vulture whose eggs it was trying to steal.  Unfortunately for the baby Gulo, all the adult Gulos are distracted by all the delicious swamp vulture eggs, and it has to wait very, very patiently as the adults constantly trip the very, very sensitive &quot;egg alarm&quot; rigged by the vulture to scare off the pesky Gulos.<br/><br/>There is a nice wooden bowl filled with multicolored swamp vulture eggs of various sizes, into which a long thin dowel with another egg at one end is inserted, like a flagpole.  As you can imagine, lots of M&amp;M Peanut-shaped wooden bits banging around together in a polished wooden bowl makes it rather difficult to keep a thin dowel with weight at the top balanced...<br/><br/>The essential mechanic of the game is to try to pull an egg of a particular color and move to a tile of that color on the linear path toward the bowl, and the little stack of tiles hiding the baby Gulo tile.  If you set off the alarm, or knock any eggs out of the bowl, your Gulo is sent back to the previous tile of the attempted color.  If there's no such tile, then back to the start he goes!<br/><br/>",

The Havel River was difficult to navigate near the Oranienburg mills, so a canal was built from the Havel that crossed the older Ruppin canal, thereby forming the Oranienburg canal cross. During the industrialization in the 19th century, lots of companies and businesses were formed at this important waterway. Moreover, additional streets and railways were built.<br/><br/>In Oranienburger Kanal, you erect new industries and shape the infrastructure by building pathways, streets, railways, and canals. Most important of all are bridges that connect buildings. To do all of this, you have access to various actions that you select in the right moments.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the best industrial area and the best infrastructure wins.<br/><br/>Oranienburger Kanal also includes a solo game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each of the 12 regions of the board contains five areas, each area containing one of four different terrain types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent occupied area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring can gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.<br/><br/>Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.<br/><br/>",

In this type of game, the player assumes the role of a character in an interactive story driven by puzzle solving and exploration. This game is a direct adaption of these mechanics to the cardboard medium that requires no electronics to play. In other words, you are holding a classic point-and-click adventure game in book format. You will talk to characters, combine items to solve puzzles, and explore a unique world to get ahead in the story.<br/><br/>In the first part of the Cantaloop Trilogy, you embody the small-time criminal Oz &quot;Hook&quot; Carpenter who just returned from exile, seeking revenge on the person who made you leave in the first place. But thats easier said than done: You wont stand a chance against the most powerful crook of the city all by yourself. You need a team of people with a unique set of skills if you even want the slightest chance to succeed.<br/><br/>Explore 20 beautifully illustrated locations, talk to characters and solve tricky puzzles to gather your crew in this &quot;Point'n'Click&quot; like game. Search and collect items, figure out where to use them and combine them with each other.<br/><br/>- Open World: You decide where you want to go and when.<br/>- Non-Linear Puzzle Design: There's always at least two puzzles to solve at any given time, so chances that you'll get stuck are minimized.<br/>- 6-10 hours Playtime: Or 18-30 hours for the entire trilogy - a huge game world to immerse yourself in.<br/>- Story-driven: In the prologue (download the Print &amp; Play at lookout-spiele.de) and the 3 parts of the game, the story slowly ramps up to the big heist on Cantaloop Island.<br/>- Humor: Similar to the old point &amp; click adventure games, you'll get a funny response for a lot of the combinations you try.<br/>- Non-Destructive: None of the game material gets destroyed in your playthrough. There is only one sheet of paper that you can easily copy.<br/>- Help System: Should you get stuck, there is a vast help section where you can get up to two hints and the solution to any puzzle.<br/>- No Abstract Puzzles: Every puzzle fits into the world and story of Cantaloop.<br/>- Dialogues: Most of Cantaloop's story is told in speech bubbles, encouraging player groups to roleplay the scenes together.<br/>- Secrets: There MAY be a few easter eggs and unlockables sprinkled throughout Cantaloop, but I'm sure that's just hearsay.<br/><br/>--description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and your fellow samurai companions are the only standing obstacle between one frightened village and a full horde of blood-thirsty villains. The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces &mdash; but this comparison doesn't take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat. Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!<br/><br/>Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.<br/><br/>The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village! Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren't unlimited, you must do what's necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it. Do you have what it takes to stand against evil and become a true hero?<br/><br/>Fight with courage, smartly assist your teammates, defend the poor villagers, turn into a savage beast, and wreak havoc on the enemy lines &mdash; all of this is up to you! Ultimately it would be your honor to chose to die in a ultimate sacrifice in order to save the village. All of this is what makes the true samurai spirit!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left no clear heir to the immense empire he had conquered. It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander's empire. By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms. Successors III is a four-player game based on those wars.<br/><br/>Successors was first published in 1997 by Avalon Hill. Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer. Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment. The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia. Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers. The Tyche cards have received the most changes&mdash;nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added.<br/><br/>In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved. Years of questions and answers on Consimworld have been used to clarify the rules. The rules also include hints on strategy from a number of long-time Successors players, and an extended example of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cosmic Frog is a game of collection, combat, and theft on a planetary scale. Each player controls a two-mile-tall, immortal, invulnerable frog-like creature that exists solely to gather terrain from the Shards of Aeth, the fragments of a long-ago shattered world. The First Ones seek to use the lands from the Shards to reconstruct the world of Aeth, and your frogs are their terrain harvesters.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, your frogs descend from the Aether, the cosmic sea between the worlds, onto a terrain-rich Shard of Aeth. Once on the Shard, you harvest land and store it in your massive gullet. When your gullet is sufficiently full, you leap into the Aether and disgorge your gullet contents into your inter-dimensional vault for permanent storage, then return to the Shard to collect more land. Although your frogs' collective mission is to gather as much land as possible for the First Ones, your private goal is to prove yourself to be the greatest of their harvesters by delivering to them the most valuable vault. To do this, you have to fill your vault strategically in a manner that both maximizes linear sets of identical lands and maximizes the diversity of lands in your vault at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you're free to keep to yourself and focus on harvesting at your own pace...or you may attack other frogs and try to take lands directly from their gullets. You may even raid another frog's vault and steal the lands they have gathered if they have been knocked into the dreaded Outer Dimensions. As you are all immortal and invulnerable, no frog is ever wounded or killed &mdash; just irritated and inconvenienced.<br/><br/>But don't ever get too comfortable with your carefully crafted plans as the Aether is a chaotic and unstable place. Waves of Aether Flux will prompt you to mutate, and you may have to change your strategy in accordance with your new powers. And Splinters of Aeth, tiny slivers of the old world that swirl madly about in the Aether, will periodically fall from their orbit and crash into the Shard, destroying large areas of terrain and blasting apart the very Shard itself!<br/><br/>The game ends when the Shard is stripped of all harvestable land or when a Splinter shatters it. When the game ends, the player with the highest valued vault wins, and the frogs move to the next Shard to gather more land for the First Ones...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Whoever played the highest card of this color wins the trick. If two or more colors are tied, then the highest card counts as the winner.<br/><br/>You play several rounds until someone reaches the target number of tricks taken.

The period from 1840 to 1861 saw these issues brought to a boil, and in 1861 the nation became tangled in a terrible war that lasted four long years.<br/><br/>The game depicts the war between North and South from the First Battle of Bull Run (or Manassas Junction) to Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse &ndash; or Grant's surrender at Harrisburg... Each player leads one of these two nations and makes the strategic decisions which determine the outcome of the war.<br/><br/>The game board represents the United States, north and south and from the Atlantic coast to just west of the Mississippi. [...] The play map contains a number of boxes, each representing a city, town or locations important to the war. These boxes are connected by transportation lines &ndash; blue for rivers, tan for roads and black for railroads &ndash; which provide the paths to victory or defeat.<br/><br/>Can you keep the Union whole or force the separation of the United States?<br/><br/>",

You must get to the Abyss, lair of the Darkhouse, before the Phantom Submarine (his henchman) reaches your homeland, the Happy Isles &mdash; but to defeat the Darkhouse, not only must you be faster than the Phantom Submarine, you must also assemble the submarine's crew along the way.<br/><br/>Each turn, you roll three dice and give one to each of these figures: the Nautilion, the Phantom Submarine, and the Darkhouse. The dice of the Nautilion and the Phantom Submarine move those figures along a path formed by Crew tokens: the Nautilion from the Happy Isles towards the Abyss; the Phantom Submarine in the opposite direction. The crew token on which your Nautilion ends its move joins your submarine, the one the Phantom Submarine reaches is lost!<br/><br/>Only four copies exist of each of the nine different tokens, so you have to decide carefully which die you need and which you can leave to your enemies. (The Darkhouse doesn't move, but inflicts damage to you each time he gets a die with a high value.) To win, you need to reach the Abyss with a full crew of nine different tokens.<br/><br/>Five expansions are included with the game, adding new crew members, powers, treacheries and challenges.<br/><br/>",

The Government, representing both the colonial authorities and France&rsquo;s military leadership, must engage the nationalist insurgency decisively while striving to preserve the support and commitment of the civilian government and society. Players will enter the &ldquo;heart of darkness&rdquo; as they use military, political, and economic actions and exploit events to build and maneuver forces to influence or control the population or otherwise achieve their aims along the twisting route to independence.<br/><br/>This installment in GMT&rsquo;s popular COIN Series system is the first to be designed for two players. You must carefully consider  just what it is you want to do, and how much of it, before the initiative slips from your fingers.<br/><br/>It also includes rules for a solitaire FLN bot AI opponent. (There is no French bot, so the only solitaire option is for the human to play as the government against the insurgent bot.)<br/><br/>From the Casbah to the Aures, are you ready to run the gauntlet?<br/><br/>",

Use positional play to complete quests&mdash;and influence fate to ensure the outcome is in your favor. Strike the perfect balance of misdirection and mischief to capture the throne.<br/><br/>There are 9 Demigods. At the beginning of the game, each player is secretly assigned one Demigod as their offspring. When the game begins, however, players may control the actions of any Demigod, not just their own. Through strategic play, special powers, and secret voting, players must aid their Demigod in gaining Renown. But be careful! Giving away your lineage too soon may cause the other players to work together toward your Demigod&rsquo;s demise.<br/><br/>On their turn, players will have 2 actions with which to send Demigods on quests. Each Quest can result in 2 different ways, which the gods influence with secret voting cards called Fate Cards. When a Quest is completed, the Fate cards are revealed and the winning side of the card is resolved, giving some Demigods Renown and taking it from others. A player wins if their Demigod has the most Renown at the end of 3 rounds called ages, and that Demigod becomes the heir to the throne.<br/><br/>Part social deduction, part strategy, Veiled Fate pits wit against wit.

        "description": "Petrichor is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil. The word is constructed from Greek (&pi;έ&tau;&rho;&alpha;) petra, meaning &quot;stone&quot;, and (ἰ&chi;ώ&rho;) īchōr, the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology.<br/><br/>Welcome to the lush world of Petrichor; you are a cloud. Your entire purpose in life is to expand, sire other clouds and water crops. Unfortunately, your mates (who are also clouds) have a similar plan. It&rsquo;s up to you to manipulate the weather and assimilate these rogue clouds to contribute to the growth of as many crops as possible - all in order to claim the title of Most Valuable Cloud.<br/><br/>Petrichor is a highly interactive board game, playable by 1-4 people (up to 5 with the expansion, see below). It&rsquo;s an action selection/area influence game, with 4 simple actions which interact with the various fields in ever surprising ways. The players move clouds with water droplets, and then rain those droplets onto specific fields, to make sure they have the right amount of water for the Harvest. During a Harvest, crops that have been watered enough are scored! Players are able to influence when, and how often the harvest happens. Players need to strike a fine balance between maintaining control of the different fields as well as influencing Harvest, to make sure the two come together at the optimal time.<br/><br/>Solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi<br/><br/>",

There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.<br/><br/>Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:<br/><br/>A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.<br/><br/>Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:<br/><br/>Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.<br/><br/>Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:<br/><br/>This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns. In 2014, Gryphon Games released a new edition of this game as Wildlife Safari, featuring the same components and artwork but changing the title of the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.<br/><br/>A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.<br/><br/>Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent does have more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).<br/><br/>",

The suit dictates which of four regions you activate, the value dictates which site within that region you get to circle, and the poker card goes toward a five-card poker hand that is resolved at the end of each round. Each of the four regions &mdash; Trail, Badlands, Mine, and Town &mdash; offers a different puzzle to master, while each site within a region provides a unique reward such as cash, gold, helpful items like guns, horses and tools, or bonus actions to create powerful combinations.<br/><br/>For solo play, you can play to achieve a high score or compete against one of four &quot;cowbot&quot; robot opponents, each with its own motivation.<br/><br/>For multiplayer play, players use &quot;community cards&quot; in the center of play, with players resolving each turn simultaneously. Additionally, bounty cards add competitive goals that players are racing to achieve.<br/><br/>In addition to the standard game, you can play as one of 14 wild west characters.

In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.<br/><br/>The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the falls, it's a hefty investment to replace it. And there are also the Desperadoes to contend with, who aren't above trying to plunder the riches from Adventurers returning home. Niagara is distinguished by an innovative movement mechanic as well as a beautiful three-dimensional rendering of the waterfall setting.<br/><br/> Expanded by: <br/><br/><br/>     Niagara: Diamond Joe<br/>     Niagara: The Spirits of Niagara<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dutch Blitz, each player has her own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors; red and blue cards show a Pennsylvania Dutch boy, while yellow and green cards show a Pennsylvania Dutch girl. Each deck has a different symbol on the back to aid with card sorting between rounds.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, each player lays out three cards face up in front of her to create her post piles; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to her post piles to create her blitz pile ; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.<br/><br/>Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty her blitz pile. If she has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, she plays it to the center of the table to create a Dutch pile. If she has a 2 of the same color as any 1 on top of a Dutch pile, she can place the 2 on the 1. All cards on a Dutch pile must be played in ascending order and must be the same color. A player can also play from the blitz pile onto a post pile, or from one post pile onto another, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the boys and girls alternate.<br/><br/>If a player can't play anything, she can reveal cards from the stack in her hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. She can play this top card onto a Dutch pile or post pile as long as she meets the rules for doing so.<br/><br/>As soon as a player empties her blitz pile, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of her cards among the Dutch piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in her blitz pile. Players then sort all the cards and play another round. As soon as at least one player has at least 75 points, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Note that while the Dutch Blitz: Expansion Pack allows for play of Dutch Blitz with up to eight players (by having differently colored card backs), it is also a standalone game and is therefore listed as a separate edition of Dutch Blitz despite the name.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme:<br/><br/>Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world.  Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.<br/><br/>Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.<br/><br/>Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.<br/><br/>In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.<br/><br/>Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.<br/><br/>Revised using:<br/><br/>    Talisman: Upgrade Pack<br/><br/><br/>",

On a 29&quot; x 29&quot; wooden board, players flick a large weighted disc (the striker) at smaller wooden discs (the carrom-men). The goal is to sink your 9 carrom-men (black or white), as well as the red Queen, in the four corner pockets. The first player or team to accomplish this collects points for the round (commonly called a &quot;board&quot;). A standard game of Carrom continues until one player has 25 points or 8 boards have been completed.<br/><br/>Carrom is typically played with powder, and some variations of the game use cues.  The most widely played form of 'proper' Carrom is supported by a world wide set of rules known as The Laws of Carrom, and are available from the International Carrom Federation.<br/><br/>Carrom bears similarities to Pool and Crokinole, but is a fascinating game in its own right with varied strategies and techniques. No one knows exactly where the game originated. It could have come from Bangladesh, Burma, Egypt, or Ethiopia, but most believe it originated in India.<br/><br/>Also see American Carrom and the European games in a similar vein, Korona and H-ring spel.<br/><br/>",

The game ends once all the available VPs have been claimed or the shared deck of cards runs out.<br/><br/>Ascension: Rise of Vigil, part of the Ascension deck-building game series, is both a standalone game for 2-4 players and an expansion that can be combined with any other Ascension game to support up to six players.<br/><br/>Rise of Vigil introduces treasure cards to the game system, with all treasure cards in this set being &quot;Energy Shard&quot;. When a treasure card is drawn from the shared deck, you place it in the empty space in the shared pool, then continue to draw until you reveal a hero, monster or construct to cover the treasure. When you acquire or defeat that top card, you also gain the treasure, which is added to your deck like hero and construct cards. When you play a treasure from your hand, you immediately draw another card from your deck; more importantly, you can use the energy on these cards to activate special powers on certain heroes, constructs and monsters. (Non-treasure cards can also provide energy, but they are usually worth VPs whereas treasure is worthless aside from the energy.) Energy available on a turn can be &quot;spent&quot; more than once, so if you have, say, two energy, then you can power up all cards with an Energize cost of two or less.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An iconic major league baseball game that is so well known that it is exhibited in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The game is conducted with pitcher and batter cards constructed with statistical probabilities so they realistically reproduce the real-life performance of each player for the season represented.  The gamer is placed in the role of the manager and/or general manager of a team and controls the batting order, the choice of a starting pitcher, game strategies (hit and run, steals, intentional walks, bunting, positioning of infielders, pinch hitters, defensive substitutions, pitching changes, etc.).  If a full season is played, the game produces amazingly realistic statistics at the player, team, and league levels.  The game comes in two versions: a cards and dice version that has been around since 1962 and a computer version that automatically looks up play outcomes and compiles player, team and league statistics.  Every year, Strat-O-Matic releases new player card sets based on the previous baseball season, seasons past, and some &quot;greats&quot; collections.<br/><br/>",

Highly interactive with no direct conflict.<br/><br/>Players move ants along a trail and collect food as they go. However, the value of that food depends on how the other ants move.<br/><br/>Shared incentives mean you are always trying to figure out what the other players are up to. Variable &quot;rules cards&quot; tweak the rules to every game so that each play is fresh.<br/><br/><br/>During setup, a trail of food is laid out. On each player's turn, they can move any ant to the next food in the trail that matches their color (red ant to apple, purple ant to grapes, etc). Then the player takes the food token directly in front of or behind the ant, saving it to score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>However, players don't know for sure how much the food is going to be worth until the matching ant makes it to the ant hill at the end of the trail. This creates shared incentives as players work together to advance some ants and hold others back.<br/><br/>Along the way players also have the chance to pick up chocolate, which can be turned into special actions, and wine, which provides a way to score bonus points.<br/><br/>There are four decks of cards that define the rules for the game. Each game, one card is chosen from each deck to provide a unqiue combination. Players have to adapt their strategy to the actions the other players are taking and the unique rules for this game. The &quot;rule decks&quot; are:<br/><br/><br/>     Ant Hill - Food tokens are worth more points if the matching ant gets to the hill FIRST. Or, food tokens are worth more points if the matching ants get to the ant hill LAST.<br/>     Wine - The wine tokens have a different way of scoring in every game.<br/>     Chocolate - The chocolate tokens provide a different special power in every game. And, the best way to use that power will change based on the other special rules in play.<br/>     Variant - One special rule that applies to this game which offers an extra twist.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your actions will change the incentives for the other players. Can you manage these cascading effects to collect the most valuable food collection?<br/><br/>",

Players truck to various locations around America's Heartland, picking up and dropping off goods using matching cards from their hands. Most locations have native goods that require fewer cards to load; other locations may pay a premium for those goods but may also require more fuel &ndash; and time &ndash; to get there with the cargo. With limited space in each trailer and only five cards in hand at a time, players will have to expertly manage their resources, as well as play the odds and press their luck to be the best trucker on the road.<br/><br/>The Great Heartland Hauling Co. offers a lot of replay value through the use of cards to create a variable board set-up each game. The game includes 60 goods cubes, four thick cardboard trucks, and 46 resource cards &ndash; required for pick-up and delivery &ndash; that are drawn from a shared draft board, as well as 20 fuel cards, which are used to move about the Heartland.<br/><br/>",

Gather resources to add buildings with new actions and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.<br/><br/>In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.<br/><br/>Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.<br/><br/>You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common.

But life isn't only about work. Your village baker longs for a partner, and the farmer's son has his eye on the dashing woodcutter in the neighboring village.<br/><br/>So let the wedding bells ring and marry off that farmer's son in the village of another player, thereby earning you additional income. And surely your village baker will find a woman from a neighboring village to move in with him. Before you know it, their offspring will be new citizens in your village.<br/><br/>Your goal in Helvetia is to build new homes, bring culture to your village, and sell essential goods at market. Whatever strategy you choose, this village life won't be boring &ndash; especially in the villages that grow and thrive!<br/><br/>",

Now it's up to you, a team of detectives, to crack the case, find the culprit, and recover the missing MacGuffin.<br/><br/>Start by searching for hidden symbols in each room of the museum and find the matching symbols on the codex.

In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess.

        "description": "Far to the south of The Last Ruin lies a cliffside village called The Monument. For generations, it protected an ancient shrine until the day a crystal meteorite descended. The meteor's denizens slowly crept out into the world&mdash;bizarre monstrosities from nightmare, attacking all in their path. As they spread across the land, there was no intelligent malice nor grand invasion strategy; the creatures acted like a fungus&mdash;spreading into new territory sporadically. After many fruitless attempts to expel the monsters, the people of The Monument fled as their village crumbled, exiled to distant lands, resigned to a nomadic existence.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, there are rumors that the bizarre monsters are growing weak. They&rsquo;re slower, less impervious to attack, some undergoing a gradual petrification until they crumble to dust. Is it the atmosphere? Are they dying of old age? Do they suffer from a strange disease? No one is certain, but as the news spreads, various factions set their eyes on the vacant, ruined village of The Monument. The original villagers, now refugees, are desperate to return and rebuild. But they must do it quickly, before someone else claims their home. This is their chance. It&rsquo;s now or never.<br/><br/>In Now or Never, you and up to three friends compete to best rebuild your ancestral village and guide the rest of the villagers on their journey home. Although the creatures of the meteorite have lost much of their strength, many of them remain, and you must fight them off to protect traveling villagers. Now or Never is the third game in the Arzium storybook series that includes Above and Below and Near and Far.<br/><br/>Now or Never is a competitive strategy game that allows you to:<br/><br/><br/>     Choose one of four asymmetrical characters to play.<br/>     Rebuild the village so that returning villagers have a place to live. You must carefully choose what and where to build to maintain an advantage, earning the biggest rewards for long-term planning.<br/>     Interact with other players by hiring their specialists to perform special actions.<br/>     Combat dangerous creatures to rescue villagers.<br/>     Explore a fantasy landscape filled with bizarre places, technology, and peoples.<br/><br/><br/>Now or Never includes two modes of play: standard and story. When playing in story mode, you read from a storybook when you explore, making choices and learning more about the characters and the world. Each character has their own set of stories, unique to the locations they explore and diverse in plot, perspective, and motive, allowing you to choose what direction your own story will take.<br/><br/>Journey to The Monument and help rebuild your ancient home!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Love Letter: The Hobbit &ndash; The Battle of the Five Armies is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players based on the original Love Letter game by Seiji Kanai. The deck consists of 17 cards, with the Arkenstone being valued #8, Bilbo Baggins #7, and so on down to The One Ring at #0.<br/><br/>In each round, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, using the power on that card to expose others and (possibly) knock them out of the round. If you're the final player active in the round or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point. In LL: The Hobbit, The One Ring does nothing during play, but it counts as a #7 when the game ends, possibly leading to a tie should someone else hold Bilbo.<br/><br/>In addition to the one extra card, LL: The Hobbit differs from the original game in that the Baron (#3) is represented by two separate cards: Tauriel and Legolas. When you use an elf's power to compare cards, Tauriel knocks out the player with the higher valued card while Legolas targets the lower valued card. (This change isn't in the German edition, where Legolas and Tauriel have the same text.)<br/><br/>Whoever first wins 4-7 rounds, with the number dependent on the number of players, wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Carefully observe strange clues and ominous patterns in the things going on in the apartments across the way. There are parties, knives, a saw, bickering, laughing, music...and a mysterious trunk. Do you detect a murder? Or is the secret, private world of the neighbors planting frightening ideas in your mind?<br/><br/>In Rear Window, one player takes the role of director Alfred Hitchcock &mdash; the &quot;Master of Suspense&quot; &mdash; and communicates via building windows clues and signs for the other players without ever uttering a word, ideally giving them enough to go on that they can figure out who the murderer is &mdash; or whether a murder even took place.<br/><br/>If a murderer is out there, you need to nail down all eight attributes of that person by the end of four rounds without them catching on to what you see and know.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Under a blazing sun in 4th century BCE, traders come from all corners of the Mediterranean Sea to Corinth to sell their goods; Persian carpets, Cretan olive oil, Roman grapes, and Egyptian spices are highly prized by traders. Players have a few weeks to secure their place in Corinthian lore as its most savvy trader!<br/><br/>Corinth is a roll-and-write game akin to a dice-only version of the board game Yspahan. At the start of a turn, the active player rolls nine dice, then places all the dice with the highest value on the gold space at the top of the chart, then starts placing dice from the bottom of the chart up, with each value of dice being on a separate level.<br/><br/>The active player takes all the dice on one level, then the action associated with that level. The top level gives the player as many gold as the number of dice they took; the bottom level gives goats instead of gold; and the middle levels allow a player to deliver goods to a number of market stalls on their personal player sheet equal to the dice claimed. (You have four colors of market stalls, and once you start marking off, say, rugs in one of the blue areas, you have to finish marking off all the rugs in that area before you can start marking off another blue area.)<br/><br/>The active player can spend gold to roll up to three extra yellow dice and thereby increase the odds of getting to take a desired level; if the active player doesn't take any of these yellow dice, they are removed from play, preventing others from benefitting at that player's expense.<br/><br/>Instead of marking off gold, goats, or goods, you can use the value of the die or dice claimed (1-6) to move the steward on your personal score sheet. The steward starts in the middle of a 5x5 grid on your sheet, and you must move it as many spaces as the number of pips on the die value claimed, not crossing over any line you've drawn previously. You can pay 1 gold to move the steward one more or one fewer space, and you can pay as much gold as you want to do this. You can receive gold, goats, or goods from where the steward stops, but beyond that, you can earn points. When the steward stops on a corner space of this grid, you count the number of spaces circled to this point, with some spaces counting twice, then you write down that number, scoring that many points at game's end. If you stop in another corner later, you do the same thing again, which compounds the value of all your previous movement.<br/><br/>You can spend gold or goats to construct buildings that give you bonus powers, such as collecting two additional gold whenever you collect any gold or moving the steward up to two spaces more or less without paying.<br/><br/>After 16 turns (with four players) or 18 turns (with two or three players), the game ends and you tally points for goods delivered, spaces visited by the steward, buildings constructed, and goats and gold still on hand.<br/><br/>",

You play cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete World War II squad-level combat missions.<br/><br/>The core game and 4 expansions provides you with all the cards you need to play as, or against, the Americans, British, or Germans in post D-Day Europe.<br/><br/>This includes the soldiers, weapons, equipment, and tactics used by each of those nations. Everything you need to create your own unique squad of soldiers!<br/><br/>At the start of each mission, you each select one or more Player Soldiers, equip them with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit. You then fight your way through hostile territory and engage enemy soldiers, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective. Every mission is a stand-alone game. You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>Warfighter uses a new combat system that takes into account the fire mode you select for your weapon, range to the target, running out of ammo, suppression fire, and cover - all in the same dice roll!<br/><br/>This system creates an incredibly deep narrative with every attack. As you eliminate soldiers, you gain experience to Upgun your Action cards, play Support cards, and activate special Skills.<br/><br/>There are 3 levels of Soldiers in Warfighter: Player Soldiers, Non-Player Soldiers, and Squad Soldiers.<br/><br/>",

One tile always remains outside the labyrinth, and players take turns taking this extra tile and sliding it into a row of the labyrinth, moving all those tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board; this newly removed tile becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.<br/><br/>Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures.

Whereas in 1870 there are still many clippers around and the good old paddle steamer &quot;Scotia&quot; sails the North Atlantic, sea trade is dominated by the end of this era by huge vessels like &quot;Mauretania&quot;(Cunard), &quot;Olympic&quot;(White Star), or &quot;Imperator&quot;(Hapag).<br/><br/>In Transatlantic, 2 to 4 players lead their own shipping companies, which transport freight, mail, and passengers around the globe. They purchase new steamships from the market, each of them historical with their individual technical data (tons, knots etc.). Competition is tough, especially in the North Atlantic where winning the &quot;Blue Riband&quot; is not only a matter of prestige, but may also be a profitable investment. In order to let a shipping company flourish, purchasing the best steamships is not enough, if one fails to acquire enough coal bunkers and trade posts as well.<br/><br/>The game is driven by cards; on each turn, play one card and execute the related action. As new cards enter the game, build your individual deck of cards with new or improved possibilities. The task is to manage your merchant fleet most efficiently. It's a maritime strategy game with low luck, lots of interactive choices, and tough decisions.<br/><br/>",

Choose your assassins according to their unique abilities, level up during the campaign, and unlock new skills for each of them.<br/><br/>Fight or stay incognito thanks to the equipment found in chests or manufactured by Leonardo Da Vinci. Evade your pursuers by climbing on roofs and towers, then synchronize to reveal new game elements. Bribe your enemies, use secret hideouts to escape patrols, and flip mechanisms to change the level layout. After each memory, fall back to your headquarters to heal your wounds, grow your brotherhood's fame, and craft special equipment. The game features a save system that allows the number of players to vary between each campaign and the level of play adjusts according to the number of players.<br/><br/>The retail edition of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice features the same scenarios as the original Kickstarter release and therefore the same gameplay experience. What has changed is that all of the miniatures other than the five detailed assassin figurines have been replaced with standees, so the game includes 5 miniatures, 139 standees, 6 secret envelopes, 41 tiles, and more than 400 cards.<br/><br/>Many surprises await in the sealed envelopes.

The Allied player must rush his ground forces forward as fast as possible to relieve his beleaguered airborne divisions and capture a bridge across the Rhine.<br/><br/>The scale of the map is 2 kilometers per hex and covers the battlefield from the Belgian border to Arnhem.

It is basically a simple move-fight, I-go then u-go game. If you have played Ardennes '44: The Battle of the Bulge or Normandy '44 you will have no trouble learning the game. Rules such as ZOC Bonds, Determined Defense, Extended Movement, and Traffic Markers all make their reappearance.

By using certain powers to peek at your own cards, spy on your opponent's cards, or swap a card with an opponent, you can try to minimize the value of your cards. When you think you have the lowest value, you can call &quot;CABO&quot; to end the round, but everyone else gets another turn. In the end, the player with the lowest total wins; can you shed your cards quicker than your opponents?<br/><br/>This second edition of CABO features modified rules, a scorepad, four player reference cards, and all new artwork. Rules modifications include the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Plays 2&ndash;4 players (instead of 2&ndash;5)<br/>     Cards taken from the discard pile remain face up for the rest of the game, even when in front of players (instead of always keeping cards face down)<br/>     Penalty for non-matching cards: Keep all cards including the one drawn &mdash; one more per additional cards that do not match (instead of no penalty)<br/>     10 point penalty for missing a CABO call (instead of 5)<br/>     All players score the sum of their points; if the CABO caller has (or is tied for) the lowest sum, they get 0 points (instead of the lowest player always receiving 0 points)<br/>     The round ends after a CABO call or the deck runs out (instead of just when CABO is called)<br/>     Limit of one reset to 50 when your score=100 exactly (instead of unlimited resets)<br/><br/><br/>",

The area is best known today for its eccentric skyline, with the houses having been built from scrapped fishing boats and the metal being colorfully painted to create a patchwork effect across the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Creating skylines of similar beauty and eccentricity is the goal of the construction teams that play La Boca. In shifting teams of two that sit across from one another, players try to create skylines on challenge cards &ndash; but the players can see the completed image only from their point of view, so they must consult with one another constantly to make sure each colored block ends up in the right location while racing against the timer. The faster the players complete their building, the more points they score. Then the next team takes a seat, breaks down the blocks, then begins building anew. Whoever has the most points after a certain number of rounds will stand atop La Boca and glory in the cheers of the Argentinian public!<br/><br/>",

Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.<br/><br/>Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7&times;7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.<br/><br/>What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.<br/><br/>If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...<br/><br/>",

The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store, and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>In this two-player card game Odin's Ravens, two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks comprising domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.<br/><br/>In this first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.<br/><br/>The Odin's Ravens (Second Edition) transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Loki deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire. Whoever reaches the end of the world first wins.<br/><br/>",

Translated loosely as &quot;elephant game&quot;, the name of XiangQi may have first been recorded in Songs of Chu during the 4th century BC of early China; in the state of Qi during the Warring State Period, the name &quot;XiangQi&quot; meant ivory Liubo pieces, not modern XiangQi played by Chinese. The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.<br/><br/>Based closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>XiangQi, commonly referred to in English as &quot;Chinese Chess&quot;, is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.<br/><br/>The pieces on both sides and their movements &amp; special rules are:<br/><br/><br/>    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to &lsquo;see&rsquo; the enemy General on an open file.<br/>    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.<br/>    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.<br/>    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.<br/>    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.<br/>    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.<br/>    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.<br/><br/><br/>Pieces capture as they move and never jump. The only exception (for both rules) apply to the cannon.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The price of the game varies depending on the material used in the game. Inexpensive sets are usually made with plastic or low-grade wooden pieces and a paper gameboard. Expensive sets are usually made with jade or high-grade wooden pieces and a wooden gameboard.<br/><br/>Variants<br/><br/>    Banqi - Game using same pieces<br/>    Giog - Game using same pieces<br/>    Mini Xiang Qi - Smaller version<br/>    San Guo Qi - Three-player version<br/>    Qi Guo Xiang Qi - Seven-player version<br/>    Changgi - Korean version<br/><br/><br/>You can play Chinese Chess for free at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.xiangqi.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.xiangqi.com</a>.<br/><br/>",

During a turn, each player (who starts the game with several inspiration tokens) chooses one of the three following actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Take up to three gems from one column and place them on top of their individual board &mdash; or by spending a token, place them in a more strategic position.<br/>    Spend one token to use one of eight available actions; moving gems up or down by the number of chakra spaces indicated on the action is the key to reaching a perfect alignment.<br/>    Meditate to reclaim an inspiration token and secretly look at the point value, which is common to all players, that a harmonized chakra (3 same-colored gems) will score.<br/><br/><br/>When a player manages to align five of their chakras, the last turn is played before you perform the final scoring.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

People lived, travelled, and traded between the Alps mountain range and the river Po. The main occupations of the Terramara people were hunting, farming and metallurgy, casting bronze tools like axe heads in stone molds. The houses in the villages were built on piles, meaning each house is built above the ground, supported by wooden stakes.<br/><br/>In Terramara, you play as the chief of a clan living in one of these villages. Your goal is to develop your clan, exploring lands farther away to trade with other villages, and reach sacred places. You improve your battle strength and discover new technologies to create useful artefacts. The player who develops the best clan by gaining more development points becomes leader of all of Terramara and wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Lurkers are represented by a deck of various types of enemies that add to the variety of enemies heroes must defeat in the game.<br/><br/>While heroes attempt to complete their quest before drawing the attention of the almighty villain, the unstable magic of the altars constantly affect the game.

The game spans four centuries during which you erect the most prestigious buildings and places of the city. Construction is not enough: you also have to ensure your presence in the great spheres of power. It is up to you and your opponents to build Qu&eacute;bec City in your colors!<br/><br/>A game takes place over four centuries. Each player plays on average 5 to 7 turns per century. On each turn, players choose one of these actions :<br/><br/>     Start a new building with his architect<br/>     Complete part of a building<br/>     Send a worker to a zone of influence<br/>     Take a leader card<br/><br/><br/>By contributing to the numerous buildings, players acquire influence with the authorities of the time : religion, politics, commerce and culture. Players also help build the famous Citadelle.<br/><br/>At the end of each century, there is a scoring round where players get victory points for the workers they managed to send in the 5 zones of influence. Qu&eacute;bec introduces a unique and addictive majority rule. The player with the majority in a zone cascades half of his workers by moving them to the next zone. Workers moved in this way allow a player to score even more points. If a player still has the majority in the next zone, his workers cascade again &ndash; a potentially devastating ripple effect. This mechanism illustrates the interrelationship between the great zones of influence. Players must not only fight to get majorities, they must also erect the most prestigious buildings.<br/><br/>The game ends after the fourth century. Players then receive points for the buildings they completed. The player with the most points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Qu&eacute;bec won the Plateau d'or 2007 and was shortlisted at the 2007 Boulogne-Billancourt International Designer Contest.<br/><br/>",

In Tiny Epic Pirates you take control of a Pirate ship with the goal of burying vast amounts of wealth on secret island hideaways.<br/><br/>Each turn, you move your Captain Token around your ship&rsquo;s action wheel (rondel), selecting which action to perform... Plunder, Trade, Crew Up, Attack, or Search. Each player has a randomized and unique arrangement of these actions on their rondel. Sailing your Pirate Ship is something every player can do every time they take an action. Plundering allows you to acquire booty from settlements at a very reasonable rate. It&rsquo;s amazing how negotiating changes when your blunderbuss is at the ready. A crate of gunpowder for a promise of no harm? Fair exchange. Trading allows you to sell your ill-gotten goods to the Black Market for gold. Each Market is only interested in a specific good, so make sure you are sailing in the right direction. Timing is everything, sell your good at the wrong time and it&rsquo;s worth a pittance. Crew Up adds a new crew member to your growing Pirate Ship. Crew increases your ship&rsquo;s combat advantage and unlocks new abilities for each spoke of your ship&rsquo;s action wheel, making that action more powerful every time you take it!  Attacking Merchant Ships and other Pirates will  grow your reputation. It also happens to be a great way to score some gold and more booty to sell. Be enough of a menace and you may just become a Legend of the Sea!<br/><br/>Search the high-seas for treasures left behind by the unfortunate souls that preceded you. Salvage old ship parts for temporary aid or get lucky and find something worth selling.<br/><br/>The end of the game is triggered once a player has buried three treasures. To do this, a player must first acquire the amount of gold required to bury at the various bury spots on the map. After all players have had an equal number of turns. The player who has buried three treasures wins the game. Ties are decided by the player who has the highest legendary status, followed by which player has the most gold.<br/><br/>--description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Royal Navy gave Franklin two heavy Ships (HMS Terror and HMS Erebus) filled with scientific equipment, 1000 books, a crew of 128 men, and enough food to last for three years. They left England in May and encountered whalers along the west coast of Greenland in August. There, they waited for more favorable weather conditions for the crossing of the Lancaster Sound. Once the weather improved, they sailed into unknown waters, and no one ever heard from them again...<br/><br/>Their disappearance provoked a great deal of turmoil in public opinion, and numerous British and American expeditions attempted to find their trail. As leaders of these expeditions in Expedition: Northwest Passage, players must venture into these hazardous Arctic waters in order to discover Franklin's fate and succeed where he failed &ndash; by finding the Northwest Passage. Players allocate their crewmen in their ship or in their sled to perform various actions such as exploring, moving, or gathering clues on the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the seasons will pass and parts of the sea will be frozen, blocking the way for the ships. Players acquire victory points by gathering clues, mapping the area, and &ndash; of course &ndash; discovering the Northwest Passage. However, in order to claim victory, one has to come back home to the Greenland on time!<br/><br/>",

At the end of each mission is a powerful super villain &mdash; and after the first super villain is defeated, the campaign continues to the second super villain. Each super villain, and each randomized mission, gets harder until players reach Thanos, the final super villain.<br/><br/>",

What's more, the king has declared that at this feast, he will choose his new Hand &mdash; and you have a chance of rising to this lofty position. Of course, you're not the only one with eyes set on becoming the power behind the Iron Throne. In A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King, you need to scheme and backstab to outwit your opponents, and you need the help of Varys, the Master of Whispers, to do it.<br/><br/>Hand of the King is a fast-paced card game of conspiracies and sudden twists of fate for two to four players, challenging each of you to gain the most support among the twisted intrigues of the King&rsquo;s Landing court. Each turn, you send Varys to do your bidding, moving through the court and inciting iconic characters from A Song of Ice and Fire to support your cause. With the help of some companions and crafty alliances with other players, you just might rise to become the king's new Hand!<br/><br/>In more detail, players move Varys in orthogonal lines in a 6x6 grid, stopping it on a character token, then collecting that token and any other character from that House that you passed over. Possess as many characters from a House as someone else, and you claim the banner from that person. Collect the final character from a House, and you immediately use the power of one of six companions; since the game contains fourteen companions, the mix of powers will differ each game.<br/><br/>",

You have nothing but your fear, a flickering candle, and a question: How long will your light last?<br/><br/>Trapped and crawling your way through a pitch-black labyrinth, equipped with nothing but dim candles, you must work together to explore the maze and escape. Unfortunately, your weak candlelight illuminates only your immediate surroundings. Worse still, horrifying Wax Eaters &mdash; monsters who despise the light &mdash; lurk in the suffocating darkness for their opportunity to strike.<br/><br/>The Night Cage is a fully co-operative, horror-themed tile-placement game that traps 1-5 lost souls within an unnatural labyrinth of eternal darkness. To win, players must each collect a key, find a gate, and escape as a group.<br/><br/>Escape won't be easy as each player's visibility is limited by the weak light of their candle. They illuminate only tiles directly connected to their own, and when players move, tiles that fall into darkness are removed from the game. Doubling back the way you came only opens new paths, the old ones being lost forever with critical keys and gates vanishing if your light move away from them...<br/><br/>",

The game features several unique systems, including alternating activations that keep the players engaged; a Rank System that changes a unit's capabilities as the battle rages on; a Tactics System that provides strategic powers fueled by a finite resource each round; and, most importantly, the iconic Heroes, such as Robb Stark and Jaime Lannister, that can change the course of war both on and off the battlefield.<br/><br/>The Stark vs Lannister Starter Set has everything needed for two players to fight epic battles. Containing forces for both House Stark and House Lannister, players build their armies, select leaders, construct their tactics deck, and engage in one of five different game modes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Security forces were activated immediately and they arrested a suspicious young laborer near the area.<br/><br/>Mycroft Holmes, at the service of the crown, was commissioned to investigate the relationship of the young laborer with anarchist groups. He thinks it will be an easy task that he can do from the comfort of his armchair in the Diogenes Club &mdash; until he is informed of disturbing news; his younger brother Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, has been hired by the boy's parents to prove the innocence of his son, who believes to be a scapegoat of a dark conspiracy.<br/><br/>For the first time, the brightest minds in London face each other. Was the young laborer involved in this terrible attack or he is just a scapegoat for a dark conspiracy?<br/><br/>A game of Holmes: Sherlock &amp; Mycroft lasts seven turns (days of investigation). At the beginning of each day, famous characters extracted from the books of Arthur Conan Doyle appear in London.<br/><br/>Each player has three action tokens that move from one character to another to use their special abilities, knowing that a player can never have two tokens on the same character. Therefore, a character must be freed before reuse. The abilities of each character allow them to obtain Evidence Cards or gain Investigation Tokens in multiple ways. The game has great replay value because it is not known whether a character with a specific ability will make their appearance on the board in the Day 1 or in the final Day 7. Each game is different!<br/><br/>",

Three bush-fire spaces and one rock space will remain unoccupied in your park for the entire game, and six tree spaces and four grass spaces are unoccupied at the start of play.<br/><br/>On a turn, you name a specific face-up tile that all players must pick up, flip face down, then move to a different empty space within their own park. Tiles that have been flipped cannot move again, and once all tiles have moved, the game ends with a scoring round. First, tiles adjacent to bush fires are removed if they depict as many animals as the number of fires (1, 2, or 3) on the bush-fire space. Score for each grass and tree uncovered on your board. Finally, score for each of the six animal species; the bigger the main herd of each of species and the more water holes it contains, the more points you score, e.g. a herd of five rhinos and three watering holes is worth (5x3) 15 points. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Savannah Park includes a solo mode, a set-up variant that allows you to place the bush fires and trees where you wish, and a scoring variant that rewards you for bumping a lion out of the animals' way.<br/><br/>",

These are revealed simultaneously and then resolved in a set order.

Once a building is built, the tile is moved to reveal spaces for workers. These spaces give bonus points at the end of the game.

The flooding of the Nile is coming to an end and the lands of the Valley are ready to offer their riches. Organize the collection of resources, build districts with the most lucrative shops, supply them with goods and earn the most Debens for the glory of the Pharaoh. The player who will make the best use of the resources of the Nile Valley will win the game.<br/><br/>Fertility is a simple resource management game that raises tough decisions for you to take. Each turn, you collect some of the riches of the Valley of the Nile and immediately decide how to use them : supply one of your Shop to earn money, or spend them to build new districts, offering you new opportunities. Be wise because your choices are irreversible. None of the resources already stocked in your shops can be moved or reused until the end of the game. But any resource unspent by the end of your turn will be definitively lost. Optimize your turns and choices if you want to win.<br/><br/>A player&rsquo;s turn goes through three fast and simple steps. They start by placing one of their Valley tile on the central board in order to collect resources : alabaster, bovines, papyrus flowers, grapes or wheat. They then have the opportunity to spend these resources to build a new District tile on their Metropolis board, for opening new opportunities. Lastly, they supply their Shops in their Metropolis by stocking the remaining resources. Any resource that a player has left unused at the end of their turn is lost. So, the aim is to collect as many resources as possible, but even more to be able to optimize how to use them. The game ends after 9 turns and each totally supplied Shop is worth money for their owner. The player with the highest amount of money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

They select warriors of all ages and lands and whisk them away to the Hormonde where the enslaved gladiators must fight for their souls and the chance to become the ultimate champion. Why don't the gods put an end to this macabre circus? Why does Xelor himself turn a blind eye to the demons' meddling with time's delicate web? Well, you may ask, but it is not for us mortals to know the minds of the gods.<br/><br/>Krosmaster: Arena is a player-vs-player, tactical card game with anime-style miniatures that offers the craftiest tacticians among you the chance to challenge other players to heated battles in arenas scattered around Hormonde. All players build their team using a pre-determined method, whether a point system, draft, or at random. Equip your team with spells, weapons and other items adapted to their requirements, then utilize their various talents and abilities to create a powerful fighting force. Every figure has a point value attached to it to help balance things out. Randomly drawn event cards spice up the game at each turn, and the winning conditions differ for each game based on the scenario you choose to play. Only those who are able to create a strong, yet versatile, strategy will prevail!<br/><br/>",

To win, you have to gamble your relationships with the most powerful bosses in town to win influence. This influence comes in many forms: Law, Money and Force. If you&rsquo;re clever enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to take claim over the buildings in the evergrowing boomtowns and gain powerful abilities. At the end of the day, the boss who has the best combination of wit and bluff will become the most powerful tycoon in the Wild Wild West.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY: The game is played in a series of rounds.  Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle.  Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight. If you have the highest stake in the most lucrative industry at the end, you will be rewarded bonus points. Add these points to the points you've collected from buying buildings and determine the winner!

        "description": "Once an age, a mythic wind lifts the veil between the spirit world and ours. Whimsical seraphs, drawn to the vigor of an ancient forest, descend through clouds to once again take up their centennial game. You are one of these seraphs &ndash; a being of great power and curiosity. The life of the forest fascinates you, and you eagerly gather plant, animal, and sprite alike to add to your mystical menagerie. But beware, for you are not alone. Other beings just like yourself contest to collect the life of the forest as well!<br/><br/>In Spirits of the Forest, players represent the four elements that nourish the forces of nature. Up to four players compete to acquire the most (of nine different) spirit symbols, which are bound to a different element of nature. Each turn, a player drafts up to two spirit tiles from the forest (a common pool of 48 spirit tiles), collects favor tokens, and moves, places, or recovers gemstones. Players continue taking turns until all tiles have been collected from the forest. At the end of the game, players score nature points for each spirit (augmented by favor tokens) of which they have a majority. Whoever has the most nature points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Two athmospheric Soundtracks by the author Michael Schacht enrich the gameplay of Spirits of the Forest and Moonlight:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://metricsystem1981.bandcamp.com/album/spirits-of-the-forest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://metricsystem1981.bandcamp.com/album/spirits-of-the-f...</a> <br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://ditto.fm/spirits-of-the-forest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://ditto.fm/spirits-of-the-forest</a><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://metricsystem1981.bandcamp.com/album/moonlight-spirits-of-the-forest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://metricsystem1981.bandcamp.com/album/moonlight-spirit...</a><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://ditto.fm/moonlight-metric-system-1981\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://ditto.fm/moonlight-metric-system-1981</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Tinners' Trail, set in 19th century Cornwall, you represent a mining conglomerate at the height of the tin and copper mining industry. You must buy plots of land across Cornwall in auctions and survey them for tin and copper, always managing your &quot;work points&quot; and money effectively.<br/><br/>Once you have a mine in place, it's time to extract the ore and (ideally) make a profit, but the deeper your mine goes, the more expensive the process gets. To reduce the cost of mining, you can place developments, such as ports, train stations, and adits (drainage tunnels), but there's only so many improvements to go around. Once you have made your money &mdash; trying to time the market to sell when prices are high &mdash; you can invest it in industries outside of Cornwall, which gains you victory points. The earlier you invest, the better the return. Can you outplay the competition and make the most money, or will you be left without two shillings to rub together?<br/><br/>This edition of Tinners' Trail differs from the original 2008 version in several ways. The player count, for example, is now 1-5 instead of 3-4, and the resources on the board are now set up via tiles instead of die rolls to maintain variability while reducing the randomness. Dual-use cards are now an important part of the game, giving you information before an auction or an extra boost after an auction.<br/><br/>With lead development and expansion designs by David Digby<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.<br/><br/>After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.<br/><br/>Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "London, 1899: in the renowned Diamonds Club meet four successful gemstone dealers in an ambitious competition: they want to equip magnificently their country estates -- with the profit made from the gemstone trade. To do that, they invest their money in mines, mining rights and the latest technologies. The player who has the most valuable park at the end of the game is the Lord of Diamonds!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to build a magnificent park with many (different) attractions. The game ends, when the first player completes his or her park. Then victory points are scored based on the contents of the parks, technology advancements and achievements gained during the game. The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Diamonds Club is played in turns until the end condition is met by the first player. Each turn is divided into different phases. In the first phase players take turns placing coins on a central board to gain several benefits: mines, ships and prospector rights to gain gemstones, technology advancements or wildlife park attractions for the own park.<br/>To gain the benefit of a square you have to place one coin plus the sum of all vertical and horizontal placed coins. So as the players take turns, the available benefits grow more and more expensive.<br/>Once every player has passed, the players may change a combination of ship, prospector rights and mine into as many gemstones as the lowest value on all of the counters depicts.<br/>In the final phase the players can buy new attractions for their park using the earned gemstones.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, there are several achievements, for example to be the first player having 5 equal attractions, or a special combination of attractions. Those score later extra points for the player who won this. Also, there are several technologies, which could raise the value of woods in the park, increase the gemstone income of the player or increases the number of coins available each round for the player. On the higher levels those technologies also score additional points in the final scoring.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An extra Treefrog game for Essen 2008.<br/><br/>A relatively simple train game set in North America and involving shares and building railway lines with a few twists thrown in.<br/><br/>Each player uses their investment cubes to bid for control of companies, (six in all). When you take control of a company you receive one share, which means that only one share per turn can be purchased. The cubes you bid with go into the company and allow it to build track. Each location has a value which determines how much profit you receive for connecting it. After companies have built as much track as they can players are paid the profit that each company they control has made this turn. Profit levels are reset for the following turn. Players get another set of cubes to bid with and then bid again for control of companies.<br/><br/>Cash earned from shares is really victory points, it cannot be used to bid on future shares. As each player receives the same number of investment cubes each turn there is no positive feedback for owning the best shares.<br/><br/>The game lasts five turns. At the end of the game each company will pay out an additional amount of profit to each share held. This level is determined by how many different regions a company is connected to, (it's a little more involved than that, and coloured cubes are moved around!).<br/><br/>About Steel Driver, Martin Wallace states in the rulebook:  &quot;I&rsquo;ve had it in mind to develop and update the system used in Prairie Railroads to fix some of the rougher elements.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board. The central idea is that a column of marbles has weight given by the number of marbles in line. Someone will need to push with a heavier group of marbles in order to push the column along that axis. However, with six possible directions, it's difficult to defend yourself perfectly. Also, it's possible to play the game with up to six players when supplemental marble sets are purchased.<br/><br/>A winner of the 1988 Concours International de Créateurs de Jeux de Société.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On June 18, 1815, one of the most decisive battles in military history was fought in Belgian fields twenty miles southeast of Brussels. Within a short 100 days, Napoleon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.<br/><br/>Napoleon invaded Belgium on June 15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoleon.<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/><br/>     Mapboard which is a color map of southern Belgium. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Wooden Blocks as counters provide step-reduction and fog of war with no muss or fuss <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Two or three player game - Napoleon can be played by two or three players. With three, the allied side has two players, one British and one Prussian, and some special rules apply. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Note that there are essentially three different versions of the game which means that the rules are somewhat different. Key Differences in the various editions:<br/>         1st and 2nd edition had 48 blocks--shorter (60+ min.) play time -- vs.-- 3rd edition has 84 blocks--more accurate division level<br/>          3rd edition had Bl&uuml;cher, Napoleon, and Wellington leader blocks that give slight combat and movement bonuses. Although units have increased nearly two fold, the 3rd edition map remains same size, leading to overcrowding.<br/>          4th edition has 56 blocks and a larger map - play time is usually 90 minutes or less.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

Pharaohs, The Nile, Civilizations, and Monuments as well as the occasional catastrophe are all here.<br/><br/>Instead of auctions, the core mechanism of Ra, each player rolls 5 dice and can reroll any of them up to two times. The five dice have identical sides, but different colors - the die color matters in some occasions (eg. a player can't claim purple civilization square with a green die). Then, according to the roll, the player claims some squares on the central board (civilizations, monuments, Niles etc.) or moves the Ra figure, which determines the remaining time in Epoch. One die side is a joker and can be used as any other side, as long as one of the other dice actually shows the mentioned other side.<br/>Players need to consider how to utilize their roll for the best personal gain. Scoring takes place in three Epochs (with monuments only scored after the third) and is nearly identical as in the original Ra, but this time the score is kept on a score track on the edge of the board, instead of tokens.<br/><br/>From the box: Remember Ra! Now Reiner has added dice to the game and in such a great way. Players still try to score by collecting Pharaohs, niles and floods, monuments and civilizations, but this time they roll dice and choose which to keep and which to re-roll. True to the original game, players must watch out for disasters and each of the three rounds ends when &quot;Ra&quot; shows up a set number of times, so players need to watch Ra and decide when the round may end and when they have more time. After three rounds, the player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Renowned mediums are competing to figure out a secret object and prove they can connect with the &quot;World Beyond&quot;. The first team to figure out the secret object wins!<br/><br/>To set up Phantom Ink, divide players so that the Sun team and the Moon team each have one Spirit and up to three Mediums. The mediums on a team share a hand of seven question cards, and the spirits begin the game by choosing one of the five objects on a card as the secret object. On a turn, the mediums pass two question cards to their spirit, with sample questions like &quot;What color is it most commonly?&quot;, &quot;What fictional character has it or uses it?&quot;, and &quot;If it were a musical instrument, what would it be?&quot;<br/><br/>The spirit discards one question card face up, then returns the question card it's going to answer to their mediums, then slowly writes the answer one letter at a time for all to see. As soon as the mediums think they know what this clue word is, they yell &quot;Silencio&quot;, and the spirit stops writing. The other team of mediums might see only the letter &quot;Y&quot;, but if you know the question is &quot;What color is it?&quot;, then you know the clue must be &quot;yellow&quot;. To end your turn, draw two new question cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, instead of handing over question cards, you can attempt to guess the answer &mdash; and to do so you write like the spirits, one letter at a time. If you write an incorrect letter, the spirits will stop you, marking out your error, with your partial guess giving the other team more information. If you guess the entire word correctly, you win!<br/><br/>Awards &amp; Honors:<br/>Game Makers Guild - Seal of Approval<br/>The Dice Tower - Seal of Approval<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nevsky: Teutons and Rus in Collision 1240-1242 is a board wargame about the storied clash between Latin Teutonic and Orthodox Russian powers along the Baltic frontier of the mid-13th-Century. It is the first volume in GMT Games&rsquo; &quot;Levy &amp; Campaign Series&quot; portraying military operations in a variety of pre-industrial conflicts. In Nevsky players raise and equip their armies, then provision and maneuver them to ravage or conquer enemy territory or defeat enemy forces in battle. Feudal politics obligate an array of lords and vassals to serve on campaign&mdash;but only for limited periods. Players must keep an eye on the calendar and reward lords to keep their armies in the field.<br/><br/>Nevsky is solitaire friendly or can add a rules option with screens that hide what the two players&rsquo; lords levy. A second option adds detail regarding vassal forces&rsquo; terms of service.<br/><br/>In Nevsky, two players take the roles of &ldquo;Russians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teutons&rdquo;, respectively. The Russians represent the wealthy city-state of Novgorod and its allies. The Teutons comprise German and Danish landholders&mdash;including the Teutonic Order&mdash;expanding a Baltic dominion.<br/><br/>The sides every 40 days will levy various lords and vassals and their forces, transport, and capabilities, backed by higher political authorities&mdash;a papal legate for the Teutons and Novgorod&rsquo;s city council (veche) for the Russians. Each lord is rated for fealty, lordship, service, and command and lays out his forces and assets on a mat. Wooden pieces represent units of knights, mounted sergeants, light and Asiatic cavalry, men-at-arms, and unarmored serfs and militia. Assets include counters for transport such as carts, boats, and sleds; provender to feed the army; and coin to pay for longer service or booty captured by ravaging or conquering enemy regions.<br/><br/>The players then plan and command a campaign for that 40 days with the lords who have mustered. To represent the limits of communications on medieval operations, stacks of command cards commit players to activating lords in a sequence that may or may not meet the needs of the developing situation. Cylinder pieces on the map show the lords&rsquo; maneuvers, while markers on a feudal calendar show how much longer the lords will serve, influenced by success or failure in their campaigns. When lords clash in field battle or storming a castle, players array their lords&rsquo; mats left, right, center, and reserve and attempt to rout the enemy. Various event and capability cards reveal cultural and technological particulars that influence levy, campaign, and combat.<br/><br/>",

They then receive a hand of cards, the order of which they cannot change. The start player for a round leads by playing a combination of up to three cards, and these cards must be next to one another in that player's hand. A player can lay down a single card, a pair, a triple, or a run of two or three consecutive cards. Each player in turn must beat the combination, with a pair being beaten by a higher pair or a triple. If you cannot or will not play, you instead pick up one of your reserve cards, placing it where you choose within your hand. If you have no more reserve cards, then you must discard a life token.<br/><br/>Once each player has played or passed, whoever played the highest combination wins that round and begins the next round. If a player must discard a life token but has none, this player loses the game and everyone else wins.<br/><br/>",

Research new spells as you carve a path through the many treacherous terrains of the continent, using your company's unique advantages to outbuild the competition and secure supply lines for rare resources.<br/><br/>In Empyreal: Spells &amp; Steam, technomancers use mana to build rails, and the amount of mana crystals required to cast a spell varies by terrain and by the potency of the spell. Mana crystals must recharge after being used, so your choice of when and where to use each spell will be critical to determining the efficiency of your construction engine.<br/><br/>The towns you choose to connect to your network will provide critical resources, and the value of these resources changes over time. Some become more valuable as they become more connected, while others become less valuable as their abundance increases. Thus, you need to be wary of what your competitors are building into their trade networks and adapt your strategies accordingly to maximize the value of your stock portfolio.<br/><br/>Reaching new cities first gives you additional benefits, and being the first to bridge the continent provides you with a sizable commission from your backers.

This is a relatively simple bidding and trick-taking game, and one of the best non-threatening partnership games.<br/><br/>Conventional Euchre uses a deck of 24 standard playing cards consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9 of each of the four suits. A standard deck  52-card deck can be used, omitting the cards from 2 to 8. Players are dealt a five-card hand and the object is to win three of the five tricks. A card is turned up to determine trump, which can be either accepted or refused by each player in turn. If refused, another bidding round takes place in which each player is given the privilege of naming trump. The player fixing trump has the option of playing alone or with their partner (playing alone increases the scores and penalties.)<br/><br/>",

It is fully compatible with the previous and subsequent versions, adding new mechanics and play concepts to the highly successful D-Day Dice franchise.<br/><br/>Normandy, June 6th, 1944 &ndash; as you land on the well-defended beaches, a German machine gun nest is killing your comrades like flies. You must do something!<br/><br/>In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, he will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier. He will succeed...or die trying.<br/><br/>D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive. It also includes solitaire optional rules. Although built around dice rolling, this game is about resource management (soldiers, specialists, items and courage) and knowing when to move your unit. Resources are kept from turn to turn, so the players can plan ahead.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.<br/><br/>When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Bohnanza: 25 Jahre-Edition is a special 25th anniversary edition of the game that contains a new bean type (&quot;Elsterbohne&quot;; magpie bean) and comes with three variant games, one of which will use a collectible coin packaged in the box.<br/><br/>",

They are charged with gathering ore from the mines, purchasing weapon designs from the market and then using these resources to forge weapons for adventurers who will go on quests to fight back the ever-deepening darkness. If the adventurers are successful, they will return with more ore, money and other rewards with which players can invest back into their burgeoning weaponsmithing empire.<br/><br/>At its core, Forge War is a rewarding game of aggressive investment, which occurs through the acquisition of quests. Quest management becomes challenging for the player, however, because quests undertaken aren't completed immediately, but instead progress each turn and become more difficult. At specific time intervals, players will need to add more resources to their quests or face failure.<br/><br/>Gameplay cycles through three different phases in each round. The first phase consists of moving pieces around a hex grid to maximize resource production. The second phase is a market phase that features an action blocking mechanic to gain access to new weapon plans and other advantages. The final phase is the acquisition and management of quests, which are selected from a pool of available cards.<br/><br/>",

Alongside your colleagues, you have to cooperate well, to admit, diagnose and treat various patients who need your help. Combine your strengths and treat efficiently the patients arriving at hospital, but be careful, because mistakes can be of the highest value in Rush MD!<br/><br/>'Rush M.D. is an innovative, real-time, cooperative board game that simulates the challenging and high-pressure nature of medical professions. A worker placement mechanism, using hourglasses as workers allows, but also limits, players to perform a multitude of actions. Each player handles 1 Doctor hourglass running around the hospital, admitting patients, providing immediate medical care, performing different kinds of exams as well as performing surgeries. Additionally, there are 4 more Nurse hourglasses, which can be used by all players. Nurses provide medicines to patients, supply all necessary drugs and equipment that you need to carry out all your exams and medical procedures. Any worker placed on an action space may not be used elsewhere before the sand within the hourglass runs out, making each decision important as time is limited.<br/><br/>The game plays from 1-4 players and lasts for 4 rounds of 4 minutes each. That means you only have 16 minutes in total to treat various patients, overcome many difficulties and challenges and manage to cooperate efficiently with your teammates, combine your forces into helping as many of your patients. A highly thematic experience that is equally rewarding for gamers and families, filled with fun, challenges and sharp decision making!<br/><br/>In Rush M.D. pressure is high as human lives are upon your hands!

The expansion of your navy and armies can take what should be rightfully yours.

Depending on where you place your tent, you might be able to snatch a nugget from another explorer &mdash; but sometimes you'll be left holding fool's gold while someone else uncovers a rich gold find...<br/><br/>",

On his turn, a player will perform actions based on the number of servants available on each location. If he has, for example, three servants on the mint, he gets three pieces of gold. As a bonus, the player with the majority of servants on a location receives generally a bonus extra action.<br/><br/>Some places allow you to add new servants or to move them from room to room. The purpose is to earn gold and royal seals and to use those to recruit the lofty noblemen waiting in the castle park. The latter will be the main source of victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Some noblemen benefits are that you can break the balance in the rooms of the palace and there are also cards with privileges, offering bonuses of the same nature that it is also possible to retain them in hand to score points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A collectible card game, set in a fantasy empire called Rokugan, based loosely upon medieval Japan and Japanese Mythology.<br/><br/>The factions available have changed over the editions, but generally include the 7 Great Clans: Crab, Crane, Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, Scorpion, and Unicorn. Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.<br/><br/>The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.<br/><br/>Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say &quot;I'm a Crab player&quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.<br/><br/>L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.<br/><br/>The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: <br/><br/>     Clan War, a miniatures game.<br/>     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.<br/>     Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.<br/>     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game<br/><br/><br/>As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.<br/><br/>In 2008, L5R held the first &quot;Mega-Game&quot; which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.<br/><br/>In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.<br/><br/>Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.<br/><br/>In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.<br/><br/>2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.<br/><br/>In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017. FFG has also plans to continue the RPG at some point (in what form and with which ruleset is yet unknown).<br/><br/>",

The Allied player wins by establishing a beachhead, or (better) by successfully breaking out of the landing area.<br/><br/>The mapboard depicts the Normandy area where the initial landings took place.  Units are regiments and brigades, representing infantry, airborne, armour artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft units.<br/><br/>The game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Turning Point: Stalingrad.<br/><br/>",

Fourteen cards are laid out at the start of the game, each showing one castle and the symbols required to conquer this castle, with the symbols separated into battle lines. Each castle belongs to a clan, with some clans having only a single castle and some having up to four castles.<br/><br/>A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show archery, cavalry, daimyo, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.<br/><br/>Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional daimyo line in the process. If a player owns all the castles of one clan, however, those castles are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these castles are now worth more points because you've united the clan under one ruler (you) and strengthened your hold over Japan.<br/><br/>When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Movement to targets is through zones. Die rolls and game tables determine appearance, type, and position of enemy fighters. Charts are used to determine if hits are made, where the damage is located, and how serious the damage is.  Game tables and die rolls also determine everything from the bomber's target and formation position to weather, flak, and German fighter opposition as the B-17 makes its way over land and sea to its target.<br/><br/>The game has a low complexity and typically, the playing time is generally less than one hour after your first few games.<br/><br/>B-17 is designed to be primarily a solitaire game. The player controls a B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, trying to survive German fighter attacks and drop its load of bombs on the selected target, then return home safely. Optionally, a second player can control the German fighters (to some degree; their appearance is determined randomly, but successive attacks are under the control of the German player). If each player has their own copy of B-17, then they can fly their bomber while playing the same mission as part of the formation.<br/><br/>",

After 3-4 rounds, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>One version of this game, TransEuropa+, includes the Vexation expansion of colored rails, with each of the six colors having three colored rails. When you place one of these rails on the board, it counts only as part of your network and not anyone else's.<br/><br/>The 2018 edition of Transeuropa, which is the preferred spelling of the publisher although the box suggests otherwise, includes a slightly different map of Europe, with the colored cities rotated so that all of the yellow cities are in the UK and Scandinavia. What's more, these cities are separated from others by double-squiggly lines that represent spaces where a ferry can go. As with the Vexation expansion, in this edition each player has three colored rails, and on a ferry route up to two rails can be placed, whether both colored rails or one being colored and the other a normal black rail line that any player can use. A player can lay only one colored rail per turn, and they can claim both possible rail lines in a ferry space. A ferry space is not complete unless it contains two rail lines.<br/><br/>",
