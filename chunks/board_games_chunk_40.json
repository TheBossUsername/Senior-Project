        "description": "Brewery is a competitive eurogame board game.<br/><br/>The game takes place in 6 rounds, each round is divided into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase plus a maintenance sub-phase where employee salaries and restoration are paid.<br/><br/>During the placement phase, the players take turns placing their workers, while during the resolution phase, starting from the first player, he chooses which action to resolve and a benefit is obtained in order of majority. Each action can only contain 4 workers who, identified by the placement order, will be able to resolve the action. During the Placing other workers can be added in the same areas to increase a player's influence. Players with more influence will get more and better effect from the action they are resolving. Resolving some actions will give resources to the player. There are 4 resources available: water, hops (aromas), malt &amp; barley (cereals) and yeast + a special resource for fermentation.<br/><br/>The dominant player, i.e. the one with the most influence or, in case of a tie, the one who placed first will get all the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly), and so on everyone will choose what to take from every action where it is present.<br/><br/>The resources obtained from the resolution of the places as well as for the production of the beers are also used to buy more workers and to pay their salaries as $ currency. Buildings function much like buildings in other placement games. Some sponsors give permanent benefits while breweries can be used every turn by placing one of your workers on them to brew beer. As for stocks, having more influence will be beneficial and dominant players will get cheaper workers or get the best resources sooner. The game contains no money, so players will have to be careful when combining resources because if they overpay, no change will be returned. Players accumulate points when brewing beer from factories and hiring new workers. At the end of the 6th round, the points are subtracted for each empty space on the board, then the player with the most points is declared the winner with the most value in resources left in the warehouses!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You and the other prisoners of the Royal Jail have been entered into DOOM ROOM, a life-or-death tournament where nothing is certain and each step could be your last.<br/><br/>Your goal is to survive as long as possible in a room full of people trying to kill each other (all in good fun, of course). The longer you last, the more points you&rsquo;ll earn. It&rsquo;s a race against time to eliminate your secret target with audacious attacks, daring dodges, and tricky tactics before someone gets to you.<br/><br/>First, you&rsquo;ll need to find a weapon, with a lucky die roll or by searching chests. Attack cards can only be used once, and only at a certain distance, so get into range and take your shot. But if your target has a Block card with the same range, they&rsquo;ll survive, and the chase restarts. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re out!<br/><br/>Strategic plays, clever positioning, and surprise moves keep the game in constant flux. Advantages don&rsquo;t last long, resources are scarce, and a single play can tilt the odds in anybody&rsquo;s favour. Every decision could mean your glorious or grisly end.<br/><br/>Remember, the Queen is always watching, and she&rsquo;ll change things up just to keep herself entertained. She&rsquo;s not very patient, either: if the game goes on for too long, she&rsquo;ll join in and take you out herself!<br/><br/>&bull; Replayable: No two games are ever the same.<br/>&bull; Simple: Roll die, move meeples, and play cards.<br/>&bull; Crispy: Big choices, big consequences, no math.<br/>&bull; Quick-start: Choose a room, deal the cards, done.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object is to become a &ldquo;Cultural Expert&rdquo;.  The first player to collect one card from each category wins the game. Second place goes to the player with the most cards.<br/><br/>There are 5 card categories: Do&rsquo;s &amp; Taboos, Superstitions, Food &amp; Drink, Holidays &amp; Festivals and Customs.  Each category has it&rsquo;s own color. The cards are removed from the box and placed in stacks according to category within easy reach of all players. Each player takes two cards from each category and replenishes their hand throughout the game.<br/><br/>The youngest player (player #1) starts the game by rolling the die. The die has 5 colors which match the cards and one wild side where the player can pick the category. The color on the die indicates the card category to be read. <br/>Light Green = Superstitions<br/>Dark Green = Holidays &amp; Festivals<br/>Orange = Food &amp; Drink<br/>Dark Blue = Do&rsquo;s &amp; Taboos<br/>Light Blue = Customs<br/><br/>Players do not read their own card, rather, the person to the right of the player looks at the two category cards in their hand that match the die. They strategically select the more difficult card to read to player #1.  A cultural fact on the card is read along with 3 country answer choices. Player #1 gets one chance to select the correct country that the card applies to (the answer is on the back).  If the payer #1 selects the correct country they win the card.  If they guess incorrectly, the card goes to the bottom of the deck. End of Turn. Play continues clockwise.<br/><br/>Example: <br/>Player #1 rolls and the die lands on dark blue. The player on the right of player #1 reads a Do&rsquo;s and Taboos card from their hand. <br/>The card reads:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Importing or selling chewing gum is illegal. There are high fines for improper disposal of gum.<br/><br/>Switzerland<br/>Afganistan<br/>Singapore  X<br/><br/>Player #1 gets one chance to guess Singapore as the correct country.<br/><br/>The game has an optional &ldquo;Challenge Round&rdquo; in which the player calls out &ldquo;Challenge Round&rdquo; before rolling the die and must guess the country without being read the 3 answer choices.  If the player is incorrect the turn ends.  If they are correct, they get to keep the card and roll again, but they must again answer the correct country with out hearing the answer choices. If they are wrong, they loose the card they previously won and the player to the right can try to guess the country.  Whoever gets it right gets the card.<br/><br/>",

You travel by car, plane or boat.<br/><br/>Rules.<br/><br/>And so before you is a gorgeous map of the Swedish Kingdom.<br/>At the beginning of the game, 4 destination cards are revealed. To have time to collect as many cards as possible, 18 days are given.<br/>Players move their chips, from city to city, following the directions given after the scroll of the arrow.<br/>A spinning arrow can indicate the number of steps from 3 to 5, a question mark, a ticket, a day.<br/>Steps can be used both backwards and forwards within a single move.<br/>The question mark means that you will have to answer 1 out of 3 difficult questions (for adults) or 1 out of 2 easy ones (for children). Both categories of questions concern Sweden. The prize for the correct answer will be any of the opened 4 destination cards.<br/>A ticket means the player receives an additional ticket (one is already available at the start), which can be used when flying or sailing on a ship.<br/>1 day means that the player advances the chip on the board with 18 days of vacation one day ahead, thereby bringing its end closer.<br/>Of course, the lucky one who visits the largest number of cities wins.<br/><br/>Fair winds, guys!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

In this untamed wilderness that spans three different countries and endures extreme temperatures, survival is a fierce challenge for its inhabitants. Among them, Meerkats embody resilience as they bravely navigate a world filled with perils, including predators like eagles, snakes, and hyenas. But the dangers don't end there &ndash; rival Meerkat families also vie for dominance.<br/><br/>In Kalahari, you step into the role of a Meerkat queen, tasked with securing your family's supremacy in this harsh environment. It's time to prove the strength of your matriarchy.<br/><br/>Kalahari is a thrilling area control game for 2-4 players with a very light Meerkat placement element. By strategically pairing your dice rolls, you must decide which crucial locations to deploy your Meerkat meeples to.<br/><br/>The gameplay continues until players exhaust their supply of Meerkat meeples. However, once only one player remains with Meerkat meeples, the game reaches its final round, do your best to position your Meerkats wisely and faster than your opponents!<br/><br/>Carefully consider which locations to fight over because if both players have an equal number of Meerkats there, neither will gain control. To secure victory, players must employ their best strategies to claim the most valuable locations and complete secret objective cards. It is through these endeavors that one can attain the most points and emerge triumphant as the ultimate Meerkat family in the Kalahari.<br/><br/>",

It has been showcased as a prototype at various fairs and has been adored by Moms with Daughters, Grandmothers with Granddaughters, Kids, and Families of all ages who played it with me. Now it's ready and printed :)<br/><br/>Alicorns are happy creatures when they all fly together, like the colors on a rainbow :)<br/><br/>If you're playing with 2 players, choose 4 Alicorns each. If you're playing with 3 or 4 players, choose 2 Alicorns each. If you have 5-8 players, choose 1 Alicorn each. Each card moves all the Alicorns illustrated on the card forward by one space. Each turn, starting with the youngest player and going clockwise, draw a card from the scattered and turned deck and move ALL the Unicorns with that characteristic or r don't use that card. The first Alicorn to cross the finish line... Is the winner!<br/><br/>For example, the &quot;Yellow&quot; card moves Sun and Star forward by one space.<br/><br/>On the website, you can see many examples and learn how to create new imaginative winged steeds invented by you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To deliver deadly wounds and bring down your enemy, you must pursue and out-speed their escape. But can the paltry might of your attack penetrate their defenses? Become more powerful by changing your trait cards, and use your cunning to collect advantageous combinations&mdash;doubles, triples, and even the game-ending quadruple!<br/><br/>Players begin with four cards in front of them which represent their traits&mdash;speed, attack, defense, and health. Think of these traits as the player&rsquo;s stats: the higher the number, the stronger, unless you seek to debilitate your opponent with the lower ones using a pair.<br/><br/>Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of a variety of actions that they can perform depending on the cards currently in front of them. Players can choose to &ldquo;focus&rdquo; one of their traits, changing its value (whether higher or lower), by flipping over a card from a deck in the center of the playing field. Or they can choose to &ldquo;attack&rdquo; an opponent if they have sufficient speed and attack over an opponent&rsquo;s own speed and defense, dealing damage to them. Finally, they can choose to perform a &ldquo;gambit&rdquo; on an opponent, in which they sacrifice a pair in front of them to replace an opponent&rsquo;s trait (perhaps with something worse).<br/><br/>Additionally, players have a hand of trait cards that they draw under special circumstances and keep secret from others. When performing an action, they may use the cards in their hand to directly change their traits, offering themselves a secretive edge.<br/><br/>In short, Gladiators players compete to have the best stat values and try to inhibit those of their opponents. They may rely on the luck of the draw, or they may use their wits and cunning: to fight to become the last Gladiator standing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game spans 3,000 years of combat, from the age of Greek generals to the invention of gunpowder.<br/><br/>The game system is straight forward and action packed. Players  depend upon the quality of their army's leadership to provide orders needed to maneuver their armies and strike against the enemy. The better an army's command, the more flexibility it has to move, rally, and attack.<br/><br/>Also included are supplementary rules that cover free deployment in scenarios, barbarian charges, command control and impetuosity, elephant panic, and random events.<br/><br/>Each scenario notes the disposition of the armies that engaged at a historical battle and the terrain that encompassed the battlefield. Units include a variety of infantry (including hoplites and the Macedonian phalanx), cavalry (including chariots and mounted archers), missile units (including slingers, longbows, and early gunpowder weapons, and special units such as elephants and war wagons.<br/><br/>The game's primary engine is comprised of an action deck used to determine command, the randomly determined outcomes of actions, and melee combat. Additionally, action cards provide special effects that players can use to enhance their units' abilities as well as the narrative of the play experience. The deck ensures that no two games are ever the same.<br/><br/>The base game includes twenty scenarios:<br/><br/><br/>     Megiddo, 1457 BCE<br/>     Che, 717 BCE<br/>     Marathon, 490 BCE<br/>     Gaugamela, 331 BCE<br/>     Ipsus, 301 BCE<br/>     Heraclea, 280 BCE<br/>     Lake Trasimeno, 217 BCE<br/>     Raphia, 217 BCE<br/>     Illipa, 206 BCE<br/>     Zama, 202 BCE<br/>     Sabis River, 57 BCE<br/>     Pharsalus, 48 BCE<br/>     Hastings, 1066 CE<br/>     Dyrrhachium, 1081 CE<br/>     Fornham, 1173 CE<br/>     Bouvines, 1214 CE<br/>     Kalka River, 1223 CE<br/>     Cr&ecirc;&ccedil;y, 1346 CE<br/>     Poitiers, 1356 CE<br/>     Aljubarrota, 1386 CE<br/><br/><br/>In addition to these battles, the game includes comprehensive guidelines on how to create your own scenarios, making &quot;Dawn of Battle&quot; a complete system usable to recreate virtually any battle from the ancient world to early gunpowder.<br/><br/>This Designer's Edition of Dawn of Battle is an update to the original Dawn of Battle released by Worthington Games in 2021.

        "description": "An Enemy Pack themed for the Hell Train and the infamous Mutant Outlaws known as the Scafford Gang. This is the second set of a new type called an Enemy Theme Pack. It's a great way to add a bunch of exciting new Enemies, cards, and Missions that are all themed for a specific World or faction in the game.<br/><br/>The Scafford Gang are the most notorious mutant outlaws in the Southwest! Making their hideouts in the old caves and mines around the ruins of Brimstone, they have becoming grossly mutated by the cursed radiation of the Dark Stone. As their infamy grows, so too do their ranks, welcoming in any fellow mutants that have been ousted by the locals or that are just looking to make a dishonest buck!<br/><br/>Led by Colonel Scafford and his original gang of confederates (including his miscreant sons), the Scafford Gang mostly loots travelers on the road, knocks over frontier town banks, and raids caravans for their gold and precious Dark Stone cargo. But when it comes to bigger heists, the Colonel&rsquo;s daughter, Captain Belle Scafford, rides out with her mutant Outriders to race down Trains in search of the big scores.<br/><br/>The Riders of the Storm Enemy Theme Pack comes with a host of new Scafford Gang Enemies to challenge your Heroes, as well as new Scafford-themed Missions for the Hell Train, and over 40 new Game cards with assorted counters.<br/><br/>Captain Belle Scafford is the favorite daughter of the Colonel and an expert horsewoman, deadly duelist with a sabre, and a rogue of the highest order. She has a twinkle in her eye, and a cutthroat smile, with a ruthless disposition. Many men have died underestimating her skill, both on horseback and with a blade. Quick on the draw, she never shoots a man in the back&hellip; they are rarely fast enough to turn and run.<br/><br/>The Scafford Outriders are mutant train robbers that descend from the hills to hit the rail lines that run through the valleys and gulches near Brimstone. Riding thunderous horses tainted by the Void energy of the black rock, these wild outlaws use their weird and wondrous mutations to great effect during a heist. With slippery skin to squeeze through the train&rsquo;s windows, flailing tentacles to climb onto the rooftops, or extra limbs to hold up several passengers at once, they hit and run, leaving only a slimy trail and the faint echo of cackling laughter in their wake.<br/><br/>When extra muscle is needed to tear the doors off a train or rip a steel safe to pieces, the Safecrackers always get the job done. These hulking mutants can charge up alongside a train, running at full bore before making a massive leap to land on the rooftop. With meaty barbed claws and rippling muscle, they can shred right through anything that stands in their way, whether it&rsquo;s the side of a train car, a reinforced bank safe, or even the unfortunate marshals that try to stop them. No cage can keep them in, no wall can keep them out.<br/><br/>Though afflicted with a hideous troll body and diminutive size, Mortimer J. (Morty) Scafford makes up for his shortcomings by being the best heist planner and safe breaker in the West. Armed with the tools of the trade and a custom stethoscope for fine detail work, he often rides into battle perched atop one of the massive mutant Safecrackers to get him where he needs to be. Planning every heist down to the last detail, Morty Scafford leaves nothing to chance. If you think you know what he&rsquo;s going to do, he&rsquo;s most likely already been and gone, and he probably stole your wallet too.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of 36 cards in three suits (Comedies, Histories and Tragedies). Each player may keep one card for each trick they took (and pay one coin for each kept card). The rest of the cards are returned to create the draw deck for the Deck of Plays.<br/><br/>The game then transitions to a worker placement game with four possible actions:<br/><br/>     Gather resources (from the dice in the marketplace)<br/>     Purchase a play (for 1 one of each resource - paper, type, ink)<br/>     Hire a person (for 2 coins)<br/>     Spin the Wheel of Fortune (the last player to do so in the turn will be the first player in the following turn)<br/><br/><br/>After several turns, when there four or less cards left in the Deck of Plays, the game transitions to the final auction for the remaining plays.<br/><br/>Final scoring is thus:<br/>1 point for each play<br/>2 points for each set (same number of all three suits)<br/>X points for the longest run in each suit (so 2-3-4-5-6 of comedies would score 5 points)<br/>X points for certain personage cards<br/>3 points for most coins (or 2 points to each player tied)<br/><br/>The most points wins and will print Shakespeare's First Folio!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Whether you&rsquo;re the mastermind or hired hand, you want to get involved in as many jobs as possible and make as much money as you can.  Walk away from a series of jewel heists as the winner with the most money by cooperating with other burglars to break into a vault. Work together to physically move &ldquo;padlocks&rdquo; using tiny hands and steal the jewels they&rsquo;re protecting. The harder the heist, the bigger the payout &ndash; whoever ends up with the most money wins.<br/><br/>During each turn of Tiny Laser Heist, a player becomes the Mastermind and selects his team.  Players not selected now play against the team to stop the heist.  Both teams play action cards to determine the teams abilities and obstacles the team must face during the heist.  The team then has 90 seconds to steal the jewels.  If the you do, the Mastermind picks up and distributes money cards to his team members. Play continues until all the money is gone.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Always give more than you promised.&rdquo; &ndash;Motto of the Studebaker Corporation.<br/>The 1950s auto industry was a fascinating and unique period in USA economic history. Transitioning from a seller&rsquo;s to a buyer&rsquo;s market following the post-war economic boom, the automobile market in the USA was marked by tremendous changes inside and out of the industry. New automotive massed-produced technologies such as automatic transmissions, overhead valve V-8 engines, air conditioning, power brakes and other accessories competed for buyers' attention along with new makes (hardtops and station wagons in particular), annual styling changes and new model lines. New marketing techniques were also developed in the face of rising consumer demands, new communication technologies (especially television), and a growing middle class with increasing cash to spend, as well as a growing need for transportation as millions moved from the cities to the expanding suburbs.<br/><br/>In this game players take on the roles of the independent auto makers Studebaker, Packard, Nash, Hudson, Kaiser-Fraser and Willys-Overland (henceforward referred to as Willys) and try to survive and hopefully even grow during this turbulent decade. The rules and card play cover the actions of the &quot;Big Three&quot; (GM, Ford/Lincoln/Mercury/Edsel, Chrysler/Plymouth/Dodge), as well as national events that impacted the overall economy and automobile industry. A variant adds an additional player to take on the role of the Tucker Automobile Company. Players must allocate resources to marketing, product development, new technologies, dealerships and their various car lines (luxury, family, sport and economy models) and live/adapt with the results.<br/><br/>Each turn represents a year, with each side of the game board that players must transit representing a season of the year. Cards that represent various company assets as designers, new products, dealerships among others are played. Event cards are drawn at various points that can adversely affect, or benefit, one of more players during the turn or game. There are three scenarios (1951-53, 1954-56 and 1957-59) that concentrate on key periods of the decade for the auto industry, and a &quot;campaign game&quot; that covers the entire period. Players win by earning profit and gaining market share, and lose by going bust. Can you do as well or better than your historical car manufacturer?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Navigation Portal is a game that delves into the intricacies of mathematical prowess as players journey through a vast expanse of about 63 square parsecs in nearby space. Players will be challenged to tackle diverse navigational scenarios, utilizing the Navigation Portal to traverse the vastness of interstellar realms. With each play, players will hone their skills, mastering the art of space navigation.<br/><br/>The game features two modes: Educational and Racer.<br/>In the Educational mode, kids explore trigonometry through gameplay. To grasp the basics of trigonometry, players will typically need a maximum of 10 hours to complete Level 1 and Level 2. Level 3 delves deeper, covering trigonometry as taught in secondary schools. This level can be mastered by players as young as 12.<br/><br/>The Racer mode is designed for experienced players, starting even from Level 1. Each game can accommodate 1-8 players and allows for a mix of Levels 1, 2, and 3. Players are finding their way home.<br/><br/>Quick Start notes<br/>First moment...<br/>When you kick off the game, start timing yourself using a watch with a seconds feature or your phone's stopwatch, and keep it running the entire game. During your turns, you can set your course based on the seconds passed. Remember, don't pause the timekeeping throughout your gameplay. Later, you can tap into this recorded time for game stats, like gauging the average time taken per move or figuring out the overall game duration.<br/><br/>...a moment later<br/>When you begin the game, you'll venture out from the solar system, positioned at the heart of the game board. Your initial direction is set by timing seconds on a stopwatch. Take that count, multiply it by six, and then add the number you roll on the dice. This combination maps out your path and sets the stage for your in-game decisions and strategy.<br/>    <br/>Gather The keys<br/>Throughout the game, your route is charted using the navigation portal keys, represented by cards you gather along the way. Crossing the polar grid on your journey from start to finish rewards you with a navigation key for every point where you intersect the grid.<br/><br/>Fuel<br/>Throughout the game, your route is charted using the navigation portal keys, represented by cards you gather along the way. Crossing the polar grid on your journey from start to finish rewards you with a navigation key for every point where you intersect the grid.    Your game's dashboard starts with a fuel gauge of 21 units. Your journey's length hinges on this fuel reserve. Think of each fuel unit as the power to travel one light year. On your game board, this distance is shown as a single centimeter. So, when considering a scale where a centimeter equals a light year, a span of 9.3 light years in the game translates to 9.3 centimeters. In terms of fuel consumption, you'd spend 9.3 units for that journey.<br/><br/>Settlers<br/>When the game begins, you're equipped with two settler modules, each loaded with 25 settler units. Should you journey to a star or star cluster, you get the chance to colonize adjacent sectors. Think of a sector as a 1/5 ly&sup2; square, where you can place one settler unit. Now, if you discover planets in these clusters, keep them in mind, as you can revisit them later to boost your settler count based on the planets present. For a quick illustration: if there are 3 settler units represented by 3 occupied sectors near a planet, you can top up 3 of those groups in your game dashboard's module. And if you come across a system with four planets, that's a potential of adding 12 settler groups back to your resources.<br/><br/>",

What sets Athenium apart is that it is permanently simplified to the most basic elements of gameplay.<br/><br/>Starting life points are determined by the number of players.  Each player involved adds 5 life points to the starting life point total of every player.  It's meant for 2 players, starting at ten, but it's still really fun with 4 players, starting at 20.<br/><br/>There are still resource cards, called Macguffins, that are used to motivate a character into the battle, but instead of 4-7 colors, there are 3, and they are based on genre.  The green cards are Fantasy characters, the blue cards are Science Fiction characters, and the red cards are Horror characters.<br/><br/>Each character card has one number, which represents attack, defense, and casting cost, which go up or down based on their type matchups.<br/><br/>They attack and block left to right, just like reading a book.  When the defending characters run out, the rest is damage dealt to the defending player.  When the defending player runs out of life points, they lose.  Last librarian standing wins.<br/><br/>Everyone plays from one deck which may be supplemented with special cards, or later expansion decks.  All of the art, graphic design, writing, gameplay architecture and web design were done by Ben Butcher, though the expansions have other illustrators on payroll in the near future.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction:Anda (from Proto-Germanic: An&thorn;ą, which means &quot;breath&quot;) is a drawless game for two players: Black and White. It is played at the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. The recommended size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on a 11&ndash;sized board for longer games or a 7&ndash;sized board for shorter games. There is also an off-board location called the prison. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A group is a set of connected stones of the same color among themselves. A single stone is also a group.<br/>&ndash; A liberty is an empty point adjacent orthogonally or diagonally to a group.<br/>&ndash; A smothered group is a group where all its liberties has a path of N empty points connected to exactly one enemy supergroup, where N can be zero.<br/>&ndash; A territory is a set of connected empty points. You own a territory if all the stones connected to it are your color.<br/> &ndash; To annihilate is to place a stone on an empty point that smother all enemy groups, leaving the board with stones only of your color. You cannot annihilate if your opponent also annihilated in a previous turn.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, do one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&ndash; Place a stone of your color on an empty point where it is not smothered, then move all smothered friendly and enemy groups to the prison. If it's your first turn, do it twice on non-adjacent empty points.<br/>&ndash; Remove an enemy stone from the prison.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, the group of the stone you placed cannot be smothered.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:&ndash; The player who performed the last action wins the game, so passing the turn is not allowed.<br/>&ndash; One player has the option to &ldquo;propose ending&rdquo; to the game and the other player must accept it or not. If accepted, the points will be counted by adding the friendly territory and the enemy prisoners, in addition to granting an extra half point to the player who made the last move.<br/><br/>For the game to be fair, before it starts:<br/><br/>&ndash; Player 1 places two black stones.<br/>&ndash; Player 2 either (i) swaps or (ii) places two white stones.<br/>　&ndash; If (i), Player 1 places two white stones and Player 2 either swaps or accepts.<br/>　&ndash; If (ii), Player 1 either swaps or accepts.<br/><br/>Then, the player with the black stones offers a komi pie, where the first player places several black stones in the prison and the second player chooses a side. The player with the white stones either swaps or accepts. I have called this balancing method dual pie rule.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariant:For a simpler option, each player places two stones of their color on non-adjacent corners during game setup. Then Black starts the game by playing the first normal turn. The komi pie can also be used for balance.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes:Special thanks to Christopher Field for his contribution to a simpler alternative balancing method. The prison mechanism was introduced by David Wolfe and Elwyn Berlekamp in their book &quot;Mathematical Go: Chilling Gets the Last Point&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the victory in North Africa, Allied planners readied a new campaign.  It was aimed at the so called &lsquo;soft underbelly&lsquo; of Europe.  A bold plan to knock Italy out of the war and drain Axis units from fighting on other fronts. Beginning with the invasion of Sicily in July of 1943, the Allies pressed the enemy, but there was nothing soft about the bloody fight. The drive to Messina in Sicily, the landing at Salerno, the beleaguered beachhead at Anzio, through all the Allies pushed on towards Rome.  Countless river valleys and fortified lines favored the German defenders and stymied the Allies at every turn.  The Volturno River, the Rapid River, the Liri valley, the Gustav Line, the Caesar Line, all of these names proved a deadly challenge to the Allies fighting to control them. The drive up the Italian Peninsula was costly for both sides and dragged on until the end, which occurred May 2, 1945 with the formal surrender of all Axis forces in Italy.<br/><br/>Old School Tactical Volume IV brings the exciting OST system to this challenging theater of WW2.  It brings British forces into the game to battle German and Italian units in difficult terrain.  Vickers machine guns,  Commandos,  Bren guns, PIATs and sticky bombs will see action in the game on the side of the British.  They also have an allotment of vehicles including Sherman and Churchill tanks.<br/>The German and Italian forces counter with many panzers including the Marder III and Elefant.<br/>A large map of beautiful Italian countryside is designed for players to contest the many exciting scenarios included in the playbook.<br/><br/>Two players contest each scenario using counters representing the soldiers, guns, and vehicles that fought these desperate battles. On each turn, play goes back and forth between the sides as Impulse Points are spent to enable a player's forces to act. When the battle is over, casualty and victory points are tallied and a victor is declared.<br/><br/>Infantry target other soft units and attack using their Firepower value against the target&rsquo;s Defense value.  The attack can be modified by Leadership, support weapons and terrain effects. When things get intense, Assault moves into enemy hexes result in deadly Close Combat.  Dice rolls are made using the Infantry Combat Table, and results are implemented.  Attacking armored vehicles requires a roll to hit the vehicle.  If a hit is scored, the Firepower value of the attacker&rsquo;s gun is used against the target&rsquo;s front or flank defense value.  Dice rolls are made using the Vehicle Combat Table and results are enforced. Vehicles may also use their HE Firepower value and secondary armaments directly against soft targets using the Infantry Combat Table.<br/><br/>",

The force card tells you what to do next once played. All Force cards are also wild cards.  You can simply use them to change the color if you desire.<br/><br/>",

McCammon says situation is critical&rdquo;. &ndash;Except from General Stilwell&rsquo;s May 22nd personal log report about offensive to take Myitkyina.<br/><br/>Galahad&rsquo;s Ordeal portrays the Allied attack and siege of Myitkyina during WWII. The town and its nearby airfield were a constant threat to the Allied airlift operations that ferried war materials and supplies from India to Nationalist China. The Japanese occupation of the town also severed the only land access from India to China for the Allies. <br/>When the Japanese offensive at Imphal and Kohima was launched the Allied High Command viewed the battle as an opportunity to launch a counter offensive by the US 5307th Infantry Group (Merrill&rsquo;s Marauders, also nicknamed Galahad Force by their British and Indian Allies) supported by Nationalist Chinese forces against Myitkyina, deep into the rear areas of Japanese occupied northern Burma. The Allies calculated that the Japanese had to have weakened their hold here to launch their massive offensive to the west. Unfortunately for the Allies, the US forces were badly depleted from earlier battles, and the Japanese had not weakened their grip at Myitkyina, and instead, anticipating just such an attack, were in the process of strengthening the town&rsquo;s garrison. One of the most costly and prolonged battles of the Burma theatre would be waged here. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?

Make your way to the Devils Reef and be rid of the curse that surrounds you! The first person there is the winner, but to get there you will face various Encounters along the way. Only the sane will survive to make it to the end.<br/><br/>Sort out the cards into the different piles and give them all a good shuffle. Lay out the locations, and choose a character, a curse (which indicates where you begin) and take your first clue. Each character gets 6 Sanity points and 4 Health points to begin with. Should either of these gets to zero, your character needs to rest for a turn in the Hotel before continuing. You also lose any Artefacts you may have gathered, including any boat tickets.<br/><br/>Move your character one location at a time to get to the clue destination. Each time you move, take an Event. Resolve the Event and if you survive, you are rewarded with an Artefact. If you have reached your Clue Destination, take another Clue and continue on your way.<br/><br/>When you reach your third Clue Destination, take a Boat Ticket and head to the Harbour. From there, you can make it across the Open Seas and to the Devils Reef. The first person to get to the Devils Reef is the winner!<br/><br/>",

As the leader of your army, you will need to recruit your soldiers, equip them with weapons, and send them into battle against your opponents on a dynamic battlefield.<br/><br/>In Age of Swords, you will have at your disposal 28 cards for each of the two armies, each with their own unique units and special abilities. From light cavalry to archers and crossbowmen, knights and commanders, each unit plays an important role in battle. You play on a 8x12 battlefield grid.<br/><br/>Each card has three main characteristics that define its role in battle: movement speed on the board, attack strength, and, in the case of ranged units like archers and crossbowmen, also includes the shooting distance. In combat the defender also rolls a D20 to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>You will have to demonstrate your ingenuity and skill by moving them across the board to claim victory. You win by defeating all enemy units.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are old-fashioned typesetters, building up words letter-by-letter to be used on a printing press. As the letters come out, you must plan and place them accordingly, while carefully using your bank of vowels to puzzle out a higher score. Use the tools of the trade to twist the rules, and create combos that land you the bonus letters you need to win.<br/><br/>On a turn, both in solo and multiplayer, a consonant is randomly turned face-up for all the players to use in building up words on their player card. The catch? All placed letters must be put in the leftmost empty space of a given line. Players can freely use their bank of vowels before and after to help out, as long as they haven't run out. As more consonants come out, the words get trickier to fit together, and certain letters become more desirable. Certain actions, like taking hard-to-use letters or using the special ability, result in bonus 'wild' letters of your choice, clinching the final pieces to your word puzzle. You have limited room for error, and the letters themselves have no value- only word length matters for scoring. Every five letters, each player may opt out on their own and score their cards, or risk another five letters that may ruin everything.... or fit beautifully into place.<br/><br/>Plan, place, and chance it either on your own or with a group of fellow typesetters. Typeset is built to travel, easy-to-teach, and infinitely replayable with the wealth of ability cards that twist and change the rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When someone has completed a decided number of lists, how many lists were completed, and how accurately, are tallied for points. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Includes rules for either a lighter game or a more strategic &quot;Timeless Realm&quot; Variation.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each Geekmon is then captured by the player who managed to land the most cubes on their card.<br/><br/>But stay tuned, as you must not throw your cubes randomly, since by capturing the evolutions of your Geekmon you increase the score of your cards. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>Some plot twists during the game, such as the appearance of luminous Geekmon, critical hits, type advantages and even removing opponents' cubes from the cards (or sometimes even your own) by hitting another cube on it, will make the game exciting from the beginning to the end of the match.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Waters Unvexed details the three largest naval battles fought on the upper Mississippi River (north of the city of Vicksburg) in the months of May and June, 1862. Both sides viewed control of the river as key to the war&rsquo;s outcome. The Confederate vessels of the Mississippi River Defense Fleet had been formed from converted river sidewheel paddle steamers whose bows had been fitted with iron rams and reinforced with packed bales of cotton, as well as armed with various numbers and sizes of artillery pieces. The Union Mississippi River Squadron was made up of purpose-built stern paddlewheel gunboats and sidewheel rams. The Union vessels were fitted in many places with thin iron sheets and dubbed &ldquo;tin clads&rdquo;. The gunboats were all armed with powerful rifled cannon while their rams were only armed with their iron prows. The game portrays the battles of Island Number 10, Plum Point Bend and the First Battle of Memphis. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>Each copy of Waters Unvexed is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    Three 11 by 17 inch hex maps.<br/>&bull;    One sheet of 154 single-sided, un-mounted counters.<br/>&bull;    One players&rsquo; aid sheet.<br/>&bull;    8 pages of rules.<br/><br/>Players will also need one standard deck of playing cards, a six-sided die and one ten-sided die to play the game. A die roll of 0 is read as 10 and not zero. An opaque container (mug, envelope) is also needed to play the game.<br/><br/>Each turn represents 15 minutes of time. Each hex is about 200 yards across. Each unit represents 1 warship or a battery of 6-10 cannon.<br/><br/>Players use a standard deck of cards to determine who activates and with how many units, as well as when to determine random events and the end of the turn. Dice are used to resolve combats and other game events. Play is very interactive and true to the history.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The ship logs are divided into sections by country, each preceded by summary sheets listing basic information for each of the ship classes included for that country.<br/><br/>The AOTF Naval Annual Series is an obvious play on Brassey&rsquo;s &amp; Jane&rsquo;s but with actual ship logs for playing AOTF. There will be three volumes in the series: 1885-1906, 1907-1921, and 1922-1944.  Covers will be color-coded similar to Conway&rsquo;s (blue, green and red respectively) and each volume will be comprised of ship logs for each country (alphabetic by country, then ship type, then completion date) preceded by summary pages for each country.  A single ship log for each class (using the data of a representative ship of the class for the time period) is provided and for ship classes spanning volumes (i.e. all the WW1-era battleships and cruisers like HOOD, CAVOUR, PENNSYLVANIA, etc.), updated versions will appear in the subsequent volume.<br/><br/>The first two volumes are limited to battleships, battlecruisers, armored cruisers and light cruisers but the third volume will also contain individual ship logs for classes of destroyers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's more than just a card game; it's an adventure where fortunes can change in an instant, where strategic decisions meet wild surprises, and where endless fun awaits.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Setting Up the Madness: Start by shuffling the draw pile and placing it face down in the center of the gaming table.<br/><br/>The Unpredictable Draw: Players take turns drawing a card from the pile, moving clockwise. The draw can result in various outcomes, including exciting events like Crashes and Heists, which can turn the tide of the game.<br/><br/>Strategic Decision-Making: Players privately check their drawn cards and make a choice: play the card immediately or keep it for a future turn.<br/><br/>Playing Your Hand: Cards from your hand can be strategically deployed in two ways: adding Moolah cards to your money pile or playing action cards that can affect the game's dynamics.<br/><br/>Protection and Strategy: Strategic use of Armor cards can shield you from adverse events and actions, while Audit, Market Intel, and Magnet cards offer unique advantages for those quick enough to seize them.<br/><br/>Winning the Madness:<br/><br/>The path to victory in Moolah Madness lies in accumulating the most Moolah cards in your money pile. When all the cards from the draw pile have been claimed, the player with the greatest Moolah wealth emerges as the ultimate victor. Notably, any remaining cards in players' hands are discarded as the game concludes.<br/><br/>Moolah Madness is not just a card game; it's a captivating journey where you navigate the dynamic world of money, strategy, and endless fun. Will you thrive in this unpredictable financial landscape and emerge as the Moolah Madness champion?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cupset is an unpredictable four player strategy game filled with upsets and underdogs!<br/><br/>Each player tries to eliminate their opponents' pieces by engaging in battle, winning, and stacking on top of them and becoming the Top Dog!<br/><br/>Each player starts with ten cups. Each turn you may choose to move around the board or declare a fight with an opponent's adjacent piece. The winner of the battle stacks on top of the loser, eliminating their piece and growing their own stack.<br/><br/>To battle, the attacker rolls the die to determine the winner, but the odds on the die change according to the size of the cup stacks. Even stacks have even odds, but taller stacks have better odds, with the Top Dog stack having the best odds of all! But watch out, even the smallest stack can upset the odds and become the new Top Dog!<br/> But that's not all! Each player controls two secret &quot;underdog&quot; pieces that can quickly change the course of the game!<br/><br/>The last surviving player wins the game and reigns as Top Dog of the yard!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Roost is a card game about strategy, memorisation, alliances and, most importantly, birds. Players must avoid being at the bottom of the pecking order and stay aligned with the flock to fly away to overall victory.<br/><br/>Your goal in Roost is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. Players start the game by only knowing half of their hand and must use abilities, alliances and memory to ensure they win each round. On each turn, a player can either pick up a card from the:<br/><br/>     Unknown Pile - the player may view it privately. Then, they must choose to either place it directly onto the Discard Pile OR replace 1 of their own cards with it OR place it on top of an opponent's face-up card.<br/>     Discard Pile - the player must replace 1 of their own cards with it.<br/><br/><br/>At any time, players can match cards onto the top discard pile card.<br/><br/>Most birds contain abilities where you can switch, steal, discover, enact revenge, boost your final score or FLIP cards. Flipping cards means that players can now, at any point, stack birds onto the face-up cards of an opponent, creating some massive point hauls if not dealt with promptly. Some other abilities involve play direction changing, collecting specific bird breeds, and even taking a significant point hit to enact an ability in the following round.<br/><br/>Event cards introduce one-time game cards, which can be extraordinarily crucial in certain circumstances and give players who are losing miserably a chance of a comeback. A round of Roost ends when a player calls 'Roost', with all other players getting one more turn. If the player wins the Roost, they get a point deduction bonus; otherwise, they get harshly penalised. Beware of Roosting too early, as some cards specifically penalise jumping the gun. Roost is played over multiple rounds, with the game ending when a score threshold is reached for the amount of players playing.<br/><br/>Roost features a modified rule set for 2-3 players and comes with 36 additional cards that can be swapped in to bring new dynamic twists to the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When Thunder Rolled (WTR) is a solitaire simulation of the United States Air Force's contribution to Operation Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War. Rolling Thunder began on 3 March 1965 and concluded on 31 October 1968. During the campaign the USAF and United States Navy bombed targets throughout North Vietnam. The area around Hanoi and Haiphong was the most dangerous area and was split between the USAF and USN. WTR simulates the USAF campaign using the F-105D as the primary bomber.<br/><br/>WTR gives you the opportunity to assume the role of a USAF F-105D pilot, attempting to survive 100 missions over North Vietnam. The game is based on the format originated by the Korean War simulation Able Dog.<br/><br/>A few things I want to say before you take a look. The first is that the counters are...well, let me say I'm not a graphics guy. They're the best I can do but they allow you to play the game. The second is that, as are other games of this genre, When Thunder Rolled is a dice-roller. If you hate this type of game, you'll hate this one, too. The third is that I have taken some shortcuts that make parts of the game somewhat abstract (air-to-air combat is an example). Lastly, if you have comments, positive and negative, please PM me. I'm happy to adapt things that will improve the game. If you love the game, I'm glad. If you hate it, I understand that, too. But I hope you'll at least try it, even if you don't want to fly a full 100 mission tour.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Mission is simple: land forces onto R'lyeh beaches and push trough horror and madness all the way to Necropolis, where group of investigators will perform a ritual with the scepter and save the world.<br/>But, no one knows what terrors await human forces...<br/><br/>SEQUENCE of PLAY<br/><br/>Each turn is consistent of 6 phases: Expedition phase, Event phase, Supply and Support phase, Combat phase, Counter-Attack phase and Morale phase.<br/><br/>Main Mission and Objectives<br/><br/>Capture at least 2 black areas. Hold an area with Tomb of Cthulhu with a brigade that has Investigator's unit attached to it till the end of a turn.<br/><br/>National plan &ndash; Secondary Objectives<br/>Roll one d6 to get a random secondary objective or use one of your choice.<br/><br/><br/>     French Republic &ndash; Capture all areas of the central peninsula (small island connected with bridges to the main landmass).<br/>     German Empire &ndash; Hold both areas with Portals.<br/>     Ottoman Empire &ndash; Hold Fort Marsh and Fort Barnabas.<br/>     United Kingdom &ndash; Finish the game with at least 3 Relics or Artifacts in your possession.<br/>     American Forces &ndash; Capture all green colored areas.<br/>     Russian Empire &ndash; Capture all areas with +4 terrain bonus.<br/><br/><br/>Important: if objective of secondary mission is to hold an area, during the turn when you are finishing a Main mission and objective, you also must hold areas as stated for the secondary objective. This means that in that last turn when you are winning the game, those areas must be held (there must be at least on friendly unit in that area that is not exhausted).<br/><br/>Winning and Losing a game<br/><br/>To win a game you must fulfill Main and Secondary mission objectives.<br/><br/>You lose the game if turn counter reaches a space with Cthulhu icon on it and you still didn't finish Main and Secondary mission objectives, or if a special Investigators counter is destroyed. You may also choose to resign a game if you see that due to the loses to your units it is not possible to finish mission parameters anymore.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If you liked Arnhem '44, then you will really like Blitz '40:  221 minis including separate infantry figures, tanks, artillery, mechanized, recon, fighters and bombers made for each nation.  Two big, beautiful map sections that fit together to create a truly impressive campaign area - from the German frontier with fortress Holland all the way to Paris at 9 miles/hex!  Event cards introduce aspects from the historical contest and add to the re-playability and &quot;fog of war&quot;.  The combat system is similar to Arnhem '44 but adjusted for division vs. battalion scale, and the air rules include Air Superiority, Interception, Interdiction, Close Air Support, Combat Air Patrol, and Ground Attack missions.  This game may use minis and big maps, but make no mistake, it is a REAL wargame, not just a great-looking one.  Players can even choose to use counters instead of minis - both are provided to fit your personal preference!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is played on the intersections (points) of a initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. It can be played on a 7&ndash;sized board for long games or a 5&ndash;sized board for short games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A group is a set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone is also a group.<br/>&ndash; The size of a group is the number of stones it contains.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first and then turns alternate. On your turn, perform these actions in the following order:<br/><br/>1. Place a stone of your color on an empty point. You can start a new group or grow one of your preexisting groups by adding a stone, as long as you don't merge groups. If you cannot place a stone, pass your turn, otherwise passing is not allowed.<br/>2. Steal a stone from each adjacent enemy group to your group, as long as the groups have the same shape (even if they are rotated or reflected). You can only perform this action if the newly placed stone is adjacent to a friendly stone. The stolen stones are placed adjacent to your group simultaneously, allowing for further growth.<br/><br/>After growing your group, you must continue stealing stones from adjacent enemy groups that have the same shape. Additionally, if you steal a stone from an enemy group that acquires the same shape as one of your adjacent groups, that group will also steal a stone in response and place it next to it to continue growing. These processes continue as long as your groups can keep growing. If your groups can no longer grow, you can no longer steal more stones.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the Game:The game ends when neither player can place more stones on the board. At that point, points are counted to determine the winner. Points are obtained by summing the total number of stones in groups of different sizes, without counting repetitions. Additionally, half a point is awarded to the player with the largest group, and each player receives one point for each group of a different size.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score in the final position wins.<br/><br/>To ensure fairness, before the game starts, the first player places an initial stone, one black and one white, on any empty point of the board, and the second player chooses a side. This balance method is called the pie rule.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes:Vastuz is based on Nick Bentley's game Bug, which involves capturing enemy groups with identical shapes. However, Vastuz implements it differently. Instead of capturing the entire enemy group, the player chooses a specific stone from the enemy group with the same shape and adds it to their own group. Additionally, unlike Bug, Vastuz does not impose limits on group growth.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction:Dendria (from Greek: Dendron, meaning &quot;tree&quot;, combined with the suffix &ndash;ria used in many geographical names) is a board game for two players: Light and Dark. It is played on the hexes (soils) of an initially empty hexagonal field (board). It can be played on a 8&ndash;sized board for longer games or a 6&ndash;sized board for shorter games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones in their own color, divided into three categories: Seeds, trees, and dendrids.<br/><br/>To facilitate the physical game, light brown and dark brown stones can be used. Light and dark brown stones would represent seeds and trees, with seeds on the front and trees on the reverse. In addition, light brown and dark brown pawns can be used to represent dendrids.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A seed is planted by placing it on an empty soil.<br/>&ndash; The root of a seed is a set of one or more connected empty soils in a straight line without interruption from that seed to the edge of the board, and a seed, dendrid, or tree of any color is said to provide nutrients to that seed through N uninterrupted empty soils (where N can be zero), as long as it is placed on one of its roots.<br/>&ndash; A nourished seed is a seed that has all its roots with nutrients, and it is said to be nourished by a seed, dendrid, or tree of any color located on one of its roots.<br/>&ndash; A dendrid sprouts from a nourished seed by more seeds, dendrids, or trees of the same color rather than the opposite color.<br/>&ndash; A dendrid fertilizes all connected empty soils in a straight line without interruption.<br/>&ndash; A seedbed is a set of one or more seeds of the same color connected together.<br/>&ndash; A forest is a set of one or more trees of the same color connected together.<br/>&ndash; A fertile soil is an empty soil adjacent to a seedbed or a forest.<br/>&ndash; A forest grows from a seedbed whose fertile soils have been fertilized by dendrids of the same color.<br/>&ndash; An enemy forest can optionally become a friendly forest if all its fertile soils are fertilized by friendly dendrids and at least one of those fertile soils is not fertilized by enemy dendrids.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Dark plays first and then alternate. On your turn, perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&ndash; Plant a seed on an empty soil with at least one nutrientless root. Then, optionally, let one or more dendrids of the corresponding color sprout from it, according to the aforementioned rules. If a seed is planted on an empty soil and all its fertile soils are fertilized by dendrids of the same color, it can immediately grow into a tree of that color.<br/>&ndash; Move a dendrid through connected empty soils in a straight line to another empty soil, being able to jump over friendly or enemy seeds, as well as friendly dendrids, but never over trees. Then, optionally, let one or more forests, whether friendly or enemy, grow according to the aforementioned rules. A dendrid can stop at an empty soil to nourish the seeds or make them grow into trees and then move to continue doing so with others during its journey repeatedly, as long as it moves in a straight line.<br/>&ndash; Pass your turn.<br/><br/>It is important to note that it is not allowed to make a move that results in an exact repetition of a previous game state. This means that the same moves cannot be repeated in a loop indefinitely.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the Game:The game ends when both players pass their turn consecutively.  At the end of the game, each player receives one point for each forest of different size without counting repetitions, one point for each forest size in which he has more forests than his opponent and half a point for the player with the largest forest (or the second largest in case of equality).<br/><br/>The player with the highest score in the final position wins.<br/><br/>To ensure fairness, before the game starts, the first player places an initial dark seed anywhere on the empty board, and the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called the pie rule.<br/><br/>Finally, to prevent possible stalemate tactics where players simply move their dendrids without making significant strategic decisions, at the beginning of the game, players agree to set a limit on the number of dendrid moves in consecutive alternating turns (both with the same number of turns) before considering the game over, which ensures that the game does not extend too long.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNote:In Spanish, I use the word &quot;d&eacute;ndride&quot; for the English version I made: dendrid.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It replaces those board games' dice components to enable tactical combat that forces players to make difficult trade-offs, leaning in on the delicate balance of aggression and preservation in a way that is faithful to the ethos of the video games they are based upon. The set is backwards compatible with all aspects of the board games it's suggested for and truly drop-in; no house rules, no component errata, no additional tweaks necessary.<br/><br/>Lean in on the clever strategies that those beloved action RPG games demand. The engine this set includes lets players make careful choices about when to extend their offensive strategy, when to take a conservative approach, and choose which critical moments they're willing to leave in the hands of fate.<br/><br/>Use the enemy's offense to your advantage! Among the cards that allow players to customize their approach toward battle, a brand new parry/riposte mechanic that rewards careful planning and positioning is featured. The set also features a collection of cards that are exclusive to player classes, highlighting a unique playstyle for each class. Using a class card in your deck rewards you for drawing on that class's strengths, and colors gameplay in a way that truly sets each class apart. Finally, Black Spirits: Combat Cards includes several difficulty modes to cater to both brand new players, as well as veterans. Each player can separately choose what difficulty to align to, and players within the same party can even choose not to use cards at all if they prefer chucking dice.<br/><br/>So all players need to do is create their decks, plan carefully, and steel themselves for death.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A single piece is also a stack.<br/>&ndash; The height of a stack is the number of pieces it contains.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first and then turns alternate. On your turn, you can either pass your turn or perform the following actions in the following order:<br/><br/>1. Place a stack of height 1 on an empty point (called a 1-stack).<br/>2. Move a stack to an empty point in a straight line, either orthogonally or diagonally, at a distance equal to its height. You cannot move a stack that was just placed on that same turn.<br/>3. Increase the height by 1 of all friendly and enemy stacks that are at the same distance as the height of the stack you just moved, by placing an additional piece of the opposite color on these stacks.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:The game ends when a player runs out of possible moves. The player with the highest stack on the board is declared the winner. In case of a tie between the highest stacks, the next highest stacks are compared.<br/><br/>To ensure fairness in the game, before the game starts, the first player places a black stack of height 1 and a white stack of height 1 on any empty point, and the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called the two-stack pie rule.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

This Initiative based scalable game system allow players to start out with a few tripods and tanks with the ability to progress to play truly massive conflicts.<br/><br/>Rules are designed to suit all previous versions models.<br/><br/>In June 1904 Earth was forever changed when the skies were lit up by Martian drop pods streaking through pillars of fire into the ground. Emerging from these pods, Martian war-machines rapidly spread out destroying and killing everything in their path.  Despite humanities best efforts, the Martian Tripods were unstoppable. It was not until the invading Martians succumbed to infections and disease was their rampage halted. The year is now 1917 and in the midst of the largest and most widespread conflict in human history the skies are once again lit up by pillars of fire heralding the Return of the Tripods&trade;.<br/><br/>Having learned from their previous incursion, the Martians have returned with improved war machines, new weapons, and biological immunities. Humanity has not been idle either.  Scavenging the remains of the Martian's previous attacks humans too have learned.

        "description": "Two teams of four tanks play football on a field that consists of a grid of hexes. Pieces' movement is determined by dice, and it is a combination of turns in place and forward moves to the hex in front. A Super Heavy Tank (a &quot;Heavy Tank&quot; for the purpose of this game) can move in each turn for the number of steps shown on the die or less, and a Recon Tank (a &quot;Light Tank&quot;) is faster, so it can move maximally for two steps more than the number on the die (or again, less, if it suits the player). In each turn, a player chooses which two pieces to move; in some cases, it is possible to move 3 or all 4 pieces in one turn.<br/><br/>Each piece can push the ball during its movement. Due to their higher speed, Light tanks have an advantage when pushing compared to Heavy tanks; however, Heavy tanks can hit the ball with their large cannon barrel when turning the turret. The length of the ball movement is determined with a red-dotted die, which is rolled at the same time as the movement dice.  The ball bounces off the borders of the field according to a very intuitive rule, and if it reaches another tank on its trajectory, it stops on the last empty hex. When the ball is hit or pushed in such a way that it ends up on white hexes on the opposite side of the board, a goal is scored.<br/><br/>Although the length of movement of the pieces and the ball is determined by the dice, luck does not play a huge role. To win, it requires a lot of thinking in order to plan and coordinate your team both in attack and defense, so you get into many favorable positions for execution, while allowing your opponent as few opportunities for counterplay as possible.<br/><br/>Tankball is in some way a Tank Chess derivative, as it uses some of the Tank Chess pieces, and it was conceived right after Tank Chess became a reality thanks to a Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If you are playing alone, skip this step.<br/>The starting player selects a tetracube piece of their chosen color and carefully places it on the half-sphere.<br/>The other player (or the same player in a solo game) rolls the dice and selects a tetracube piece of the rolled color to place on the half-sphere.<br/>Players take turns rolling the dice and placing tetracube pieces of the rolled color onto the half-sphere.<br/>When all 5 copies of one color are stacked on the half-sphere, players no longer need to roll the dice. From that point, they can choose their pieces to place.<br/>The game continues until the structure collapses due to an unstable placement of a piece.<br/><br/>Winning Conditions:<br/>The player responsible for causing the collapse of the structure loses, and the other player is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Variant Rules:<br/>-Solo Play: In a solo game, the player attempts to stack as many tetracube pieces as possible before the structure falls. There's no need to determine a starting player; simply enjoy stacking for personal achievement.<br/>-3 to 6 Players: Play clockwise.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Due to limited resources, they rely on the Animania League, similar to human football league, to resolve conflicts. These matches happen in space stadiums where animals with special abilities compete for victory. To succeed, coaches must make smart choices and use strategies tailored to their animals.<br/><br/>You're the coach of your very own team in Aniversus (Cats vs Squirrels). It's a big deal &ndash; you call the shots, come up with sneaky game plans, and help your animal buddies level up, get energy, and show what they're really made of. During each turn, a maximum of 3 card-playing actions can be performed.  You must draw and play cards to make strategic moves, enabling your team to generate greater productivity, gain powers, and use skills to interrupt the opponents. The team who accumulates 10 powers on their field first can attempt a shoot by rolling a die. Victory in the game is achieved when each team successfully scores twice.<br/><br/>Here's what you'll get up to in Aniversus:<br/><br/>1. Use your resources smart so your team can come out swinging when it's game time.<br/> 2. Dive into battles that make you think ahead, switch things up on the fly, and use your animals' special moves in smart ways.<br/> 3. Watch your crew get tougher, smarter, and cooler as they win more and get ready for the big leagues.<br/><br/>In Aniversus, every game is your chance to outsmart the other coaches. Can you climb to the top and make your team the legends of the Space Arena? It's all in your hands.<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the creators of Aniversus<br/><br/>",

Each compiled word the player writes down on the sheet with the sum of points of used letters and this word. The player's cards that were used to make words are discarded and are not used anymore. When a player can no longer make words from his cards or has no cards at all (as at the beginning of the game), he proceeds to the second action of his turn.<br/><br/>The second action of the turn is the right to turn over any two pairs of cards laid out on the table. The number of flipped cards must be one more than the player made words in the first action of his turn. For example: during the first action of his turn the player made 1 word, then accordingly the player turns over 2 pairs of cards (i.e. 4 cards at the same time).<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no cards left on the table and no player can make a word from his cards. The winner is the player who has the highest sum of points for the words made during the whole game.

All rectangular cards are thoroughly mixed and laid out back side up on the table in a stack.<br/>Each player in one turn has the right to turn over any one unopened square card from the hidden drawing laid out in rows and looks for exactly where that card should be.<br/><br/>If a card revealed by a player should be on a spot that does NOT share a border with any already revealed card on the table, that move is considered unsuccessful. The player returns the card back to its place face up. All players try to memorize its location. The turn passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Attention! Only the cards that are touching by the sides are considered to be cards that have a common border. Touching cards with corners is not considered to have a common border!<br/>If a card opened by a player should be on a place having a common border with some already opened card on the table, such a move is considered successful. The player puts it on this necessary place on the principle of a puzzle according to the pattern instead of the unopened card on this place, which in its turn without opening moves to the empty place where the card opened by the player was earlier. For each successful move the player gets three privileges:<br/>a) to take from the stack one top prize card with accrued points;<br/>b) the opportunity to increase the points accrued (if it is provided in the text of the prize card received);<br/>c) make another move (if it is not prohibited in the text of the received prize card).<br/><br/>Use of Prize Cards:<br/>A prize card contains a number of points gained or lost by a player during a turn.<br/>A prize card may contain a prohibition on taking another turn, even if the turn was successful.<br/>A prize card may contain additional conditions that a player must read and, if possible, fulfill in order to increase the number of points he has gained or decrease the number of points of other players.<br/>The game ends when the hidden picture puzzle is completely assembled on the table.

        "description": "You're running late for the Christmas family reunion, and you still haven't purchased their presents. Opting for clothing seems like the easy choice, but everyone's facing the same dilemma right now, so going shopping is chaotic!<br/><br/>Welcome to Gamarra, Peru's most bustling and expansive clothes market, where you'll find everything you need and encounter stereotypical characters from Lima's streets like 'el pituco' (the rich guy), 'el guachiman' (the security guard), or 'el choro' (the robber), among others, who will assist you with your shopping list.<br/><br/>In Gamarra, each turn involves buying an item, summoning a character, or discarding any number of cards to replenish your hand. The objective is to be the first player to purchase between 3 to 5 items, with the winning number depending on the total number of players.<br/><br/>Furthermore, each time a player makes a purchase, it triggers an event from the Events Deck. These events cause random occurrences that affect all players' hands or characters, such as 'Sismo de 8 grados' (Earthquake), 'Hora Punta' (Rush hour), or 'Fin de mes' (Payday), among others.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Triggering citywide events can change the tide of the game, offering points, money, and expansions for the players ready for it. You can even enact laws to give yourself the advantage!<br/><br/>You earn points for building types, upgrades, landmarks, events, and remaining cash, and at the end of the game, whoever's neighborhood has earned the most points wins.<br/><br/>Rebuilding Chicago also comes with a solo player deck so that you can compete to build the best version of Chicago even with just one player.

        "description": "Late to the Fight is an historical simulation of the battle fought on May 13, 1865 just east of Brownsville, Texas along the Rio Grande River. Although the Confederate forces and their leaders knew of the surrender of Confederate forces in the east, as well as the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, die-hards in state government and the remaining forces in Texas remained defiant. Union forces had occupied Brownsville, Texas in November 1863, but most of the Union forces there were withdrawn in November 1864 to where the Rio Grande emptied into the Gulf of Mexico at Brazos Island, Texas to guard against smuggling by pro-South Mexicans. A &ldquo;gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement&rdquo; between the Union and Confederate forces in the area meant a relative calm had prevailed since then. However, when Union General Lew Wallace&rsquo;s attempts to negotiate a surrender of all Confederate forces and the state of Texas were rebuffed in March, tensions grew. When General Wallace learned of a large Confederate force assembling at Brownsville, orders were issued for the 34th Indiana Infantry Regiment and 62nd United States Colored Troops Regiment to retake the town and disperse any rebel forces found there. What ensued as the last battle of the American Civil War, fought nearly a month after the surrender at Appomattox Court House. Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>Each turn in Late to the Fight represents one hour of time. Infantry and Cavalry units represent Companies. Artillery units represent 2-4 guns. A hex on the map is approximately 250 yards across.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As a result this game both re-implements and expands Catacombs 3E. All Catacombs 3E expansions are compatible with Fortress.<br/><br/>In the Catacombs related games, players must skilfully flick wooden discs that represent one of the characters under their control. Usually this is a hero or a monster, if playing as the Dungeon Master or &quot;Overseer&quot;. Flicking a disc represents a &quot;shot&quot;. The basic shots are rush (for moving) and melee (for both moving and attacking). When performing a ranged shot, a separate disc is used instead of a hero or monster's disc. Ranged shots include fireballs, ice boulders, missiles and hook shots. Some shots inflict damage while others enable special effects. When all of the monsters in a room have been cleared, the heroes can advance further up the fortress.<br/><br/>New features: Crates (treasure chests) that contain both rewards and traps appear on runes during the Battle Phase. Assistants can be rescued that will help the heroes in their quest through the Fortress. Items may be purchased during the Battle Phase.<br/><br/>This is expected to be the last entry in the Catacombs 3E series of games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If you grab the egg first, you win the set. But just because you win the set doesn't mean you keep it...<br/><br/>Gameplay: Players take turns to draw cards away from themselves from the middle of the table. If a player draws a bird card that is identical to one that they already have, the player can make a pile of the matching cards in front of them. If a player collects * 3 identical bird cards * everyone must try to grab a wooden egg that is in the middle of the table. Whoever gets the egg first, wins the set of cards too.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, there are some sneaky cards called consequence cards. These cards can make players lose, gain, swap and steal entire sets of bird cards from other players, meaning that no set is safe!!! If a player draws a consequence card, they must follow the instructions on the card, and then place the consequence cards and any other relevant cards in the discard pile.<br/><br/>The player who collects 5 sets of bird cards, wins the game.<br/><br/>Simple!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionMesbur (from Welsh: Maes brwydr, which means battlefield) is a strategy game for two players. It uses 36 numbered dominoes from 0 to 7, a dice with enough faces, and three tokens called medals. The objective of the game is to strategically place the dominoes on the playing field, creating sets and sequences to earn points. This game began to be created in 2009 by Sa&iuml;d Gadwen, but it took until 2024 to perfect its rules.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSetup:The initial setup of the field is done by placing two columns of dominoes. The first column consists of eight dominoes with even numbers, starting from domino 0-0 and ascending to domino 7-7. The second column is placed to the right of the first and contains eight dominoes with sequential numbers, starting from domino 0-1 and ascending to domino 7-0. It is important to ensure that the adjacent numbers between the columns match.<br/><br/>This initial arrangement of the field forms a total of sixteen horizontally arranged dominoes. The remaining dominoes are used for the pie bidding, meaning they are kept separate from the playing field.<br/><br/>The initial setup of the field looks as follows:<br/><br/>　　　7-7 | 7-0　　　<br/>　　　6-6 | 6-7　　　<br/>　　　5-5 | 5-6　　　<br/>　　　4-4 | 4-5　　　<br/>　　　3-3 | 3-4　　　<br/>　　　2-2 | 2-3　　　<br/>　　　  1-1  | 1-2　　　<br/>　　　0-0 | 0-1　　　<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A square is half of a domino, with values from 0 to 7.<br/>&ndash; The vanguard is the set of dominoes in each player's possession.<br/>&ndash; The barricade consists of two discarded dominoes from the vanguard, used to block opponent's combinations.<br/>&ndash; A row is a set of squares placed in a straight line between the vanguard dominoes, dividing them into two opposing zones: upper and lower.<br/>&ndash; The field is the set of sixteen horizontally arranged dominoes.<br/>&ndash; The configuration is the arrangement of the dominoes on the field.<br/>&ndash; A blocker is a square that makes an opponent's combinations ending in its value lose against any combination regardless of its strength.<br/>&ndash; Dominance is the ability of a domino to block opponent's combinations by having a blocker.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCombinations:Combinations are divided into two classes: Sets and Sequences.<br/><br/>&ndash; Sets are combinations of at least three repeated numbers in the lower row and five in the upper row.<br/>&ndash; Sequences are combinations of at least three consecutive numbers in the lower row and five in the upper row.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tValue of combinations:Combinations have two ranks: length and height.<br/><br/>&ndash; Length is the number of squares used in the combination. The longer the length, the higher the value.<br/>&ndash; Height is the value of the square with the highest number. The higher the height, the higher the value.<br/><br/>The combination with the longest length wins, ignoring the height. In case of a tie, the combination with the highest height wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie bidding:The bidder is randomly chosen, usually using a dice, where more importance is given to higher numbers. The bidder separates the remaining dominoes from the field into two groups, placing them face up to form the vanguards. Then, the second player, who will be the acceptor, chooses one of the vanguards to play with. In the next round, the other player becomes the bidder and so on.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEquipment phase:The bidder starts the game, then turns alternate. Then, on your turn, after the pie bidding, you can either (i) choose to pass your turn, which will end the equip phase if they are consecutive passes, or (ii) perform these actions in the following order:<br/><br/>1. Choose two of your dominoes and place them face down to form the barricade.<br/>2. Place one of your dominoes horizontally adjacent to a field domino, so that the numbers on the ends match when they touch.<br/><br/>In the following example, the number 6 dominoes touch:<br/><br/>　　　7-7 | 7-0　　　<br/>　　　6-6 | 6-7　　　<br/>　　　5-5 | 5-6 | 6-3 <br/>　　　4-4 | 4-5　　　<br/>　　　3-3 | 3-4　　　<br/>　　　2-2 | 2-3　　　<br/>　　　  1-1  | 1-2　　　<br/>　　　0-0 | 0-1　　　<br/><br/>3. Push the selected field domino inward using your newly placed domino, thus pushing out the domino on the opposite end of the field.<br/><br/>In the following example, the 5-5 domino is pushed out to the other side of the field:<br/><br/>　　　7-7 | 7-0　　　<br/>　　　6-6 | 6-7　　　<br/>   　5-5 | 5-6 | 6-3　　　<br/>　　　4-4 | 4-5　　　<br/>　　　3-3 | 3-4　　　<br/>　　　2-2 | 2-3　　　<br/>　　　  1-1  | 1-2　　　<br/>　　　0-0 | 0-1　　　<br/><br/>4. Take the domino that you pushed out of the field and place it with your vanguard dominoes.<br/>5. Increase the value of the dice by one if, and only if, you are the bidder, and end your turn.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCombat phase:This phase is carried out after the equipment phase, which will be carried out under these steps in the following order:<br/><br/>1. Attack step: The player who manages to form three combinations and two of them occupy the eight squares of the bottom row will have the opportunity to show his pieces, forcing the opponent to do the same. This step can be used as an alternative to finishing the equip phase instead of consecutive passes.<br/><br/>2. Defense step: The two barricade tokens are flipped over to reveal their contents. The piece with the highest number has dominance, so it blocks all of the opponent's combinations that end in that number. If none of them manage to do so, dominance will pass to the other piece on the barricade. The other player can steal one or both of the barricade tiles as long as he can improve some of his combinations and the blocking number does not change.<br/><br/>Upon completing the previous steps, players compare their combinations from greatest to least strength. For each winning combination, the player will receive a medal. Then, the tiles on the field will remain as they are to acquire a new configuration, while the other tiles will be used for the new pie bidding.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tScoring points:The points are calculated as follows:<br/><br/>&ndash; The squares that are not part of a player's combinations are added up together with those of their opponent to obtain the community score.<br/>&ndash; Both players will multiply the community score by the number of medals obtained to obtain the individual score.<br/>&ndash; Then, both players will multiply the value of the dice by the number of medals obtained, which will be added to their individual score.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:The game can be played for four, six, or eight rounds, depending on the players' preference, and the player with the most points at the end of all the rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes:In Mesbur, tiles similar to dominoes are used in terms of shape and size. However, instead of dots, these tiles are numbered with dashes. In addition, it should be noted that the Mesbur tiles are a little thicker so that they remain in a vertical position and allow better visualization of the combinations during the game. This also makes it easier to cover these combinations from the opponent during the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Every player has 5 hours per turn. <br/>Those hours are used for two actions, moving (costs 1 hour, roll the die and move in any direction) and painting (you need hours and spray cans for that)<br/>The smaller graffitis cost less spraycans and hours than the bigger ones.<br/><br/>At the start of the game you have 4 tags (smallest graffiti), 2 spray cans and 1 coin.

        "description": "Following the French surrender, an invasion of Great Britain was increasingly likely. However, the severe losses sustained by Germany&rsquo;s Kreigsmarine with the invasion of Norway, and Hitler&rsquo;s desire to compel Great Britain to come to terms with Nazi Germany, were significant factors that made such an invasion unlikely. Seeing the increasingly vulnerability of the British to blockade, Hitler ordered Admiral Erich Raeder to develop a plan to invade Iceland, dubbed Fall Icarus (Plan Ikarus). If successful, the island could serve as a base from which German submarines and aircraft could threaten any convoy approaching the British Isles. It could also serve as an advanced base for German surface warships and commerce raiders, further strengthening the German naval strangle hold. The capture of Iceland, on the heels of Dunkirk, could also bring about the fall of Winston Churchill as Prime Minister, and the rise of someone more amenable to a negotiated end to the war between Great Britain and Nazi Germany (Lord Halifax, the King&rsquo;s preference for Prime Minister perhaps?). This designer has made some assumptions in crafting this game:<br/><br/><br/>     German intelligence efforts, which at this point in the war were actually superior to those currently available to the British, were able to accurately estimate the British defense works and capabilities at Iceland (which were weak in many key areas).<br/>     Operation Icarus is given much higher priority over the preparations for Operation Sealion, the invasion of Great Britain (the latter becomes a diversion and feint intended to keep the Royal Navy and Air Force full attention).<br/>     Unfinished warships such as the battleship Bismarck and aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin are used in support of Operation Ikarus and to help deceive/mislead the British.<br/><br/><br/>Each turn represents six hours of time. A hex is about 6 kilometers across on the Akureyri map, about 10 kilometers on the Reykjavik map. Infantry units are battalions and tank units represent companies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It took nearly a year for the US to mobilize, equip, train and then transport to Europe an army after it declared war on Germany and the Central Powers in April 1917 when it entered the &ldquo;War to end all wars&rdquo;. However, by 1940 it was very apparent to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the various leaders of the US military, that America could not afford to wait until it entered the next conflict to raise and equip a modern army, and expect to emerge victorious from the conflicts raging in Europe and Asia. After initiating the first peace time draft in US history that same year, despite strenuous and heated debate and a very strong and wide-spread isolationist sentiment, Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall ordered two large scale military maneuvers to be held to test and train the new recruits, their weaponry and tactics in 1941. These maneuvers, the first two held in Louisiana and a third in the Carolinas, were concluded weeks before the attack at Pearl Harbor, and would prove decisive in determining what kind of forces the US would field, and the leaders who would command them, to victory in WWII.<br/><br/>Combat units are mostly regiments, brigades or their equivalent sized battle groups. Exception: A Paratrooper unit represents two platoons (Louisiana) or one company (Carolinas), and an AT unit represents a reinforced battalion. Each turn of the game represents 8 hours of time.  Each hex on the Louisiana map is approximately a 5.5 miles across; approximately 4 miles across on the Carolinas map.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A single stone is also a phalanx.<br/>&ndash; The length of a phalanx is the number of stones it contains.<br/>&ndash; A new phalanx is a phalanx that, during a turn, grows by at least one additional stone adjacent to it in a straight line, even if two friendly phalanxes merge or not, otherwise it is an old phalanx.<br/>&ndash; An invading phalanx is a new phalanx that is sandwiched between two enemy phalanxes adjacent to the invading phalanx, all arranged in a straight line. The two mentioned enemy phalanxes are invaded phalanxes.<br/>&ndash; To flip is replacing a stone with a stone of the opposite color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform these actions in the following order:<br/><br/>1. Place a stone of your color on an empty point not adjacent to enemy phalanxes, unless you are forming a friendly invading phalanx.<br/>2. Flip a number N of stones from invaded phalanxes whenever N is equal for the pair of such phalanxes and is equal to the length of the shorter phalanx among the invaded phalanxes in that same straight line.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of game:The game ends when the board is full. At the end of the game, the player with the most number of stones of their color on the board is the winner.<br/><br/>To ensure fairness, before the game starts, the first player places a black stone on an empty point and the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called the pie rule.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "El Rosc&oacute;n es un juego de mesa con la tem&aacute;tica principal del cl&aacute;sico rosc&oacute;n de reyes de navidad. Los jugadores ir&aacute;n cogiendo trozos de rosc&oacute;n y acumulando puntos hasta que alguien coja la desdichada haba. Hay cartas de acci&oacute;n y de puntos. Al final de 3 roscones, el jugador que m&aacute;s puntos tenga ser&aacute; el ganador. Se podr&iacute;a clasificar como filler y Party, ya que es un juego sencillo, r&aacute;pido, para muchos jugadores y divertid&iacute;simo. Se cogen todos los trozos y se colocan en formas de rosc&oacute;n, si no te sale un c&iacute;rculo muy definido no importa, eso quiere decir que el rosc&oacute;n es m&aacute;s artesano. Cada jugador en su turno coge un trozo de donde quiera, aunque est&eacute; en la otra punta (Es que era el m&aacute;s grande, con m&aacute;s almendras y el que mejor pinta ten&iacute;a, punto). Si es una acci&oacute;n, la hace, teniendo en cuenta un m&aacute;ximo de una acci&oacute;n por jugador. Por lo que si una acci&oacute;n te lleva a otra acci&oacute;n, pues se acaba tu turno y no se hace. Y si son puntos, te lo quedas boca arriba enfrente tuya. As&iacute; hasta que alguien coja el haba o te hagan cogerla.<br/><br/>El Rosc&oacute;n is a board game with the main theme of the classic Christmas rosc&oacute;n. Players will collect pieces of rosc&oacute;n and accumulate points until someone takes the unfortunate bean. There are action cards and points cards. At the end of 3 roscones, the player with the most points will be the winner. It could be classified as filler and Party, since it is a simple, fast game, for many players and a lot of fun. All the pieces are taken and placed in rosc&oacute;n shapes, if you don't get a very defined circle it doesn't matter, that means that the rosc&oacute;n is more artisanal. Each player in turn takes a piece from wherever they want, even if it is at the other end (It was the biggest, with the most almonds and the best looking, period). If it is an action, he does it, taking into account a maximum of one action per player. So if an action leads you to another action, then your turn is over and it is not done. And if they are points, you keep them face up in front of you. That is until someone picks the bean or they make you pick it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Moonrakers are on the brink.<br/><br/>They have thrown off the oppressive yoke of the Utopian Alliance, but they are in a constant struggle to stay independent and find their identity. Alliances are formed and factions arise as the Moonrakers agree to turn their focus outward instead of squabbling over what little they have. Captains push out into unknown corners of the system in attempt to gain resources, influence, and power. The tenuous alliances will only last so long and soon someone must emerge to lead or they will fall.<br/><br/>Brink is a worker placement, trading, and hidden voting game that brings the world of Moonrakers to a new genre. It combines the strategy and planning of a worker placement game with the negotiation and &ldquo;above the table&rdquo; play found in Moonrakers and Fractured Sky.<br/><br/>Each turn, players will place one of three different sized ships (workers) onto a grid of hexes. Each hex will gain the player resources and actions, but even more importantly, it will give them power within a faction based on the color of the hex. At the end of each round, players will vote on which faction will score points, which is then multiplied by the amount of power each player has in that factions color on the board.<br/><br/>Players will upgrade their ships, hire ambassadors, explore new systems, and spend influence to complete faction objectives, granting them new abilities. Each game, the map will reveal in a totally new way as regions are explored, presenting new strategies as well as strengths and weaknesses to existing strategies. The player with the most prestige points at the end of 4 rounds wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

So let's start a real Battle of the Brewers!<br/><br/>Each player's turn consists of several sequential actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw cards. The player takes two material cards and two product cards into his hand.<br/>     Combination. The player combines raw material and products cards to complete the task.<br/>     Draw event cards. The player takes an event card from the deck.<br/>     Hand check. If there are more than five cards in the hand, the player discards the extra ones, but order and event cards do not count towards the limit.<br/><br/><br/>In addition, you can play event cards at any time during your turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player manages to complete five orders, and the winner is determined by the number of victory points.<br/><br/>",

Even stranger is the fact that all of the information on the pawn ticket- including name, address, and phone number-is yours. Curious as to who sent the ticket and why something was pawned in your name, you visit the pawn shop, trade in the pawn ticket, and wait anxiously while the clerk rummages around to find the item. Eventually, he returns with a puzzle box and tells you that the amount borrowed against the value of the box is a single dollar. You pay the dollar eagerly and begin trying to open the box to see what&rsquo;s inside. As you quickly find out, there is more to this puzzle than meets the eye. A lot more.

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction:Gardar (from Old Norse: Gar&eth;ar, meaning &quot;fences, enclosed spaces, castles&quot;) is a drawless game for two players: Black and White. It is played at the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board. The recommended board size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on a 11&ndash;sized board for longer games or a 7&ndash;sized board for shorter games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A group is a set of stones of the same color connected to each other. A single stone is also a group.<br/>&ndash; An enclosure is a set of empty points or enemy stones bounded by stones of any color without including the empty points on the edge for bounding. You control an enclosure if the majority of the stones that bound it are your color.<br/>&ndash; A shared enclosure is an enclosure bounded by an equal number of friendly and enemy stones.<br/>&ndash; A loop is a set of stones of the same color around an enclosure, such that no additional stone can be removed without breaking the closed circuit of the loop.<br/>&ndash; The perimeter loop of a group is a loop located on the boundary of a group. The perimeter loop may contain one or more enclosures.<br/>&ndash; A surplus stone is a stone that, when removed, does not break the perimeter loop of any group.<br/>&ndash; The value of a group is the number of stones that form its perimeter loop, excluding surplus stones.<br/>&ndash; A dead stone is a stone adjacent to an enemy enclosure, unless it is adjacent to a friendly or shared enclosure. A set of stones that are bounded by more enemy stones than friendly ones are also dead, empty points on the edge are not included for the bounding.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, take one of the following actions:<br/>&ndash; Place a stone of your color on an empty point, then remove all dead enemy stones.<br/>&ndash; Pass your turn.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, the board position must be different from the board positions at the end of all your previous turns.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:The game ends when both players pass their turn consecutively. At the end of the game, points are scored based on the number of friendly stones in the perimeter loops adjacent to at least one enclosure within the corresponding group, minus the number of surplus stones on the board. Additionally, half an extra point is awarded to the player who passed their turn first.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, before the game begins, the first player chooses an integer as the komi value, and then the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called pie komi.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player has 6 chips of their color, and 1 card at a time. The card has a word on it that describes where to hide one of the chips. The goal is to hide a chip in, on, or around the word on your card. Once you&rsquo;ve done that, you draw a new card and hide another chip.<br/><br/>While you&rsquo;re hiding your own chips, you&rsquo;re also on the lookout for those of other players. If you come across any or spot someone in the act of planting one, you call them out and they have to take the chip back and draw a new card. This means you have to be subtle and smart about how, when, and where you plant your chips to avoid detection.<br/><br/>The best parts of the game are when you get a really sly plant just behind someone's back without being spotted, or when you catch another player&rsquo;s subtle move out of the corner of your eye and call them out and make a scene. You get to feel really slick, like a spy or secret agent outplaying the opposition in moments like that throughout the whole game.<br/><br/>",

A player scores by matching color segments on snakes.<br/><br/>As noted, instead of a dice, the unique Cyclop's Cave is used to pick up randomly the snakes. The other interesting and novel part is that the snakes may be placed in two different ways adding to a combination of memory and strategy game. There are also special snakes that have special mathematical actions.<br/><br/>Solo rules: Place all 24 snakes on the outlines of medousa&rsquo;s head by matching the color segments on the snakes when they overlay another snakes.

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. The recommended board size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on a 11&ndash;sized board for longer games or a 7&ndash;sized board for shorter games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A group is a set of stones of the same color connected to each other. A single stone is also a group.<br/>&ndash; A partition is each of the areas separated by a group that cannot be connected to each other except through said group.<br/>&ndash; The value of a group is the number of partitions it contains based on triangular scoring, which is calculated by summing consecutive natural numbers from 1 to the number of partitions in the group.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, do one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&ndash; Place a stone of your color on an empty point.<br/>&ndash; Pass your turn.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:The game ends when both players pass their turns consecutively. At the end of the game, points are counted by summing the value of all friendly groups, plus an extra half point to the player who passes his turn first.<br/><br/>To ensure fairness, before the game begins, the first player chooses an integer number as the komi value and then the second player chooses the sides. This balancing method is called komi pie.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The mid-weight pick-up &amp; delivery game has players taking on the roles of monster hunters from the paranormal society, Invisible, Inc. Guided by your helpful and often maniacal AI assistant, Boogle, the hunters search a haunted house for the AR monsters lurking in the various rooms. It&rsquo;s their mission to find the correct gear and capture three monsters first. But if the house gets overrun by Haunted Objects, the monsters escape the board and HAUNT YOUR HOUSE in a real-world AR monster hunt!<br/><br/>On your turn, a player takes three actions from seven potential actions. Players must move through the house collecting the specific gear they need to catch the monsters hiding in the house. Using the Boogle app, players can scan the house to find the monster and ultimately catch them. But beware of Haunted Objects lurking in the house that will scare you back to the starting gate.<br/><br/>At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn, it&rsquo;s the monster&rsquo;s turn, having the players roll the Monster Dice, which often brings new challenges but can bring rewards, too. If three Haunted Objects are unveiled in the house or the Grand Escape icon is rolled, the house becomes unstable and the monsters escape the board in an AR monster hunting event. The player who blasts the most monsters in the Grand Escape is rewarded two gear tiles and the chance to rid the house of one Haunted Object. The first player to capture three monsters is the winner!<br/><br/>The game can be played with or without the AR app.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The behaviors have been already experienced by us (especially by the creator of this game) and by playing Plato&rsquo;s Cave, we get to experience them again to think critically and creatively.<br/><br/>The IQ scale used in this game is a playful one and has nothing to do with other (subjective) IQ scales used around the world.<br/><br/>And in contrast to some other games, where we are taught to harm others in order to win, in this game we win by helping others.<br/><br/>Experience and knowledge are combined to become intelligence.<br/><br/>The game is played by 2 to 4 Players, while there is also a 1-Player Puzzle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A group is a set of stones of the same color connected to each other. A single stone is also a group.<br/>&ndash; A partition is each of the areas separated by a group that cannot be connected to each other except through said group.<br/>&ndash; The value of a group is the number of stones it contains.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, do one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&ndash; Place a stone of your color on an empty point. You can create a triangle pattern if exactly one of its stones is on the edge of the board and the rest or all of them (not on the edge) are adjacent to (i) a friendly stone that is not part of a triangle pattern or to (ii) a center stone of an hourglass pattern.<br/>&ndash; Pass your turn.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the above restrictions apply to all triangle patterns.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:The game ends when both players pass their turns consecutively. At the end of the game, points are counted by adding the value of all friendly groups with partitions minus the value of all friendly groups without partitions, plus an extra half point to the player who passed their turn first.<br/><br/>To ensure fairness, before the game begins, the first player chooses an integer number as the komi value and then the second player chooses the sides. This balancing method is called komi pie.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Like the town within which it resides, the asylum is also the source of its fair share of mysteries such as the fire in 2002 that led to several deaths. Now, more than 20 years later, new evidence has come to light that seems to indicate the fire may have been used to cover up something sinister. With this new evidence in hand, you enter this notorious mental health facility to get to the bottom of what really happened all those years ago. To your surprise, there are still workers on site who were employed at Saturn Hills at the time of the fire. There are also patients who were housed there in 2002.

It is played on the intersections (points) of a initially empty square board. The default board size is 17 points per side, but it can be played on a 15-sized board for intermediate players or a 13-sized board for beginners. There is also a location outside the board called prison. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>This game is based on Anda.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A group is a set of stones of the same color connected orthogonally. A single stone is also a group.<br/>&ndash; A supergroup is a set of groups of the same color connected diagonally. A single group is also a supergroup.<br/>&ndash; A liberty is an empty point adjacent orthogonally or diagonally to a group.<br/>&ndash; A smothered group is a group where all its liberties has a path of N empty points connected to exactly one enemy supergroup, where N can be zero.<br/>&ndash; A territory is a set of connected empty points. You own a territory if you are the only one who can place stones on those points.<br/> &ndash; To annihilate is to place a stone on an empty point that smother all enemy groups, leaving the board with stones only of your color. You cannot annihilate if your opponent also annihilated in a previous turn.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&ndash; Place a stone of your color on an empty point, then move all smothered friendly and enemy groups to prison. If it's your first turn, do this twice on non-adjacent empty points.<br/>&ndash; Remove an enemy stone from prison.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, the group of the stone you placed cannot be left smothered.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:&ndash; The player who made the last move wins the game.<br/>&ndash; A player has the option to &quot;propose end&quot; of the game and the other player must accept it or not. In case of acceptance, points will be counted by adding the friendly territory and enemy prisoners, and also awarding an extra half point to the player who made the last move.<br/><br/>For the game to be fair, before it starts:<br/><br/>&ndash; Player 1 places two black stones.<br/>&ndash; Player 2 either (i) swaps or (ii) places two white stones.<br/>　&ndash; If (i), Player 1 places two white stones and Player 2 either swaps or accepts.<br/>　&ndash; If (ii), Player 1 either swaps or accepts.<br/><br/>Then, the player with the black stones offers a komi pie, where the first player places several black stones in the prison and the second player chooses a side. The player with the white stones either swaps or accepts. I have called this balancing method dual pie rule.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariant:For a simpler option, each player places two stones of their color on non-adjacent corners during game setup. Then Black starts the game by playing the first normal turn. The komi pie can also be used for balance.<br/><br/>Additionally, for better visual clarity it is recommended that beginners start playing with optional captures.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes:Special thanks to Christopher Field for his contribution to a simpler alternative balancing method.

On a player's turn, they roll a single 6-sided die, and must place it in a column on their board. A filled column does not accept any more dice.<br/>Each player's score, which is the sum of all the dice values on their board. If a player places multiple dice of the same value in the same column, the score awarded for each of those dice is multiplied by the number of dice of the same value in that column. <br/>When a player places a die, all dice of the same value in the corresponding column of the opponent's board gets destroyed. Players can use this to destroy their opponent's high-scoring combos.<br/>The game ends when either player completely fills up their 3x3 board. The player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction:Droched (from Irish: Droichead, meaning &quot;bridge&quot;) is a board game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the hexes (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal board. The default board size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on a 11&ndash;sized board for longer games or on a 7&ndash;sized board for shorter games. There is also a location outside the board called the prison. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A group is a set of stones of the same color connected to each other. A single stone is also a group.<br/>&ndash; It is said that a group is on a bridge if any of its stones have paths through empty cells connecting it to at least two board edges, two corners, or one board edge and one corner. If none of the stones in a group have those paths, the group is on a broken bridge. The corners are not part of the edges.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&ndash; Place a stone of your color on an empty cell. Then, in the following order, move to the prison (i) all enemy groups on broken bridges and (ii) all friendly groups on broken bridges.<br/>&ndash; Remove an enemy stone from the prison.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, the stone you placed must not be the only dead stone, and the board position must be different from the board positions at the end of all your previous turns.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of game:The game ends when a player takes the last action, in which case they are declared the winner.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, before it begins, the first player places several black stones in the prison and then the second player chooses a side. This method of balance is called the komi pie. For handicap games, the weaker player takes black and starts by placing on the board a number of black stones proportional to the difference in skills between the players.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes:The prison mechanism was introduced by David Wolfe and Elwyn Berlekamp in their book Mathematical Go: Chilling Gets the Last Point.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Embark on an exciting cooperative gaming experience with the Tiny Epic Game of Thrones: Ice &amp; Fire expansion. In this unique twist on the original game, players must work together to unite the Seven Kingdoms against the menacing threat of the Night King and his army of White Walkers. While the core mechanics remain mostly the same, players must now strategize and collaborate to outsmart and outmaneuver this formidable foe.<br/><br/>As fear spreads among the non-player houses due to the Night King's relentless advance southward, building alliances becomes crucial. The fate of Westeros hangs in the balance, and without the support of these houses, all hope may be lost.<br/><br/>The expansion introduces two new playable houses: House Targaryen and The Night's Watch. Players can embody iconic heroes such as Daenerys Targaryen with her three dragons, and Jon Snow.<br/><br/>The map of Westeros is expanded to include new regions beyond the Wall. As long as the Wall stands, the White Walkers are contained. However, once the Wall falls, they will be unleashed upon Westeros, wreaking havoc as they march southward.<br/><br/>Each round begins with players receiving a report from the Rangers of the Night's Watch. These reports, represented by a deck of cards, reveal where the Night King and his army will strike next. This mechanic, along with the Night King's Ice Dragon, adds an element of suspense and strategy to the game, driving the movements of the Night King.<br/><br/>The expansion also introduces a new element of exploration to the game. Throughout the domains on both sides of the Wall, players will encounter various exploration tokens with unique effects. It is essential for players to collaborate in searching these domains for Dragonglass and Valyrian Steel. The discovery of an ample supply of these resources is crucial for success, as the power of the Night King diminishes with each Dragonglass recovered, and the strength of the White Walkers decreases with each Valyrian Steel token found. Without these resources, players will have no hope of defeating the Night King.<br/><br/>The challenge of defeating the Night King requires seamless coordination among all participants. The ultimate outcome of their collective efforts will be clear-cut: either successfully eliminate the Night King within six rounds of gameplay, or face the catastrophic loss of Westeros.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Le Banquet pour Louis is a simple, fast and highly competitive game in which the players are chefs who try to satisfy every request of King Louis XV. before the big banquet.<br/><br/>In a series of separate rounds, the dishes you cook will be worth a different number of points, and it's up to you to maximize them towards victory. However, you must regularly watch out for other chefs at the table, because each dish activates special, sometimes insidious, mini-actions. This way you can run out of cooked dishes or someone can steal a dish that is just being prepared, but there are also ways of 'defense', for example if you cook a fish dish that gives you a short immunity to the wickedness of other teammates.<br/><br/>In the game, everyone is sweating about the random arrival of the king on a tour of the kitchens. As soon as he knocks on the door (jumps out of the deck of cards with dishes), the game stops, and the king goes from one table to another and tastes the finest dish - i.e. the dish that is worth the most points that particular round. The only way to save your most valuable dish is to distract the king with the king's cat, a card that rarely appears in the deck, and which is equally valued by chefs and the king.<br/><br/>Le Banquet pour Louis is primarily intended for families, has simple rules and is very intuitive. Replayability is guaranteed with a number of different cards with scoring dishes, and the always random appearance of Louis on a tour.<br/><br/>",

Work together with your fellow scientists; however, rumor has it that a rival company has attempted to bribe someone to sabotage your efforts... Of course, it is just a rumor, right?<br/><br/>The Cure is a small hidden role game where you are working together to reach your goal. Players are dealt a hidden role and 12 numbered cards with the rest set to the side. Then, players will take turns adding 1 card face down to a center pile while declaring aloud the supposed total of the cards. If suspicion gets too high, a vote may be taken to use a microscope to check the last played card, but only the active player may look. Once players believe they are close to the goal, they may vote to stop. If the goal is reached, the good players win! If not, the bad player wins. There may be games with no bad player, so if the goal is not reached, all of the players lose!<br/><br/>Carefully selected truths and lies are the main strategy of this game, whether good or bad, a well made lie can guarantee victory. Just be careful not to be caught.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These should work separately or in various combinations, including with the earlier Fair Youth expansions. The new content includes:<br/><br/>The Darkest Ladies - Unlike those in the base game or Fair Youth expansion, this alternative set of Dark Lady cards has no suits, and you must deduce the Dark Lady&rsquo;s symbols in their correct order. Features more card-flipping hole-peeking antics.<br/><br/>Indirections - This expansion adds two different types of stealth cards to be mixed into your deck. Cards with compass symbols show what compass direction the Dark Lady traveled from her last location, while others show the potential colour of her current location.<br/><br/>Blazonry - The Dark Lady is hiding behind the shield of her heraldic blazon. To access her you must first deduce the symbols of her blazon using special fog cards.<br/><br/>The Ferryman - The ferry is the quickest way to get around London, allowing you to travel from any riverside location (marked with the boat icon) to any other riverside location in one turn, possibly heading off the Dark Lady as she flees. But this comes at a cost &ndash; the ferryman protects the Dark Lady, preventing you from searching for her at any riverside location. In addition, you must collect the location cards in a specific order.<br/><br/>Cat and Mouse - This is an asymmetric two-player game of cat and mouse, where one player is the Dark Lady and the other is the Historian trying to track and unmask her.<br/><br/>Tarry cards - This small expansion allows you to temporarily pause the Dark Lady&rsquo;s flight, potentially letting you catch up to her, but you must pay a later cost...<br/><br/>Extra fog cards - Four additional fog cards are provided, each with a beneficial effect. You may use these to: (a) Increase the size of the fog deck to allow more searches in a game &ndash; especially if including the harder Dark Ladies from either expansion, as these may require more clues to solve; (b) Replace detrimental fog cards in the base deck to make it more appealing (but still risky) to use fog cards that arise; or (c) Randomly replace fog cards from the base deck to increase the variety of fog card actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It can play solo or up to five players with built in accelerators for higher player counts to speed the game along. In most game modes you are changing the purchase and draw options when you make your own purchases, laying new cards on top of the ones accessible to players atop the six draw-discard piles.<br/><br/>Varied and largely unique costs for permanent resources challenge players to find buy-path patterns and make strategic choices on wether to reserve cards as part of a draw or hope to buy them before someone else snatches it up. There are many paths to victory, and winning strategies may change as the purchase options alter. The cards have vital information clearly showing along with colorful imagery and art. Each of the seven element colors also has a unique symbol to aid color-blind players.<br/><br/>There are five play modes, from a very fast and easy intro-mode called &quot;Initiate&quot;, to &quot;Novice&quot; (harder but much more strategically involved game, to the standard modes of &quot;Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Journeyman&quot; (adds some rules to boost scores) and &quot;Alchemist&quot; (adds a few more rules to boost scoring even more).

However, the fight for the British colony was severe and prolonged. The US mounted a double-pronged offensive from New York to take Canadian capital city of Montreal in the fall of 1813 planned by US Secretary of War, John Armstrong, Jr. However, the two US forces were commanded by Generals James Wilkenson, who had a particularly dubious and corrupt history, and Major General Wade Hampton, who loathed and despised Wilkenson.  With little to no cooperation between the US forces, their British and Canadian opponents were able to deal with each US force separately.<br/><br/>With most of the British regular forces devoted to dealing with Wilkenson, it was left to Canadian militia and First Nation warriors, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles de Salabarry, to stop Hampton. The combined Canadian and First Nation force skirmished repeatedly with the Americans as soon as they crossed the St. Lawrence River, frustrating Hampton&rsquo;s hopes that he could beat his rival to Montreal. The weather and sparsely settled region meant that the few trails were muddy quagmires that frequently mired the American supply wagons and artillery caissons, slowing the American&rsquo;s advance even more. Along the Chateauguay River Hampton learned that the enemy had built a substantial defensive position along the main route to Montreal, and he divided his force in two. One would pin the Canadians and First Nation warriors in place, while the other crossed the river to flank the enemy and capture fords that were to the rear of their defensive works. If successful, the enemy would be trapped and the way to Montreal open to the Americans. However, dividing one&rsquo;s force in the face of an undefeated and determined enemy is a very dangerous gambit in warfare.<br/><br/>Can you do as well, or better, than your historical counterparts?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HitPoint is a multi-purpose card game for players to create characters, build decks, and battle in a standalone trading card format or adventure in a tabletop RPG campaign.<br/><br/>Your deck represents your health, which is also your main resource to play cards. The more powerful the card, the more it will exhaust your character. You win when all opponents&rsquo; HP is reduced to 0 or they run out of playable cards, and you have cards remaining in your deck or your hand.<br/><br/>This keeps the game fast and simple, while giving a satisfying visual effect to your character&rsquo;s exhaustion.<br/><br/>HitPoint features meaningful strategy in combination with random dice rolling. This allows each player to make choices that affect how the game progresses but the dice rolls can influence the potency of cards played. Even the rarest cards can underperform and the common cards can overperform.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;If they help Saddam Hussein attack our economic resources they will not see oil.&rdquo; &ndash;Ayatollah Khomeini, Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran.<br/><br/>January 1985 marked over four years of bloody war between Iraq and Iran. The previous year Saddam Hussein, leader of Iraq, initiated a new campaign in the war with Iran by having his air force target the Iranian Kharg Island oil installations and any shipping caught loading there. Saddam realized that if Iran&rsquo;s ability to sell oil was successfully brought under attack, that nation&rsquo;s ability to wage war would be severely impacted. In response, Iran constructed a floating terminal at Sirri Island that was beyond the range of Iraqi warplanes. Iranian tankers ferried oil from Kharg Island to Sirri where the Iranian oil could then be safely off-loaded. What ensued was an escalating war in the Persian Gulf in which Iraqi warplanes targeted any vessel suspected of heading for any of Iran&rsquo;s ports, and similar efforts by Iran&rsquo;s warplanes, ships and Pasdaran militia attack boats targeting ships they believed were heading for Iraq and ports in Arab nations sympathetic to their enemy. 1985 promised to be a year in which the violence of the growing &ldquo;Tanker War&rdquo; could spread throughout the region and threaten the economies of nations all over the globe.<br/><br/>In Blood and Oil players take on the roles of the leaders of the Iran and Iraq military forces fighting the 1985 Tanker War in a moderate complexity level wargame. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Covers will be color-coded similar to Conway&rsquo;s (blue, green and red respectively) and each volume will be comprised of ship logs for each country (alphabetic by country, then ship type, then completion date) preceded by summary pages for each country.  A single ship log for each class (using the data of a representative ship of the class for the time period) is provided and for ship classes spanning volumes (i.e. all the WW1-era battleships and cruisers like HOOD, CAVOUR, PENNSYLVANIA, etc.), updated versions will appear in the subsequent volume.<br/><br/>The first two volumes are limited to battleships, battlecruisers, armored cruisers and light cruisers but the third volume will also contain individual ship logs for classes of destroyers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Iran has bared its hostile designs against the Arab nation and its pan-Arab revolutionary movement&rdquo; &ndash;Saddam Hussein, April 1980.<br/><br/>When the conflict between Iraq and Iran erupted into full scale war with Iraq&rsquo;s invasion in late September 1980, the control of the Shatt al-Arab was a major goal for Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s forces. Key to an Iraqi victory was capturing the crucial Iranian port and oil refinery center at Abadan just a few miles east of the city of Khorramshahr. Due to the earlier clashes along the border, that included artillery and air strikes as well as commando raids, much of the Khorramshahr&rsquo;s populace fled earlier, and those that remained were being hastily evacuated by the Iranian government once full-scale war broke out. The Iraqis believed they would find the city abandoned or only lightly defended, and gave orders for their forces deployed further north to strike deep into Iran to secure their objectives and win a quick victory. However, the Ayatollah declared that the forces of the &ldquo;godless Baathists&rdquo; were to be resisted everywhere, and so units of the Iranian Army, including elements of the newly formed Pasdaran and Basiji militia, were rushed to defend Khorramshahr. What ensued was one of the most protracted and bloody city fights since the end of the Second World War.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?<br/><br/>Combat units are mostly battalions or their equivalent sized battle groups. Each day turn of the game represents 4 days of time with each turn&rsquo;s Operations Phase representing two days.  Each hex is approximately 100 meters across.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the contemporary world, mental development and problem-solving abilities are increasingly recognized as crucial skills. Consequently, a newly introduced game named &quot;Viplex&quot; serves to facilitate players in enhancing their cognitive development in an engaging manner. The primary objective of the &quot;Viplex&quot; game is to utilize the available numerical resources to both endeavor to obtain the highest possible numerical value on one's own board and thwart the opponent's pursuit of the same objective.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The game consists of 2 6x6 boards, 28 green, 28 white and 18 yellow pieces with the numbers 1 to 9 and 2 X's. The game is divided into two parts, green and white pieces. Each player has 3 pieces corresponding to their color and 1 yellow piece of each number. White and green pieces can only be played on your own board, while yellow pieces can be played on both the opponent's and your own board. In the two-player game of Viplex, the objective is to achieve the highest possible number by using the numbers in hand, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally from left to right and top to bottom. &quot;X&quot; tiles are considered wildcards in the game and are the most important tiles. &quot;X&quot; tiles are placed on the opponent's board and have the ability to cancel all movements vertically, horizontally, and diagonally from top to bottom and left to right where they are placed, and each player has only one of them. Our game can also be played with a sack. In this case, numbers are randomly selected from the sack. Thus, the bags add a factor of chance to the game and test the players' strategic thinking skills.<br/><br/>",

According to legend, the princess Wencheng was a devout follower of Buddhism. When she married Songtsen Gampo, she brought with her as part of her dowry a precious statue of the Buddha that awaken a demon living in the Red Mountain during the construction of the Potala Palace, he tried to disrupt the work every night by destroying what had been built during the day. To prevent this, King Songtsen Gampo consulted an oracle, which advised that the demon be appeased with the offering of the body of a man or woman. Princess Wencheng, with great courage, volunteered to be sacrificed.<br/><br/>After two hundred years, with the perdition of Tubo Dynasty, the Potala Palace were damaged during wars in 9th century, there were only ruins left, making the demon awaken again. <br/>Until in 17th century when the 5th Dalai Lama came to power, he commanded his Rinpoches (the players) with they monk-workers, to rebuilding the palace immediately and vanish the demon once for all, making the Potala Palace a new home and a spiritual tower for the next generations of the Dalai Lamas.<br/><br/>Potala Palace is a euro-game with deck building and worker/dice placement mechanics, where players take on the roles of Rinpoches who must assist in the reconstruction of the palace using their dice (workers) to acquire new resources and cards to improve their decks, allowing them to build new facilities such as halls, statues, reliquaries, thangkas (a type of Tibetan tapestry), thus accumulating &quot;merit points&quot; (victory points) and achieving enlightenment by completing the &quot;Great Mandala&quot; at the end of the game. The game features a day and night mechanics where players' deck cards can be flipped upside down, completely changing their effects, further expanding the strategic possibilities of the game, but beware of the demon's jealousy, as he may come during the nighttime to destroy something the players have built.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Turret Dice The Defenders is a Cooperative, Dice Placement, Tower Defense Game about defending your planet from a colossal swarm of meteors that threatens to destroy everything. Players must work together to shoot down all incoming targets as even one slipping through will be the end of their world.<br/><br/>Players will roll dice on their turns to determine which actions are available to take. They will then spend their dice to activate turret spaces in their Defense Array to damage and destroy incoming meteors and tower spaces that have a wide range of clever abilities like making other actions better, and mitigating dice rolls. Alternately, dice can be spent on Dashboard Actions to build more turrets and towers into the player's customized Defense Arrays, to upgrade turrets, to draw cards, or play powerful one-time-use event cards.<br/><br/>Meteors are generated by randomized &quot;Spawn Decks&quot; and have special abilities and tricks of their own, as well as pesky Alert Cards to throw players off and distinctively different bosses. These randomized elements will keep the game fresh and different for play after play! Not to mention optional Gameplay Modifiers that can change up the way the game is played or increase the difficulty substantially.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It will become the &quot;market&quot; where each player, starting by the first one, will chose and take a tile (this is compulsory).<br/>Once the player has taken the tile from the market may choose to place it next the starter tile (or any other tile placed before) following the RULE OF PLACEMENT or to keep it in his reserve. There's no limit of tiles one can have in this personal reserve and can be used in any moment but, once the tile is placed in a &quot;legal&quot; position it can't be moved.<br/>Once all players have taken their tile and placed (or not), &quot;first player&quot; moves to the next player who now will keep the pool and replenish the &quot;market&quot;.<br/><br/>Rule of placement:<br/><br/>A tile can be placed only next to another tile while there's no contact with a marked side.<br/><br/>Game ends:<br/><br/>Game ends when there are no more tiles to take from the &quot;pool&quot; or when there's no room for more tiles on player's figures.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>Each tile has a value equal to its marked sides. So, for us, red has value of 1, blue of 2, yellow of 3, green equals 4 and brown is 5.<br/>So each player has to count how many tiles have of every colour and do the maths.<br/>Also we count each marked continuous side and take the value of the lonqest one. If this is a &quot;circular&quot; one, surrounding the figure, its value doubles. In case of ties the figure with less tiles win.<br/><br/>",

The flowers and butterflies are all native to the Philippines.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a family friendly card game for 2-4 players, which takes about 20 minutes to play. Featuring hand painted artwork created by local Filipino artists.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>At the end of the game the player with the most butterflies wins!<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Deal 3 flower cards to each player. Then place the remaining deck of cards to the side and reveal the top three flower cards, placing them in a line as cards that may be drawn.<br/><br/>Place the butterfly circle in the middle of the table and the butterfly deck on it. Reveal the top three butterfly cards and place them around the circle matching to their color.<br/><br/>Left of the dealer goes first.<br/><br/>ON YOUR TURN<br/>Draw a flower card from one of the three revealed or the top of the deck.<br/><br/>Create a &lsquo;garden&rsquo; by laying down 3 of the same color flower cards.<br/><br/>Flower cards come in 7 colors of the rainbow. There are also &lsquo;double-color&rsquo; flower cards which may be one of two colors. And there&rsquo;s also a &lsquo;wild&rsquo; flower card that can be any color.<br/><br/>Collect any revealed wild butterflies that are the same color as your garden by laying them on your garden. <br/>In addition, you may STEAL all butterflies from an opponent&rsquo;s garden IF it is the SAME COLOR and WEAKER. Determine a garden&rsquo;s strength by counting the total number of &lsquo;butterfly symbols&rsquo; on the corners of each flower that match your garden&rsquo;s &lsquo;color&rsquo;. (solid color flower cards are &lsquo;stronger&rsquo; than double-color or wild-color flower cards).<br/><br/>At the end of your turn reveal a new wild butterfly from the top of the deck. A player with a matching color flower garden may immediately collect this butterfly. But they must pay attention because if they miss it before the next person&rsquo;s turn then another player may steal it for their themselves!<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no wild butterflies around the wild butterfly circle. This usually happens when atleast one garden of every color has been made. The game may also end when there are no butterfly cards in the deck.<br/><br/>There are also 7 &lsquo;sparkly butterflies&rsquo; which have a special ability that activates when they are collected by a player. See the reference cards for these. Example: &ldquo;draw 2 flower cards&rdquo;, or &ldquo;reveal a flower card and steal this color butterfly&rdquo;.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The Cruel Frost expansion introduces challenging new scenarios, hair-raising new enemies, and unique new heroes.<br/><br/>The story centers around a malevolent Spider Queen who&rsquo;s seized control of forbidden ice magic, and now threatens to plunge Euthia into frozen darkness. Take on the challenges as one of the existing heroes, or become one of the new heroes introduced in Cruel Frost, each with their own branching path.<br/><br/>As well as new replayable scenarios, Cruel Frost introduces icy new mechanics to your base game. Playable with almost any scenario, the Ice Claws module brings raging ice storms to Euthia, transforming your modular map with new frozen tiles and paving the way to fresh challenges and new opportunities.<br/><br/>Moving through ice storms will cause frostbite, but will also grant access to powerful ice magic, changing the way you play. Out in the snow, you&rsquo;ll encounter the new Ice Entity, offering tantalizing rewards to the brave.<br/><br/>Luckily, with the Ice Claws module comes the arrival of the Ice Clans. These guardians of ancient wisdom will share their knowledge with your heroes to help them withstand the cold, revealing new ways to gear up, heal, and learn new abilities.<br/><br/>Speaking of gearing up, Cruel Frost introduces an entire new stock of items for traders, adding even more depth to equipment upgrades. Not only are there more levels and options (thanks to new items and four new gem types), but some armor can also now be upgraded with elemental essences, introducing powerful new effects in the advanced stages of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aqua Tofana is a strategic 18-card game set in 17th-century Italy, themed around the famous poison that gives the game its name. In the game, players simulate a tense dinner between a married couple, with each player taking the role of either poison or antidote. The goal is to have the most cards of their role visible in the playing area by the end of the game. The game's premise revolves around Giulia Tofana, a famed cosmetologist who secretly elaborated and sold lethal poison to abused wives seeking a way out of violent marriages. The game's setting and design evoke a sense of historical tension and social commentary on gender violence and the resilience of women in patriarchal societies.<br/><br/>The game is played with 18 cards, each with poison on one side and antidote on the other. Players then take turns placing cards orthogonally adjacent to existing cards, applying the flipping effect represented on the card played. These effects can cause cards in the playing area to flip, changing the visible role and impacting the game's outcome. The gameplay symbolizes a confrontation between doses of poison and antidote.<br/><br/>Through its historical theme and social commentary, Aqua Tofana brings attention to the enduring fight against gender violence, promoting solidarity and resilience among women. The game&rsquo;s design and artwork, alongside the unique gameplay mechanics, offer a thoughtful and engaging experience for players while underscoring an important message about equality and justice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is designed for 2 to 5 players and 90-minute games.<br/><br/>At the begining of each turn, opportunities appear in the city, represented by cards. These cards enable you to form alliances with important groups, bribe powerful peoples, exploit recent scientific discoveries or make your presence felt at important events.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to perform maneuvers to win these opportunities, or to earn Influence markers in the city's districts.<br/><br/>The basic maneuver consists of sending a team of agents onto the game board. Henchmen, guards, emissaries&hellip; Players secretly place their pawns on the board. At the end of the turn, the player who has the greatest number of Emissaries in a sector can take an opportunity card or an Influence marker first.<br/><br/>The second maneuver is to spy. The player can look at two face-down game elements: opponent's pawn or hidden opportunity card<br/><br/>The third maneuver consists of carrying out an assassination.<br/>The player designates an opposing pawn and turns it over. If it is an Emissary, the assassination succeeds and the player gains 3 power points. If it is a guard, the assassin is captured and it is the assassin who must pay his opponent.<br/><br/>Power points are used in particular to unlock the special abilities of the factions, which are very asymmetrical.<br/><br/>The Others constitute an autonomous faction, opposed to all players. These monsters from the NOC universe are trying to invade the city and, if players cannot put their conflicts aside to unite against this force of evil when the need arises, they all risk losing the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Basalt is a dynamic connection game set on the side of an exploding volcano. It is played on the hexagonal tiles of a triangular shaped grid of side length 9, using Black and Red checkers. Before the game, the three corners of the board are filled with a checker (two Black, one Red). Red moves first.<br/><br/>Players control a stack if the top checker in the stack is of their designated color. On each turn, players take N checkers (where N is any number from 1 to stack size) from the top of a stack you control and move them N spaces in straight lines to a destination containing N or less checkers. Then, a new checker of that color is added to the destination. Stacks may not jump over enemies, but may land on enemy or friendly stacks, thereby burying them. If you have no legal moves, you must pass. You win if you have connected all three edges by a connected group of stacks you control (corners count for both edges).<br/><br/>NOTE: This game may optionally be played using a pie rule, in which the Host places 1 or 2 checkers of each color anywhere on the board (in any configuration), and the Guest chooses whether to play first as Red, or second as Black.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Friends turned rivals face off in intense battles, rolling and scoring dice. Defenders navigate the treacherous effects of the 7 Deadly Sins and epic mythical clashes, while attackers aim to sabotage their opponents&rsquo; high scores. Experience the rush of dice-driven excitement&mdash;get ready to roll!<br/><br/>Unveil your darker side and get ready to battle your nemeses in Vices and Vengeance&mdash;a simple, yet thrilling dice game where heavenly virtues are nowhere in sight. In this perilous world, the Seven Deadly Sins reign, and your goal is to outmaneuver and out-roll your opponents while keeping your score as low as possible. Silver Bullets and Mirrors may be your key to success, but be careful, though; reaching 70 points, often the number of forgiveness, could spell your doom!<br/><br/>The Seven Sins have Colors! You will play with:<br/><br/>     7 larger 6-sided Sin dice (16mm): Lust (Blue), Gluttony<br/><br/><br/>(Orange), Greed (Gold), Sloth (Light Blue), Wrath<br/>(Red), Envy (Green), &amp; Pride (Purple).<br/><br/>     7 smaller 6-sided Sin Dice (14mm).<br/>     1 special 6-sided Pride Die: Purple metal.<br/>     7 &quot;Nemesis&rdquo; dice: 20-sided &amp; sin-colored.<br/>     6 Mythical Match-up 6-sided dice pairs: Mirror &amp; Medusa, David &amp; Goliath (Maroon - 25mm &amp; 12mm), the Silver Bullet &amp; Werewolf.<br/>     3 Spoiler dice: 12-sided (black), 10-sided (gray), &amp; 8-sided dice (white).<br/>     2 rolling trays with a removable foam insert.<br/>     7 sin-colored &quot;tracker&quot; tokens.<br/><br/><br/>THE GAME<br/>Assign the Sins<br/><br/>     Determine the first player by the highest roll on any 20-sided die (d20). Play goes clockwise.<br/>     The first player rolls the &quot;Mirror&quot; die along with the 7 (16mm) sin dice. That player chooses from any sins matching the mirror die. If none match, roll again. The next rolls 6 sins, etc. until all players have a sin.<br/>     Each player receives their 16mm sin die, the matching d20 (Nemesis die), and sin token.<br/>     A player with Pride also gets the metal purple &quot;Pride&quot; die.<br/><br/><br/>Everybody Rolls!<br/><br/>     The player whose turn it is is called the Defending Player (DP). The DP rolls all 7 of the 14mm sin dice, the Mythical Match-up dice, the 12, 10, 8-sided dice, and their d20 Nemesis die to start a turn (* See the example below).<br/>     The DP does not roll their 16mm Sin die on their turn.<br/>     All other players (Attacking players-APs) roll their 16mm Sin die and their d20 Nemesis die every roll. APs are trying to match the DP's 14 mm sin die of the same color as well as trying to match any Nemesis dice the DP rolls. Upon a match, the DP faces an Effect roll detailed below.<br/>     At least one die must be removed/scored each roll. The DP repeats rolls until the end of their turn. Their turn ends after all dice have been scored/removed.<br/><br/><br/>&dagger; APs only need to roll dice they can still match to DP's!<br/><br/>Die Removal &amp; Scoring<br/><br/>     The DP must remove and score at least one die each roll.<br/>     When they have removed all the dice they want to score on a roll, they roll unscored dice again, and the APs roll their dice, too.<br/>     Mythical Match-up pairs must be scored in pairs. (See below)<br/>     A Matching Nemesis die from any AP must be taken by the DP and rolled next roll. It cannot be scored the turn it matches. The DP may still remove any nemesis die/dice that they rolled. For example, if an AP rolls any 19, and the DP rolls 19, the DP can only remove the 19 that they rolled.<br/><br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>     The DP wants to score the lowest total in each turn. The way to score low is to roll Max Rolls on dice or match specific dice.<br/>     Max Roll: Any die that rolls its maximum number can score 0.<br/>     Non-Max Roll: Points add up by 1 for each pip less than the max roll. For Example, an 8 on a 12-sided die scores 4.<br/>     Mythical Match-up: If a Mythical Match-up pair matches (e.g., Medusa and Mirror), they both score 0 points! If the bullet lands upright, it is wild and matches any number on the Werewolf die.<br/>     DP's Matching Nemeses or Sins: Any DP rolled Nemesis d20s that match, or any matching penalty Sin dice score 0 points.<br/><br/><br/>",

Ideal for family and travel!<br/><br/>The gameplay is deceptively simple: Players race to collect four matching Anger cards and four matching Zen cards. However, the real excitement comes from the strategic use of Bloodboilers (events that make your blood boil) and Disruptors (sneaky cards that can hinder your opponents). Players must carefully decide whether to focus on building their own sets, sabotaging others, or forming temporary alliances to obstruct the leader.<br/><br/>The game is fast-paced, with each round offering players the choice to draw a new card, take a matching card from the centre pile, or play a BloodBoiler or Disruptor card. The tension ratchets up as players get closer to completing their sets, and a single well-timed move can often determine the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Whether as the cult of the Demonologist, Warlock, Necromancer, or Doomsayer, players must adeptly recruit villagers or harvest their blood to empower their sinister rituals. <br/>Through a fusion of Area Majority, Worker placement and Resource gathering, they vie with one another, navigating the perilous path of corruption, enhancing their Rituals, and staining various parts of the village to seize territories and augment their Taint (Victory Points). With each round introducing fresh challenges and opportunities, players must judiciously balance their strategies to outmaneuver their adversaries and emerge as the foremost cult as the fifth round draws to a close.<br/>Game Overview: <br/>Each player delves into their spellbook, serving as their player board, to oversee their Cultists, amass Resources, and upgrade their Rituals. The main board grants access to the five pivotal locations where the four cults will contend for control, eventually corrupting them. <br/>At the outset of each round, during the Upkeep phase, these locations undergo random variations in the number of available Peasants, the resources they yield and more... <br/>In the Placement phase, all cults place their workers (Cultist Miniatures) in these locations, determining the actions their cult can execute in each one. The majority in each location dictates not only special actions but also the initiative in which these actions will unfold. <br/>Subsequently, in the Resolve phase, each cult assigns their cultists to diverse actions, from resource gathering for Ritual upgrades to hanging peasants at the Tree of the Damned to bolster their Dark Favor. Crucially, each cultist can be designated to various Rituals in the player Spellbook, with distinct effects such as Proselytizing other Peasants to expand your cult or Sacrificing peasants to procure their blood. Several additional Rituals are available, but the paramount one is Corrupting the land, which, when enhanced, may summon your Cult's Monstrosity! <br/>In the final phase, players Defile the land and bid their accumulated Blood to dominate the most corrupted location. The number of Sigils placed by each player significantly influences the ultimate outcome. As the fifth round concludes, the locations you corrupted, along with other factors such as your cult's size, upgraded Rituals, secret quest, concealed Taint and more, will determine the prevailing cult.<br/><br/>",

The game includes 2 toast tiles, negative chips, and cards showing male and female students from three different schools. Matching cards have the same color background as well as similar uniforms. There are also four Whoopsy! cards that do not have a match but act as a game timer.<br/><br/>All cards are dealt into draw piles for each player, and players take turns flipping cards onto their personal discard piles. When two different player's face-up cards show a matching boy and girl whose pictures are facing toward each other, those two players crash into one another. As long as the cards are facing the right direction, players will crash even if the cards are upside down or other players are between them. Crashing players must make a pre-determined exclamation (&quot;Watch out!&quot; &quot;Ouch!&quot;). Players not directly involved in the crash must try to be the first to &quot;catch&quot; (touch) the toast tile. In larger games, both toast tiles are used. If the crashing players fail to speak up before the toast is caught, or if uninvolved player fail to be the first to touch the toast, they must take a negative chip.<br/><br/>When a Whoopsy card is flipped over, all players must try to touch the toast first, or else they receive a negative chip. The Whoopsy card is set aside, and players put their discard piles at the bottom of their decks continue. When the fourth Whoopsy card is flipped, the game ends.<br/><br/>The publisher compares Hurry Girl (ハリーガール) to Halli Galli, and the name even appears to be a reference to that game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Panzer Strike: Western Front is not a historical wargame but an engaging dynamic simulation of tank combat.<br/><br/>This is a first game in the series of Panzer Strike games which is centered around a theme of tank battles on the Western Front. This is not a depiction of any particular battle, but a simulation of possible tactical conflicts between the Allied and German forces during the 1944-45 period, in an urban environment.<br/><br/>Dice are a part of this game but strategy and positioning can always mitigate unlucky rolls. Still, even the most heavily armoured tank on the battlefield can be incapacitated by a lucky shot, but you should never rely on it. The outcome of each encounter depends predominantly on the tactical decisions taken.<br/><br/>The movement of the piece consists of a series of individual steps (forward movements to the adjacent square or a rotation in place by 45&deg;) which resembles the movement of tracked vehicles in real life. In the Simplified rules, the destruction upon the action of shooting depends on the Firepower of the shooting tank (determined by red dice rolls), Armour value of the target vehicle (different values for each side of every tank type) and the Distance between the tanks (determined by a special ruler): the tank is destroyed if the Firepower is greater than the sum of the Armour and Distance values. In the Core Rules, the movement of the pieces is identical, but the difference is that in addition to Firepower, Armour, and Distance factors, there is a fourth one: Accuracy. Its introduction, along with some other elements, makes the game even more dynamic and realistic.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Veil Between Cursed Lands is a fantasy themed tactical game in the magical world of Croya. Players will take on the role of a warden with their own special skill and item set. In the process, you will enhance your character and gears with experience and loot. Choose one of the wardens that suit you best and determine the fate of this battle for existence.<br/><br/>This game has several difficulty levels. Each level is played out through rounds of combat against automated enemies or a player that is controlling enemies. In each round, players will have action points that determine the order in which they move and what abilities they perform. At the end of the game, we will fight one of the demon lords. If we can beat it, we will win the game.<br/><br/>To break up the monotony of &quot;move and attack,&quot; we created the Combo system. We will spend the combo points to use class abilities. Combo points will be granted to players based on the success level of their weapon attack. This level of success will be determined by the results of the dice roll.<br/><br/>",

The goal of Operation Barbarossa was to decisively defeat the Soviet Union in a short lightning campaign before the onset of winter.<br/><br/>During the early stages of the campaign, the Wehrmacht caught the Red Army completely unprepared and had advanced its armored spearheads across the Dnepr in only a few short weeks. By mid-October, the Axis invasion appeared unstoppable and on the verge of ultimate success.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the Axis, the time for a decisive victory had run out with the arrival of Russia&rsquo;s notorious muddy season and the worst winter in a century. Despite suffering catastrophic losses over four months, the Soviet military was finally able to regroup and halt the invaders at the gates of Moscow. The Axis would never come so close to victory again and the initiative would slowly fall from its grasp.<br/><br/>As the Axis, can you do better and seize Moscow before the snow falls?<br/><br/>",

Dig, drill, &amp; blast your way while casting spells to slow your opponents down!<br/><br/>In Wizard Miners, each player has a Mine Deck of cards that represents the cave they are mining. The object is to clear all of the cards from your deck before any other player does. As you mine, you will find gems in the rock. With these gems, you can buy more and better tools with which to mine and dynamite to cave in your opponents&rsquo; caves. But what&rsquo;s the point of having a wizard in charge if you aren&rsquo;t casting spells? Each turn, each player can cast spells to make their tools mine better, break other players&rsquo; tools, blast rock from your mine, or cave in your opponents&rsquo; mines.<br/><br/>Mining is important each turn as each tool gives you a better chance to mine cards out of your deck. But, be careful! You also have to take time to clean up the rubble or those cards (minus their gems!) could cave back in on you and make you clear them again!<br/><br/>Wizard Miners is a fast paced, light hearted, simultaneous-play game with both strategy and luck involved.  It will keep seasoned gamers interested in the choices they make and novices excited as the luck of the roll can always change fortunes!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

A strategic card game that both kids and adults can enjoy.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a race to collect all 5 pets, but every round presents you with some intriguing real-life questions: Should I save or spend my money? What&rsquo;s the value of waiting? But don&rsquo;t be intimidated! It all boils down into a simple choice of 3 card types: coins, pets, and time.<br/><br/>Each round opens with card drafting. Then each player takes turns playing their cards in an open-hand fashion. The cards represent 3 categories of resources. Coins increase your ability to buy. Time improves your bid to go first next round. Pets are collected to reserve the right to buy them. But when to buy them and at what price makes all the difference.<br/><br/>This game incorporates various classic board game mechanics in a simple format that makes it accessible to players of all ages. The themes are intuitive and universal. Open-hand play gives adults the option to guide children. And the ability to read is not a pre-requisite to playing this game at its fullest. You'd be surprised at how strategic a 5-year-old can be!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The purpose of the game is to mine more Substract (which is a highly valuable liquid with living sub-molecular creatures) than any other player.<br/><br/>Each round, players use bidding drones to bid on Aliens (called Hewns); technologies; scouting advantages; and the Turn order. The alien Hewns all have different skill levels and abilities. However, Bidding costs valuable Substract!<br/><br/>When a player has his/ her turn they can enter their Hewns through common entrances onto the board which is made up of Nodes and ravines. The spaces of ravines and nodes can be either big, medium, or small and these spaces sizes will restrict certain Hewns from entering. But beware! Hewns usually don't survive! They can become damaged, stunned, killed, or even stolen by other players, or even killed by the planet itself!<br/><br/>When Hewns reach the mines on the board they can choose to mine aggressively or normally. The more aggressive the mining the worse the planet will react to the Hewns and also the faster the game will play out.<br/><br/>Players can also attack other Hewns owned by other players but the Substract they have collected will be used up as ammunition for the long-range and/or powerful shooting. Even crazier Hewns and technologies let you take over other players Hewns: but watch out, they might die in the attempt!<br/><br/>",

If Ichabod runs out of hit points, they are converted to a Headless Horseman. If a horseman runs out of hit points, they are sent back to one of the graveyards and can continue the chase.

Using grid-based movement over two different realms, Schism utilises an action-point system giving players access to a range of moves, options and abilities each turn, but decisions must be made carefully as some actions will cost you your life force and energy; lose too much and you may find yourself banished to one world or the next, edging you ever closer to the end of your existence. So, which path will you follow?<br/><br/>Action in Schism is spread over two separate board sections, one representing 'Life' - the world as we know it; and the other representing 'The Other Side' - the celestial world where the souls of the dead roam free. Players may travel freely between these worlds, or play an entire game in one of them, exploiting the resources available there and playing event/item cards to shape the way the game progresses.<br/><br/>Be the first player to collect 10 Souls/believers or be the last player standing to be declared the winner.<br/><br/>FROM THE BOX:<br/><br/>There is a war that&rsquo;s raging, a war between celestial beings living among us on earth. No one can be sure whether there&rsquo;s a heaven or a hell, but we can be sure that there&rsquo;s a divide - a divide that will separate us all. Some of them care for us, watch over us and protect us, while others corrupt, kill and manipulate. We assume they have always been here, but now they are making it known. The world as we know it has been changed forever. &lsquo;Angels&rsquo; are revealing themselves, gathering followers and building an army of believers to defend against the threats that emerge from the darkness. &lsquo;Daemons&rsquo; are stealing souls, building rank after rank of damned warriors, preparing to ravage and consume one realm or the next. These beings have begun tearing each other limb from limb, wielding weapons of fire &amp; light, spreading their wings and exerting otherworldly powers. So, which way will you turn? Influence believers? Claim souls? Slaughter your opponents? Regain your humanity? You decide.<br/><br/>",

Play to win numbered notes called Quantum Marks, that have codes used to generate power. Longer sequences create more power. The object is to create the most power by building the longest sequence. Your ultimate goal is to create the maximum power sequence, a Quay (pronounced key) made from all 118Q. <br/> To begin play Deal 5Q to each player. The first player who can make a start sequence leads the play. The start sequence is a series of 2 or more Q created from Q received in the deal, or by using Q from draw deck. The longest or highest sequence wins the chance to lead. Players play their Q on table in clockwise order. The Leader calls the play by choosing a game (Dots, Age, Number or Name) and if high or low values win. At the start of your turn you draw 1Q, look for interception sequences, and use special forces to change the play in your favor. After playing your Q you draw again so that you end the round with 5Q.

        "description": "&quot;Runeslingers: The Awakening&quot; is a strategic customizable card game that ingeniously melds board game and dueling card game elements into a wholly unique strategy gaming experience. It promises to challenge even the most seasoned gaming veterans with its myriad strategic win conditions, card combinations, and decision trees that confront players each turn.<br/><br/>Take on the role of a Runeslinger, a wielder of magical incantations known as runespells. Much of the game's art features runestones, ancient stone artifacts that empower your Runeslinger with runespells. Each runespell possesses a class affinity that provides guidance on its thematic origins and strategic pairings but does not limit card pairings in deck construction.<br/><br/>The game's objective is straightforward: diminish the enemy Runeslinger's power from five to zero. Achieve this by dealing damage, applying ailments, or discarding the enemy's cards to weaken their power. Reduce the enemy Runeslinger's maximum health to zero, or deplete their entire deck and discard pile to secure instant victory! With five distinct win conditions coupled with a unique ailment system, &quot;Runeslingers&quot; stands as an exceptionally complex yet rewarding strategy game that introduces significant mechanical advancements to the genre.<br/><br/>Customize your Runeslinger with a unique stance and ability to further develop specific strategies, limited only by your creativity. Select from a pool of over 180 unique cards in the Alpha set, and assemble a 40-card deck with no class or color restrictions. Employ six unique ailments that dynamically alter gameplay on a moment's notice. Master the art of shouting, Runeslinger's distinctive take-that mechanic that enables you to disrupt enemy actions, even when it's not your turn!<br/><br/>If you seek a challenging and genuinely strategic game, your search ends with &quot;Runeslingers!&quot;<br/><br/>",

A Game of Corruption takes you back in time to Lebanon&rsquo;s golden years and gives you a chance to fix what went wrong and change the course of history.<br/><br/>Each player is randomly and secretly assigned a role, either Reformist or Corrupt Elite, and then works on campaigning in the different districts to amass the most seats in the parliament.  On your turn, you can either swap districts with other players, draw or replace a new secret objective, or spread influence by campaigning in swing districts or by battling against other players to take their districts. The game moves into the second phase of electing a president once 5 rounds are played or 6 objectives are completed. Would the corrupt succeed in sowing confusion and distrust and bluff their way to power? Or would the reformists be able to see through their game and vote them out?<br/><br/>The game of corruption is tricky and treacherous. Do you have what it takes to get to the presidential chair?<br/><br/>Mentioned in:<br/><br/>The Guardian:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/10/power-play-the-lebanese-board-game-with-a-political-point-to-make-machrou3-ra2is\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/10/p...</a><br/><br/>SRF Television Channel:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.srf.ch/news/international/mit-spielkarten-an-die-macht-brettspiel-der-anderen-art-das-spiel-um-die-macht-im-libanon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.srf.ch/news/international/mit-spielkarten-an-die...</a><br/><br/>Wired Middle East:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://wired.me/culture/play-a-game-of-corruption-your-in-lebanon/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://wired.me/culture/play-a-game-of-corruption-your-in-l...</a><br/><br/>Al Nahhar Lebanon:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://l8.nu/rt8m\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://l8.nu/rt8m</a><br/><br/>Mille World UAE:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.milleworld.com/machrou3-ra2is-the-new-lebanese-board-game-that-will-literally-corrupt-you/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.milleworld.com/machrou3-ra2is-the-new-lebanese-b...</a><br/><br/>Info 3:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://info3.com?news=102463&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://info3.com?news=102463&amp</a>;text=short&amp;lang=1<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://info3.com/?news=102463&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://info3.com/?news=102463&amp</a>;text=short&amp;lang=2<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://info3.com?news=102473&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://info3.com?news=102473&amp</a>;text=short&amp;lang=5<br/><br/>G&ouml;teborgs-Posten (SWE):<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.gp.se/nyheter/v%C3%A4rlden/de-spelar-om-libanons-framtid-1.105402900\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.gp.se/nyheter/v%C3%A4rlden/de-spelar-om-libanons...</a><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Zombie Fight or Flight is a collaborative card game, where players work together or die trying.<br/><br/>Each player in turn chooses a card from their hand, which represents what the entire group does for a day.  If the group goes 7 days without playing provisions or cannot recover from zombie encounters the entire group dies.  The goal is to survive long enough (at least 3 weeks) and then get clear from the zombies so the group can be rescued.<br/><br/>The rules to this game are accessible for inexperienced gamers and is suitable for intergenerational play.<br/><br/>",

The time has come for Don Quijote, Sancho Panza, Carmen, Don Juan, Celestina, Segismundo, Fortunata y Jacinta and many more! And also for Alfonso X, Maim&oacute;nides, Wallada, B&eacute;cquer, Teresa de Jes&uacute;s&hellip;!<br/><br/>In this new &Ntilde; game (the fourth in the series), the players have to combine cards correctly with the aim of acquiring more points than their opponents before everybody has played their hand. There are five types of cards: 1) &lsquo;Character cards&rsquo;, 2) Object cards, 3), Scenario cards, 4) League cards, and 5) Action cards.<br/>As is the case with Mahjong, there are special card combinations that add up points (&lsquo;Character&rsquo; + &lsquo;Object&rsquo;; &lsquo;Scenario&rsquo; + &lsquo;Character&rsquo;; or according to &lsquo;Work&rsquo; or &lsquo;Author&rsquo;). There are also card combinations like &lsquo;Heroines&rsquo;, (Benina, Teresa or Esperanza), or &lsquo;Villains of Literature&rsquo; (Do&ntilde;a Perfecta, Bernarda Alba). The value of each card is determined according to the &lsquo;&Ntilde; value&rsquo;, (main value), &lsquo;Wisdom value&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Strength value&rsquo;. Unless an &lsquo;Action card&rsquo; specifies otherwise, the &lsquo;&Ntilde;&rsquo; value is the one that should be used to score points.<br/><br/>During the game, players have to take turns choosing cards that allow them to score or undermine their opponents. The cards can be found in four different states of play: 1) in the players&rsquo; hands (each player receives a set number of cards at the start of the game), 2) on the table (visible to all players), 3) in the scoring area of each player, or 4) out of the game (used cards). Cards in the hand or on the table can be used to score points, while cards in the scoring area of the players or among used cards are irrevocable, meaning that they can not be placed in another area.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The artifact is part of a set, and until recently you had no information regarding the location of the other piece.  One of your contacts has just informed you that the other piece is in the hands of a rival &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; thief in the area.  Your contact also told you this other thief is going to attempt to complete his own set by acquiring your artifact.<br/><br/>In order to win, you must steal your opponent's artifact and make sure they cannot steal it back.  You will be able to purchase and install security systems to safeguard your own artifact.  You will train up your skills at bypassing the different types of security systems.  To fund your endeavors, you will take on smaller heists.<br/><br/>The most unique aspect of the game is that you may only take your turn while your opponent is not around.  This means a single game can take days or even weeks to finish, but each turn only takes a few minutes.  The game can be stored in the box between turns.<br/><br/>Dice rolling is the primary mechanic for bypassing security systems and accomplishing heists.  Each security system has a minimum roll to bypass, and you will roll two dice (D6).  Training and some cards you can get during heists can increase your roll.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As we journey through the world of City of Winter, we will encounter varied traditions of the City represented by decks of Tradition Cards. As our characters change and grow the traditions they hold as a family change as well.<br/><br/>City of Winter takes place in a world of fantasy where things are possible that are not possible in our day to day lives. Use this space to imagine and discover without the restrictions we find in our day to day lives.&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Hunting bounties through time, Chrono-Ranger knows just how dangerous his prey can be, and what the ramifications of failing might mean. K.N.Y.F.E. is always ready for a fight, but with the level of threats arrayed against the Multiverse, could she have bitten off more than she can chew? And a psychic warrior from a war-torn future has found her way to our reality, where The Visionary hopes to save this reality's version of herself before it's too late! These heroes and more join the fight to save the Multiverse, but desperate times call for disparate measures, including teaming up with unexpected allies...<br/><br/>Besides adding these capable heroes to the roster, Sentinels of the Multiverse: Disparation includes nine dangerous villains, five ever-changing environments, and more variants, events, critical events, and even new options for different ways for you to play your heroes to their principles.<br/><br/>",

You and your fellow members of the 13th Street Crew occupy the lowest rung of the Old Don&rsquo;s organization, but the city is full of opportunities to prove yourself worthy of rising in the ranks.  Most of you are loyal crew members eager to prove your worth as good earners.  One of you&hellip; may have decided to instead work against the organization as a police informant! <br/><br/>The 13th Street Crew is a semi-cooperative social deduction game of criminal strategy.  At the beginning of the game, players are secretly given a hidden identity as either a loyal crew member or an informant.  While it is highly likely that one of the crew is an informant, it is also possible that there is no informant.  Whether or not one of the players is secretly working with the police, however, each player has to carefully choose which other players to work with in order to win because no one can be truly trusted.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, players will negotiate with their fellow crew members to be brought with on various jobs.  From introducing local politicians to the family, to doing favors for the Old Don himself, each job will require different resources to complete, but will reward you with cash, permanent assets, or even powerful one-time use abilities.<br/><br/>The police are vigilant, however, and with every job comes the risk of provoking the law!  Each crew member on a job secretly plays a card giving the all clear or calling in the cops, and the police also make their own move and play a card from the Police Deck.  If the police show, all resources are lost and no rewards are given.  Was it just bad luck, were you set up to fail so that one of your fellow crew members could rise, or is there an informant in your midst?<br/><br/>Loyal crew members that make enough money for the organization gain the Old Don&rsquo;s favor and can win the game either on their own or jointly.  If the police manage to break up five jobs before then though, the whole crew will be doing hard time!  If one of the players is the informant, that player can win by helping the police break up five jobs or by making enough money on their own and claiming victory for themselves!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each Executive then enters a two-minute negotiation with every Board Member, offering Paperclips in exchange for information and support with the hope of closing Deals with Shareholders during the Board Meeting at the end of the game. Shareholders must decide which Executive to side with and close the most lucrative Deal, while Infiltrators disrupt negotiations with their own goals.<br/><br/>While negotiations are occurring, the other players are free to network, strategizing and scheming with each other.

        "description": "Crystal Chaos is a simple yet deceptively strategic card game for the whole family. It is a fast and friendly game for ages 10+ and designed for 3-6 players. Easy to play but challenging to master, this highly re-playable game will have you smirking, shouting, and laughing out loud. Crystal Chaos should take less than a minute to learn the rules as they're all printed on a single card. Once players get the feel of it, expect the game to last 10-20 minutes.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a hand of five cards, with the goal of ending a turn with only the Treasure card in their hand. On your turn, you will draw a card from the draw deck to your hand, then play a card to use its power. Cards will allow you to swap hands between players, discard additional cards, make players draw cards, peek at other players' hands, and more. Slowly gain information about where the Treasure card is (whether its in the deck or another player's hand) and manipulate the field to make it yours! The game ends either when one player has the Treasure card as their only card at the end of any player's turn, making them the winner, or when the draw deck is emptied, the player who has the Treasure card at the end of the turn wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>The legend of the Crystal Cavern goes back centuries to a king who hid all his valuables in a cave behind a mystical barrier. The cave walls almost felt alive as they bloomed with vividly colored crystals and pulsed with a soothing glow. Once filled, the cavern entrance blurred out of existence, not to be seen again for centuries, if ever.<br/><br/>Ever since, adventurers have been searching for the long-lost Cavern. It is said that the Cavern itself will sprout crystals up throughout the landscape to tease adventurers, leaving tiny shimmering breadcrumbs. Some say the Cavern only uses these to lead adventurers astray while others claim they are meant to lead the chosen to its bountiful treasure. Which will happen to you? Will you succumb to the Chaos magic and wander endlessly? Will you outsmart the Cavern with wit and strategy? Will you be deemed worthy and wander effortlessly into the Crystal Cavern?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

This large gap allowed Dumenko&rsquo;s three cavalry brigades and a few armor cars to advance unopposed by any White forces. It was only 40 miles from Tsaritsyn. The steppe was perfect for such an advance, flat as hell, providing no cover but fast transit for the cavalry. While White forces did occupy some of Tsaritsyn, there were none in the White rear areas. The closest forces were the 2nd Kuban Cavalry Corps (6000 men) but over a day away. The British B Flight of the 47th RAF led by Lt.

Two players are at least needed but plenty more one each side can join the game. The more units the longer the game takes but it scales really well in terms of gameplay and keeping the overview.<br/>The game is played on hex-field maps. It is turn-based and consists of an initiative phase, movement and fire phase. Damage is taken and casualities will be removed at the end phase simultaneously from the board.<br/>The faster a plane moves - the wider the turn it makes. There are also numerous maneuvers available.<br/>Players will be able to turn the tide of battle with their skill and dice rolls.<br/>Air Raid 36/46 focuses on having fun and excitement at the table. Despite the light-weight and fluent gameplay all statistics of the planes have been researched with care from historical facts.<br/><br/>There is no administrative burden with tracking damage, ammo etc. on a record sheet. Everything you need to remember will be attached with a chip to the base of the aircraft model.<br/>Only one statistic card per type of aircraft model is needed at the table.<br/>The aircraft models themselves come at a very high quality and are made of metal. Scale is 1/200 which avoids flimsy parts breaking off and keeps the models at an acceptable size.<br/><br/>Beside the rules, maps, counters and stat cards the base box contains models from the pacific theatre. These are three P40, three Zeros and 4 Japanese light bombers.<br/>The scenarios that come with the rulebook offer situations and objectives as a change to head-on dockfights.<br/><br/>There is also more than 40 miniatures released from different theatres and nations like English, German, French, Spanish etc. <br/>The timeline starts at 1936 from the Spanish civil war and will be covered to a fictional ongoing war past 1945 and later theatres. Blisters with multiple fighters are already released as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Short Description:<br/><br/>The King is dead, and you and your friends try to claim the empty throne. You will be fighting for the crown through various rounds. The goal is to score the highest points by the end of the round and claim the coveted crown.<br/><br/>On each round, you have a different goal. For example, on a Missions round everyone&rsquo;s given 5 missions to choose from, and you gain points if you manage to do your mission or lose coins otherwise! In the Alliances round, you form alliances of two and cooperate in order for both of you to do your bids correctly. In the Secret Battle round, nobody knows your bids, but you don't know theirs either. There are 16 unique Round Types to choose from.<br/>At the end of each round the player with the highest score claims the metal crown symbolising their temporary dominance!<br/><br/>Add more excitement and fun to your game with Special Ability cards. If you play the Witch you can steal coins from your opponents. The Alchemist can help you change the trump suit during the gameplay. The Bishop allows you see one of your opponent's hand. There are 16 of them each to choose from.<br/><br/>The player with the most points in the last round is crowned the ultimate sovereign of the lands.<br/><br/>Standard Battle (The Base Game):<br/><br/>Rounds:<br/>In each round, the number of cards dealt to each player changes. <br/>The first round begins with one card per player, the second round has two cards per player, and so on, until the final round where each player receives a number of cards equal to the round number.<br/><br/>To prepare for the game, you need to choose the cards you want to use in the deck. The number of cards you need for the game will vary based on the number of players involved.<br/>You can experience unique gameplay by only changing the Special Cards or altering the rounds structure.<br/><br/>Set up:<br/>To begin, randomly pick a dealer for the first round. On each subsequent round, the dealer should change in a clockwise direction. The dealer will always have the Round Tracker specifying the number of cards dealt in that round.<br/>The dealer shuffles the deck and deals a hand of cards to each player. In each round, the number of cards dealt is different.<br/><br/>Trump suit:<br/>On each round, the dealer spins the spinner (or the dice) and reveals one card. This card determines the Trump suit/color for the current round. If the card revealed is an X, no Trump suit will be used for that round. If the card revealed is the Dragon, the dealer chooses which suit/color will serve as the Trump suit for that round.<br/><br/>Round:<br/>Each player declares how many tricks they think they can win in the current round. Bidding starts with the player on the left of the dealer and continues in a clockwise direction. The bid can also be 2 consecutive bids (double-bid). Ensure that every player gets the corresponding bidding token reflecting their bid amount.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick of the round by playing a card from their hand. The other players then have to play a card of the same suit/color, if possible. If they don't have any cards of the same suit, they can play a card from another suit. If a trump suit card is played, it's stronger than the leading suit, otherwise, all other suits are weaker.<br/>The Player who won the trick leads the suit/color of the next round.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>After all the tricks have been played, the players count up the number of tricks they have won and compare it to their bid. Points are awarded for each trick won and players who do not meet their bid lose points.<br/>At the end of each round, the player with the highest score gets the crown to indicate the current leader. In case of a tie between players, place the crown at the center between them.<br/>The player with the highest score at the end of the final round will be crowned the winner!<br/><br/>Expansion Round Types:<br/><br/>Standard Battle<br/>As generals you have all agreed to reveal your strategies openly.<br/>Place your bids face-up for all to see.<br/><br/>Secret Battle<br/>Trust is gone in the realm and your strategies remain hidden.<br/>Place your bids face-down to keep them secret.<br/><br/>Extended Battle<br/>Battles intensify and you have to lead your troops into an extended clash.<br/>Play a second card to extend the trick.<br/><br/>Stealth Battle<br/>Ambushes are happening all around the battlefield. The one who initiates the attack, is the one getting ambushed.<br/>Play your card face-down except for the trick leader.<br/><br/>Leaked Plans<br/>A spy leaks your battle plans, forcing quick adjustments.<br/>Reveal a suit of your choice.<br/><br/>The Split<br/>Change of plans you have to divide your army for a two-wave assault.<br/>Divide your hand into two equal parts and bid on each.<br/><br/>Precision Strike<br/>Command your archers to deliver a precise strike.<br/>Predict the number of tricks and their suits for bonus points.<br/><br/>Missions<br/>Lead your assassins into a special mission to complete.<br/>Choose a mission card detailing specific objectives for the round.<br/><br/>Secret Missions<br/>Nobody knows your assassins&rsquo; mission.<br/>Keep your mission secret from opponents.<br/><br/>Wagering<br/>Driven by greed, you wager your coins.<br/>Wager coins to increase your potential winnings.<br/><br/>Wagering<br/>Fueled by greed, you stake your coins in a high-stakes gamble.<br/>Wager coins to increase your potential winnings.<br/><br/>Duel Battles<br/>Duel battles erupt across the realm; the victorious seize valuable loot from the defeated.<br/>Pair into twos or threes for head-to-head battles.<br/><br/>Parallel Battles<br/>As two battles unfold at once, you must prove your skill as a general by managing both at the same time.<br/>Manage and win both tricks at the same time.<br/><br/>Memory Battles<br/>Your armies revive from the dead and they fight one last time.<br/>Play this round twice and remember the cards that were in play!<br/><br/>Alliances<br/>The realm falls into chaos, and you must unite with your former enemies.

You can wheel and deal with other players, invest money, and enter Bonus to reach higher levels of play. Remember, everything in the game is negotiable.<br/><br/>We have taken six of the most powerful symbols known to man and made them my principal characters. They represent man&rsquo;s ultimate choices.<br/><br/>Eagle &ndash; Strength through individual freedom as we soar to new heights of achievement.<br/>Fire &ndash; Since the beginning of time man has nurtured its eternal flame.<br/>Demon &ndash; A symbol of corrupted power waiting in the darkness to feed on the weak and helpless.<br/>Throne &ndash; Rules of wealth dominate for themselves vast empires of property and people.<br/>Serpent &ndash; In the garden was a serpent coiled and waiting to misguide and misdirect.<br/>Cross &ndash; A universal symbol of good, we can always depend on the kindness of others.<br/><br/>It is the relationship between people&rsquo;s morals, money, and their different goals that cause conflict and change.<br/><br/>We introduce The Ultimate Game. For the first time you can experience fantasy and reality with the imagination of role playing and the strategy of a board game. You can make the game come to life. The rules should guide, but not limit you. Welcome to our world. A new dimension of game playing awaits you.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Played on a fully painted board, a fantasy-induced image becomes the actual playing board. The game is started as pawns, much like in life. Movement is made by standard two 6d rolls. There are various hazards and events on the board and penalties and bonuses are paid in cash or movement limitations. Along the game path, there are six home bases of the various character images. A pawn can enter any one of his choosing and assume that character for the rest of the game. Character images may not harass pawns in any way.<br/><br/>At this point a player assumes his character image role and each player has different powers and functions. Primary functions include: Eagle receives a cash commission for ALL financial transactions in the game, Fire  sweeps  and moves players about the board, Demon harasses players and blocks them from advancing, Throne buys properties and investments that increase each round, Serpent harasses and robs players, and Cross saves players from being robbed, harassed, or burned (moved against their will) by Fire. There are dozens of specific other roles, functions and actions that each character may do, and image characters add a &ldquo;magic red&rdquo; die to their roles that also allows them to perform custom functions and actions, as well as common actions to all characters in the game.<br/><br/>The player with the most money/property at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mr. Graves is an expansion unit for Malifaux. He belongs to the Neverborn faction.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Mr. Graves is the Honeypot's bouncer and secret Nephilim skinwalker.<br/><br/>Mobility<br/>Mr. Graves respectable walk and charge ranges and has Shove Aside, allowing him to move through HT 1 or 2 models. He has a (1) action called &quot;Show ya the door&quot; that initiates a CB-&gt;DF Duel with Graves and an enemy model within 1&quot;. If Graves wins he can Push the model up to 5&quot; and graves can then push himself into Base contact with that model. He has a (0) spell called &quot;Bar's Closed&quot; that's a 6&quot; pulse. He picks a spot within LOS and 6&quot; and any model that fails to resist the spell (using willpower) is pushed 4&quot; directly away from the chosen spot. Although this ability does not move Mr. Graves himself, it can be useful for adding to the speed of his crew.<br/><br/>Offense<br/>His fencepost packs a nasty punch with a minimum of 3 Dg and receives a positive flip to damage against Height 1 and height 2 models. He can flurry with that Fence post, and he gets a Rams to his combat when swinging on models with the Brilliance characteristic. This allows him to easily trigger &quot;Broke Something&quot; which causes a model damaged by the Fence Post to be unable to spend more than 2 AP during its next activation.<br/><br/>He has the Wicked and Ruthless characteristics as well to let his disengaging strikes hurt and ignore those harmless/pitiful models.<br/><br/>He also has a ranged damaging spell - Settel Tab, one that he can discard cards for in order to gain positive flips on its damage. This can be used in melee and has a respectable severe damage of 5. Bear this in mind if you are facing spirits.<br/><br/>Resilience<br/>He has Black Blood to punish people hitting him in Melee along with Armor 1 and Slow to Die. He has a (0) spell called &quot;Keeping the Peace&quot; that's a 6&quot; Aura that makes charging enemy models win a CB-&gt;12 duel before their attack flip or they receive a negative flip to their charge damage. He is Ht3, so keep this in mind when it comes to hiding models behind him and when trying to get him into cover.<br/><br/>Tips and Tricks<br/><br/>Bar's Closed<br/>Although at first glance Mr. Graves seems to be not a lot more than a beatstick, this surprisingly versatile spell gives him much more scope in a crew. Unlike similar spells, such as Zoraida's repulsive, the push effect does not emanate from the model generating the pulse, but from a point he picks when he casts the spell. It must be noted that it isn't models within 6&quot; of the point that are affected, its all models within 6&quot; of Mr. Graves.<br/>Some tricks that can be played with this ability include, but are not limited to:<br/>push your models further up the table<br/>push enemy models off objectives<br/>push models into Mr. Graves' melee range so that he can flurry them.<br/>push models off heights to cause damage<br/>separate models that are engaged in melee<br/>push brilliant models towards the Hungering Darkness so it can feed from them<br/>bring a model closer to Mr. Graves so that he can use Show Ya The Door<br/><br/>",

Each player will fight first against the game in order to survive, and then against the other players to become the one who takes more objectives (SP=Survival Points) to his/her Shelter before the Storm returns.<br/><br/>WHAT THE HELL IS THE STORM?<br/><br/>A huge meteorological phenomenon dragging with it toxic dust and which annihilates life wherever it goes through. The game befalls along some &ldquo;Days&rdquo;, each one of them is divided in four &ldquo;Turns&rdquo; (6 hours each). The &ldquo;Stormboard&rdquo; measures game length and every player must always have an eye on it, because they have to be back inside their Shelters before that one arrives&hellip; and it does indeed. As curious note, starting from half the &ldquo;Stormboard&rdquo;, every zone becomes more toxic&hellip;<br/><br/>IS THERE ANY VEXING BETWEEN PLAYERS?<br/><br/>After the games I&rsquo;ve had, I can tell you that &ldquo;even though could not be &ldquo;PvP&rdquo;, everything suggests that if you are dying from thirst, the Water Source is far away and a nearby survivor has water&hellip; you go for it&rdquo;. Besides, it is the only way of obtaining some objective tokens for your Shelter if another survivor obtained them before. Furthermore It has Mission cards that can be gotten in certain &ldquo;Zones&rdquo;, which pretty motivates players interaction, besides &ldquo;Radio Missions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Individual Missions&rdquo;.<br/><br/>IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE APART FROM PLAYERS INTERACTION?<br/><br/>There will be continuous barter, business in the Trading Bazaar, Mercenaries control, Pathfinding, Dogs or Street Children. Caravan dealing and Gambling Houses; provisionally taking refuge in Camps, to put on a Gas Mask in order to not obtaining too much &ldquo;Deterioration&rdquo;, climbing and trying to get out unhurt from &ldquo;Devastated Zones&rdquo;. Dragging on Supplies Boxes towards your Shelter, covered in warm clothes to protect you from the outdoor; fights against Predators and Raiders ambushes&hellip; and if you can do it in a modified vehicle looking with Binoculars, that&acute;s better, isn&acute;t it?<br/><br/>WELL, I MISS SOMETHING IN IT:<br/><br/>General Catastrophes, Event cards, enemies that remain on the board and move, 37 Zones and a different board in each game, 3 different board centers, combat system with a single roll (ALWAYS is resolved with a single roll), making your own weapons and improving them, or find them along the way, personalized missions for each Searcher, and we start with 8 Searchers with two capabilities to choose each one of them&hellip; Who said versatility?<br/><br/>FINALLY:<br/><br/>&ldquo;After The End&rdquo; is a game from 1 to 4 players that tries to approach a long forgotten theme in board games as far as I know: the fight for survival in the manner of Mad Max, Fallout, I&acute;m Alive or Metro 2033. If you enjoy these masterpieces, without any doubt you should have to check &ldquo;After The End&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Here you don&acute;t lead an army, nor a survivors group, nor a gang, nor a nation&hellip; it is just your Searcher against the world and the others Searchers, fighting hard for surviving in a devastated and hostile world, and bringing back to his/her Shelter everything is possible before the Storm comes back&hellip;<br/><br/>I can&acute;t say good bye without telling the reason I did ATE one year and a half ago: I wanted myself a survival game in a post-apocalyptic world, I searched and searched again and I found some titles touching the theme, but not in the way I wanted. So I started to make my own game. Months later, with the prototype finished, I can say I have the game I wanted&hellip; and the intention is making it available to whoever wants it.<br/><br/>",

Becoming this apprentice is a most coveted position, bringing with it the chance to learn skills and techniques that most only dream of; not to mention the prestigious work afterward. You will play as an up-and-coming gnomish tinkerer fighting for your place as Mastermind&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute; at this year&rsquo;s competition. Mastermind chooses this apprentice each year by their ability to finish a single task. It will be your job to destroy a Masterbot; a steamwork contraption Mastermind has designed and built to attack your workshop.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayEach player receives a game board, a player placard for tracking resources, a gnome character, and a starter bot they can build to help defend their workshop from Masterminds Masterbot.  <br/>Players take turns playing their characters and Mastermind. On Mastermind&rsquo;s turn all the players decide the actions of the Masterbot attacking the player to their left , while the players attempt to defend their workshop from destruction. On the players turn dice are rolled to gather resources. Bots are then bought, scrapped, or built.

        "description": "Thieves and Cops in the lonely roads of the town. Will you be the next victim? A quick game about observation and bluff for strong nerves.<br/><br/>Thieves and Cops is a card game.<br/>On each round, the players are in charge of a certain character (Cop, Thief, Victim or the Watcher. With just a simple blink of the eye, the Thief, with the help of the Watcher, tries to steal as many Victims as he can, before he gets caught by the Cop. The players are awarded with money cards, depending on the character they have on each round. The first player, who gathers 600 pounds, will be the winner of the game.<br/><br/>The Thieves and Cops: Blink to your Victim has an original gameplay that keeps players across what course of alert. Easy to learn it, zero time setup , fits in your pocket! A game for large groups that guarantees your fun!<br/><br/>The player, who has the Thief card, sees all players discreetly in the eyes and blinks to the one who he believes that is the Victim so that he can steal him. The Victim that has been stolen waits for a while and then he announces that the Thief stole him, reveling his Character card. The Thief continues to steal the Victims, trying to avoid the Cop.<br/>The round ends when:<br/><br/>     The Cop catches the Thief.<br/>     The Cop catches the wrong Thief.<br/>     The Thief steal all the Victims.<br/>     The Thief steals the Cop man.<br/><br/><br/>When something of the above happens, the players that have won, gain Money cards, and a new round begins. All the character cards are gathered again, shuffled and handed out to the players for a new round. The players, who have gained the money cards, put them aside until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Goal of Each Character<br/><br/>Thief &ndash; Tries to steal all the Victims, without the Cop finding him or to accidently steal him.<br/><br/>Watcher &ndash; Observes all the players during the game, trying to understand who the Cop is. When the thief blinks to the Watcher, he announces to the rest who he believes that the Cop is, trying to help the Thief. If his prediction is right, he will get at the end of the round Money cards. The Watcher is not a Victim.<br/><br/>Cop &ndash; He has to find out who the Thief is. When he finds him, he reveals his card and announces the Thief. If he finds him, he gets rewarded with Money cards and all the Victims that have been stolen get compensated with Money cards. If he doesn&rsquo;t find the Thief and catches a Victim, the Thief wins and the Victim gets compensation.<br/><br/>Victim &ndash; When the Thief steals a Victim he waits until the Cop catches the Thief, so he can get compensation, otherwise he won&rsquo;t get any money cards. When the Cop catches the Victim, instead of the Thief, he will get compensation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "22ra (translated &ldquo;to 22&rdquo; points) is a card-driven game that simulates basque hand-pelota  games between 2 players, or 4 players when playing doubles. The objective is to score 22 points by playing cards, so that the opponent cannot or does not want to reach the ball or makes a foul when hitting the ball.<br/><br/>The game consists of three separate decks of cards: <br/><br/>         The Player Trait&rsquo;s cards, consisting of <br/>             Movement cards (Mugimendu) <br/>             Force cards (Indar), and<br/>             Skill cards (Abilezia)<br/>        <br/>         The Serve Deck (Sake), with <br/>             Normal serve cards (Arrunta) and<br/>             Risky serve cards (Ausarta) <br/>        <br/>         The Hit Deck, which consists of three Subdecks: <br/>             The Bounce Back cards (Botez Atzera), the ball is hit after it bounces<br/>             The Defence Volley cards (Airez Defentsa), the ball is hit before it bounces<br/>             The Good-play cards (Jokaldia), with different special hits and plays. <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The board represents the fronton, divided in 7 squares (A1, A2, B1, B2, D, F and R), contains also a scoring track and 5 Timeout spaces for each player (Atsedenaldiak).<br/><br/>Each player chooses seven Player Trait cards, at least 4 Movement cards. Then each player is dealt 4 Good-play cards. A start player is chosen randomly (the server in the first point) and the game can begin: the server chooses a Serve card. If the serve is good, the receiver must hit it back either after the ball bounces (from the same square where the ball is, using a Bounce Back card) or before the ball bounces (from the square directly in front of the ball, using a Defence Volley card). Play continues until one player fails to hit the ball (cannot/does not want to hit or hits a ball badly), therefore losing the point (Falta) or the other player makes a great hit, directly winning the point (Tanto). After each point, the players recover a Player Trait card and replenish their hand of Good-play cards (up to 4 cards). The first player reaching 22 points wins immediately the game.<br/><br/>In double games, the teams are formed by a Forward and a Defender, and the games are also played to 22 points. The rules are the same, except that each player chooses 4 Player Trait cards (at least 2 Movement cards) and that they can exchange the Good-play cards before the start of each point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Try to win this game of football by building words out of letter tiles representing players on your team. The defense and offense build words at the same time, and the offense advances the ball down the field based on how much better their word is. The defense also gets to intercept the ball, if they can guess how the offense will play. So huddle up, map out your plays, and&hellip; go long!<br/><br/>Each quarter of the game includes two parts: a draft - worker placement to get bonuses during play - and the field play - the actual word building portion of the game.<br/><br/>Players build words using cards with two letters on them. Players use the top or bottom letters on each card to build the word worth the most points. The offense advances the ball based on the the difference of points between the offense and the defense - one space (10 yards) per point of difference.<br/><br/>The defense can intercept the ball if they can correctly guess two of the letters the offense uses in their word. Since the defense knows some of the possible letters the offense has available, this forces a tougher decision for the offense than simply making the biggest word.<br/><br/>Like in real football, the offense can also try for a field goal, giving a much higher chance of success (they only need to have one card per space away from the end zone, and the defense doesn't build a word) but only giving half as many points.<br/><br/>",

Players gain success points by satisfying their customer needs that are influenced by market demands.

Players need to make sure that they satisfy their customers; unsatisfied customers become angry, leave the shops and spoil players' reputation.<br/>During the game, players compete in preparing in the best possible way for running their market shops.

You can even choose to play each area - three levels - as a mini-campaign! Players need not worry about the experience of their heroes or henchmen if they play later levels, either, for the skills and abilities of the adventurers are tied to the levels themselves.<br/><br/>If Darkholds is played as a campaign, players can purchase certain types of mundane equipment or hire henchmen in between levels - effectively meaning heroes have a retinue they can bring with them to the next level!<br/><br/>To succeed in their quest for eternal life players must overcome a horde of enemies trying to stop their heroes, gathering treasure, ancient artefacts and sorcerous weapons or armour to help them along the way. The Wihts, scampering grave spiders and huge, terrifying mound beetles, ancient Gāsta and shrieking Drēaguth all wish to deny the secrets of the Jutes to the outsiders, and they will do anything - including the destruction of their own halls and tombs - to stop them.<br/><br/>Players must also understand that - whilst the game is co-operative - there will also be an element of selfishness to how each player plays the game, for each hero has his own secret quest and must succeed in it if he is to progress through Darkholds successfully...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Evil Queen wants a poison for the poison apple. But only the rarest poison based on a dragon's blood will satisfy her needs. The only problem is, the last dragon alive was seen some thousand years ago...  So she turns to a covenant of witches for help.<br/><br/>Players take role of the witches that compete to concoct most bottles of the rarest poison in the game (out of 3 kinds). While the total amount of poisons in the game is changing, the rarest type of poison also changes, so the winner is uncertain until the very end. When the 5-th bottle of any type of poison is made, the game ends, and only the rarest poison is counted toward victory condition.<br/><br/>There are 10 action tokens that players may pick, and they represent the actions that each player will play on their next turn. You can not pick action token that are in possession of other player(s).<br/><br/>Players will collect ingredients for the poisons from the game board by rolling dice. But ingredients are expendable and the sources will eventually dry up. So in time, it is harder and harder to collect new ingredients.<br/><br/>Players must discover rituals that can convert certain ingredients into a dragon's blood, necessary for concocting the poisons. Players build their gameplay based on the rituals they have discovered.<br/><br/>Each player starts with one Secret Ally card. If the player finish the game on his turn, and that makes his secret ally player to win - they both win! This eliminates the &quot;kingmaker&quot; mechanic.<br/><br/>",

We all loved the subtle balance of co-op and every man for himself. The pain of taking one for the team by compromising an intended mission to help someone else pick up a Regalia rather than let it get to Cairo makes for some fantastic gameplay with all the deal making/breaking that goes with that.<br/>The end game is a lovely ramping of tension and the option of going for total loss rather than helping someone who has previously screwed you over win outright is also a very nice/nasty touch.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Each game begins with a random building of the town with up to 50 structures and then placement of your fort followed by choosing your characters. Then you pick the order for your characters and enjoy the unfolding of a new adventure.<br/><br/>Your team of 2-4 characters begins their quest to bring the green emerald back to their fort. On each turn a player may move a character and use that characters weapons or special power. Each characters movement is defined by a number of chain links giving your character a speed limit but allowing movement in any direction. Each character also has a set of weapons that have range limitations based on line of site and distance. Each character also has a unique power allowing them to use dynamite, arrest a character, use multiple weapons, etc.  Temporary alliances, control of strategic vantage points, and a balance of defensive strength and offensive risk taking make the inevitable race to get the emerald a do or die moment. Hits on each character are achieved though a damage bag that inserts an element of chance in which a hit could mean a miss, 1 or 2 life points or possibly an instant kill. The game is won when one player has returned the green emerald to their fort.  The key to winning is choosing your moment to go for the emerald when you are strong enough to beat all the others players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

New rules will cover the impact on air combat from weapon harmonization, simple, reflector and gyroscopic gun sights, compressibility, effects of armor, turbo chargers and much more.<br/><br/>One addition to the game system for WWII is increases in aircraft performance which are addressed with additional columns in the Maximum Speed section of the data card. Military (MIL), War Emergency Power (WEP) and thrust augmentation systems such as water injection or nitrous oxide deliver varying horse power and thrust. Each throttle setting has a maximum speed determined by the thrust provided. For example, the Bf 109 E-3 has three maximum speeds, Military, 1 WEP and 5 WEP. The WEP has a one and five minute allowable time limit over-boost which provided additional power over the military rating of the engine. Fuel use increases with the use of WEP and pilots of aircraft with short legs will need to watch their use of fuel or getting home may be a problem when flying a flight operations mission. Aircraft specific overheating, trains, shell penetration and ground unit armor thickness are some of the areas covered.<br/><br/>",

Warring human faction must choose to keep fighting one another or join forces to defeat the Alien invaders... or both... or side with the aliens to get help in defeating their human foes... or not.<br/><br/>Day of Independence is a grand strategy game for 2 - 5 players set in an alternative steam-punky future. Each player plays a human power trying to take over the world. At some random point in the game Aliens may show up. The Aliens' true intentions are slowly revealed over time, and players must decide whether to fight the Aliens or not. Players choose actions that will make them either Collaborators with the Aliens or Resistance Fighters. The benefits and penalties of each decision depends upon the Aliens' true intentions. Lots of strategy, forced cooperation, and the ever present possibility of a knife in the back makes this game fun and different each time it is played.<br/><br/>You live on an Earth that is a fractured world of rival human powers, struggling against each other for dominance&hellip; you know, the usual &mdash; like it&rsquo;s always been. Each unwilling to let other nations just chill.<br/>Culture, art, religion, language, population, and even military might have been reduced to a single quantified unit of influential power, called Influence.<br/>Advances in technology have allowed all economies and industries to rely on just three resources: Ever-Stones, a chewy red resource crystal especially good in stews and as a sealant for nuclear waste sites; Green Avoidium, an aromatic mineral green resource used to put off chores and unpleasant tasks until tomorrow, and; Un-salt, a yellow resource ore best described by what it isn&rsquo;t &mdash; it&rsquo;s not salt.<br/>Scientist the world over have postulated the possibility of extra-terrestrial life for centuries, but there has never been any proof that Aliens exist and no proof that they are heading to earth on a mothership filled with super-powerful weapons and a willingness to use them.<br/>So don&rsquo;t worry. There probably aren&rsquo;t any super advanced Aliens out there with incredible technology that could pose a threat to humankind. Just keep fighting amongst yourselves. If only you could capture enough territory to declare yourself Ruler of Earth, everything would be great. All problems would be solved and you could go to bed at night and sleep the sleep of the just, knowing that you are the winner, &lsquo;cause winning is all that matters.<br/>But, if Aliens came&hellip; they might Exterminate the human race, or maybe they would come to Enslave you all. If they knew the Earth contained the Resource of Interest that they have been scouring the Universe for, they might come to Mine the Earth dry. Or maybe they might just come to say &lsquo;hi&rsquo;, as part of their mission to Explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and new civilizations. Or maybe capitalism would be their bag, and they would come to Trade, with a special offer, just for you.<br/>But they probably don&rsquo;t exist, so just keep fighting amongst yourselves.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fyra is a card game about matching and stacking meant for 1-4 players who have, at a minimum, the ability to differentiate colors or printed patterns. You take turns matching up your cards with the ones already on the play field. The cards overlap but you must match the colors of at least one of the corners. If you can't find a spot for your cards, you get to place one next to the other cards, but have to take two replacements. Alternately, if you find a spot where you can match all four corners you don't have to take any replacement cards and get one step closer to going out.<br/><br/>The real fun comes in when you choose a team color and try to make sure as few of those squares are showing by the time you go out. Make alliances to spread one player's color all over the field and make their score worse while setting up spots where you can match up all your own corners the next time your turn comes around. There are 2 goals: be the first to get rid of all your cards and second, have the fewest squares of your color on the play field when you do.<br/><br/>You can also play a solo game trying to make the smallest pile of cards based on randomly selected hands of cards. A game with 4 players should last around 5 to 20 minutes.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Little Nutters is a turn-based game where you take on the persona of a squirrel trying to uncover their buried nuts through the various patches on the playing field. Be the first to find all of your nuts before your opponents, but beware of rapid kittens, quack attacks, and ninja beavers. The dangers are very real in Little Nutters.<br/><br/>One by one, players take turns searching or digging through 27 randomly shuffled patches of 4 cards. The ultimate goal is to uncover a nut within these patches, but along the way players may find defense cards to bolster their hand or obstacles or animal attacks to possibly hinder their turn. Watch out for other players too as they can play trouble cards during their turn to weaken your hand or bust-a-nut cards to try and steal one of your hard earned prizes.<br/><br/>Set in a whimsical environment with fantastic cartoon-ish artwork, Little Nutters is a perfect party game with a quick  and easy set-up and rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tales of War is a competitive tactical board game for two players, which places you in the roles of army generals in the conflict for the Cross of Eternity, an ancient artefact holding the key to immortality!<br/><br/>The game board represents an open book filled with ever-changing terrain and mighty heroes leading their armies of medieval troops and fantasy creatures into battle. Each time you play the game, you write a new tale. It is your very own tale of war!<br/><br/>Key gameplay features:<br/><br/>- Skill-based combat. Players take turns activating one unit at a time and either move it to another position or attack an opponent&acute;s unit. Tales of War doesn&rsquo;t use dice, nor cards to resolve combat. Instead defeating enemy units is as simple as either moving your melee unit onto a square occupied by them or positioning your ranged units in the line of fire and range.<br/><br/>Each unit has different equipment, which defines its special rules. For example, units equipped with spears will automatically repel a direct cavalry charge and archers cannot make a frontal assault on units armed with shields. A player can still use the cavalry to outmanoeuvre a unit equipped with spears and devastate it with a flank or rear charge, just as archers may trap a shielded enemy by attacking at an angle.<br/><br/>There are 21 unit types and each has unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses. As the campaign progresses, your initially small force expands to include units, such as Elves, Dwarves, Fire and Ice Sorceresses, Giants, Hydras, Fire Elementals or even Vampires!<br/><br/>- RPG-like sense of progression and a constant arms race. Both armies evolve from one battle to the next, and your heroes learn new skills making them more dangerous on the battlefield;<br/><br/>- Replayability. Tales of War offers new, unique challenges and strategic/tactical possibilities each time you play. Each battle has its own victory conditions and is played on unique terrain. You will face a different, custom-built army each battle, just as your own army will have been re-equipped and re-organised.<br/><br/>- Fast setup and quick turns. Tales of War takes under 5 minutes to set up and tear down. Watching your opponents moves is as exciting as making your own as it always has an impact on the situation on the board;<br/><br/>- Ease of saving campaign progress. Simply put your units and their cards into your army box and that's it. You can pick up where you left off in the next session.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Join the race against time in Clockwise, the worker placement board game played on functioning mechanical gears.<br/><br/>Based on a Jules Verne short story, players collect resources and build clocks to save the city of Geneva. The game board consists of five inner mechanical gears and one large outer gear that rotates all the inner gears when it is moved. The inner gears contain resource spots that correspond to resource items used to build clocks. Players must place one of their workers on the starting position of any gear. The more turns you wait on the inner gears, the more valuable resources you will receive.<br/><br/>With the resources claimed, players can trade them in to build one of the revealed clocks located at the bottom of the board. Each clock has unique resources to build them and each hold a different victory point value when completing them. The game is played for 24 hours and when the clock strikes midnight, the game is over and clock victory points are tallied. The player with the most victory points wins the game and is titled as Geneva's next Clockmaster. Can you restore order before time runs out?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To flatter him, it would be enough to pluck 12 stars from the sky. <br/>The path to the great eagle is a perilous one, and the Norns will have to help you tame Sleipnir, outwit Loki, trick Nidhogg and coax Ratatosk... &quot;.<br/><br/>The game consists of collecting Odin or Thor runes, each rune card giving a certain number of points indicated at the bottom of the card. To do this, the player will try to accumulate the cards in order to obtain 12 stars (except in the case of modifying effect cards). If one of the players exceeds the goal, the others will share the runes in the stand.<br/>The winner of the game is the player who has collected the most rune points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of a faction (Catholic or Protestant), seeking to direct the fate of the &quot;Holy Roman German Empire&quot; while pursuing their own national interests, allowing to reproduce bold moves and influence or control Regions in the Holy Roman Empire, Flanders and the United Provinces, Northern Italy and Hungary. With the crucial support of foreign nations both military (troops) and with 'Subsidies' (financial resources) will help to achieve victory for one of the two game&rsquo; factions.<br/>The game will include a historical book with very interesting historical information about the conflict, and a detailed game example to progressively learn the mechanics of the game.<br/><br/>The Collapse is an intense and very fun game, which is easy to play due to its main mechanics (point to point) and being a card engine (CDG), but with unique aspects such as the planning phase at the beginning of the turn, the prestige points that grant more options to the players (leaders, abilities and much more), and the intense but impressive diplomacy of 9 nations (Saxony, Brandenburg, England, Papacy, Hungary, Spain, Denmark, Sweden and France). Each card has Operations Points (OPS), which allow you to play the card for Operations and/or the event by paying its cost from the OPS of the card, giving many different game options and strategies.<br/>The different Operations that players can use with their operation points are Deploy, Movement, Diplomacy, Naval Blockade, Siege and Replacements. The tension of the game will be increased by having players loot regions and fortresses to pay their units (the 30 years&rsquo; war was devastating and troops were frequently fed and paid with what was ravaged. And be careful not to pay the mercenaries in the game, because they can add unrest to the game!<br/><br/>The game has 10 turns, with an average time length of 50 minutes per turn (2-3 years) and a duration of 5 hours for the complete campaign, although it has several shorter scenarios from 2 to 6 turns which includes the Bohemia Palatinate campaign (recommended to play as the first scenario and which will also serve as an example of the game), the Danish, Swedish and French Interventions, or the Cardinal Infante Fernando march. With the recommended optional rule that players can go one more turn with some modifiers if they want to continue playing once the scenario is over and they are having fun.<br/><br/>The sequence of each game turn is divided into 4 main phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Planning phase: depending on the prestige of each faction, various actions of the factions may have more or less options<br/>     Campaign phase: players alternate cards from their hand (6 cards per turn)<br/>     Imperial Election Phase (only on turns 1 and 7): simple phase where it is decided which player has the status of Emperor, with some important benefits in the game<br/>     End of Turn Phase: where players use their replacement points to strengthen their troops and armies, determine possible attrition of units outside of their home regions, observe possible expansion of revolts, impact of Dunkirk Corsairs, redeploy units to prepare for the next turn (campaign) and extra victory points can be earned for certain conditions.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players assume the roles of skilled BJJ competitors, aiming to defeat their opponent either by achieving a &quot;submission&quot; or accumulating more points during the 10-minute match.<br/><br/>The game incorporates a combination of cards and dice, employing a straightforward war-style mechanic with a rock-paper-scissors system. This design choice ensures easy accessibility for players while allowing for strategic depth. To secure victory, players must defeat their opponent's cards, claim them, and add them to their own &quot;submission&quot; collection. The player who successfully gathers all the required cards for their submission emerges as the winner. Alternatively, players can opt to accumulate points cards to pursue victory through points.<br/><br/>Adding to the excitement, Roll 'n' Pin introduces &quot;VAI!&quot; cards, which serve as action cards. These cards offer players opportunities to bolster their strategies or make it more challenging for their opponent to achieve success.<br/><br/>The game thoughtfully incorporates various design details that create a strong connection to the theme of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu while providing an avenue for players to learn about the martial art. Notably, the point system utilized in the game closely mirrors the scoring systems employed in actual BJJ tournaments.<br/><br/>Overall, Roll 'n' Pin offers an immersive and cohesive gaming experience, merging the world of BJJ with dynamic gameplay mechanics and thematic elements that educate and entertain players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All players are psychics, except for one - the Swindler. Psychics try to write down answers that they think someone else also would write down. The Swindler tries to write down answers they think no other player would write. After all players write down their answers, they begin reading them off, player by player. All players draw a checkmark next to all matching answers and a cross sign next to all answers no one else wrote.<br/><br/>Now the voting process begins. All players write down the name of the player whom they suspect to be The Swindler and then read off their suspect. If the majority of votes singles out one player, they reveal their role. <br/>Psychics progress one space on the board for each checkmark on their answer sheet plus one additional space, if they correctly voted for the Swindler. The Swindler moves two spaces on the board for each cross sign on their answer sheet, only if they were not caught. However, if the Swindler was caught - they don't move at all. <br/>After all players have moved their pieces, all role cards are shuffled together and handed out to players.

Random room draws are replaced with a simple draft. Heroes still show up in town, but overflow into Locations (Temple, Stadium, Library, Hide-Out, and Tavern) where players can nab them with your all-new Minion meeple! If players choose to not use their Minion  to direct a hero, Minions can activate other action spaces.<br/><br/>The Town Board unlocks a long awaited single-player mode! In this mode, players will be trying to lure and slay as many heroes as possible. Players will need to keep an eye on damage, but luring is key to success; if too many heroes stack up in town, they'll head to the Tavern and end the game!<br/><br/>Super Boss Monster is 100% backwards compatible with all existing Boss Monster cards. As a standalone game, Super Boss Monster will contain everything that 1-4 players need to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Decades of catastrophic fallout from a nuclear disaster during the Cold War have laid waste to the known world, compelling civilization to seek shelter beneath the earth. The pressing task now is the construction of regenerators, which will generate new habitats to facilitate the resurgence of life and the reclamation of the Earth. A world brimming with hope awaits aboveground.<br/><br/>Phoenix New Horizon is a Euro-style board game in which players assume control of a team of commandos tasked with the mission of recolonizing Earth. Throughout the game's four rounds, players accumulate victory points by constructing regenerators and buildings, bolstering the planet's population, and achieving diverse objectives that vary between playthroughs.<br/><br/>Players must adeptly allocate their commandos to various actions throughout the game while also specializing them to enable more potent abilities at the expenses of versatility. Fulfilling missions assigned by the governing authorities yields additional actions on a player's turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You're pretty much doomed. Luckily you're in a time machine, part of an exploratory mission to test the latest time traversing technology, but you pushed the ship too far and things have gone horribly wrong.<br/><br/>Fortunately, as mentioned, the Tempus is a time machine. Your science officers have jury-rigged it to perform very localised jumps of the crew, allowing you to transport yourselves back to a time when you were not about to explode hoping that if you can gather enough information about the future you may be able to prevent the your ultimate destruction.<br/><br/>Of course it's not a perfect system, if you cause too many paradoxes the ship may find itself trapped in a fate much worse than exploding in the depth of space, if such a thing is possible.<br/><br/>Trouble on the Tempus is a co-operative game of disaster management where the players must prevent fires, electrical faults, and mechanical failures, as they work to fix the hyperdrive of the Tempus so they can power themselves home. Tragically this is a truly impossible task so the players will have no choice but to engage the ships time drive, resetting the board to the way it was at the start of the game so the players can try again with the added knowledge of when and where the disasters will appear.<br/><br/>If you can repeat the timeline enough, collecting the right equipment and positioning yourselves to pre-empt the disasters as they happen, you should be able to predict enough rounds to fix the hyper-drive and win the game. However, each time you time travel you cause a paradox, and the difficulty of the game can be adjusted by how many paradox's you can cause before reality collapses in on itself.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The strategy of GRIM begins with players' decisions regarding how to pair these Grim Decks together, as each Grim Card has Synergy Effects that will only trigger when played next to certain Elemental Grim. Attach Spirits for powerful Spirit Bonuses, react with Elements to negate and manipulate Attacks, and position wisely as you and your opponent place terrain effect Afterworlds in play. Secure enough knockouts and you will win the war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tour de France Board Game is a realistic simulation of the largest professional bicycle race in the world. The basic game set contains game plans for four stages that copy real stages of the 109th Tour de France race. The game can be further extended by additional individual stages.<br/><br/>Each player uses pawns to represent their cycling team. The movement of pawns is determined by throwing dice. Dice of different colors have different functions, depending on whether the terrain is flat or hilly, or when a tactical situation emerges.<br/><br/>The game is played as a sequence of individual moves in which the order of pawns on the game board is determined by arrows. Players take turns to move their pawns in a given order. The whole sequence is completed after all pawns are moved, upon which a new sequence begins. The beginning of each new sequence is confirmed using an application, which adds up all moves and calculates the finish times and final standings.<br/><br/>The game mechanism is not based on accident only but rather on the reasoning for each individual move, as the hexagonal net allows a relatively large freedom of movement. The placement of a pawn (rider) can be planned with respect to anticipated moves of other players' pawns. The choice of dice provides the opportunity to plan a strategic maneuver that can lead to the breaking up of a group, initiate an attack, or slow down pursuers.<br/><br/>",

It also saw an emphasis on economic warfare, as Confederate raiders tried desperately to erode the Union's enormous financial advantage by attacking Northern trade.<br/><br/>Ironclads: Divided Waters is a complete boxed game in our series of Industrial Age naval combat. It's based on the Confederacy's program of long-distance commerce raiding, with action taking place around the globe. Famous raiders like the Alabama, Florida and Shenandoah take to the high seas in search of fat Yankee merchantmen, while the U.S. Navy upholds its proud tradition of protecting the nation at any cost.<br/><br/>The map covers the entire world, as Confederate raiders attempt to ruin Yankee commerce, while the Union strangles the Confederacy's cotton-based economy with a tight blockade. While the search procedure is very different from Hearts of Iron, given the vastly different map scales, combat is resolved in exactly the same fashion.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>44 1.3&quot; x 2/3&quot; long counters; 88 2/3&quot; square counters<br/> 1 34&quot; x 22&quot; strategic map; 1 25&quot; x 24&quot; tactical map<br/> 1 16 page rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Admiral's Order: Naval Tactics in the Age of Sail is a simulation of naval engagements between ships-of-the-line and frigates in the Age of Fighting Sail. The focus of the game lies on the wars between Britain and France and her allies in the years 1775 to 1815. The Trafalgar expansion allows players to recreate the dramatic and decisive battle between the British and the allied fleet at Cape Trafalgar, an engagement featuring no fewer than sixty vessels.<br/><br/>A game turn equates to a &frac12;-hour watch on the day of battle. In each turn, players will play cards to execute sailing manoeuvres such as tacking, wearing or changing sail configuration in order to put their ships into position for devastating broadsides or even rakes on the enemy vessels.<br/><br/>In larger engagements ships are grouped together in squadrons and usually form a &ldquo;Line of Battle&rdquo;, a formation that provides the commander with the most control over his fleet. Using Admiral's Order cards players signal general commands to their squadrons ranging from &quot;Form a Keel Line&quot; and &quot;Wearing in succession&quot; to &quot;Prepare for Close Action&quot;. Keeping the ships in formation and effectively deploying the fleet in the heat of battle while also retaining the initiative is the main challenge for a commander.<br/><br/>Occasionally, ships will engage each other in brutally destructive Close Quarter combat. In such situations the game 'zooms' into the action: Using a set of &quot;Close Action&quot; cards, players can employ grapeshot, grenades, carronades, and sharpshooters to wreak destruction on the opposing vessel&rsquo;s upper deck. Through a clever use of grappling hooks and boarding crews it is possible to overcome the enemy's defenses to take the ship as the ultimate prize.<br/><br/>The Trafalgar expansion can be played by 2 to 6 players, and fighting the whole Battle of Trafalgar will take up a weekend.<br/><br/>The game is produced in a small, limited edition and comes in a hancrafted linen-bound box, including a wooden presentation box with 60 handcrafted, wooden ship models. Each ship with removable masts and ship names burned into each side.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to build three five-story pagodas on a hex-shaped board with different territories representing the lands of Tibetan mythology before your opponent can do so.<br/><br/>Your faction is made of channelers, which extract energy from the territories and build new pagoda stories, and sentinels, which protect your channeler and restrict those of the enemy. On your turn, you can perform up to three actions: move your figures, train new ones, relocate magic portals, devote energy to building pagoda stories, and so on. Extracting this energy may wake ancient demons: neutral deities that can influence and be influenced by any of the players once they're woken. However, their rule-bending effects may disrupt your plans, and as the game progresses, they become more and more powerful.<br/><br/>The demons featured in the Tibetana base game are:<br/><br/><br/>    Chemchog: the channelers' horror<br/>    Citipati: the death dancer<br/>    Kuberan: the heist<br/>    Kurukulla: the thousand faces<br/>    Mahakala: the occupier<br/><br/><br/>",

TechCommander combines miniature gaming with the sci-fi action seen in first person shooters and sci-fi real time strategy video games. The game has powerful Mechanized Strike Vehicle units (called MSV&rsquo;s for short) that can destroy targets in seconds, but also has the ultimate in elite power armor infantry units.  These units are based on a possible progression of future soldier programs in development in the modern day, and are  equipped with technology to keep them agile, powerful and somewhat safe from the monster MSV&rsquo;s roaming the landscape. The infantry are jump jet equipped, and in many cases, running a visibility and sensor masking stealth suit. Many also have capacitance based shield meaning if you do not fully eliminate them, they will recharge!  The MSV may be powerful, but left unguarded, it is no match for a crack squad of  USSC Force Recon Marines!  TechCommander MSVs are fairly large miniatures, standing anywhere from four inches to a foot high. They use a peg-together system so that swapping out weapons and gear for a battle that requires a custom load out is easy!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You may find KAM&rsquo;ON interesting for one particular reason- you can scam. Although this turns out to be incredibly interesting and allows for millions of different scenarios, plays, and manipulation, KAM&rsquo;ON has many other aspects and cards that give it a quite perfect balance between fun, complexity and possibilities. For example, take poker, a game that is not too complex yet allows for so many different plays on account of the player/human factor of the game; players can manipulate others, bluff, etc. KAM&rsquo;ON is very similar, although frankly our cards look a bit nicer.<br/><br/>Having tens of distinct cards lets the player combine different plays, playing as many cards as they  would like during their turn, yet only playing one card per type. The true intrigue comes when you realise that you may not make it without trading- or scamming. You decide to bluff. You lie about having a card that another player needs only to scam him out of a card you need. A player may only complete their part of the trade during their own turn, therefore it is quite easy to scam someone- at the cost of your in game reputation.<br/><br/>This aspect of KAM&rsquo;ON works perfectly with the beautifully designed cards that work to get you your 4 organs- the cards needed to win. In all honesty, KAM&rsquo;ON is quite simple. Do everything you can to get 4 organs, whether it be destroying your opponents and stealing their organs, or scamming them out of their organs. Whichever it is, as long as you get an organ, it was probably worth it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Using a customized deck of skills, spells, will, and other actionable cards, players battle in an arena-like fashion to knock out each others champions and become victorious.<br/><br/>Based on the recommendations of the Seer of Sanctuary, Azara, Monarchs can choose up to 3 ancient champions to take into battle. These champions from the past all hail from different realms within the world of Limsia where they once were revered by their respective species. Players take turns controlling their champions and use actionable cards that can cool down to be used again and the first player to deplete the HP of all of their opponents' champions is the winner.<br/><br/>As this is a strategy-heavy game, players can best strategize gameplay by using weapons and potions from their inventory to influence survivability and any attacks that are relevant to their champions of choice. New cards are released monthly so players can build as many unique and versatile decks as possible to vary their gameplay and avoid being locked in to specific play styles. With the number of champions growing, every battle provides a new ground for players of all skill levels to show off their customizations and strategies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After you play one card from your hand, place that card in the discard pile and draw a new card; you should always have FIVE cards.  The game continues clockwise.  If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile and it becomes the draw pile.<br/>First player to fill in a side of the fractal with all the same color, and then place the LARGE fractal in his or her side, and exclaim &quot;FREAKIN&rsquo; FRACTALS&quot; wins!  The large 'mega' fractal must be placed after the other three same colors on that side.  For a longer game, decide the first player who wins three games is the ultimate champion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Killwager is an extremely tactical, small-unit based, realism focused Ultramodern and Near future tabletop game. Minimal tokens, full on narrative. It takes you from the modern day to a newly colonized planet 80 years into the future. The only consistencies? Cash and Violence..<br/><br/>Lead a hard team of near future mercenaries as they do the bidding of several powers in the area. Blazing a corpse soaked trail of glory, cash, and spent casings across intense &quot;End of the movie&quot; style direct action engagements.<br/><br/>During their turn, a player has one model perform (or two if they are within 4&quot;), which consists of moving, shooting, taking cover, interacting with terrain, and many other measures. Any model performing can be targeted by a reactive measure. Moving across the battlefield can give your opponent an opportunity to stun, or eliminate outright, your moving asset. It's very simple and breaks down into individual actions with no math. Only increasing difficulty in performing your actions. No more adding 2 or three different modifiers together. Just one flat target number to roll a D10 and add your single stat to. That's right. One stat for the entire game<br/><br/>A game of Killwager can end in multiple ways. Typically, you want to get the most objective points, and exfiltrate off the battlefield, while trying to deny your opponent the same outcome. However, one player can be forced to end their play time prematurely if they hit pullout conditions specific during a scenario. Often times this is having too many assets killed. Once pullout conditions are met, a player must move all of their forces off the board edge or face capture by their opponent or death at the hands of 3rd party AI.<br/><br/>A player wins when points are counted up after a scenario or a chain of scenarios. Capturing objectives matter on the battlefield, and count towards your overall score. However, losing assets, including very important ones, or accidentally eliminating non-hostiles, will give you negative points. So even if you have the most people alive at the end of a match, you might not be the winner.<br/><br/>",

Intimidate or provoke your enemies to scare them or force them to attack carelessly. Use your diplomatic abilities to calm dangerous, psychopathic entities until you are able to backstab them or plead on the behalf of honorable opponents. Manage the stress of battle, seek to understand your opponents&rsquo; perverse intelligence and use that knowledge to destroy them or to find a way to save them from destroying themselves and everyone you hold dear.<br/><br/>Welcome to Yamashiro.<br/><br/>Campaign<br/><br/>The city of Yamashiro is an immense micro-universe where the lives of the citizens, heroes and enemies are tightly intertwined. Experience a unique adventure that unfolds over the course of 12 months during which you decide what activities the heroes pursue, where they explore and who they meet. Craft equipment, revel in festivals, expand the city, take advantage of the amenities of its many facilities, and explore personal relationships with the town&rsquo;s inhabitants as well as its assailants. Sankokushin does not require a heavy, multi-player commitment to reach the end of a campaign and it will not abruptly end if things go poorly. However, only those who travel across time and memory will gain the knowledge necessary to free Yamashiro from the burden of its tragic fate.<br/><br/>Procedural Narrative<br/><br/>No walls of text. No &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo; choices. Sankokushin instead wraps you in its unique story as you experience Yamashiro without confining you to a guided plotline. Instead of presenting you with only narrative choices, the storyline is organically generated by the heroes&rsquo; actions during both the combat encounters and the city phase. The assailants of Yamashiro and its inhabitants are all intimately connected by a dark fate and only the actions of the heroes can alter the course of their destiny. These interrelationships have profound consequences in game and they are the heart of Sankokushin&rsquo;s narrative and it is impossible to experience them all in a single playthrough as they are a reflection of your unique playstyle so different gaming groups will have different experiences.<br/><br/>Intelligent Enemies<br/><br/>Each of the 10 bosses included in Sankokushin has a unique personality and story arc that is closely linked with the overall narrative. The way you deal with each of them will reverberate throughout the course of the campaign. You will learn to love and hate their twisted personalities and will see that the methods used to fight them will deeply influence their future behavior. They learn from your strategies and change their attitude towards you (and the way they fight!) according to the way you psychologically approach them thanks to the unique communication system. Sankokushin is designed by a small team whose knowledge in the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis have made possible bosses with realistic, uncanny, and perverse personalities that will show you the darkest sides of human nature.<br/><br/>",

Each player draws a card, remembers its colour and places it face-down in front of him/herself.<br/><br/>Players take turns looking at the face-down side of one of the discs (without showing it to the other players). The active player may either uncover the mafioso (= put him back face-up) or just put him back. If the player reveals him, he/she gets a second try. If not, it's the next player's turn now. If the second mafioso is also revealed, the active player gets a third and final attempt, on which he/she always has to mask an already revealed mafioso (= return the disc face-down). A player's turn always ends after a maximum of three attempts.<br/>A player's turn also ends when he/she looks at one of the two discs without a face, and these cannot be revealed.<br/><br/>The game ends when all 8 conspirators of one colour have been uncovered (unless that colour is not attributed to a player, which can happen with fewer than six players). The player with that colour card wins the game.<br/><br/>",

You are dealt 3 cards and start your turn by drawing enough cards to bring your hand to 4. You may then play Gargoyle cards to the table in front of you to start your set. Finally, you can attack other players with villain cards trying to take Gargoyle cards you need from them. Demona and Xanatos cards steal cards automatically. Lesser Villains must use battle cards (with a rock-paper-scissors outcome) to win a Gargoyle. Sunrise/Sundown cards turn an opponent's gargoyle to stone and prevent it from counting towards a set. The first player to complete a set of the 6 different Gargoyles is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The players supply the figures at any desired scale.  The hallmark of these rules is the highly detailed and historically meticulous system for portraying the various types of military organization during this period.  Units consist of variable numbers of figures and constitute infantry battalions, cavalry regiment and artillery batteries.<br/><br/>Despite its deliberately &quot;Old School&quot; design (i.e., large-sized units, figure removal, historically accurate rules on movement and changes of facing), the rules use modern mechanics and so do not require the writing of orders.  Existing miniature armies need not be re-based to use this rules set.

Referred to on occasion as &quot;D.A.I.S&quot; or &quot;The D.A.I.S. System.&quot;<br/><br/>Made available through Wyre Forest Games Club as a free download:<br/><br/>The game strives to capture the &quot;feel&quot; of the period using two or three &quot;divisions&quot; or &quot;battles&quot; of grouped warrior bands of Retinues and Contingents, rather than a number of independently-maneuvering &quot;units&quot; of like-armed soldiers.<br/><br/>The qualities of Aggression, Formation and Strength are key along with Leadership which seeks to maximize these qualities to gain advantage over opposing troops.  These qualities ebb and flow depending on the fortunes of the unit, nearby friendly units, and Leaders.<br/><br/>The actual resolution of combat is literally resolved by each player engaging in a single round of rock/paper/scissors for each pair of units, or aligned groups of soldiers from a unit, brought together in melee.<br/><br/>",

Four squares of empty space at each corner of the board are called Towers and are not in the field of play.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to force an opponent's King into Checkmate.

Players will need to print and mount the counters which have all been sized to accommodate miniatures which players can purchase and paint to their taste.<br/><br/>WWII: The Struggle for Asia can be played by 2-5 players, but is ideal as a 4 player game (2 Allied and 2 Japanese players).

Maybe it's your first time in this tropical paradise. Perhaps you are a veteran of the sun and sea, either way none of you expected to be trapped here.  Dr. McRaph's keys have been stolen, the food supply is dwindling and if you don't get off the island in a few days everyone is going to starve.<br/><br/>With the key held tight in their grasp, the guilty party watches everyone descend into fits of rage and paranoia.  This is the moment they have been waiting for, a chance to break the taboo without a single witness left to tell the tale.  It is now time for the meat feast!&rdquo;<br/><br/>In Hannibal Island everyone adopts the secret role of a over-privileged holiday goer or perhaps Dr. McRaph himself.  One player is dealt the role of the Cannibal  it is their aim to murder/eat everyone on the island, while it is everyone else&rsquo;s aim to survive and lynch the cannibal before he/she eats them all.<br/><br/>Hannibal Island is a Mafia/Werewolf variant.  Unlike Mafia, the Cannibal does not have to kill every turn and the time limit is set by the dwindling food supply.  Each character has an appetite (how much food they need in a day) and a health value (how many days they can not meet their appetite value before dying) Once players get used to the game extra cards/roles can be added to vary the game play and add more strategy, victory conditions and most importantly fun!<br/><br/>The game is designed to work with up to seven players without a moderator or judge, if you have an honest gaming group. With more players the game still requires a judge to assist with the flow of the game.<br/><br/>",

You must roll equal to or higher than the indicated number. Rolling a 19 or 20 will cause a CRIT, usually causing double damage. When you have to hit your target you roll however many action dice your weapon allows. Refer to your accuracy, and if the dice you rolled are equal to or above your accuracy, you successfully hit.<br/><br/>Weapons: Each character has some form of a melee weapon. Most characters will be able to cause either 4 or 6 total damage with their weapon. Though the way it is caused is different for every character. The knight with a flail rolls 1 action dice causing 6 damage. While the Crusader with his longsword rolls 6 action dice each causing only 1damage. The Cleric with his hand mace causes 4damage with 1 action dice, while the Sorcerer and their casting staff rolls 2 action dice each causing 2 damage.<br/><br/>Movement: Movements between the characters vary based on their maneuverability and battlefield mobility. The ranger holds roots to the Bishop of Chess, allowing them to go as far as they want in a diagonal line. The knight is able to move in the classic 'L-move' associated with knights of Chess. Though when it comes to the Crusader (able to move up to 2 squares diagonally) or Assassin(able to move up to 2 squares in ANY direction) Cathedr'l takes on its own personality as characters must use their unique movement to navigate the battlefield.<br/><br/>Spells: The Sorcerer, Cleric, and Paladin, utilize magic to support themselves and their allies in combat with powerful abilities only used by the select few magic users of Cathedr'l.<br/><br/>Abilities: Abilities are what will allow certain characters their unique traits. The Warrior and his Charge ability allow him, like a pawn, to move up to 2 squares on his first movement. The Paladin with the ability of STED, has built extreme strength and endurance and has an extra Hitpoint that regenerates at the end of every turn, essentially ignoring 1 point of damage whenever he is hit.<br/><br/>Using a system that is as deep and complex, as a tried and true RPG, and the unique strategy offered by chess, both players will use strategy and the role-playing aspect of a 20-sided Action Dice in order to outsmart and gain better positioning against their opponents. <br/>   <br/>   In order to beat the game, you must slay your opponents King AND Queen. After slaying either of the two 'royal' characters on your opponent's team, all of the their characters that started the game on their respective royal's side of the board, go into exile and are removed from play. This allows for another layer of strategy as slaying your opponents king or queen can leave your opponent at half strength and weak against your troops.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Simulation of the Post-Reformation Smack Down!<br/><br/>The premise behind Spiritual Warfare: Luther's Small Catechism Edition (LSCE) is that there is a very real war that is being waged across the world. Look, you may not think this is your thing. You may be completely unaware of the earth-shattering implications of the Reformation or a guy named Martin Luther. You may not know that there is a legacy of this radical confessing church that exists to this present day. Regardless, this is still a boss game that helps people understand the battle for truth that plays out for every member of planet earth. It is not combat that can be fought and won with worldly weapons. It is a war of words.<br/><br/>The game is played with each side choosing their champions.  The Enemies of the faith can choose between slick Gurus, irreverent Pagans, boastful Humanists, and wicked Fanatics.  The Defenders of the faith square off against them with wise Mentors, sharp Theologians, courageous Missionaries, and generous Stewards.<br/><br/>Game play moves through 4 distinct phases: the Draw Stage, the Activation Stage, the Encounter Stage, and the Resource Stage.  Each player uses their champion to make the best on the spot decisions through each individual phase in order to gain the edge and silence their opponent.<br/><br/>This game comes with:<br/>12 Defenders of the Faith Champion cards<br/>10 Defenders of the Faith Interject cards<br/>12 Defenders of the Faith Possession cards<br/>36 Defenders of the Faith Teaching cards<br/>12 Enemies of the Faith Champion cards<br/>15 Enemies of the Faith Interject cards<br/>14 Enemies of the Faith Possession cards<br/>29 Enemies of the Faith Teaching cards<br/>140 Square Shards<br/>2 Simplified Rules Mats<br/>1 Spiritual Warfare: LSCE Large Rules Booklet<br/>1 Spiritual Warfare: LSCE Gaming Box<br/><br/>This game can also function as a training tool in connection with Luther's Small Catechism to help students of any age learn the six chief parts of the historic, Christian faith.<br/><br/>",

A game will last 6 - 12 turns or with a variable turn system.<br/><br/>Each player is a regimental commander who controls 4 - 9 companies. All companies are color coded &amp; under command of a battalion HQ. A HQ can issue orders to three companies (three colors).

Morale of a company will vary from scenario to scenario.<br/><br/>Air-support, OB artillery, reinforcement, mines, snipers, hidden units, weather change &amp; other unexpected battlefield events will be handled by cards. Leadership will be implemented by command points &amp; cards.<br/><br/>There is also a solitaire mode in which a player will play as a fictional regimental commander who will do daily routines like refit, replace units or send units for patrol &amp; recon when there is no action. Enemy force is unknown until first contact. Your regiment will gain more &amp; better resources if you proof yourself in battle. If you see too many casualties, you may request to retreat from battlefield &amp; end the battle of the day but withdrawal request is not always permitted depending on the overall battle situation.<br/><br/>There is a battle-fatigue system. As a regiment commander, you choose which of your one/two battalions or attached companies will be upfront for attack or defense mission. The company will get one fatigue point for mission without contact and two fatigue points for contact with enemy force after each mission. A company's morale will drop by one if fatigue point is 2 or more. So you need to decide whether to send more troops upfront or call troops back for refit to remove fatigue points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ogoola Karuta is a westernized version of a 400-year-old Japanese card game called Hyakunin-isshu Karuta. The game is sometimes described as intellectual martial arts. It is about listening and being extremely focused and fast, just like the Samurai with their swords. Only here you fight with cards instead.<br/><br/>The game is comprised of two decks of cards, the Reader deck and the Player deck. Cards in the Reader deck contain short poems or poetry quotations while cards in the Player deck contain only the second part of these poems. To begin the game, a Reader is chosen (or you may opt to use the Reader app) and the players are divided into two teams sitting on opposite sides of the table or play area. The Reader shuffles the Reader deck and the Players mix, split evenly the Player deck between the teams and place them face-up in 3-4 rows in front of them. The Reader will read the complete poetry quotation on their cards and the player that finds the matching card first takes that card and puts it aside. If the card taken was on your opponent's side, you must give one card from your side to your opponent. The first team that has no cards left on their side is the winner (you must get rid of all your cards first, to win).<br/><br/>The game is set in Japan during the Genpei war (1180-1185). In order to win the war, you need a strategy. Place the cards you are familiar with close to you (in the beginning it is normal that none of the cards are familiar). If you know what cards your opponent is familiar with, place those cards as far as possible from them inside the playing field. Since the reader or app will always read the complete quotation, you do not need prior knowledge of the poems. Strategically place the playing cards in a way that you can find and take them quickly such as laying them alphabetically or categorize them under the same first words.<br/><br/>Ogoola Karuta Poetry Game is not a translation of the original Japanese game. In this first edition, we have selected 50 of the well-known classical poems written in the English language. It is the first western version of Hyakunin-isshu Karuta, which means Karuta: 100 poems by 100 poets.<br/><br/>",

Players take control of ace bounty hunters and use &quot;Command Cards&quot; to pilot their fighters across space, shoot enemies, and activate unique character abilities.<br/><br/>In multiplayer, the enemy is too much for you to overcome. Allegiances are made by necessity. But as soon as your usefulness has run out, you better watch your back! There's money to be made on these bounties and between a cold-hearted strategist, an unpredictable hot head, an infamous con artist, and a wanted backstabber, you may find your ship rammed into the path of enemy fire.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, single player features adjusted difficulty that, while manageable, makes every action count. Meticulous decision making is rewarded to earn the highest score (and bragging rights).<br/><br/>",

It takes 30 minutes to play, and players will learn their character and craft combinations to stack odds in their favor. This battle card game is in the vein of RPG video game battle systems. Rounds play out through three phases: recovery, equip, and attack. You may have to recover after an opposing attack, then you can build your team back up by adding a character to your battleground, or by supping up with upgrades. Players can have a max of three of their characters on the battleground at a time, to attack card v. card. This allows players to become familiar with their team members, and also allows for fair and balanced game play throughout.<br/><br/>The sole light in the dark zone is a beacon for those who seek knowledge, adventure, and power! Build a team of characters with unique attributes, equip them with powerful and sometimes unpredictable upgrades, and battle your way to unlock the mysteries the Pulsar Event left in it's wake.<br/><br/>",

Players&rsquo; goal is to become the Prophet and brainwash everyone into believing that the world is ending. In this mind game, Everyone starts out with the same amount of sanity points. Once your sanity points are gone, you fall into a state of madness. The player who plays the role of the Prophet will spread his prophecy(madness), and convert every other player into the state of madness, thus becoming his follower. Once he turns everyone into his follower, he wins.<br/><br/>The rest of the players need to not only keep themselves from losing their sanity but at the same time, expose the Prophet&rsquo;s lies. The player who destroys the Prophet&rsquo;s last bit of sanity will become the next the Prophet. There is no trust in this game, as anyone who fights on your side might be your enemy next round; because the only way to win the game is to become the Prophet and eliminate the nonbelievers yourself.<br/><br/>Our game features a handful of controversial historical figures that had made the significant impact through the course of the world history, whether it is good or bad. Players will be able to play the role of a historical character of their choice, use their unique ability to either fight against the Prophet or be the Prophet themselves.<br/><br/>Now stay sane, and spread the madness.<br/><br/>",

It is the only game that covers the specific battles that took place between the Schmalkaldic League of Confessors (the Lutherans) and the Catholic League (Holy Roman Empire) between the years 1532-1555. The setting of League of Confessors begins after the death of John the Steadfast as the leaders of the Augsburg Confession prepare to defend themselves against the impending armies of the Holy Roman Empire. Power and wealth will collide with conviction and courage as two leagues of heroes go to war with sword and the pen!<br/><br/>League of Confessors comes with 4 different classes of heroes.<br/><br/>Commanders &ndash; Commanders are the heroes that initially lead your entire army. They are good leaders in battle and are very versatile.<br/><br/>Generals &ndash; Generals are good leaders in battle, but that is all they will do. They can advance in their battle abilities very quickly.<br/><br/>Princes &ndash; Princes will help build the infrastructure of your expanding territory through the construction of armories, castles, or churches.<br/><br/>Confessors &ndash; Confessors do not have the ability to lead troops in battle. They are the only heroes who have the ability to publish confessional writings to convert opponents to their side.<br/><br/>The goal is to win the game by gaining seven Conquest Points. Each electorate territory is worth 1 Conquest Point (CP). The other way you can gain a CP is to fully advance a hero in their abilities. If you fully advance a hero in their abilities, you will also gain 1 CP for as long as that hero is alive. If your league has seven or more Conquest Points at the end of one of your turns, you win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Get ready to tell stories like you've never told them before. What's that? Why is this different and just not some marketing ploy? Well, I'll tell you internet friend!<br/><br/>In Everything Makes Sense, you'll be telling stories will all your friends, your family, and even your greatest enemies for story glory!<br/><br/>Games last several rounds or until THE END OF TIME ITSELF. Play until your heart's content. Play for laughs, play to win, play to tell the greatest tale. Play to understand the fundamentals of what it even means to play!<br/><br/>It's up to you.<br/><br/>We're pretty confident things will make sense, otherwise, that would just be awkward.<br/><br/>- How to play -<br/><br/>The game is simple. Each player draws two cards from the Character, Setting, and Plot decks up to a maximum hand size of (6) cards. Whenever you play a card, draw the same card type, always drawing back up to six cards.<br/><br/>The group selects a Story Stickler (judge) who reads off the Theme card, enforces any rules of that card, weights in on the direction of the story if needed, and most importantly awards the points.<br/><br/>Each player plays up to three cards per theme, playing one between the Beginning, Middle, and End of each story. The Player who goes first has the freedom to set up the story however they like, whereas the player who goes last has the power to really end with a bang.<br/><br/>The round ends when all players have played three cards between the Beginning, Middle, and End. The Story Stickler then picks whom the winner is based on whatever they liked from that story. A new Story Stickler is chosen and a new Theme is picked, giving way to a new tale.<br/><br/>Oh! I almost forgot. There's also Plot Twists that can be played anytime to override any card in the story with another card from your hand.<br/><br/>As crazy as stories can get, hopefully... Everything Makes Sense!<br/><br/>",

Each suit has 14 cards - 7 officers and 7 enlisted.<br/><br/>Each round an increasing number of mission tokens (points) become available to be claimed by the crew cards. On your turn you play ONE CARD from hand and claim all the mission tokens of that color. If the mission tokens are as yet unclaimed, you take them. If another player has already claimed them and your card outranks the one they are using to hold the tokens, you steal them from that player!<br/><br/>The deck is seeded with 7 ALERT cards and the game ends when the last one is drawn. The player with the most points accumulated from claiming job tokens is the winner and is hailed by the admiralty as the most formidable captain in the Fleet.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the introduction in the rules)<br/>You were all looking forward to your class trip. You'd spent so much time raising money so you'd be able to afford a trip to a tropical island. However, on the boat ride out you are all gassed. When you wake up some anonymous men instruct you that you will compete in a Battle Royal, where only the sole survivor will be allowed to leave the island. One by one, you get to pick up a back pack with one random item within, and leave and set out on the island. What terror!<br/>How will you survive this terrible ordeal? You open up your bag, your stomach churns at the sight of what's inside. How will you be able to survive, knowing your neither the strongest nor the smartest in the class...<br/><br/>Team Kill is a social party game of negotiation, bluffing and tactics loosely based on the Japanese movie <i>Battle Royal</i>. At the start of the game each player is dealt one card with a printed value on it (from 0 to 32). Players take turns interacting in &quot;confrontations&quot;, i.e. making a fist and simultaneously making a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Thumbs down will result in a violent confrontation where the players try to kill each other by comparing cards, eliminating the player with the lower value. Thumbs up will let players form teams, whose card values are then summed in later confrontations. Often though, one player will do a thumbs-up, while the other will do a thumbs-down. In those cases, the teaming player is instantly &quot;team killed&quot;.<br/><br/>There are only 36 cards in the game, ranging from the weak Teddy Bear, Canned Food and Ornate Fan, to the very powerful Sub Machine Gun, Automatic Rifle and Bazooka. Needless to say, the more powerful cards usually come with better odds for winning. However, the more powerful cards require the player to make a sound like &quot;bang&quot;, &quot;ra-ta-ta-tat&quot;, or &quot;kah-boom&quot; when using them, thus signaling to the rest of the players that trouble is coming.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to become the last man/woman standing in this death match on the tropical island. However, in certain circumstances two players can win together by forming a final bond of trust.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a role playing board game focused at learning and discussing the theme of collaborative economy and its relation with open digital services. In particular focuses on platform coops as an alternative crowd-sourcing model with respect to privately owned network models. A main inspiring reference is Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy by Trebor Scholz.<br/><br/>This is a board game that mixes role playing, card deck building, collaborative gameplay and transformative narrative aimed at exploring platform coops and their integration.<br/><br/>What is the object of the game? For the single Megacorp player, to acquire all the Platform Coops transforming them in its subsidiaries. For all other players, who play as Platform Coops, to earn 5 happiness points. Players can decide whether the game ends as soon as one Platform Coop reaches their goal, or all are required to reach the 5 happiness points.<br/><br/>How is it won or lost? Players win when they reach their goal.<br/><br/>What do players do in their turns? Each player picks a new card which goes in their hand, and also may play a card as a new service of the coop or Megacorp. Each player has then to pay taxes and compute earnings, which are determined by the cards that they have played. For coop players, the effects of the cards of their deck are integrated with those of the shared service which require all coops subscription to become effective.<br/><br/>The game is available as print and play, all materials available on Github with the rules. On Youtube there is a how-to-play video.<br/><br/><br/>",

Who is your friend, and who is planning on stabbing you tonight?<br/>Ask questions, collect items, and attack other partygoers to accomplish your hidden agenda before anyone else. Blend in while figuring out your fellow partygoers&rsquo; hidden agendas before it&rsquo;s too late!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player gets a card with their secret role and hidden agenda. Attending the party are The Host, The BFF, The Trickster, and The Hitman. Everyone, except the Hitman, is also informed of the Host&rsquo;s profession on their Role Card. <br/>The Host&rsquo;s agenda is to figure out who the Hitman is and to kill them. <br/>The BFF&rsquo;s agenda is to help and protect the Host. <br/>The Trickster&rsquo;s agenda is to attack or get attacked a total of seven times. <br/>The Hitman&rsquo;s agenda is to figure out the Host&rsquo;s profession, or to kill them.<br/>While in the same room, players may ask each other yes/no questions to discern information about the Host&rsquo;s profession, revealing who the Hitman is based on incorrect answers. Players explore the house and collect items upon entering an empty room. Items can be used to help gather information, attack other players, or replenish lost Health.<br/>Whoever accomplishes their hidden agenda first, wins the game.<br/><br/>Killer Dinner is a party game that will create a new social dynamic each time it&rsquo;s played. A great number of Host&rsquo;s professions and the random role allocation, makes every game different. Due to the social aspect and asking questions the game is a good opportunity to get to know your fellows players better!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designers<br/><br/>",

To the surprise and admiration of their fellows, two officers, like insane artists trying to gild refined gold or paint the lily, pursued a private contest through the years of universal carnage.&quot;<br/><br/>-Joseph Conrad, The Duel: Point of Honor, 1908<br/><br/>The Duel: Point of Honor is a two player tactical card game that offers a fast-paced tactical experience. The game highlights elements of dueling culture, sword-fighting, and the discipline of martial arts.<br/><br/>You are a robotic soldier in a life-long rivalry. Every few years, you meet your opponent to test your skill and to preserve your honor. In each game, opponents will participate in multiple duels to earn the most Prestige while managing to stay alive in the process. Each duel will be a choice when and how to attack your opponent in the most efficient manner. Players will then have the opportunity to evolve their play to surprise their opponents in later rounds with newfound tactics and attacks.<br/><br/>Duel players will challenge each other with subtle but impactful decisions within this ten-minute card game. The game is enacted through a series of escalating duels fought between the players. In each duel, players will earn Prestige by dealing damage and playing faster timing cards than their opponent.<br/><br/>Each duel consists of three rounds of combat, divided into two phases: Timing Phase and Action Phase. In the Timing Phase, players simultaneously choose a card from their hand to bid on turn order. In the Action Phase, players will play cards to try to win the duel. After each duel, players earn prestige and can gain better cards from the Advanced Techniques Deck. At the end of a duel, if a player has earned 7 Prestige, the game is over and the player with the most Prestige wins!<br/><br/>The art and graphic design of the game captures the look and feel of renaissance era aristocracy. And the game's illustrations evokes the grace and intelligence of sword-fighting... but also robots.<br/><br/>",

Witness these lumbering juggernauts tear each other apart for your amusement! Do you have what it takes to win the belt?!<br/><br/>The most advanced mechs in the world compete every week in the Mech Combat League. Soaring arenas glitter from a million cameras as lethal machines tear each other apart. Each combatant costs millions of dollars and represents the very pinnacle of corporate technology. Fortunes rise and fall on the results as a win in the arena demonstrates the superiority of a corporation&rsquo;s technology. Billions of fans sit riveted every Saturday and spend all of their money and time on the fights. It&rsquo;s the cultural phenomena of the century!<br/><br/>But this isn&rsquo;t the Mech Combat League. This is the Wreck-A-Mech Minor League where scrappy mechanics will rig together a Mech out of anything they can find in the junkyard. They meet at local events, take photos with grass roots fans and then bash each other to bits. Any part that isn&rsquo;t completely destroyed is fished out of the mud and retooled into next week&rsquo;s combatant. Nobody ever said getting to the big leagues was easy.<br/><br/>Wreck-A-Mech is a deck building card game where players assemble the best mech (mechanized combatant) possible from the cards in their hand. Then combat ensues and the mechs knock each other to pieces! Cause as much damage as possible to your opponent because the more you wreck, the more spare parts you can buy. Then draw from your new parts and improve your mech for the next round. Keep fighting until you knock your opponent out 3 times!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prelude to War: Europe 1936-1939 is a detailed historical simulation game, for three players, that recreates the political, diplomatic and military maneuvering that preceded the outbreak of the Second World War.<br/><br/>The players take on the roles of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Western democracies of France and the United Kingdom.<br/>They advance their goals through diplomacy, intimidation, agitation, appeasement, pacts, economic warfare, rearmament, minor country dispute arbitration, multilateral conferences, political consolidation... The German and Soviet factions may also conduct territorial annexations, partitions, or military invasions.<br/><br/>The game is card-assisted but not card-driven. The design postulate is one of rigorous historical accuracy, and explores in great detail the chain of events that lead to the pivotal international crises, the inner workings behind their resolution and the various aspects of their consequences, as well as the prominent domestic issues faced by each faction.<br/><br/>The diplomatic wrangling and muscle-flexing between the major powers is translated into a &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; mechanism where players stake national pride and international credibility until one side caves in, or the escalation culminates in a final &ldquo;test of nerves&rdquo; that determines the victor. The resolution of these challenges does not involve any dice rolling and is essentially a mind game based on bluff and risk-management: the higher the escalation, the greater the cost for the loser (in terms of international prestige, national self-confidence, and support at home for the regime). Cards and hidden chits provide a realistic degree of uncertainty and limited intelligence.<br/><br/>Turns are seasonal, counter density is very low, the action is fast-paced and very interactive.<br/><br/>A detailed, historically contextualized After Action Report can be found on the game's page on the Legion Wargames website.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The British player can build laboratories and barracks, move armies across different countries, ask for the help of politicians and military leaders and even call the mighty Thunderchild!<br/><br/>The other player will control the cruel Martians.

Battles are played in a fast and tactical way. Each troop has a different combat value, based on its speed and its fire power. When an army recieves damage, the general can distribute it between their men... but, beware! A destroyed unit can't retaliate!<br/><br/>The British will rely in their courage and bigger numbers.

A man leaves behind marks that associate his name with symbol of either admiration or hatred.<br/><br/>Number of players: The design of this mystic game based on Eastern History where 1-6 players act as heir to the throne.

By giving in the player becomes an underdog, and hunts down his fellow players.<br/>The board shows an ancient carpet with original eastern features and players take turns rolling dice on 18x6 grid to conquer six different thrones.<br/>Six different Characters, particularly different Tiles and their relationships define the game as a rule-based system specifying what there is, how the player can interact with them. Points are awarded for collecting sets of thrones, and in the end of final set the player with the most points becomes the winner. <br/>Eastern Mystery uses simple rules, but involves various tasks such as &ldquo;Open Sesame&rdquo; &ldquo;Flying carpet&rdquo;, &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jinnee&rdquo; our famous figure: which is very curious about all and interested in your curiosity as well! The more you play the more nuances you will discover.

Be the first to build your horde and bask in the ultimate glory of awesome victory. Sounds easy, but your opponents will not just stand by and let you win. No, they want to block and quarantine your precious horde, so they must be defeated at all costs. It's a life and death struggle that only the greatest, coolest and super nice will survive.<br/>     Gameplay mainly involves turn-based drawing and playing cards. Players start and grow their horde by placing cards of the same color in numerical sequence one through ten, but other players will attempt to hinder their progress by blocking, curing, and quarantining. There is even a Zomb-Fish card which allows you to steal a card from another player. The game usually intensifies as one player gets closer and closer to completing their horde, which usually ramps up the &ldquo;take that&rdquo; element of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pack of Crooks is a semi-cooperative deckbuilding card game with a twist. Work as a team to pull off heists, then fight for the loot!<br/><br/>In Pack of Crooks, players are crooks who are working to complete jobs and collect loot. <br/>To successfully complete jobs, you will need to work with a bunch of other crooks. <br/>Your objective is to finish the game with the most loot.<br/><br/>To do this, you will need to purchase tool cards to build your own personal deck. <br/>You will then use the cards in your hand to defeat the security in each room and negotiate for your share of the loot.<br/><br/>To beat each security card, players must play tool cards of the same color to equal or higher value. <br/>For example, a Vault is a purple security card with a value of 20. Players will need to combine 20 points of purple tool cards. <br/>Players will need to negotiate to decide who will defeat each room card, and how the loot will be split. The combination of players that can play the most points wins.<br/><br/>The game is finished when all jobs are complete. Players should count their loot. <br/>Their tool cards are also worth the value they were purchased for. <br/>Cards from a player&rsquo;s starting hand have no value.<br/>The winner is the player with the highest total.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/> A Glimpse of Luna (GoL) is a collectible card game that connects two worlds - the physical and the digital. Based on a fantasy world of our own creation, the collectible cards can be played in the traditional sense at a table but can also be brought to life digitally. Playing and trading cards is possible on both interconnected platforms. A glimpse of Luna is a 2-player strategical trading card game that combines new elements like movement, range and troop strength into the TCG/CCG genre.<br/><br/>You start by choosing one of the available races and then you build your deck.  It is not possible to use different races in your deck. Each race has diverse types of playable character-cards. The highlights are certainly the heroes and guardians, which both play an important role in this game. The game is played by turns. Each player starts with 3 fight moral points. The ultimate goal is to destroy all of your opponents fight moral. This can be achieved in three different ways:<br/><br/><br/>     Destroy your opponents hero (-1 fight moral point)<br/>     Destroy your opponents guardian (-1 fight moral point)<br/>     Destroy 5 character-cards of your opponent (-1 fight moral point) &ndash; multiple times possible<br/><br/><br/>We created this game with the basic principle &bdquo;Easy to LEARN, Hard to MASTER&ldquo;. A Glimpse of Luna&rsquo;s basic mechanics are simple to learn and by gaining experience you are exploring, learning and mastering many new strategies. It was our objective to create a game with mechanics, that feels similar to a real battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

With Pirate crews being formed from people of all walks of life, riches are won with witts, sword and flintlock and losses are counted in blood.  All of the trade of the entire world is up for grabs with opportunity for wealth all around, if you know how to go out and get it, and you do not mind getting bloody.<br/><br/>With the seas teetering on the brink of total anarchy, the mainland have ordered their ships to capture and kill any pirates they find.  The coastland offers exciting and dangerous opportunities with the ships that navigate these waters.  The Pirate Captains, heroes, defy the mainland.  Plundering is their trade and their only means to grow their reputations and fortunes.  Each Captain is a force of nature themselves.  Powerful, cunning and resourceful they are the only ones that can tame these wild places on the fringes of the empire and make them their own.<br/><br/>Dangers lay ahead for any Captain and crew that sales these waters.  The seas and their islands are ever-changing with untold riches and horrors awaiting anyone on their shores.  Mysterious Islands, lost wrecks, dangerous encounters, and supernatural creatures.<br/><br/>The greatest danger of all may not be the seas or the mainland, but other Pirates.  Each Captain and crew seek their own wealth, even at the cost of your own fortune and lives.  Making alliances can often beneficial, but keeping one eye on all of the Captains is the best strategy.<br/><br/>Can you roll dice with fortune and death?  Can you stare down the elements, natural and unnatural and make a name for yourself in the shadows of an all-powerful mainland empire?  Your chance to be infamous, free, and rich awaits with us all on the seas.<br/><br/>To win at Avast! players recruit crews, strategically gather resources, complete Pirate jobs and fight to gather a reputation, and become the Pirate King.

Each of the five were once champions of their race before transcending from mortals to demigods while on a quest to destroy the gods of old.<br/><br/>Their quest was bestowed upon them at The Gathering, a time when the major races of Athien came together to select five among them, so they could travel to the plane of shadow and stop the meddling of the old gods. The orcs and dwarfs nominated their most respected spiritual leaders, Krognar and Bruell to guide the five. The Elves and Minotaurs nominated their most powerful mage, Ista, and warrior Grul, to challenge the gods. By consensus the humans provided their greatest knight, Tomas, to provide leadership for the company.<br/><br/>As one of the Everlasting, you summon heroes from the mortal world of Athien to the shadow plane (Between), so they can harvest souls at your behest. Souls that give you power and sustain your immortality. This is the game of Judgement.<br/><br/>Judgement brings all the elements of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) video game genre to the table top. Powerful, diverse and fun heroes, neutral monsters, magical items and hero levels. These ingredients provide a truly amazing gaming experience like no other miniature game on the market.

        "description": "Retro Gaming Cards! is a card game inspired by the aesthetics and functionality of the first 80's PC games. Do you want to know how it works? Keep on reading!<br/><br/>Hand out a Reference card to each player and remove the remaining Reference cards out of the deck. After that, shuffle the deck, hand out every card facing up and making equal rows, and wait for 30s. During this period, players should try to memorize the position of the cards, paying special attention to their patterns and symbols. Once time has passed, turn over the cards in the exact same order.<br/> In their turn, players must take two cards and try to match them according to the rules explained in the Types of cards section. If they can make a pair, players collect both matching cards and put them in their deck. If they can not make a pair, players must leave the cards facing up. In both cases,the turn will pass to the next player. When there are no more pairs to make, the game will be over. The winner will be the player with the biggest amount of cards in his deck after the game has finished!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is a relaxed and relaxing game, where enough depends on the turn of a card and the roll of a handful of dice to say that our disasters are pure chance, but enough cunning decision-making to claim our victories as acts of brilliant generalship.<br/><br/>Our model soldiers are very brave, obedient, and generally do what we want them to. Players are expected to behave in a friendly manner, and conduct themselves as gentlemen (or ladies, as is appropriate).

Each player will attempt to kill the opponents Emperor to claim the throne and win the game. This is done by moving their pawns into the opponent's emperor space in the center of the board.<br/><br/>During each turn, a player will choose a pawn to move to an adjacent open slot. Then they choose to either rotate a ring of the board, place a dragon cylinder to block an opponent or forfeit their secondary action, which removes the rotation tracker from the board. If the player chooses to rotate the ring that their pawn has entered or the center ring, they must mark which direction they rotated the ring by placing the rotation tracker on it. This blocks the next player from undoing the rotation that was just completed.<br/><br/>Each player plans their movements, but find that the grounds beneath them are always shifting, forcing them to plan their movements even more carefully.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A boat tile goes in that empty space and each player puts one of their work meeple onto the boat.<br/><br/>Over 12 rounds players will rotate as first player which allows them to move the boat either horizontally or vertically along the grid, shifting the icebergs when them move the boat.<br/><br/>Each iceberg has an action that a player can choose to take to help them gain or convert their resources as needed.  If a player has enough resources they may upgrade one of the current buildings on the icebergs to gain points. They do this on their turn by choosing the upgrade action or by upgrading a building adjacent to the boat by paying the appropriate cost (combination of water, wood and coins). Then the player will flip that iceberg over to show the upgraded building and new actions available.<br/><br/>The winner is the player at the end of 12 rounds with the most victory points and they will get the KEY TO ICEBURGH!<br/>​<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Army of Flanders is the thirteenth volume in Red Sash Games&rsquo; Lace Wars series. This game is the third in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or<br/>the Nine Years War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV. As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand<br/>France&rsquo;s borders. That was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson<br/>on the throne of Spain. Despite the King&rsquo;s ultimate aim, that was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis&rsquo; war of middle age &ndash; a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men.<br/><br/>In Army of Flanders, you will have a chance to change history &ndash; and even if you cannot, perhaps you can win enough glory to<br/>write your name in the history books. Flanders is the source of Gloire, and the graveyard of reputations.<br/><br/>As the French, will you pursue an offensive or a defensive strategy? The French Army is state-of-the-art. You have more artillery, the latest equipment (bayonets instead of pikes), and acess to an administrative machine capable of supporting nearly 500,000 men. But you are under the eye of Versailles, only a couple of day&rsquo;s ride from the front. You are merely an extension of the King&rsquo;s will. If his reputation needs patching up, expect to be ordered to lay siege to some massive fortress. At least you will have the resources. But, if the King decides to pursue diplomacy, you will have to secure and &lsquo;rationalise&rsquo; the frontier. If you fail, you will lose the respect of the Sun King and the Court ladies. IF you disobey&hellip; it does not bear thinking about.<br/><br/>As the Allied commander you lead a motley collection of troops: Dutch, British, Spanish, German, Huguenot, and even the not<br/>inconsiderable army of Li&egrave;ge. The Germans want to pursue a Rhine strategy. The Spanish want to hunker down and let the Dutch<br/>do all the fighting. The British Isles are still being subjugated by the Prince of Orange, though much of the populace supports him.In the early years it will be enough to hold the line. Later, hopefully, the enemy will run out of steam and you can pay him back in his own coin!<br/><br/>Like the other games in the series, Army of Flanders focuses on the operational art rather than tactics or grand strategy. You are the theatre commander, subject to dictates from on high and only partially able to guide the action. Your main goal is to acquire Prestige. Your playing pieces represent battalions and regiments, which you must deploy wisely, deciding how strong to make your garrisons, and how many units to group into mobile formations for attack or defence. These formations are commanded by Leaders, rated for their skill and their temperament (and their political pull), and assisted by Auxiliaries. These last are specialists such as grenadiers and pioneers. Once you are organised, be sure you pick the right time to fight. You have a large army, but it is not infinite! The combat system has a tactical feel, addressing the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Sieges depend on good planning. Screen your besieging army with another to keep the enemy at bay and make sure you have lots of siege guns and sappers. Supply is critical. You can live of the land, but it is safer to build a string of dep&ocirc;ts. Operational tempo is driven by the accumulation of &lsquo;operations points&rsquo;, which must be expended in order to act aggressively. A player may have the Initiative for a while and dictate the pace of the game, but eventually, he will run out of steam and have to pause to accumulate more points.<br/><br/>Special rules in Army of Flanders deal with the imposition of<br/>strategy from above, the discord of allies, the War of the Two<br/>Kings in Ireland, and the campaigning along the Moselle Valley, which was the highway to the Rhine, just off the map.<br/><br/>The game ends when peace breaks out &ndash; something you have little control over &ndash; so be sure to acquire Prestige as fast as you can!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A lone howl rises above the surrounding trees. It's faint but he can hear it. The long, cold nights have not diminished the bull elk's wariness. Too many winters have come and gone and the scent of wolf on the air is undeniable. The clearing ahead could provide much-needed food, but it's best not to linger. As his path leads closer to the edge of the forest, a pair of unseen eyes shine in the moonlight following each step, aware of the large antlers. She&rsquo;s low and down wind, invisible to the lumbering elk. The rest of the pack draws near waiting for her lead. There&rsquo;s danger in such a large prize but hunger drives every decision. Now is the moment. Another howl rises.<br/><br/>The Wild North is a two-player asymmetric game simulating the everyday struggle between predator and prey in the northern Rocky Mountain ranges. Whether you&rsquo;re a herd of elk searching for greener pastures or the wolf pack after the scent of a straggler, each player will feel the tense conflict that arises when these species clash. Survival is at stake.<br/><br/>A game is played over three rounds called years and each year is made up of four phases called seasons. Within each season prey and predators will play cards and work towards survival by increasing their range. At the end of each year range is determined and whichever species has the largest range after the third year wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The book provides comprehensive coverage of the clashes between the United States Navy and North Vietnam&rsquo;s Peoples Air Force between 1965 and 1968 during Operation Rolling Thunder with four campaigns, a mini-campaign and 28 scenarios. The scenarios can be played individually, linked to form campaigns, or combined as one grand campaign. The campaigns cover the battles that occurred during the annual southern monsoon fighting season.  The missions changed during the course of Rolling Thunder, so each campaign is different.<br/><br/>The first campaign 1965: Hard Lessons Relearned covers the initial battles between the USN and VPAF and the failures of initial tactics and weapons at the start of Rolling Thunder.<br/><br/>The second campaign 1966: The Grind covers the period where the operational failure of Rolling Thunder&rsquo;s restrictions became clear to the men fighting even as their weapons and tactics improved, the skill of the VPAF improved as well.<br/><br/>The third campaign 1967: The Gloves Come Off covers the period where many of Rolling Thunder&rsquo;s restrictions were lifted, large strikes on VPAF airfields and the push to destroy the VPAF. Included within this campaign period is the mini-campaign &ldquo;A Birthday Gift for Uncle Ho&rdquo; covering the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s audacious mission to deliver Walleye glide bombs to a power plant in downtown Hanoi, and the running air battle that ensued.<br/><br/>The fourth campaign 1968: The End of the Beginning covers the period post Tet Offensive, the US ended their operations over the heart of North Vietnam, and thereby created a safe haven for VPAF MiGs North of the 19th Parallel. The VPAF began to sweep south and with bait and killer teams, and the Navy had to change tactics again, counter to these attacks till the end of Operation Rolling Thunder.<br/><br/>HISTORICAL RESEARCH: The book includes a sections containing historical background, the training, tactics and weapons of each side, an annotated bibliography for further reading, a color scheme guide, and a campaign map.<br/><br/>AIRCRAFT STATISTICS and CAMPAIGN INFORMATION: The book contains aircraft statistics for 14 US and Soviet-built aircraft and their variants in Check Your 6 Jet Age  format for use in the scenarios.

        "description": "Each player is the leader of a clan of Dwarves returning to a lost mountain kingdom. Players are competing with each other to remove threats, find artifacts, complete tasks, and earn honor. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game becomes the new King of the reclaimed mountain.<br/><br/>It is fundamentally a worker placement game, but with many rules that increase player interaction. Players compete to recruit four different worker types as they also compete to utilize locations before their opponents.<br/><br/>The board is made up of 20 halls, semi-randomly placed at the start of the game. The top 8 halls were undefended, but the lower 12 halls have threats that must be cleared before they can be accessed.<br/><br/>Each hall has one or two labors that can be performed in them. Each labor requires a particular type of dwarf, and often will require a team of dwarves plus other resources to be completed. Each labor offers its own rewards, from honor or gold, or mine cards, or artifacts, or retaining more dwarves to a players palace.<br/><br/>A particular labor can only be used from one to four times a year, so players are competing to use use labors before each other. Because labors have different requirements to complete, they are also competing to gather the types of dwarves needed for the labors they want to perform.<br/><br/>There are four kinds of dwarves: Workers, Warriors, Craftsmen, and Nobles. They are generally used for the kinds of labors one might expect from their names.<br/><br/>Unlike most worker placement games, the players do not have their own pieces. There are common pools of dwarves available, and the players take or assign dwarves from those common pools. One pool is a hall called The Commons, which has dwarves ready to work in them. Players can use one dwarf from The Commons on each of their turns. Dwarves are also in The Camp outside of the mountain, recovering or resting until  players recruit them to their palaces.<br/><br/>Play goes around the table, with players selecting a labor they want to perform in a hall, or a threat they want to remove. When a threat is removed, the hall it guarded is revealed and the player effectively gets a free turn to be the first to perform a labor in the hall.<br/><br/>Players can obtain mine cards that will have either gold, iron, gems or mithril. Gold is turned in immediately, while the other three are kept secret until they are used to complete a labor or a task.<br/><br/>There are also Tasks which the players can complete to earn victory points, which generally require four or five resources.<br/><br/>Artifacts may be gained in several ways, and provide victory points as well as the opportunity to attract a dwarf from the Camp when it is revealed. They are a way to hide your possible activities from your opponents.<br/><br/>The game is played in five segments, each representing a year, though players can agree to shorter games by reducing the number of years played. A year ends when The Commons is empty of Dwarves and a player passes. That player will be the first player for the following year. Then the dwarves out in the halls return to The Commons to be available for the next year.<br/><br/>Many of the threats have year-end effects that can remove dwarves from The Commons, remove them from the players' palaces, take gold or mine cards, re-close halls, or even remove a hall from the game.<br/><br/>Players are also determining what kind of values the reclaimed kingdom will be known for. There are four Dwarven virtues - Military, Craft, Wealth, and Heritage. Players can promote these virtues by completing Tasks and performing Labors. The most promoted virtues can earn players bonus points at the end of the game for each Task they completed or Artifact they acquired associated with those virtues.<br/><br/>The combination of randomly placed hidden halls and randomly placed threats with varying effects provides an enormous amount of replayability. Players need to consider the kinds of labors and threats that are present when devising their plans, as well as what dwarves are available in The Commons.<br/><br/>It is a victory point gathering game. There are six ways to earn VP:<br/>Rewards for a Labor<br/>Completing a Task<br/>Acquiring Artifacts<br/>Clearing Threats<br/>Bonus points for clearing the most threats <br/>Bonus Points for matching Tasks and Artifacts to the most promoted Dwarven Virtues<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Individuals no longer struggle with self-worth, self-image and self-concept and thereby are no longer competitive nature. Individuals no longer struggle to comprehend the abundant, endless nature of the universe and its resources, and thereby no longer feel the need to fight or go to war over resources or an inward sense of lacking.<br/><br/>In this world devoid of competition with each other, there is still a desire to achieve great works for the sheer joy of it. Individuals practice absolute focus, mastery of every part of their body, precision, emotional clarity, strength of compassion, intuitive guidance, and tests of logic. After mastering these subjects in their first forty to eighty years of life, individuals move on to more advanced lessons: telepathy, levitation, full grokking of other beings, enmeshment with animals and plants, energetic biological influence, and direct manifestation (without the waiting period).<br/><br/>The acolytes in the game represent six areas of study that are of great interest in this era: three areas from the study of earth and three areas from ether. You can read more about the setting in the manual which is available as a free PDF download.<br/><br/>[Gameplay]<br/><br/>Each turn you collect resources from your lands and acolytes, tracking them on your abacus. Then you spend as many resources as you wish to acquire more lands, acolytes, and technologies. Collect lilies to win. (With the Adventuring Acolytes expansion you have an ulterior motive &ndash; a hidden win condition unique to you.)<br/><br/>The game uses a mechanic called &quot;splaying&quot; where cards overlap one another to create different effects depending on which direction the cards are &quot;splayed.&quot; Acolytes reside within Arcania (buildings) where they study and work. Acolytes who are apprentices are splayed to the right, revealing a single resource of their specialty. Technologies allow acolytes to further their advancement, changing which way they splay, and thereby how many resources they provide.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shipwrecked with strangers in the middle of the ocean, with scarce resources and even scarcer trust in each other. As tension rises and starvation sets in, your companions may be more inclined to throw you overboard to make rations last longer. All while mother nature is doing her best to ensure that no one is returning home. Calenture is a social deduction-game in which you have to gather your collective resources to keep the crew alive. But who can you trust when the food turns up spoiled and nobody seems to know where the gun has gone?<br/><br/>More in-depth:<br/><br/>Calenture's playtime is 20-40 minutes and the game includes mechanics such as hidden agendas, resource and card management, random event cards, bluffing and player elimination. Some players will be in it for themselves while others are protectors or saboteurs. You win the game by fulfilling your agenda which most of the time also involves surviving. The game ends when all the players are either dead or rescued. There can be multiple winners or even no winners at all. When the players reach the bottom of the event deck they will get a chance to be rescued, but there will not always be room for all of them.<br/><br/>Players will draw cards from a deck of items. It can be food, weapons and other items that can help or hinder the survival of the group.<br/><br/>The game will throw random events at you, most of the time it involves a challenge that will need to be overcome or something that reveals information about the players. Maybe a storm hits that throws a random card out of the hands of all the players, maybe someone gets to look at the hand of another player and steal a card or just maybe a shark will attack and threaten to eat someone unless they either bribe it with food or hunt it away with the gun. Frequently the event cards will trigger starvation, when this happens the group will contribute item cards to feed the group. But you can contribute as much or as little as you like and the cards will be face down and shuffled so it will be harder to know who put in what. There are no restrictions on what items can be contributed and cards like rat-poison that spoils the food exists.<br/><br/>The game features both a lot of opportunities to be sneaky and manipulative as well as giving the players tools to get information on their fellow players intentions. If a saboteur is caught the group can vote to throw them overboard if they have the majority so it is of utmost importance to know when to lay low and when to strike.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.<br/><br/>Each player has a flight of four bombers, represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &ldquo;performance rulers&rdquo; that represent the aircraft&rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed<br/><br/>Each performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.<br/><br/>TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.<br/><br/>Each aircraft is sold separately.  Only pay for the ones you want, and print out as many copies as you need to create your own epic WWII air battle.<br/><br/>The B-29 Superfortress performed strategic bombing of Japan's factories and infrastructure.  A pressurized cockpit reduced crew fatigue, allowing long flights over the ocean.  The Superfortress featured heavy defensive armament and a massive bomb load.<br/><br/>This set is a self-contained rulebook with miniatures for the B-29 Superfortress and four scenarios that reference other aircraft:<br/><br/>     Target 357: At high altitudes, Ki-84 Franks  intercept B-29s inbound to the Nakajima engine plant in Tokyo.<br/>     Thumper:  A lone B-29 tries to escape a lone Ki-61<br/>     Firestorm: B-29s drop incendiary bombs on Tokyo at night. Defending Ki-84 depend on spotlights to illuminate the bombers.<br/>     Target 357 Again: The capture of Iwo Jima allows P-51D Mustangs to escort B-29s, while Ki-61s protect the factory complex.<br/><br/><br/>This set contains miniatures for the B-29, along a city target,  flak templates, spotlight templates, illumination markers, and and hit markers.  The other aircraft must be purchased separately.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Royal Navy of Great Britain was the world&rsquo;s greatest navy at the outbreak of the Second World War. However, Britain went to war with mainly First World War-vintage vessels. Since the Royal Navy already possessed many powerful units, construction of the most modern designs was limited. This meant that at the outbreak of World War Two Britain had far more battleships than most other nations, but they had smaller guns than those built to the most modern ships.<br/><br/>Though the main battle force was kept concentrated in home waters, task forces were assigned to many distant areas, but the Royal Navy could not be strong everywhere. Although badly stretched, the Royal Navy lived up to its traditional &lsquo;can do!&rsquo; ethos, fighting hard in all theatres.<br/><br/>In addition to the battleship forces, the Royal Navy maintained a handful of fast battlecruisers &ndash; some of them quite old &ndash; and aircraft carriers. These were backed up by a strong cruiser force and light forces including destroyers, motor torpedo boats (MTBs) and motor gunboats (MGBs).<br/><br/>As the war went on, aircraft carriers became increasingly important and air defences were steadily improved on all ships. Yet the big guns of the battleships and cruisers played a vital role in many theatres of war. British capital ships saw action in the Arctic and the Atlantic against German commerce raiders, in the Mediterranean against Italian forces, and ventured into the Pacific in an ill-fated attempt to stem the Japanese advance. Though the great fleet actions planned for and desired by the architects of the Royal Navy did not materialise during World War Two, the Royal Navy adapted well to the war it was destined to fight and emerged with great honour.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>8 Model Ships<br/>  ‣ 1 HMS Eagle 1940<br/>  ‣ 1 HMS Duke of York 1943<br/>  ‣ 1 HMS Neptune 1941<br/>  ‣ 1 HMS Belfast 1942<br/>  ‣ 1 HMS Dido 1940<br/>  ‣ 3 Tribal-class Destroyers<br/>4 Fairey Swordfish Flights<br/>Ship Cards<br/>Damage Sliders<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HMS Warspite was a Queen Elizabeth-class battleship of the Royal Navy. Built during the early 1910s, she served in the First World War, including at the Battle of Jutland. Modernized in the 1930s, she went on to serve in the Second World War.<br/><br/>Warspite was part of the Norwegian campaign of 1940 and subsequently was transferred to the Mediterranean, squaring off in fleet actions against the Italian Regia Marina. During the Battle of Crete in mid-1941 she suffered damage from enemy German aircraft and spent 6 months under repair in the US. These repairs were completed shortly after US entry into the war, and she set sail across the Pacific to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in early 1942.<br/><br/>She returned home in 1943 to provide gunfire support as part of Force H in the Italian campaign. She again suffered damage, this time at the hand of radio-controlled glider bombs, during the landings at Salerno. She spent almost another year under repair as a result.<br/><br/>Before her repairs were fully completed, she was back at sea, providing fire support the next year, supporting the Normandy landings and on Walcheren Island in 1944. These actions earned her the recognition of being the ship with the most battle honours in the history of the Royal Navy, and also accorded her the affectionate nickname, the &quot;Grand Old Lady&quot;.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Model Ship<br/>  ‣ HMS Warspite<br/>1 Ship Card<br/>Damage Sliders<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
