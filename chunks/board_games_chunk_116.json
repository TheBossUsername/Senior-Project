        "description": "A roll &amp; move style game based on the US Presidential election process.<br/><br/>Players move around a large board attempting to win a party nomination, then gain newspaper, TV and radio promotions, then finally win a &quot;majority&quot; of states which is defined as 15 or 20 states depending on the number of players (there are no electoral votes in this game).<br/><br/>Most of the play centres on the use of a &quot;percentage&quot; die which is a six sided die with 20%, 30%, 40%, 70%, 80% and 90% printed on it.  Nominations and states are won by rolling more than 50% on this die with no other modifiers (i.e. there is always a 50-50 chance of winning or losing a given contest).  Every time the die is rolled, the player must stake money to do so, and if a loss occurs the money is lost to the bank or opponent when challenging for an already-owned state.<br/><br/>Players have a supply of map markers equal to the number of states they must win (15 or 20) and must leave one of these as a deposit with the bank if they take out a loan; therefore it is impossible to win with loans outstanding but as loans are repaid with interest it is necessary to defeat opponents who challenge for your states and therefore end up paying you the money they stake.<br/><br/>Interestingly the game defines the Aleutian Islands as one of the &quot;states&quot; to be won, in addition to the 50 usual states (the District of Columbia is not treated as a state, unlike many similar games).<br/><br/>",

All lines must contain tiles in which the colors are either all the same OR all different, AND the shapes are also either all the same or all different. There are also shape-specific Wild tiles which can represent any color, and color-specific Wild tiles which can represent any shape. In addition, there are 2 Q!nto tiles which can represent any shape in any color. Instead of adding tiles to the grid, a player may use his/her turn to swap tiles from his/her hand for already played Wild tiles, as long as they work in that position. Q!nto can be played a few different ways. In Q!nto Classic, players keep score. Q!nto Plus allows players to count valid diagonal lines of 3 or more tiles. In Q!nto Light, the tiles are divided evenly among the players who then race to get rid of all their tiles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In WWI: The Tug of War, two players compete in a very light, fast-playing game of dice-rolling and battle, as all the major countries involved in &ldquo;The Great War&rdquo; are slowly and inexorably tugged into the conflict. Game turns quickly become combat events, with the outcome in doubt and usually dependent on the entrance of the United States into the fray, ending a long and bitter back-and-forth stalemate.<br/><br/>The active player always rolls two red dice. He/she will roll one or more four white dice along with the two red dice after he has cards with at least three dice icons, rounded down, in front of him. At the start of the game each player has a card with a half-die in front of him. He or she will therefore need to get cards into the war with two-and-a-half more dice icons to be able to roll a total of three dice (two red and one white).<br/><br/>If the red dice total matches the entry number of one of your nation&rsquo;s cards it enters the war and its dice icon(s) will be available to you on your next turn. To score a hit (i.e., win a battle), you must roll a 5 or 6 on a white die. If you do, move the token one space toward you on the Tug of War track. Move the token to your &quot;Win&quot; space and you win the game.<br/><br/>Sometimes you'll have to choose between the red and white dice result, and when one player can roll all six dice, the end of game sequence will trigger.<br/><br/>Not my best work. I wish I could get BGG to remove it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Big Time Hoops is a fast-playing, card-based simulation of professional basketball for two players. To recreate the flow of the game and remove &quot;housekeeping&quot; altogether, the game eschews individual cards for basketball players and focuses exclusively on the major action elements of the sport.<br/><br/>In general, you'll hold a hand of three cards, most of which will be offensive in nature. You'll play one of them, choosing to pass the ball or drive to the basket; each card will result in a shot attempt with a varying degree of success. Then you'll roll a die. If the shot fails, the card states which side gets the rebound. (Yes, three-point shots are in the game.)<br/><br/>Your opponent can play a defensive card, and when used wisely he'll steal a pass, block a shot or foul your shooter.<br/><br/>Simulating realistic scoring requires a delicate balance in a sport where each team averages 100 points per game. Rest assured that you'll find it here, as the number of two-pointers, three-pointers and foul shots will be very close to their actual real-life averages each and every game.<br/><br/>Playable in an hour, Big Time Hoops will provide all the fun and excitement of real pro basketball -- without the high ticket prices!<br/><br/>",

Place all the cards facing down on a table or floor so that no card is touching another. The youngest player goes first by turning over 2 cards at random. If they match identically, ie 2 satchels, that player takes them and may then turn over 2 more cards. If the pairs don't match, they are turned face down again and the next player continues in the same way. If any player turns over an ODLAW card that player must shout ODLAW!, take the ODLAW card, then shuffle all the remaining cards in play so that no one can remember the position of any cards. The player who collects the most matching pairs wins!<br/><br/>This memory game contains 54 Jumbo cards with easy rules for even the youngest of players.

The games are introductory in level and complexity, designed for fun and competitive play, while also depicting the history of the battles. This first volume in the series depicts the battles of Leuctra and Mantineia.<br/><br/>After the Peloponnesian War, Sparta was the uncontested military leader of the Greek poleis. For almost three decades the Spartans were considered nearly invincible in an open field battle due to the strength and tactical organization of their hoplites.<br/><br/>Beginning in 378 BC a coalition of cities from the northern part of Greece, led by Athens and Thebes, began to challenge Spartan power and for a short period of time, under the leadership of two great generals, Pelopidas and Epaminondas, the small city of Thebes achieved a lasting place in ancient history, making the acropolis of their city (called Cadmea and for a long time subject to the control of a Spartan garrison) a sort of paladin of freedom against Lacedaemonian power.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s battles of volume 1 in the series, Leuctra and Mantineia, depict the rise and fall of this short &quot;empire&quot;, serving as an eulogy to one of the greatest military leaders of all time, Epaminondas.<br/><br/>",

Once the board is constructed, it displays a winding path through the jungle or Amazon. Over a dozen animals specific to the region featured are included several times on the game spaces that make up the path. A deck of cards featuring the animals is included and players take turns drawing cards and moving to the animal shown.

It consists of 119 plain cards each with a single numbered question, and a booklet with directions and all the answers.<br/><br/>Players are given at least six cards each, and take turns flipping over a single one of their cards. If that player cannot answer the question, he passes it to his left, and each player in turn has the opportunity to answer. Whichever player answers correctly keeps the card, and the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>While the box is undated, Alex G. Malloy dates it to 1910 (American Games, 1999, p. 35, #1081), and the questions confirm the period: Cuba is shown as an independent nation, while the largest Empire in the world is still Russia, with its capital at Petrograd. Interestingly for an American game, 11 of the questions (almost 1/10) deal with what is now Canada.<br/><br/>",

Event cards might give you votes or get your party member to be elected as a minister or get the whole government to be moved to some parliamentary committee.<br/><br/>Other way to get your party member to government is to move one of your already elected members of parliament to government squares on the board. You want you MP's into government because then you get extra votes.<br/> Game ends when one player gets all his/her party members elected to parliament.

It's a card game played on a randomized map, where the object is to discover defensive outposts and fortify them against the onslaught of the Deep Krillord.<br/><br/>Protecting your home is a wonderful thing to do with friends, but King Blubbulous only has one throne to give to a heroic whale, so you might as well sabotage your fellow whales along the way. There are over 60 abilities and organisms to aid you in your quest, from swordfish assassins to deep-ocean ectoplasm. Or, if being a hero isn't your style, aid the Krillord in usurping the Blubbulous throne and bring terror to the Krilling Field in his evil name.<br/><br/>The Krilling Field takes between thirty minutes and one hour to play, and every game has completely rearranged terrain, with players altering the shape, size, and order of the playing field at will.

Thieves gamble their reputation with every expedition into the dangerous tombs that litter the land of Al-Shirkuh, but this gamble is worth the risk as great riches can be found.

The cards are divided up by 9 scenes of 3 different cards each.  The 3 cards of each scene form a larger picture scene.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first player to collect all 3 cards of a scene.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player is dealt 3 cards, and the remaining pile becomes the stock.  The dealer draws a card from the stock, and then passes one of their cards to the left, so they are only left with 3 cards.  The next player then chooses a card to discard to the next player, etc.  The last player discards their card to a discard pile, and then the dealer starts the next round by drawing the top card from the stock again.<br/><br/>Play continues until a player collects all 3 cards from a scene, and displays it on the table, winning the game.<br/><br/>This game closely resembles a Children's Card game called My Ship Sails played with a traditional deck(s) of cards, but players try to match suits in that game instead of picture scenes.<br/><br/>This game was included in a 6 pack of Children's Card Games by Bicycle Playing Cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Under Cover is a light-hearted game of spy-collecting -- a set collection game, with a theme of intrigue. Manage your resources, in order to build your spy network. The more spies you have in the field, the higher your score. Put the most spies into active duty to win the game! Build your team of spies, informants, sleeper cells, whistle-blowers, and double-agents to infiltrate enemy targets. Steal agents from your opponents, call upon underworld contacts. Do what you must to ensure your forces are stronger than your enemy's.<br/><br/>As a set collecting game, the obvious goal of Under Cover is to gather the largest sets of cards -- larger sets of cards laid down scores more points. But, each card also has a special ability, which allows you to do special actions, such as drawing more cards, stealing from opponents' sets, forcing your opponent to draw cards (to put them over the hand limit), or taking cards from the &quot;Veterans Pile&quot; (the set of cards that have already been spent for their special abilities). On your turn, you may draw cards, then you'll decide how you want to act. You can lay down cards to score points, discard cards to make room in your hand, or play special ability cards. All of the cards are special ability cards. Under Cover even requires special ability cards to pick up a set from the table, so you can add to it.<br/><br/>Each game begins with a simple shuffling of the deck. That's all the setup required, so the 15-30 minute play time is entirely playing. The cleanup at the end of the game is just as simple: put the cards back in the box. The Solo mode of the game is just as simple as the multiple-player mode, but it becomes more of a puzzle game -- instead of trying to get more points than the other player(s), you have to score large enough sets in ALL the color groups. That is impossible without using the abilities on the cards in a tactical manner.<br/><br/>Under Cover has strategic choices to make, but it's a quick game that sets up in moments, and can be put away in seconds. It can be taught in five minutes, but can be played over and over -- with a quick shuffle, you're back in the game. It works as a great filler, or a fun game to play with your kids.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Suomalainen Pesis taktiikkapeli (translates as: Finnish Baseball tactical game) came out in 1977. This two player game &quot;simulates&quot; Finnish national sport Pes&auml;pallo (Baseball) which was developed in 1910's from American Baseball and old Finnish ball and bat sport called Kuningaspallo (King Ball).<br/><br/>This boardgame is a two player game and uses card based &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; -system to simulate the various situations and decisions in the field. Player of Fielding team and player of Batting team have their own cards to choose. The cards (usually three different) player can use depend on the situation on the field (ie. how many runners are on the field etc.).<br/><br/>Depending which action (card) batting team player chooses and which one fielding team player chooses determines the outcome of that particular throw of the ball. Both cards are revealed simultaneously. Batting player might have get called &quot;out&quot; or the players on the field might have been called &quot;out&quot; or batting player succeeded to advance from base to another or even managed to score a run.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Rules stipulate that the game can be played by either two players or two teams of players, but since the tasks of individual team members are not defined any further than that in the rules, this is essentially just a 2-player game.<br/><br/>Box front carries an endorsement by the then executive director of the Finnish Baseball League, Markku Pullinen.<br/><br/>Patent pending no. 772736<br/><br/>",

Yet now the Emperor&rsquo;s blades are unsheathed. Biochemically fashioned from infancy to function as supreme tacticians, combatants and bodyguards, they are death incarnate to those who oppose the Emperor&rsquo;s will. Each Custodian is sublimely skilled, their talents and abilities to the Space Marines what those transhuman warriors are to unaugmented Imperial soldiery. The Ten Thousand walk the stars in numbers not seen since the Great Crusade, and woe betide those who stand in their way.<br/><br/>Codex: Adeptus Custodes contains a wealth of background and rules &ndash; the definitive book for Adeptus Custodes collectors.

The gains and losses are decided by the value of the dice and the P&amp;L board.<br/><br/>How the P&amp;L board works.<br/><br/>If for example your dice score is 5, you will receive from the bank 600 dollars for each orange share you own, pay to the bank 400 dollars for each green share you own and receive 1000 dollars for each blue share you own. Also you will have to play 2500 dollars to the owner of West Diamond Mining.<br/><br/>If your dice score is 6,7 or 8, beside the gains or losses on the shares you own you also receive from the bank 2500 dollars for each company you own and must invest in a High Risk Deal anything between 2000 dollars and your total worth.<br/><br/>After deciding the amount to be invested in the risky deal you will roll again the dice and If your score is 7 or higher you win twice the amount invested. If the score is lower than 7 you lose half of the invested money.<br/><br/>Risky Deals are very important  in the game as it often change the leaders and set the game winners. A player that goes ALL IN  in a Risky Deal can triple his or her worth, while only risking to lose half of it.<br/><br/>The players may decide how many rounds a game will last. A 10 rounds game with 4 players lasts about 80 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Their goal is to make a set of 4 cards, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, of their own color.  The type of monster is not important, only that it's your color.  This can also be played to get 4 in a row, with the rules unchanged otherwise.<br/><br/>There is an advanced version of the game, this uses the 6 advanced assignment cards, where you have to place your monsters in a specific shape to win.  This also includes a &quot;X * monster&quot; card, which means you only win if you get 4 monster (or 5 in the 5-in-a-row variant) in the same row.<br/><br/>This game resembles a paper version of a 4/5-in-a-row type Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br/><br/>This game was published as part of a promotional campaign for the KFC restaurant group.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The player with the most credits at game end wins.<br/><br/>The main rule changes from the first edition are that the end game now has a second income phase to make purchases in the final rounds more compelling. The module track rules changed to have players discard and redraw a new module if 3 duplicates are already in there. The module decks and factions had some clarifications and errata applied to them to help clear some things up.<br/><br/>You are the alien CEO of a galactic corporation and your masters have given you seed money to invest in the new joint space station. What will you purchase? A solar power monopoly? Luxury habitats? Will you outperform your competition, and prove your dominance?<br/><br/>This second edition of Startropolis includes all new art from Brian Patterson.<br/><br/>",

Players choose from the 6 minion characters each with their own advantages and natural skills.<br/>The game begins with the Minion Working Phase which is divided in rounds. Each round is split into a series of  steps for each minion to complete: assign tasks, initialize time, demonstrate skills, complete tasks and refresh hands to earn points, skills and reputation. One player acts as the MIC (Minion in Charge) and uses the task deck to indicate status. This is the time to demonstrate delegation and negotiation skills to curry favor with the Evil Overlord (EO).<br/><br/>The MIC draws a number of tasks equal to the number of minions under their delegation. The MIC then hands out these tasks to minions as they see fit for them to complete, managing time. Any tasks not completed will an increase to the Evil Overlord Annoyance tracker (the EO has no tolerance for minions who cannot complete simple tasks!) Any tasks the MIC chooses not to complete will cost them time and points as will any failed tasks by minions. Be careful your minions could choose to strategize against you to become the next MIC. Minions complete tasks to demonstrate skills, gain abilities, points and reputation in attempt to take over as the next MIC to get their chance to please the EO and become the henchman.<br/><br/>The game ends if there are not enough tasks to assign to  minions including reshuffled tasks. The minion that has gained the most reputation points earns the respect of the Evil Overlord and is declared the Henchman and the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

The categories may include Twitter, Instagram, Church, Family and Friends, etc. There is plenty of gameplay for many types of people, which is perfect for the party crowd! Attempt to guess as many cards as possible!<br/><br/>To begin the game, the first team will flip the timer. The describer will then take a stack of cards from the box and immediately begin. They will begin by stating the category and showing the team the culture tag. They must then give hints without saying any of the words on the card. When the card is answered correctly, it gets placed to the side and a new card is drawn. If the team cannot guess the card, they will pass and place it separately from the cards that are guessed correctly.<br/><br/>When the timer comes to an end, the rest of the cards are placed in the box. The passed cards are left on the table. The cards that the team were able to correctly guessed are placed off to the side, and the team earns one point for each card that is correctly guessed.<br/><br/>The next team will then go through the same process, but they may choose to answer the passed cards or cards from the box. If they are able to guess the passed cards, they score two points per card. Gameplay continues like this until the players decide that the game is over.<br/><br/>The game comes to an end when the players decide to be finished playing. The team with the most points win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rabusie (&quot;Robbers&quot;) is a card game in which you play the role of treasure hunters competing to find valuable items in the heart of a forgotten jungle. The game is intended for 2-6 players over 7 years of age, and the average playing time is 20 minutes.<br/><br/>By playing appropriate cards, robbers try to keep the treasures they have collected so far, steal loot from their opponents, and take over those that have not been tried yet and are still in the common pool. Each loot here is equally valuable! In the end, the only thing that will count among robbers is the number of treasures looted. The players' goal is to collect as many cards as possible, because each of them gives 1 point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A memory game loosely based on Eric Carle's Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? and Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See? series of children's books.<br/><br/>2-4 players are either brown or panda bears; the pandas are looking for a set of endangered animals, while the browns are looking for a set of more mundane wildlife (albeit a bit weird, such as the blue horse).  Each turn a player flips one tile from a center pool.  If it fills an opening in their predefined set, they keep it and take one (and only one) more turn.  If not, they turn it back over.  First player to fill their whole set wins.<br/><br/>The two turn limit makes this more suited to very young children than traditional memory games, as there's never too many recently-flipped tiles to track.  Most of the time there's either zero or one, since rejected animals are usually quickly picked up by the next player in line.<br/><br/>Claims that the game helps with sequencing skills are based on the endgame, when the winning player calls out each of their animals in order, aping the book series' style.  (The animals can be picked up in any order.)<br/><br/>",

It was here, a Bolivian Army led by German General Kundt, armed with new weapons (tanks, flame-throwers, fighter-bombers) assaulted the Paraguayan defenses not from Paraguay's capitol. Kundt had been led to believe the defenses were weak, that the tanks would break through and that once Nanawa fell, the road would be open to Paraguay&rsquo;s capital. This was in fact true, however, that was the only thing which was true. The Paraguayan forces had been issued special antitank ammo and built well defended trenches with mines. Their lines were not weak and numerically almost as strong as the Bolivian! The Paraguayans had proved themselves many times during this war as a very dangerous foe even when outnumbered.

        "description": "&quot;Star moments of life, with the wisest in the realm&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Meeting of the Wise&quot; is clearly based on the long-standing (1945-1995) radio trivia program Viisasten Kerho (&quot;The Club of the Wise&quot;); most of the designers were members at one point or another, and the main authors Otila and Lindfors were it's two last chairmen. Otila especially, an economist and Member of European Parliament, was known as a kind of &quot;Mr. Trivia&quot; of Finland in the 1980's-1990's when he produced and hosted several popular TV trivia shows and participated as a competitor himself in trivia events held by others.<br/><br/>This is a trivia game for single players or teams. There are 5 categories of questions, 2500 questions in total. The game enjoys a reputation of being overly difficult as far as trivia games go; something that the designers would probably have enjoyed playing among themselves, but frustratingly challenging to the average trivia player.<br/><br/>The game was published in two versions; the initial version came in a beige box, but later a revised edition in a red box, based on player feedback, was published; it introduced a d6 and some rules addenda. A companion game, Viisasten kivi was published probably around the same time, aimed at a younger audience and therefore being a bit more casual, and having a difficulty level more in line with trivia games in general.<br/><br/>",

Like Snakes and Ladders, it takes place on a square board with a boustrouphedron track, and players roll a die to move their piece from start to finish. The distinguishing features of this distinct subgenre are that the board is set in a playground with many children playing on a see-saw, a slide, a Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, and so on. Some squares will have instructions that will move the player forward, backward or cause a missed turn.<br/><br/>Like other traditional Chinese games of this ilk, it is made by different companies and comes in small boxes with a folded paper board - in this case, the board is often fairly colourful. More modern versions include cartoon character themes (e.g. Doraemon Kang Le Qi, Snoopy Kang Le Qi).<br/><br/>",

Grab your hand and play cards building your pen to capture the pigs.  However, be careful, as your opponent will be looking to ruin your hard work and steal your pigs!<br/><br/>In a game of Pig-Pen, players are dealt a hand of five cards,  with these cards they are going to build pens to capture pigs.  A stack of Pigs, depending on the number of players, is the timer for the game.  Once these pigs are gone the game is over.  On their turn players replenish their hands back to five cards, then they are allowed to play two cards and finally they may discard any number of cards they choose.  The choices they have are to either build their pen(s) or attack their opponent(s.)  Pens are made six cards: Four Pen cards, a Feed card to entice the pig and finally a Gate card.  Players can attack their opponents with attack cards that destroy Pen cards or Unlock Gates.  Even when a Pig is captured, it still isn't safe as players can attempt to steal it with Attack cards.  Players ultimate goal is to have the best point Pigs in their Pens at games end.<br/><br/>Pig-Pen also features three levels of play.  A simple children's level, an intermediate level with some number comparisons.  And the always fun Secret Bacon Pack, where no Pig is safe from destruction of the bacon kind.<br/><br/>",

The city has been overrun by criminals and the heroes are duty-bound to clear it up.<br/><br/>The players take turns to play.  They use a spinner to determine the number of spaces they can move on the board.  Interspersed on the board are locations where the criminals have been randomly placed face-down (except for the boss, Lawrence Limburger, who is placed openly in his headquarters) and where they can draw Plutarkian Pothole cards, which grant positive or negative effects.  By moving their tokens onto criminals, the player engages them in battle, which is resolved by again using the spinner.  If victorious, the player takes (captures) the criminal's disc into his or her possession.<br/><br/>The game ends when all criminals have been captured.  The players score the criminals they have captured (different points for the 6 types of criminals in the game).  The one with the highest points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The players must thus place their own track counters as &quot;stepping stones&quot; before advancing on a path, while sabotaging other players' game by removing their counters.

Can you return him to his natural state by collecting kisses and the golden ball, and placing him on the right lily pad?<br/><br/>How it is played:<br/><br/>The central piece of the game is a clear plastic cylinder that has a disk inside. The disk shows the prince on one side, and a frog on the other. It is turned over via a magnetic mechanism: If the cylinder is put on the castle tile, it shows the frog. If it is put on the correct lily pad, the tile is turned over again and the prince reappears.<br/><br/>Players take turn spinning a spinner. The spinner has three different areas: One shows one &quot;kiss&quot; symbol (a pair of lips), the second shows two kisses, and the third one the golden ball. If the spinner points toward one of the kiss symbols, the active player gets the corresponding number of kiss tokens. If it points toward the golden ball, the active player gets the ball token (there is only one ball token, and it constantly changes its owner according to the spinner's results). A player can try rescuing the prince as soon as he/she has collected 3 kisses and the golden ball. To rescue the prince, the cylinder has to be put on the correct lily pad. But only one of the lily pads will make the prince reappear. If the player chooses the wrong lily pad, he/she loses their kiss tokens and has to start collecting new ones. If it is correct and the frog turns into a prince, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The person playing the black card chooses the funniest response.<br/><br/>This game pokes fun at Mormonism and Mormon Apologetics. The name Zelph refers to a skeleton found by Joseph Smith in Illinois that was uncovered in a Native American mound. He claimed the bones belonged to a warrior named Zelph who had fought in the battles described in the Book of Mormon.<br/><br/>The game can be played independently or integrated with Cards Against Humanity. Like the original game, the humor is very adult in nature and is recommended for mature players. For faithful Mormons, the game is probably especially offensive.<br/><br/>",

Each character starts in one of six locations (restaurant, parking lot, theater, stage, kitchen and back alley). The first act of the game is to come up with reasons why the bad guy has to go down. The bad guy starts by bragging about how bad they are. The heroes then say how they have been personally hurt by him. Players can jump in with suggestions for other people&rsquo;s stories.<br/><br/>The rest of the game is about bringing the villain down (and maybe to justice). The bad guy starts the game. Players take turns to add to the story, assisted by a tableau of scene cards (representing some key point in a revenge story plot) and action cards that can be played from hand. Another player&rsquo;s version of events can be challenged by playing an action card. Challenges are resolved by rolling dice, with the winner gaining the card their opponent used. All cards are worth victory points.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to score the most victory points while also telling an interesting story.<br/><br/>Multiple FTAL decks are available, and they can be combined for a larger scale game.<br/><br/>",

Better improvements can not be hoped for: more money and more consumption, yet more renunciation. Improvements today which are more friendly to life will produce more cultural riches, and more exchanges between all. This is all with a minimal burden on the environment and a maximum amount of self-determination. Put an end to the monopoly!<br/><br/>You choose a new homeland, a new Bolo. Every Bolo has a special way of life and is nearby. The organization of your chosen community needs you to bring it goods. You obtain distinct items during the course of the game. Any surplus produced in your own Bolo is trade able with other players. Every exchange offers a new experience. Also, every visit to another Bolo brings new knowledge.<br/><br/>Which Bolo should be judged to be first? Last can quickly become first, as when someone has attained a new innovation, it can quickly be shared with the rest of the collective through visits and the cultural exchanges that result!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>bolo' bolo is game designer / Anarchist P.M.'s second foray into political board games, with his first being the cult tile laying favourite Demono. bolo' bolo is based upon the book of the same name which lays out P.M.'s ideal society based upon sub-communities, each autonomous, with an economy fueled by trade.<br/><br/>Game components are in both German and French, and are rather archaic with the 'cards' being coloured paper with black ink style drawings, absolutely nothing like Demono's more lush visuals.<br/><br/>The basic idea of the title is that each player represents one of the &quot;bolos&quot; on the board, each of which specialises in the production of certain things, and which needs certain others, which is accomplished via trade.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragon Wars is a card game included in the RPG aid, Dragonlance Saga Fate Deck.  While the main purpose of the Fate Deck is to play an RPG using the Saga system, the deck includes rules for a stand-alone card game, Dragon Wars.  The RPG rules included in the game are credited to Steven Brown, Steve Miller, and Ed Stark, but no designer is mentioned for Dragon Wars.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 82 cards: eight suits numbered 1-9 and one suit (dragons) numbered 1-10.  To play, the dragons are removed from the deck and shuffled.  Every player gets one dragon.  The remaining 72 cards are shuffled and six are dealt to each player.<br/><br/>Three of the suits are attacking suits, three are defending suits, and two suits may be used for either.  On your turn, you attack a dragon of your choice (but not your own!) by playing attack cards.  The owner responds by playing defense cards.  The attacker may continue the attack if he has more of the same suit he started with.  If he does, the defender may defend with any defensive suit.  Once the attacker calls a halt, subtract defense cards from attack cards.  If the number is positive, the dragon takes that many hits.  (Each dragon has a number of hit points equal to the number on the card.)  Dead dragons are placed in the attacking player's victory point pile, and the defender draws a new dragon to defend, if there are any left.<br/><br/>Rules are provided for &quot;despoilers&quot; - players whose last dragon is removed after the dragon deck has run out.  (In a ten-player game, that's always!)  The game ends one round after there is only one dragon left in play: everyone else has one turn to try to defeat it.  The numbers on the dragon cards are VP.<br/><br/>",

If you have 4 players, you'll play in 2 teams. On your turn you place a chip in your color on the board next to one of your opponent. Your goal is to capture your opponents chips.<br/><br/>How is that done? First you try to close your opponents chips in. For that you need to have your chips on both sides of your opponents. This can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Then you try and capture the chip(s) by answering a question. When answered correct, the opponents chip(s) are turned over. When answered incorrect, nothing happens and your opponent takes his/her turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when the board is full or when no player can place a chip or when all chips are one color. The player with the most chips up, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Do you know who came up with tower-to-park urbanism? Who designed the first skyscraper? Who wrote Delirious New York? The Modern Architecture Game, designed by Amsterdam-based NEXTarchitects, lets players test their architectural knowledge, competing for the right to wear Le Corbusier&rsquo;s iconic round-rimmed glasses.<br/><br/>Containing almost a 1000 questions, the Modern Architecture Game provides the base for an evening full of insights in the world's most famous architects, buildings and trends of the Western architecture, all through the roll of a dice. The goal is simple: To reach the heart of the board before anyone else. This is done by moving your way through questions of six different categories: Visuals, Architect, Project, Style, Influence and Quote.<br/><br/>The Modern Architecture Game is the second edition of the architecture game. The first edition was launched on 30 August 1999. It was the first project collaboration involving the four partners at NEXT architects and was distributed in the private environment of Delft University of Technology.<br/><br/>Ten years later, we've produced a revised version of the game, analytically unravelled and improved. This edition is an international version, in the sense that it is produced in English, but also that the questions range right across the breadth of modern world history.<br/><br/>This means that many of the questions about the Netherlands that were abundant in the first version have been dropped, unless they were significant in relation to world-wide developments. By introducing these changes, we have endeavoured to make the game suitable for an extremely broad and international group of architecture enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Test your knowledge of the greatest architects, their famous buildings and legendary quotes.<br/><br/>",

The game uses the Aces and Faces to create the board. Aces represent traps, while Kings, Queens, and Jacks represent guards. The goal of the game is to find the Ace of Spades, a powerful and intricate trap like none other. It's the only exit from the dungeons the Joker can take if he wants to live out the rest of his life in freedom.<br/><br/>The game is played by a simple layout of cards in a 4 by 4 square. The joker starts in the bottom left corner, and moves one card at a time. Each card represents a room, each room contains a guard or trap. Using the number cards in your hand to match the values on each trap or guard's room, you can deal with each room accordingly. The goal is to find the Ace of spades among the rooms and disarm the trap it represents.<br/><br/>",

The player who knows the answer to both questions on one card / bite gets it (and presumably digests it, as well). If an answer was wrong, the card is returned into the box. The player with the most correct answers in the end of the game is the winner, and is awarded the golden prize (which is made of chocolate, of course).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Rise of the Red Army is a territorial strategy game covering the Russian Revolution following World War I. Historical representation of the Bolshevik, Siberian, and Crimean factions, including the Polish invasion of Russia, Japanese occupation, and independence movements from Finland and the Baltic States.&quot;<br/><br/>The game comes in a small box, with two large folded (very folded) semi-laminated maps. The components are plastic poker chips with stickers the players affix themselves.<br/><br/>The rules are closely based on Axis and Allies. Each player plays one or more nations, each varying in size and power. There is much greater variation in starting power and capabilities in this game than there is in Axis and Allies. The Bolsheviks control numerous units and a vast swath of territories, while other nations begin with only a handful of each. This imbalance in power is offset by the setting of different victory conditions for each nation. Furthermore, the victory conditions vary depending on how many players are playing and what nations they each control.<br/><br/>Resource collection rules are basically the same as Axis and Allies, (the generic &quot;resources&quot; are equivalent to the &quot;IPC's&quot; from Axis and Allies, i.e. each territory is worth a certain number of resources) with slight variations for some nations. For example, the Northern and Crimean White Russian forces gain extra resources if they keep control of their ports (representing aid from the U.K., U.S., and France), while the Bolsheviks and Ukrainian Anarchists gain extra resources from any of the core Russian areas they control (representing support from the local populace).<br/><br/>Combat rules also follow Axis and Allies, with some extra rules for trenches (which aid defense), bi-planes (very weak in the game), generals (who can add their &quot;combat factors&quot; to any units they share an area with when attacking or defending), etc. Ten-sided dice are used for combat. Certain nations, such as the Bolsheviks, Poles, and Ukrainians, have more effective infantry than others. The handful of Czech infantry controlled by the Siberian White Russians also gain bonuses in combat.<br/><br/>After combat, players must spend resources to &quot;incorporate&quot; the territories they conquer. Only after a territory has been incorporated can the new owner collect resources from it.<br/><br/>The number of territories on the map is enormous. This increases tactical opportunities, but it would seem that this could make resource collection somewhat onerous for some nations. While the Poles begin the game with 31 resources, the Bolsheviks begin with 306! Of course, the Bolsheviks are under attack from nearly every direction, so they need the bonus.<br/><br/>",

The Viet Cong D445 Local Force Battalion had dominance in this area but the Australians were increasing their activity. Most contacts with the Viet Cong were small squads and so Australian doctrine was to carry light loads and attack aggressively. The local Viet Cong commander, Colonel Nguyen Than Hong, aimed to make a large attack on 6th Bn causing a politically unacceptable loss, hoping to cause its withdrawal. The Viet Cong 275 Regiment moved south intending to attack. The VC continually formed assault waves and moved forward but were decimated by artillery fire. The soldiers of D Company showed excellent discipline holding their line and repulsing any VC that got through the artillery barrage. D Company were supported by 24 105mm and 155mm guns from Australian, New Zealand artillery units and the US 2/35 Battalion, which fired deeper into VC positions. Over 3,000 rounds of artillery were fired. The Australian A Battery fired rounds every 15 seconds for three hours. The VC were decimated with over 500 killed and 750 wounded. Australian losses were 18 killed and 24 wounded.<br/><br/>",

Produced and made available in the UK by Smiths Crisps, a snack food company.<br/><br/>From the front cover:<br/><br/>&quot;Marty McFly, a senior of Hill Valley School was late for class. After that night, however, when he climbed behind the wheel of a nuclear powered time machine car invented by eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown, he wouldn't be late for anything. In fact, he was 30 years too early.<br/><br/>Marty traveled back in time to 1955 just as the town clock was showing 4 minutes past 10 o'clock in the evening. After hiding the car and cautiously walking through his home town, Marty meets up with Lorraine Baines and George McFly - the two teenagers who are later to become his parents.<br/><br/>Not only had Marty traveled to a point in time before the dawn of rock n' roll and Smiths flavoured crisps but he had tampered with history. He now had a number of problems to solve before he could attempt to get back to his own time.<br/><br/>Now, through this exciting board game, specially produced by Smiths, you can imagine you're Marty and follow his adventures - will you be first to get back to the present time?<br/><br/>Please read the rules of the game carefully before starting our on your journey, you don't want to get stuck in 1955 forever!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brainstorm is similar to Go-Moku in that it consists of players taking turns placing pieces on the playing field and attempting to get a certain number of their symbol in a row. Unlike Go-Moku, the goal is to get as many strings of three as possible, rather than to be the first to get a string.<br/><br/>Game play begins with the players deciding which of them will play X and which will play O. Then the fifteen X/O dice are rolled, and whichever player's symbol came up more goes first. Players alternate placing the dice with their symbols until either time runs out or there are no more dice left. This does mean that one player may get more turns than the other. This confers a substantial advantage to the first player, which the rules suggest can be balanced out by playing multiple games.<br/><br/>The final layout is scored, generally by counting the number of sets of three for each player, though the board also contains special double- and triple-score squares as well as some squares preprinted with X or O.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "League Championship is a game for 2-6 players that simulates an entire season of the English Football League Championship.  It dates from the 1970s and has versions endorsed by footballers George Best and Gordon Banks.<br/><br/>During setup, each player is dealt a face-down stack of action cards which will be used during the game, and a miniature silver plastic trophy is placed on prominent display in the centre of the game's circular board.<br/><br/>Players then, in turn, simulate fixtures by rolling a blue die for the home team and a green die for the away team, followed by turning over an action card which modifies the dice rolls in favour of either team.  Examples of action cards are &quot;Work out new corner kick - score 2 more goals&quot; and &quot;Recent Cup commitments in Europe weaken team - lose 1 goal in this match&quot;.  The result of the match is thus determined with players scoring two points for a win, one for a draw and nothing for a loss.<br/><br/>A player's team's progress is tracked by use of two tokens - a small pawn on a score track to show the current points total and a footballer figure on a calendar track to mark the number of fixtures played.  At the end of the season, the player whose team has accumulated the most points wins the league championship, and of course the trophy!<br/><br/>",

The board is separated into squares on which the players can build. By doing so they manage differend aspects of a township, like a political administration in a small town. The game has a path around the edges on which the players move. Those spaces give them different opportunities and makes the players dra cards containing various events, much like the cards in Monopoly. One interesting thing in this game from 1975 is that the players mark their buildings on the plastic board using whiteboard markers. This must have been a rather early use of that in a boardgame.<br/><br/>Includes land development, unemployment issues, building of inustries, malls, water cleaning facilities, summer house areas and family homes. Four different variants of the rules provide different levels of difficulty. There is also squares for &quot;?&quot;-cards which is a variant where the players are meant to construct cards of there own to tweak the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "LOOPING is a simple card game with the theme of aerobatics.  Each card represents the side view of an aircraft completing a maneuver - climbing, diving, looping or some other similar action.<br/><br/>The start card shows an aircraft taking off and to this players add further cards in a sequence with the smoke trails on the cards indicating where two cards can be connected together.  The card also indicates the difficulty of the stunt - and the points gained if the maneuver is successfully completed.<br/><br/>Then idea of the game is to attempt to add cards allowing the aircraft to gain and lose altitude undertaking a variety of tricks on the way.  Whether the trick is achieved or not is determined by a die roll (throwing higher than a given number shown on some of the cards). Points are earned for a successfully completed maneuver. If you fail any part of the sequence then you score nothing.<br/><br/>The game ends when the aircraft is brought in to land, through the laying of the appropriate card, at a level at the same altitude from which it took off.  The winner is the player who scored the most points during the flight.<br/><br/>The game has three variants OVER THE CLOUDS (3-5 players)  DARE-DEVILS (2-4 players) and SKY-RIDER (3-6 players)which, though broadly similar, do make the game suitable for differing numbers of players.<br/><br/>",

Funded entirely by sponsorship from local firms who feature on the board and stocks, lead by the Midland Bank who got their logo on the banknotes, this game was actually produced by Sheffield YMCA with help from the City Council. Sheffield YMCA got the idea from Bergen YMCA, where apparently this style of game was a big hit in Norway, with 200,000 copies sold, the result being that all proceeds from sales went to the charity. The product is very good quality, very professional, with an unusual feature of the game board wrapping around a polystyrene contents box to form the game box like a sleeve, held by Velcro! Very strange, with the cardboard held in hinged sections in strong plastic, but the innovative &amp; modern design works very well and the result is much more interesting than many British games.<br/>Still a Monopoly clone though.<br/><br/>",

In the spirit of Golf Dice (or Galloping Golf), there are five six-sided dice, each a different color, and must be rolled in a certain order.<br/><br/>Like in the game, a RED BALL must first be potted, so the red die is first rolled. If it says &quot;Red Potted&quot;, you score a point and may continue on to the black die. &quot;No Pot&quot; means you failed and play goes to the next player. &quot;In Off&quot; gives your opponent four points and control of the dice.<br/><br/>If you made it to the black die, you must now pot a COLORED BALL -- one of the six other balls on the &quot;table&quot;, each one a different color. Like the red die, it may say &quot;Pot&quot;, &quot;No Pot&quot;, or &quot;Foul&quot; (same effect as &quot;In Off&quot;). If it says &quot;Pot&quot;, you now roll the white die to see which color was potted.<br/><br/>The white die has a different colored ball on each side. The color that comes up determines how many points you score, as in Snooker. You now return to the red die to continue the game.<br/><br/>When 15 red balls have been potted, it is set aside. The black and white dice are used to pot the six colored balls in order of score. When the final ball (black) is potted, the game is over.<br/><br/>A player who has little chance of catching his opponent may try to cause his opponent to foul by &quot;snookering&quot; him. At any time, a player may roll the blue die instead of the red or black die. If it comes up &quot;No Snooker&quot; or &quot;Foul&quot;, his opponent takes control (and gets four points for the foul). Otherwise he must roll the green die and see if he can avoid rolling a &quot;Foul&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A dice game involving moving balls on a wooden box to place them into a hole.<br/>Kulbank (&quot;marble bank&quot;) is a game for small children which consists of a bright red wooden box with only a small hole open. You lay it down flat on its side on the table. On the top side are six spaces, each labeled both 1-6 and with a color. Space number two is the hole.<br/><br/>Apart from the &quot;bank&quot; itself, the game comes with two six-sided dice (one regular and one with colors matching the spaces on the box) and a number of yellow marbles (about 25).<br/><br/>To play, divide the marbles evenly to all players and put any remainders into the bank. Select one of the dies to play with. Each player then rolls the die. If the space indicated is free he puts a marble there. If there is a marble there he gets to pick it up instead.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to lose all your marbles. If your children want to play the game too often, this may be accomplished in more than one way.<br/><br/>Children tend to like this game and are able to play it from an early age (as soon as they can recognize colors and sit still long enough). To make the game slightly more educational, use the die with numbers instead. There is absolutely no skill or strategy element, so your age or previous experience with the game has no bearing on who will win. This may be considered a bug or a feature depending on your viewpoint.<br/><br/>",

The game contains 100 question cards &ndash; the questions deal with songs, singers/bands, lyrics and competitions both from the days gone by and today.<br/><br/>Unlike the basegame, the travel edition has no board at all; each player is given a page off a pad, which has six 'pyramids' (good for six games) made of 9 circles in the colours of the four question categories - three categories have 2 circles each, while one has 3 circles, and this varies from pyramid to pyramid. In the middle is a white star which is the final game-winning question. Each time a question is answered correctly, one circle of the category in question can be crossed off, and the goal is to fill in one side of the 'pyramid' and then answer the final question correctly. The category is decided directly by a die-roll (5 or 6 means player's choice). Otherwise rules are the same as the basegame.<br/><br/>",

Movement is a result of the combination of the four dice roles.  For example a roll of 20 (including a double) would allow a space ship to leave July (space 26) and move to Mars (space 46).<br/><br/>The following dice rolls have the following effects:<br/>Throwing four of a kind (a quadruple) wins outright, even on the first throw.<br/>A triple, regardless of the number thrown allows a move of 36 spaces.<br/>A perfect sequence (1234, 2345, 3456) allows a move of 48 spaces.<br/><br/>Some squares contain special instructions that must be followed.  These include instructions to throw again or move to another square.<br/><br/>On arrival at sector 144 each space ship there qualifies for three throws of the dice.  After each throw the player may pick up or leave down any dice in choosing to go for a quadruple or perfect sequence within those three throws.  Each time a quadruple or perfect sequence is thrown one ship may be placed on the space representing the Center of the Galaxy.<br/><br/>The first player to get all three of their ships to the Center of the Galaxy is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Rekkakuskit (the truck drivers) each player tries to make their living by running a transportation company. They get paid for delivering consignments but must cover their expenses. The winner is the player that has gained most capital at the end of the game.<br/><br/>In the beginning the players get the starting capital, the operation permit cards and place their pawns in Helsinki also taking the initial freight card. Each freight card shows a destination and a table of fees. The actual fee depends on the zone one's pawn is located and the type of the operation permit.<br/><br/>The game board is a map of Finland divided in three zones: southern, middle and northern Finland. The map shows the largest cities and a set of roads (tracks of squares) between them. There are two types of operation permits and you may buy an extended permit to operate with improved rates.<br/><br/>Moving your truck (pawn) happens by roll-and-move and should one land on a given square an event card is drawn. The major part of events consist of maintenance costs. Once the destination city is reached a new freight card is drawn.<br/><br/>",

The way of the Samurai was a harsh one, but it built men as strong as the semi-legendary weapons they carried until both the man and his creed were forged into a living dream, a dream that has survived the fall of empires and the dusts of history . . . This game is extremely fast. It is felt that it reflects the flow of sword vs. sword combat. The players will soon learn that there is more to the game than attack first. Much can be gained by waiting and counterattacking.&quot;<br/><br/>The game portrays a sword duel between two Samurai swordsmen during Japan's Feudal era. The object is to be the first to make a successful attack.<br/><br/>Both players secretly select simultaneous moves (there are 48 different moves including various blocks, cuts, stances, thrusts, etc., with optional rules allowing for feints.) The game is played on two large charts with a series of boxes representing each of the 48 moves a swordsman may make. Each box on the chart shows a player's current move and lists the permissible follow-up moves that may be selected in the next phase. These boxes also display the hit probability for the various attacks. This probability varies based upon the type of attack and the defender's move.<br/><br/>",

So I've done something about that -- &quot;die! Die! DIE! The Family Game of Genocidal Warfare!&quot; is here! &quot;die! Die! DIE!&quot; is The Family Game of Genocidal Warfare. Players build empires and advance their technology in an effort to smash the others into the dust. The board is customizable each game, and almost infinitely expandable. Using mechanics that are basic and elemental, the game proceeds at a breakneck pace to the end, with piles of bodies in every direction.

You attack your opponent's mind and defend your own, with focused bits of psionic energy...By invading your opponent's mind, you may stun your enemy, or pinch a pressure point and cause the loss of those focused bits of psi-power. Your object is to occupy the opponent's conscious mind, whereupon the enemy will black out, never to awaken again.&quot;<br/><br/>Game consists of the rules, gameboard and cut-apart counters found in the magazine and 2D6.<br/><br/>The gameboard  represents the telepaths' minds and the area of mental struggle between them. Each mind is divided into conscious, subconscious and unconscious levels (the &quot;mental arcs&quot;). The area between the battling minds is divided into a series of wavelength arcs.<br/><br/>Basic Play: 1-Announce your attacking pieces (pieces that will move). 2-Pieces not moving then &quot;decay&quot; (fall back due to lack of support). 3-Move the attacking pieces. 4-&quot;Shift&quot; if you choose and are able. 5-Apply any attack results. Sending a piece into your opponent's mind is an attack. Attacking the Unconscious stuns the opponent for one turn. Attacking the Subconscious permanently eliminates your opponent's furthest advanced piece. Attacking the Conscious defeats the opponent and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each team choses their play system, for example 5-4-1 or 4-4-2, and many of the real football situations and techniques do occur in this game, like dribbling, tackling, throw-ins, offside and yellow and red cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast paced, Bible based, outrageously fun game! Babble!&trade; is an exciting new Bible game with a fresh style of play.  Every player draws two cards and start calling out the words on the cards. Wait, did someone else just yell out &quot;cross&quot;? Yes! A match! Both players place their matching cards together. One player grabs a die and rolls it while the other player calls out &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;even&quot;. If the guessing player guesses right, that player gets the match! If not, the player rolling the die gets the match. Each match is worth one point. The players then draw a new card and start calling out words again. Its so simple!<br/> The game contains six decks of cards with each deck being a different category.  The six Categories are Symbols, Books, Places, People, Animals, and Things found in the Bible.  Each card has five words related to that category.  After playing through all six decks the player with the most points wins the game!<br/> Babble!&trade; is a terrific game for a large number of players. It is great to play with friends, family, and church groups!<br/><br/>",

Each player owns four negative particles (electrons), four positive particles (positrons) and one neutral particle with zero charge (neutron).<br/><br/>The game is won by the last remaining player. All of a player's particles are removed if they do not have at least one electron, one positron, and one neutron on the board.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving one of their particles in any of the six hexagonal directions. The particle can move any number of cells in an unobstructed line. There is no passing unless a player has no legal moves.<br/><br/>An opponent's particle can be captured by replacement if: the victim is in line of sight of at least two of the current player's particles; and the total charge of all particles in the victim's line of sight cancels out to zero.<br/><br/>The idea is that such systems are unstable, but reach equilibrium after the capture.<br/><br/>It is compulsory to capture an opponent's particle if possible. The capture may be performed by any of the current player's particles in line of sight of the victim. The neutron may participate in a capture but contributes zero to the total charge.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Esso Baseball Challenge was a card game published by Imperial Oil (aka Esso in Canada) in 1988. It was a single deck of cards that contained various types of cards that represented calls in baseball (i.e. ground ball, single, home run, wild pitch, etc.).<br/><br/>The players laid out the cards for the bases in the traditional diamond formation and then used runner cards to mark where their team's players were on those bases. Players took turns at bat/pitching. Based on the cards drawn, they moved their players around the bases and scored runs. Essentially, it used the same rules as baseball itself ... but they were simulated using a deck of specialty cards.<br/><br/>The game was distributed at Esso stations in Canada during the summer of 1988 (for about $2). For baseball fanatics, this was a fun diversion.<br/><br/>Contents of the deck:<br/>63 game cards<br/>4 base cards<br/>4 runner cards<br/>1 rules/sample score card<br/><br/>",

Each time a player visits the Registry they must also visit the saloon and play a Blackjack-like dice game for at least half of their money. The first player to reach the agreed sum wins. When moving on the map, the players may encounter some events which are usually negative.<br/><br/>The gold nuggets are called according to the old gold prospectors slang: Lifeless, Nit, Louse, Bedbug, Nugget, from smallest to biggest.<br/><br/>",

There are many various parts so each player gets his own custom made car, with different abilities ad weaknesses.<br/><br/>The other piece is a sand timer, that is used to represent your car on the race track. On a players turn, he choses whether he wants to move his mechanic or car, but when then sand has run out in the sand timer, the car is out of gas and you need to move the mechanic to refill the car.<br/><br/>The race track has various hazards and shortcut, that may or may not interfere with your car, depending on what custom parts your car is made up of. You might want to move the mechanic around to find you better car parts, but in the end it is the player who first reaches the finish line with his car who wins.<br/><br/>",

First player to reach the end of a long cave tunnel wins. Monsters pop in and out of caves along the way and act as obstacles.<br/><br/>The Mines of Aslok (2-6 players)<br/>Basic roll-and-move movement, where the first player to escape the Mines with treasure wins. On their way out they need to evade traps and fight demons.<br/><br/>The Vault of Illusion (2-6 players)<br/>More dynamic and complex game, compared to the others. The adventurers move across a multicoloured hex grid at random, dictated by a coloured spinner. The goal is to acquire a magic weapon and then battle one of six different monsters.<br/><br/>",

Our Board game pits players against each other and encourages them to pick on the weakest, kick opponents when they are down and generally manifest all the characteristics that bring success in the financial world. WINNER TAKES ALL!&quot;<br/><br/>Players move round by throwing four coins and progressing as many squares as they throw heads. If a player throws four heads, he moves forward four spaces and has another turn; if he throws four tails, he throws again. When a player lands on a + square, he collects money from the bank; equally, when he lands on a minus square, he pays the bank.<br/><br/>The aim is to be the last solvent player. In order to achieve this, players try to eliminate the competition. Risk cards encourage players to pick on each other.<br/><br/>",

Each Superstar has an Attack and Defense rating out of 100, and a star rating out of 5.<br/><br/>2 players start with 9 randomly selected cards lying face against the ground. These cards are the main roster player. There are two additional cards on the sides of 9 major cards. Both cards are cards Tag Team. The player decides which begins on a playing card with his main roster, and decides whether he wants to attack or defend. He turned the card to reveal Superstar. The opponent must then take a card either defend or attack (depending on the choice of boot drive). The losing card is removed from the game. At any moment a player can choose to spend a card to one of two cards Tag Team. There are also Champion and finishing move cards. These contractors and finishing move cards are superior to the rest of the bridge, but can not be used for cards Championship is equipped with that specific Superstar. Whoever has the most to gain (or face) cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Force your partner to sell you out!<br/><br/>TRU$T is a game based on the ownership of corporations.  There are 11 corporations in the game, each of which is made up of two to five divisions.  A player may own part of all of a corporation.  Ownership of all the divisions in a corporation is known as a &quot;trust.&quot;  In TRU$T, ownership of a corporation is shared when two or more players own division of the same corporation.  The owners of such corporations are at the same time both partners and opponents.<br/><br/>TRU$T is played by moving your token around the board from island to island, buying and developing divisions of the corporations, collecting payments and dividends, and paying debts.  The game ends when only one player remains who had ownership in any corporation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher's website:<br/>Space Ludo is a space sci fi themed version of Ludo, a traditional race and capture game enjoyed around the world. Ludo is related to Pachisi, Trouble, Sorry! and others. All of them are simplified descendants of the ancient Indian cross and circle game, Pachisi.<br/><br/>Space Ludo offers an addicting blend of luck and strategy. Dice are involved yet crucial choices occur frequently. The rules are simple yet the game is always interesting and pleasant to replay. Such are the hallmarks of a classic and so, Ludo has stood the test of time.<br/><br/>Space Ludo utilizes the standard, widely known Ludo rules. These comprise the foundation of play and will be familiar to long time players. New players are encouraged to play the standard game first.<br/><br/>Space Ludo adds the deathmatch element, wormholes and other optional rules to expand and enhance the game.<br/><br/>The theme of Space Ludo comes from the spaced-out universe of the indie computer games Strange Adventures in Infinite Space (2002) and Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space (2005).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As our Pilgrims cross a desolate and craggy mountain pass, they unknowingly stray into the land of the White Bone Demons. At first, the band meets a few skeletal warriors, possessed bones of a long dead army, risen to serve their Queen. After battling against the more corrupted White Bone Demon forms, the Pilgrims find that their Cleanse Ritual is not so effective against these Demon-possessed skeletons. Finally, the narrow path takes them to the Forbidden White Cave, where the Pilgrims confront Yara, Queen of the White Bone Demon Clan, who realises that this is no ordinary group of mortals. If Yara can eat the flesh of Tripitaka, she can gain immortality, regenerate her flesh and regain her beauty. As she launches her minions into a pitched battle, the fast moving White Bone Demons scuttle across the battlefield and Yara herself joins the fray.<br/><br/>Will Yara&rsquo;s poisoned attack will be the end of our four travelers? There is more at stake than just the Pilgrims lives. If they can defeat Yara and the White Bone Demon Clan, Tripitaka will recover the second piece of the lost Sutras and will be one step closer to restoring the seal on the Underworld.<br/><br/>As normal for expansions, this is not a standalone product. There will be a rules supplement, but it will be based on the Journey rulebook. You will play with some Map Tiles and Bridge Tiles from Journey and the base rules are the same. But the expansion is more than different shaped playing pieces. The White Bone Demons play very differently to the Bull Demons, being faster and harder to cleanse. Faster means it is easier for the Pilgrims to get overrun. With the Cleanse Ritual being less effective, Pilgrims will have to risk more kills and Bad Karma. You will need new strategies to defeat the White Bone Demons.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a new game mechanic. The White Bone Demons are the reanimated bones of long dead warriors. Demon Spirits possess the bones and over time, warp them in to horrific shapes. This separation between the Demon&rsquo;s spirit and the warrior&rsquo;s body may explain why the Cleanse Ritual is harder, but it is certainly the explanation of the biggest surprise the Pilgrims will face. Dead White Bone Demons are left on the board and if Yara can attract another Demon Spirit, these piles of bones may spring back to life!<br/><br/>",

It combines trick-taking and area-majority.<br/><br/>During the game, changes occur to both the trick-taking trump and the value of areas for area majority points.<br/><br/>The game has Dice in the suit colours set up on a pentagram showing the value 2 at the start. The trick taking follows the normal pattern, with players following the suit lead if possible and the highest card winning. If there is a Trump suit, highest Trump card will win. But after each trick, the dice values change. The winning suit rises by 1 (or 2 if it was Trump). And one of the dice opposite that winning dice falls by 1. After this change, the lowest dice (if any) now becomes Trump.<br/><br/>But this change in dice values also affects the players' scoring. Before the trick winner adjusts the dice values, the losers place one or two cubes against the dice of the suit they played (or its neighbour). NOTE, the winner of the trick does not get to place cubes, but does choose which dice will drop 1 point. At the end of the round, majority cubes score the face value of the dice (except the Trump die), second most gets half rounded down. Tricks won are also worth 2 points each.<br/><br/>So the game becomes more than just winning tricks. Players want to lose tricks so they can place a cube (2 cubes if you lose on a Trump card) and gain majorities. But they also want to win tricks to control Trump or No Trump and lower the points on another dice.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>ルイ14世時代のフランスが舞台の、貴族達の権力闘争をモチーフにしたゲームです。<br/>トリックテイキングゲームとエリアマジョリティゲームを一つにまとめたような作りになっています。<br/>トリックテイキングの切り札がゲームの途中で変わります。<br/>エリアマジョリティのエリアの価値もゲームの途中で変わります。<br/><br/>",

The Mastermind can grant special bonuses to players during missions, along with their own role-specific benefits. Each player has the opportunity to acquire specialized gear and upgrades to enhance their abilities. While gear can be exchanged among players if it suits someone else better, technological improvements and specialized training upgrades are restricted. The game offers a range of balanced character and gear advancements, allowing characters to develop over the course of a progressively challenging campaign.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But someone is taking the concept to the next terrifying level.<br/><br/>Abandoned and forgotten for over two decades, Camp Hackaway sits in the middle of a thick forest where foliage and undergrowth have nearly reclaimed the old campground. People from all over the world are being abducted and dropped off in the forest on the outskirts of Camp Hackaway, forced to become unwilling participants in the ultimate game of escape and survival. Each participant is given a flashlight three very simple rules: 1) Search the cabins of the campground, find the key to the old pickup truck. 2) Survive the random attacks crazed serial killer Hackin' Hank. 3) Escape in the old pickup truck and win the game. And it won't be as easy as Hackin' Hank constantly roams the campground, stalking the participants one by one.<br/><br/>Body Count is a horror themed card/board game hybrid that utilizes tile-flipping mechanic to simulate the fog of war as the players roam the campground in the dead of night, unsure of their surroundings. The game board is made up of a 4x4 grid of 3.5 inch square tiles that begin face-down. As players move along the grid, they flip tiles to reveal their destination before moving to the next tile. If they discover a cabin, they may search it and possibly find items to help them fend of Hank if he attacks, but they may also find other, more horrifying objects such as severed heads and human remains that may trigger other events that can change the game and affect their chances of escaping alive.<br/><br/>After each player's turn, a card is drawn from Hank's location deck to see where he pops up in the campground - if it's a location occupied by a player, Hank attacks. If a player enters a tile adjacent to a tile occupied by Hank, he gets the opportunity to stalk and attack them.<br/><br/>The game board changes with every game so you'll never play the same game twice.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to SEARCH, SURVIVE, and ESCAPE?<br/><br/>",

Players ask others for the cards they need to complete the &quot;Books&quot; by asking either for the name of the prophet pictured on the card (for children) or by quoting a scripture on the card (for advanced players).<br/><br/>The rules make note that this deck of cards is appropriate for other standard card games as well.<br/><br/>",

Surprise with your signature attack but beware of Hawk Moth's traps.<br/><br/>THROWDOWN! is a turn based card game that uses the Draw-Attack-Discard system or D.A.D.s. During the game you will have a character, a deck, and a discard pile. First you need at least 2 or more people to play and each person will need to have their own character card and deck. The objective of the game is to attack your opponents deck. You do this with your character card and cards you draw from your deck. You win when their deck is completely depleted. No matter how many people play you will always attack the person to your left, so until you get down to two players you cannot attack the person that attacked you.<br/><br/>Setting up to play is easy just place your character card next to your deck and your discard pile will go on the other side of your character. Flip a coin to see who goes first, then follow 3 easy steps.<br/><br/>STEP 1 DRAW - On your turn DRAW a card from your deck and place it in front of your character card. <br/>STEP 2 ATTACK - Your character must ATTACK on your turn and will automatically defend your deck on your opponents turn. Total and resolve conflict damage. Follow any additional rules on the card.<br/>STEP 3 DISCARD - Now discard the card in play and put it into your discard pile, it is now your opponents turn and they follow the 3 easy steps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The players race for conquering Mt. Everest. The game features a 3d mountain with the East, Southwest and North faces of Everest.<br/><br/>The players may choose to begin either in Kathmandu or Lhasa. Players advance by rolling a die. The approach march takes place on the flat part of the board and once you have reached your base camp you may again choose between longer and shorter, but more risky, routes to the summit.<br/><br/>There are three kinds of event cards, for approach march, camp and climbing events. A card is drawn when a player lands on a marked space or a camp. There are both good and bad events to advance or delay the conquest.<br/><br/>When climbing players must set up 4 camps and go back and forth between them to &quot;acclimatize&quot;. Aluminum ladders and safety ropes may be set up by successful die roll to get over chasms and evil spots. Once the player enters the Death Zone (over 8000 m) oxygen tanks are needed. In case all oxygen is consumed without the player being able to reach the summit, she must return to previous camp to get more. The first player back at base camp after summiting Everest is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 19th Century Britain, sports were invented and developed to provide the idle rich with a means of betting large sums of money against each other. In The Victorian Gamer you are one of the idle rich.<br/>No aristocrat worthy of his name would have been without a fast running footman or a stable boy who was a particularly able jockey. He would put up his &lsquo;man&rsquo; against another noble&rsquo;s &lsquo;man&rsquo; for an agreed sum. The sport was incidental; it was the outcome that counted, with the winner taking all. And of course, a whole new industry of side betting with bookies quickly emerged.<br/>The Victorian Gamer mirrors this era. There are three different events &ndash; running, rowing and horseracing - each one having its own unique gameplay. In addition, players can make bets against each other and/or with the bookie. And furthermore, to add a bit of extra spice there are three differently numbered dice to form the odds and affect the outcomes. <br/>In short, there are three different races, two ways of betting, but only one winner. For friends and  family with even the tiniest element of a competitive streak, The Victorian Gamer will provide hours of fun, not to mention a few squabbles, huffs  and sulks. Warning &ndash; NOT A GAME FOR BAD LOSERS.<br/><br/>",

The teams each choose one their own to faceoff for the question. The host asks the question written on a card and the first member to respond may control the question if the response is top answer on the card. The other team gets one chance to give a higher rated response if the first team did not give the top rated response.<br/><br/>Whichever team wins the faceoff gets to try to name all of the answers on the card with team member taking turns at guessing. If the team correctly guesses all the answers without getting three wrong guesses then that team wins the card. Failure to guess all of the answers gives the other team, as a group, one last guess as to what answer may be left unguessed. If this team is correct then it scores the card, if not the first team gets the card anyway.<br/><br/>The first team to score five cards is the winner.<br/><br/>Although not faithful to the television series on which it is based, players familiar with the television series can duplicate the game show using the material provided.<br/><br/>",

Players act as popular Disney characters from the early 1930s and race to get all four of their pawns to Mickey's house before the others. Landing on an opponent's pawn sends it back to the player's starting area.<br/><br/>As is familiar in British Ludo games for children, this game uses a single die for movement. However, it also includes safety spaces, which are usually absent from Ludo and more commonly seen in Parcheesi and other, more complex variants. The board also includes hazard spaces, which is relatively unique for a Ludo/Parcheesi game.<br/><br/>",

Like most circle and cross games, Ludo evolved from Pachisi, with which it shares some game mechanics. There are many variations on play.<br/><br/>The object is to get your four Markers &quot;born&quot; and safely &quot;to Heaven&quot; before your opponents and without capture.  The roll determines your fate:  a 6 causes your Marker to be born and gives you an extra roll.  If your opponent lands on a square occupied by one of your Markers, it's back to Bornless for you.  If Lady Luck is on your side you can protect your Markers by placing two in a square to form a Bar and block your opponents.  The path to Heaven is rife with exciting twists of fate.<br/><br/>In all variations of play, the first player to get all his or her Markers into Heaven wins.<br/><br/>",

It features a large three-fold board of a fine painted lake, sets of large cards with excellent artwork and unbelievably, 6 different solid pewter figures of fishers and two little pewter rowboats. There is even a Record Book to keep a diary of your days by the lake.<br/>And days it will be, because, despite the wonderful attention to detail and genuine care taken in its making, this is a deadly dull game of dice rolling and dice rolling and dice rolling. You first seed the board with little paper tiles showing fish on one side &amp; their weight hidden below. Then you have to roll dice to walk round the lake to your chosen fishing spot (why???), roll dice to use the rowboat, roll dice to hook a fish, roll dice to reel it in, roll dice as the fish runs and so on. The cards are used as part of landing the fish, being Run, Hazard &amp; Problem cards. So it may run straight to you, but if it slips into the reeds, you lose your catch.<br/>No doubt habitual fishers will enjoy the tedium and it may well be a fine simulation of the sport, but any gamers will go mad.<br/><br/>Absolutely typical for a British product, a classic case of theme before game, no idea of a mechanism beyond dice and hazard cards. The graphic artist is named, but the actual designer is not. I suspect it is the eponymous Anglepen. The producers included an order form for parts, baseball cap, T-shirt and future accessories.<br/><br/>",

As the players go round the track (using a spinner), they draw cards and follow their instructions (&quot;Return a Pinocchio Card&quot;, &quot;Draw a Pinocchio Card and Move Forward Three Spaces&quot;, etc.).  Several &quot;bad spaces&quot; make you lose a turn --because Pinocchio gets in trouble.<br/><br/>In the first stage, each player tries to collect the three parts of Pinocchio's silhouette, in black and white, never holding more than three cards at once.  Once this is achieved, the player is now safe from losing any of these cards.  From that point on, the player hopes to get &quot;Turn a Pinocchio Card&quot; cards --once all three parts of Pinocchio are in color, he comes alive and the player wins.<br/><br/>",

He attempts to work his way through the advancing army of small markers. If he can force his way past them, he wins. The 15 small pieces (knights) win by boxing in the King so that he has no move. The knights move only forward or sideways. The king can move any direction to any non-occupied adjoining space. The king must also make single (and multiple) jumps whenever possible. He captures knights when he jumps them. If the king fails to make a jump the knight player gets a knight back and he places it anywhere he wishes. King wins in stalemates.<br/><br/>",

There's a bonus for using all your tiles in one turn.  (The game was published by Borg-Warner Chemicals, so there's also a bonus for playing any of their phosphate compounds.)<br/><br/>",

Take your turn, flip the square so that your opponent's color is on top, signifying that it's his turn, then walk away.  When your opponent sees that he's up, he can stop, play out his turn, flip the square, and go on about his business.<br/><br/>This feature justifies the magnetic aspect of the game.  It can be set up indefinitely and be played out as quickly or as slowly as you desire.  This makes it suitable for home or office play when you don't have time to sit down and play an entire game start to finish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Games Research/Design (GR/D) web site:)<br/><br/>Games Research/Design (GR/D) returns Europa to its roots and revisits the best selling Europa title Fire in the East. The new game covers the same time period as the older ones (summer of 1941 to the spring of 1942) but uses a completely new Soviet OB, a new map, and the latest rules for the Europa system.<br/><br/>Total War gives the Axis player the opportunity to see if he can improve on the massive offensive that pocketed and captured millions of Soviet soldiers. Can you take Moscow or Leningrad? Or are you condemned to suffer the Soviet winter short of victory? The Soviet player must build a strategic reserve large enough to stop the advancing Axis forces and throw them out of Russia. The Soviet player is aided by massive reinforcements that allow him to form new defensive lines in an attempt to slow down or stop the Axis armor thrusts.<br/><br/>Total War is a historical game on the German invasion of the Soviet Union, from summer 1941 to spring 1942. It charts the titanic struggle of the largest ground campaign in World War II, from the Axis offensives that brought the Germans to the gates of Moscow to the Soviet winter counteroffensive that hurled them back.<br/><br/>Total War is a two-player game. One side controls the forces of Germany and its allies while the other controls the forces of the Soviet Union. The maps cover Eastern Europe and the western USSR from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, from the plains of Poland to the steppes along the Volga River. Ground units represent corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 120 aircraft. Naval units represent task forces of warships.<br/><br/>Total War is a complete remake and updating of the classic Europa game, Fire in the East. The game&rsquo;s Soviet order of battle makes extensive use of formerly secret Kremlin information on the Red Army forces that fought the war. The game includes a Soviet order of battle for all of the USSR from 1939 to 1942 and is the more comprehensive game OB ever published on the Red Army in peace and war. The Axis order of battle also is updated, reflecting new research since the publication of Fire in the East. The rules for Total War incorporate the latest rules for the Europa system, with on-demand air power, armor effects, combined arms, and much more, recreating both the German blitzkrieg that captured entire Soviet armies and the Soviet deep operations that nearly splintered the invaders in the depth of the Russian winter.&quot;<br/><br/>",

When the golden goose is turned up the holder of the golden egg wins the pool.<br/>The game can continue a pre-determined number of rounds or until all bar one player are bankrupt.<br/><br/>",

Because of its unique 3D aspect, It lends itself for a new kind of games, 3D building card games (3D-BCG).<br/><br/>Lim is played with Leeyon's Letter Cube Cards. The object of Lim is to score the most points after 10 rounds. Points are scored by connecting the Letter Cube Cards together to form words. By connecting them in a smarter way than your opponent, you score higher points!<br/><br/>In every round one player takes the role of the Word Challenger(W.C.). He/She then challenges the Word Defender(W.D.) by calling out a word. The W.D. then has to form the word by using the Letter Cube Cards. After the W.D. is done the W.C. can challenge the defenders play. If the W.C. gets more points he/she can add them to his/her score.<br/><br/>In the next round the W.C. becomes the W.D. and The W.D. becomes the W.C. The game continues like that until the 10th round is reached. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>During the round the W.C. keeps score.<br/><br/>",

Either have the fewest robbers in your hand and the most points on the table once the final house has been built &ndash; or reveal 5 Robbers at once from your hand, and you have won. Danger City takes its inspiration from so-called &ldquo;Gated Communities&rdquo; that one may find in plush suburbs of North American (or English?) cities, and the idea that you must either be a very paranoid person to live in one, or have very good reason to want to protect yourself from someone!<br/><br/>We are taken to an idyllic neighbourhood that is in full-blown development &ndash; houses are being built, as well as parks, amenities, services and the like.  But somewhere things go wrong: a gang of robbers have arrived. The neighbourhood takes decisive action and starts to install surveillance systems, to thwart their enemies. But who will win out?<br/><br/>Basic Rules<br/><br/>Players take turns in building the neighbourhood, by playing Neighbourhood cards from their hand onto the table. Each card has a specific value &ndash; a Garage is worth 5 points while a Golf Course is worth 15. Cards circulate round the player from player to player: you draw or play a card and then pass one on face down. Lurking in their midst are a rabble of robbers. Chances are you either want to collect them or get rid of them, but you cannot play them like Neighbourhood cards. If you collect 5 of them, you can reveal them all at once from your hand and win. You have &ldquo;sided with the robbers!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Otherwise the game ends when a specific number of House cards have been played &ndash; twice the number of players. At that point the game stops and the player with the FEWEST robbers in their hand wins. If there is a tie, then Neighbourhood points come into play &ndash; whoever has played down the most points wins.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s pretty much it!<br/><br/>",

While ENVIRO-QUIZ is a game of environmental awareness, it is most definitely also a game that is fun and easy to play. Everyone loves question and answer games, whatever the subject. The game is designed in particular for children and adolescents, families and educators. Help with reviewing and validating the information, and with developing the game, was provided by well-known worldwide organizations, including the IUCN - World Conservation Union. The Instruction booklet provides many different ways of playing depending on age, number of players and the time available. It&rsquo;s a great traveling game.<br/><br/>",

At the start, they are dealt out 5 destination city cards and the top card is revealed to indicate their first destination. Players then roll dice and move their tokens along the roads on the board that connect the cities. At its core, this is a roll-and-move game, where players have to roll two dice - one ordinary pipped six-sider and an action die, which shows symbols that affect play. The action die might give extra pips to speed up your travel, cause a flat tire and force you to miss a turn, allow you to switch destination cards with another player, roll the pipped die again and add to your original roll, and even cause everyone to transfer their whole stack of destination cards to the player on their left. The first player to visit all their destination cities wins.<br/><br/>",

One of those is painted black: the one in the middle, second or the most outside one. And each painted circle is twice on hat dice.<br/>Rolling that dice decides which part of the carousel you can turn.<br/>Then you watch the picture you got at the beginning, and see, if you can create that by turning the rolled circle around the center. If you succeed creating that picture, you get one chip from the center bowl. Get the most of these to win!<br/><br/>",

Each Princess needs her invitation, her flowers, her crown, her dress and her shoes before she can go to the castle to meet her handsome Prince...<br/><br/>Players use a colored spinner to move their Princess along a colored path where some squares indicate one of the items the players are collecting. Items are represented by puzzle pieces that, when collected and assemble, form a picture of each of the 5 Disney Princesses in the game. When a player has collected all 5 items for their Princess and have reached the end of the path, they can meet up with their prince by getting the correct color on the spinner.<br/><br/>",

First you take the cubes out of the box, then, in turn order, each player selects a cube and places it back into the box. Once all 9 cubes are back in the box, the second phase begins. The starting player takes any cube from the four corners and starts to form a 3 x 3 wall of 'bricks'. The next selected cube must be taken from the space adjacent to the first cube, in clockwise order. Remember, when you choose a cube and place it, the opposite side of the cube will be facing your opponent, so you need to help yourself whilst also giving non-attractive 'cards' to your opponent.<br/>The main game is one where you try to get the best Brag (a form of Poker but only three cards count) hand facing you. There are other games suggested, with a form of Patience being the best.<br/><br/>",

Each player (or team) has four markers.  The dice is rolled to bring a marker in play and or to move it along the track;  however, a marker can be moved only if the question asked is properly answered.  When a player answers without a &quot;hint&quot; (without asking which are the multiple choices listed on the card), that player can have an other question, so an other opportunity to move forward.  Under some conditions, the questions may also be used to perform a &quot;power-play&quot;, which could force an other player to move backward.  The first player to reach the flag and to answer properly the question wins the game.<br/><br/>Canada Quiz has 250 question cards, with four questions (with multiple answers) on each, for a total of 1000 questions.

The game centers around story cards and each player attempting to figure out which of 3 options the active player picked.<br/><br/>As players take turns reading story cards, and matching answers, players collect Fruit Cards until a single player has collected six different fruit and is declared the winner. Of course there are plenty of ways to make sure that your opponent doesn't have an easy time of that, and a group of cheesy bad guys want those Fruit Cards for themselves.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing a story card, and reading it aloud. This is where your &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot; decision comes into play - because YOU get to decide what fills in that blank. You also draw a Fruit Card, which will indicate whether the other players need to match the choice of the Story Card reader, or not match it. For instance if a Apple card had been drawn, the other players would need to decide which of the three &quot;blank&quot; options was NOT choosen. We do that with... Letter Cards! After you've read your Story Card aloud all players, including the Story Card reader, play one of their Letter Cards indicating which of the three Story Card options they're choosing this turn. Of course hidden throughout the Fruit Card deck are action cards, and pesky fruit thieves. These cards are resolved immediately.<br/><br/>",

It is possible to get five of the same weapon in one set.  <br/> The game is set on Krone II (according to the box) or Pangea (according to the rulebook), where a centuries-old war has created three clans: the Paper Clan (yellow), the Scissors Clan (magenta) and the Stone Clan (blue). Most cards show badly drawn members of each clan and their weapons.<br/><br/>Players simultaneously reveal the top card on their deck, and stone cards beats scissors cards, scissors beat paper, and paper beats stone. With the exception of resolving ties and a 3-player version, that's the rules. Except there are rare monsters that beat all the clan cards, the wizard Jan-Ken-Po who beats everything, and a 'You Lose!' card ('the Herb of Destruction'), which must be played on yourself and makes you lose.<br/><br/>An attempt to cash in on the CCG boom of the mid 1990s, the game is noted for its low production values, amateurish art that is often printed sideways on the cards, a backstory that makes no sense, and gameplay that  takes Rock-Scissors-Paper and removes all the skill and tactics.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The main game includes touring Linnanm&auml;ki for a pre-agreed number of rounds for each player (a minimum of five is recommended), collecting cash when passing Go, taking event cards as instructed, and visiting the various attractions and paying for a ticket to their owners - or possibly even buying the attraction from the bank if the previous owner already went bankrupt and is out of the game, and the attraction has thus become available in the open market again. The player with the most wealth in all collected assets - cash and attractions - at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Based on the Linnanm&auml;ki attractions included, the game is probably from 1975 at the latest.<br/><br/>",

Papu has been stolen by one of the competitor's industrial spies. The thief has escaped abroad and now it's up to the players to follow, trying to find the stolen recipe and collecting four bags of different varieties of coffee beans from around the world (Medellin, Mysore, Kenia, Santos), all of which are required for the coffee mix. There are also several copies of the recipe around; these are worthless however, but only until the original recipe is found, at which point they become just as good for victory purposes.<br/><br/>Once anyone finds the original coffee recipe, a race back to Helsinki begins, and the player who first returns there with either the original recipe or a copy of it and the required four bags of beans, wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is quite clearly inspired by the most popular Finnish boardgame ever, Afrikan tähti, and plays very much like it, with copies of the recipe taking the place of the horseshoe token at the end of the game, for example. Major differences are the deck of event/trivia cards in this game, the lack of &quot;jewels&quot; or similar of lesser value than the Afrikan T&auml;hti (=coffee recipe), and the small set collection element of acquiring the coffee beans.<br/><br/>This game is likely from the 1980's as it's produced by Nelostuote Ky.<br/><br/>",

These are placed in the center of the table to form the piles that you play your cards on. You then play cards from your hand or Bunco pile in numerical sequence onto the table piles; 2s go on 1s, 3s go on 2s etc. Bunco cards are wild and can be used for any number. If you run out of cards in your hand, you draw a new hand of 5 cards. When you can no longer play a card, your turn ends and the next player goes. If you have a Stop Card, you may play it at any time during another player's turn and take the turn to play. The first player to play all the cards in their Bunco pile wins.<br/><br/>",

In the game, U-boat Admiral Ragolin would like to throw a party in his home town of Kaliningrad - but all the caviar has been exported. Ragolin finds out that the Operak&auml;llaren (a famous restaurant in Stockholm) sells caviar so he orders up to 4 of his submarine captains (the players) to park their submarines outside the Stockholm archipelago and send a mini-sub each to get the caviar from Operak&auml;llaren.<br/><br/>Each mini-sub advances on their own track towards Stockholm. Each track has a &quot;handelsboden&quot; (shop) and an anchored Russian &quot;cargo&quot; ship, where the players may get sent to by the event cards, as well as yellow event spaces. There are 2 decks of event cards; red &quot;Soviet&quot; cards are messages and orders from Kaliningrad (Ragolin, the Politbyro, etc.) and blue &quot;Swedish&quot; cards are events happening in the archipelago, where the indomitable U-boat hunter Captain Skeppstr&ouml;m and his Sea Scouts are ever watchful (every monday to friday from 08:00 to 17:00) with their special weapon, the Swedish delicacy surstr&ouml;mming.<br/><br/>First player to reach Operak&auml;llaren is the winner and gets invited to the Admiral's party, while the rest can look forward to service in the arctic icebreaking fleet for the next 15 years.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Martinetti is a type of simple traditional dice game of &quot;climbing&quot; up and down using the results of die rolls. According to game designer and aficionado Dan Glimne it is reputed to date back to Roman times; be that as it may, it could be a precursor to number matching dice games such as Shut the Box<br/><br/>Two or more players can participate, each one writing down a progression of numbers from 1 to 12 and then from 12 back down to 1. On their turn, a player rolls three dice and then crosses off as many numbers as possible, typically in order, by matching them to the numbers on the dice or sums that these add up to. E.g. a first-turn roll of 6-1-1 would allow crossing off the numbers 1 and 2, and a lucky roll of 4-2-1 would mean crossing off every number from 1 to 7. Rerolls may be allowed as long as at least one number was crossed out on the previous roll, except after scoring the first 12.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the end of their sequence, 1 to 12 to 1, is the winner.<br/><br/>Variations concern for instance restrictions on the order in which numbers may be crossed out; restrictions on the use of dice; whether there are two 12 spaces or just one; and whether and how re-rolls are used. If numbers can only be crossed out in strict order, player advancement can be recorded using individual tokens on a single path of numbered spaces.<br/><br/>Similar games include Everest, Mount Everest, Roll and Score Dice Derby Game, and Tolvan<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;You don't know the power of the plug!&quot;<br/><br/>Cards and rules in an envelope, following the Cheapass design philosophy.  The premise is that the players are trying to get the landlord's attention by plugging up the toilet in their apartment with anything they can find on the theory that, while the toilet is being fixed all the other things wrong with the apartment will be fixed also.  Having lived in off-campus apartments during college, I can relate.<br/><br/>Each player is given a playing mat with a picture of a toilet on it and is dealt one card.  On each player's turn they may draw from 0-2 cards and play one card, either on their own toilet or another player's.  The winner is the first person to exactly reach a predetermined level of points worth of stuff in their toilet (20 points for a two player game, 18 for three, etc.)  Some cards are worth negative points and are played on opponents.  That person must then remove that many points worth of stuff from their toilet.  If they don't have any cards small enough (say a -2 card was played, for instance) they must discard a larger card (Baby Brother [+5] for instance) and accept the greater loss--no making change allowed.  There are also Pet cards.  While a player has a Pet card next to their toilet they cannot win even if their toilet is full to the required score--the landlord doesn't allow pets.  They may discard the Pet card, but this counts as their entire action for the turn and they may not draw or play any other cards.<br/><br/>Each copy of Super Plug also comes with 5 blank cards.  Players are encouraged to create cards of their own.<br/><br/>",

All players are dealt five cards.  One player begins as the caller and turns over the top card in the deck.  She then choses one of the three numbers on that card and &quot;calls&quot; that number.  For instance O-43.  Any players who have cards that match that number can play them in front of them and draw a new card.  The caller does have a hand and can choose the number to call based on their cards.  Play proceeds until a FREE card is drawn.  When this happens the caller plays it as her own and any other FREE card is discarded, the deck then moves to the player on the left and they become the caller.<br/><br/>",

Kids and adults will enjoy this Bingo Adventure!&quot;<br/><br/>Dora Bingo is classic bingo, but without the numbers and letters.  Instead, colors and pictures of the Dora characters identify each spot, and a spinner is used to call out the spaces.  Red Swiper, blue Boots, orange Dora, etc.  Simple enough for four-year-olds.  Game includes four cards and a spinner, and can be stretched to five players if one calls out the spots while the other four play.<br/><br/>Note that this game includes small plastic disks to cover the spaces, which could pose a choking hazard to very small children -- clearly marked on the package.<br/><br/>Ages 4 and up<br/><br/>",

To move their pony-shaped player piece, players take turns drawing cards from a stack of 32 cards. If the card shows a horseshoe, the player moves his/her pony to the next horseshoe of the same colour on the board. If the card shows two horseshoes, the pony is moved to the next but one horseshoe of that colour. If the card shows a pony, the player moves his/her pony to the corresponding picture on the board. If a pony lands on the space directly in front of one of the two shortcuts, it takes the shortcut. If it lands on a flag field, it can only move on after the player has drawn another horseshoe card of the same colour.<br/>The player whose pony is first to reach the castle wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "KONTER (&quot;Counter&quot;) is a dice-handball game with tactics, fast pace and team spirit &ndash; for 2 dice-handball game players, 10 years and up.<br/><br/>The sport of (European) handball is characterized by quick moves and a lot of goals. KONTER has been inspired by this; with its specific game course, it creates a similar feel of play.<br/><br/><br/>     On his turn, the active player rolls two dice at the same time &ndash; for himself and for his opponent (passive player). Now the active player chooses one die for the passive player and puts the die on its tray. If he uses his Tactics cards, the active player may change the number rolled on his die.<br/>     After that, he immediately carries out an action; e.g., he can substitute a playing figure with a &quot;3&quot; and strengthen his own defense, or he can try to start an offense to get a chance of throwing a goal. Then, with his die, the passive player has a consequent reaction, e.g., guarding opposing offense spaces with a &quot;1,&quot; or fine-tuning his own tactics.<br/>     Both players try to use their &quot;all-rounder&quot; (a playing figure with special abilities) tactically and cleverly; there are different kinds of throws, fouls with 2-minute penalties, yellow cards and just one &quot;Super Glove&quot;; for reinforcement, the &quot;Team Spirit&quot; comes into play&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>The player who has &quot;thrown&quot; the most goals by the end of the game wins. And who else does? Of course, the player with the best tactics, the fastest pace, and with the Team Spirit as the eighth player on his side.<br/><br/>",

But while you collect carbs in front of you, the real action in Money Buns happens above the table between the players. Trade zealously or you might get stuck taking your buns out of the oven before they are ready!<br/><br/>Buns come off your conveyor belt every turn whether you want them or not so even the most timid players will be trading away with enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Players each start off with a hand of carbs and are working to build up collections of the same carb on the table in front of them. The more copies of a carb in a batch, the more money the baker makes when they sell. Some carbs are rarer than others, and as such, they will earn a baker more money per card.<br/><br/>The catch is that players only have 3 ovens to bake carbs in, and you can't put your ginger snaps in with your challah bread, so when new carbs come off a player's conveyor belt, they might have to toss out a batch before it can be sold for profit. To avoid this fate, players can trade with each other during their turn, often bluffing or hiding info about the most valuable carbs they may have to offer.<br/><br/>Each turn the active player adds carbs from their hand into their ovens, adds new carbs into the mix from the draw deck, and optionally trades with other players. If desired, the player may also cash in their batches for money to make room for a new carb collection in that oven and to inch closer to victory.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the player with the most money after three rounds of play.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The number of cards he may win depends on the difficulty level he chooses.<br/>     One player is the &quot;Game Master&quot;: after the debate led by the &quot;Disturbers&quot; (see next bullet), he reads the question from the question card and the three answers.<br/>     All other players are &quot;Disturbers&quot;: each of them choses one of the answers from a randomly drawn question card and try to convince the &quot;Candidate&quot; to choose that answer, before the &quot;Candidate&quot; even knowns what the question is.

He also loses one of his memory cards to each &quot;Disturber&quot; who defended that answer, if any.<br/><br/>If the candidate chose the right answer, the &quot;Disturbers&quot; who defended that answer lower their brain size by one level.

The player may loose up to 10 cards in this process (1+2+3+4).<br/><br/>Once the memory card pile is empty, the player with the most memory cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

It contains a game board, 14 pawns (2 each in 7 colours), 1 'hausse' marker, 21 'baisse' sticks, 20 cards (stock certificates), 3 dice (one six-sided, one 12-sided, and one 20-sided).<br/><br/>The game board is a grid of 12 by 20 squares. Each player receives 2 pawns and 3 'baisse' sticks. The stock certificates are ordered by value and placed face up next to the board, with the lowest value on top. One player rolls the special (1 12 sided, and 1 20 sided) dice and places the 'hausse' marker on the corresponding space on the grid. Players now roll the 6-sided dice to move one of their pawns onto the square with the hausse marker. If a player's pawn reaches the marker, that player receives the top stock certificate. The hausse marker is then placed on the game board by rolling the special dice as described above.<br/><br/>In addition, if a player hands in one of their 'baisse' sticks, they can immediately roll the special dice to move the marker (on their turn or on another player's turn).<br/><br/>The game ends when a player receives the last stock certificate. Each unused baisse stick is worth $50,000, and the player with the most money (stocks + unused baisse sticks) wins.<br/><br/>",

Build your army carefully, as you will need certain creatures to help you recruit other creatures.  Split your forces with care as your Overlords quests for new creatures to add to the army, as your opponents might slip past you and attack your Keep.  Unique pull-out Battlescape zones (like Titan's Battlelands) make the battle for each hex zone a uniquely different tactical confrontation.<br/><br/>The map is closer to a traditional wargame map, showing a Divine-Right-like land divided in hexes.  The game comes with a 17&quot;x22&quot; full color mounted game board, 189 plastic playing tokens (to which 189 stickers must be applied!), 20 Overlords cards, 7 Pull-Out Terrain Battlescapes, dice and a rule book.<br/><br/>There is also an introductory 2-player boxed set which can be used as an expansion of the main set (11&quot;x17&quot; full color map, 63 playing tokens, 10 Overlords cards, rule book and 5 Pull-Out Terrain Battlescapes), and four Creature Expansion Packs (each contains 21 playing tokens and 5 Overlords cards).<br/><br/>",

On a Power or Roll-Off square, the player can challenge an opponent for 1-2 matching cards; highest on 2D6 wins; defender wins ties.<br/><br/>To move up to the Election track, the player must turn in 2 Election cards, 4 Campaign cards and 4 matching delegates (same party, all four regions). The player turns them all in and starts collecting again on the inner track.<br/><br/>With another full set (delegates must be from the same party as before), the player gets to roll some more: he and the player with the most Delegate cards roll off 2D6 five times. If the player trying to get elected wins 3/5 rolls (opponent winning ties), he wins the game. Otherwise, he loses all his cards, stays on the Election track and starts collecting again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Amazing Adventures of Simon the Fisherman&quot; (aka apostle Peter)<br/><br/>This is a religious trivia/party game with roll-and-move mechanics and a deck of trivia/task/event cards.<br/><br/>The game board is a map of Palestine in 33 AD, where the game is set. Each player assumes the role of Simon (Peter) in travelling through the Holy Land in search of three Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven.<br/> By rolling a 6-sided die, the players move through land, mountain, and water routes. Each city on the map has a face-down counter; these counters represent events and items, including the Keys. When a player lands on a city, they must roll the die to determine whether they must a) turn the counter immediately, b) answer a trivia question, or c) perform a task. The biblical trivia questions are multi-choice (3) and on a correct answer the counter can be turned. The tasks are pantomimes such as &quot;sewing&quot;, &quot;smoke getting into eyes&quot; etc. If another player guesses the task correctly, the counter can be turned, and the guesser also gets an extra roll on her turn.<br/><br/>A negative result in the trivia or task finishes the player's turn, but she can remain in the space and try again on the next turn.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a violet space, an event takes place; these are also included in the trivia cards.<br/><br/>The first player to collect three Keys and proceed to the finish (&quot;ship bound for Rome&quot;) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Throwing one dice you decide if you go below the basket, or the player may run after one pass into the fast attack. Also you have many chances to get the long distance throw. For very lucky shots you can earn extra free throws as well. Using these two dice you decide the success of the free throws and fast attacks. Attack cards can be used to avoid ball loss and the get more chances to get a score.<br/><br/>For the game play changing the players have attack and defense cards. Defense cards help to defend against opponent attacks and force the ball lost. Attack cards can be used to avid ball loss and the get more changes to get a score.<br/><br/>Like in real life, when one teams dominates over another, it can happen here as well. You can get the rush after the right moment and can gain a lot of points in a short while. So you should always play until the end of the game, because things may change fast.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MISSION OF THE GAME<br/>Your task is to take the 12 tribes of Israel out of the slavery of Egypt and lead them with Moses into the Promised Land. During their journey the people of Israel meet many difficulties, which can affect their morale. The task of Moses (the player) is to keep their morale high enough, otherwise traveling will stop. God is with Israel in the pillars of cloud and fire. God helps his people to reach the destination by giving manna from Heaven and water from the rock. Sometimes stubborn people stir up the wrath of God and they have to sacrifice sin offerings in order to reconcile their deeds and get blessings. God rewards the obedience of people by letting them carry the Ark of the Covenant. The winner is the one who reaches the goal and offers first a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>The players will advance in pre-determined path in the game by throwing a dice and will have to keep their moral points above 2 by getting maximum of one for free or paying three/five silver coins. The players can also bog each other down by bribing the enemy causing the other to pay to progress or get slowed down. Leading the race after Mount of Sinai is also important, the leader will have the Ark of the Covenant giving him the choice to make additional step.<br/><br/>",

In actuality, it is a fantasy-themed board game where the board is constructed each play session from randomly dealt cards. It has all the trappings of a role-playing game: character generation, multiple races and professions, skills, spells, weapons, etc. But the actual game play is very much a board game: move along the board, turn over unexplored cards, and deal with the situation given on them. Players can compete against one another, or work cooperatively. Like any good multiplayer game, there are alliances and treacherous betrayals among the players. In the end, in order to defeat the evil lord in his castle (the main objective of the game) at least some of the players will need to team up because the castle lord is more powerful than any one character can handle.<br/><br/>Evidently the publisher had visions of making a whole series of games based on the R.A.G.G.S. (Random Adventure Game Generating System). The sub-title for the game is &quot;Darkness in the Light&quot; and it is called a &quot;Starter Set for Character Levels 1 - 3&quot;, presumably because other scenarios and rules for higher level characters were planned. As far as I know, no expansions for the game were ever produced and Infinite Imagination, Inc. is no more.<br/><br/>",

During all the commotion, Stanley's Pajamas, Clock, and faithful dog Milo whirled right out the window, and they've landed all around the city. Plus, The Mask did something bad: he went out and robbed a bank! Stanley better hurry up and collect his stuff--and get that money back to the bank!&quot;<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll the die and move the number of spaces indicated. If you land on a space with a chip, you turn it over, and if its an item of your color you keep it. If you land on The Mask space, you place the mask piece over your playing piece (like a hood) and become The Mask. This gives you special powers including: the ability to ignore the die and move to the space you want, and ability to land on opponent's starting space and return a color chip back to the track. As soon as another player lands on the mask space, you have to remove the mask from your mover and give it to your opponent. The first player to collect and return all 4 missing items of his or her color wins.<br/><br/>",

Set the barn box in the center of the table. Each player chooses an animal and flips a card face up on the start line. The rest of the cards are then dealt out to each player face down. Ready, Set, MOOO-VE IT! Players flip cards over from their hand one at a time searching for a card that matches their animal. If a match is made, you play the card in front of the start line &ndash; taking a step towards the barn. The first to tag the barn wins the race! Excellent game for young children!&quot;<br/><br/>",

Deep Sea Duel is the name of the entry-level starter deck for the game and at least one expansion was released to expand the game.  In the game, players attempt to talk customers in different locations into trying a nice Krusty Krab Krabby Patty.  You win the game either by &quot;katching&quot; 4 customers each from different locations, 4 customers from the same location, or a mixture of both.<br/><br/>Play begins by drawing a hand of 5 cards, taking a card from the separate Location deck, and placing it in one of 4 slots in the middle.  The &quot;potential katcher&quot; (active player) may then play a &quot;Katcher&quot; from their hand under a location to attempt to katch it.  (They may play up to 2 Katchers under two separate locations, but both are played at the same time.)  The opposing player can attempt to stop the katch by playing a strategy card from their hand, or playing a Katcher of their own from their hand.  Players go back and forth in this &quot;Showdown&quot; until one does not want to, or cannot, respond.<br/><br/>The last Katcher played by each player is compared, and the one with the highest &quot;Patty Pouch&quot; wins.  If the potential katcher won, they take the Location card.  If the opposing player wins, they have stopped the katch and the Location card remains on the board.  Once a turn is over, both players may discard up to 2 cards if they wish, and then both draw until they have 5 cards in hand each.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OVER THE HILL is a Poker variant with a trivia element thrown in.<br/><br/>The game contains a pack of playing cards with 12 cards of each value from 1 to 6. The first player is dealt a hand of 5 cards which he looks at before declaring the value of his hand (hands are valued in the same way as for Poker Dice - Four of a kind beats a Full House, beats a Straight etc). The player must declare at least a pair. This declaration can be true or false.<br/><br/>Following the declaration all the other players get the opportunity, in turn, to challenge the declaration. If no-one challenges then the hand is passed to the player on the left. This player may replace up to three cards by drawing from the deck, and then declares the value of his hand. This new declaration must be higher in value than the previous declaration. Play continues like this until there is a challenge.<br/><br/>When challenged the player holding the cards must expose his hand for all to see:<br/>- If the player holding the cards was telling the truth then the player that challenged must answer a question from the &quot;Over the Hill&quot; deck of trivia cards.<br/>- If the player holding the cards lied then he must attempt to answer an &quot;Over the Hill&quot; question.<br/><br/>The question cards come in six categories (Body, Fashion &amp; Beauty, Health, Money, People and Leisure)- the subject being selected through the roll of a die.<br/><br/>Successful answering of the question results in no penalties being incurred, but if the question is not answered correctly then the card is retained by the person who answered incorrectly as a penalty.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to avoid going &quot;Over the Hill&quot; - you are considered to be Over the Hill when you have collected four different question cards (i.e. from four different subjects) as a result of answering questions incorrectly.<br/><br/>",

Youngest player goes first. On his or her turn, the player spins the spinner. If the spinner points to a number, he or she moves her pawn that many spaces along the track:<br/><br/><br/>     If the space his or her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has instructions for continuing the move such as to go ahead or move back a certain number of spaces, follow those instructions immediately.<br/>     If the space his or her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has an M on it, the player receives a Magic card if he or she doesn't already have one, or returns his or her magic to the pile at Home if she does.<br/>     If the space he or she lands on is already occupied (except Home - only Home may be occupied by more than one pawn), he or she must move her pawn back until she reaches an unoccupied space. When a player has to move back like this, any instructions on the space he or she moves back to are ignored.<br/><br/><br/>If the spinner arrow points to Magic Card instead of a number, the player takes a Magic Card if he or she doesn't have one, or returns his or her Magic Card if he or she already has one.<br/><br/>Play continues until someone reaches Home with a Magic Card. If a player reaches Home, but does not have a Magic Card, he or she can stay there, taking his or her turn as usual until he or she spins a Magic Card or another player reaches Home with a Magic Card (or without and spins one first).<br/><br/>",

You do this by rolling the dice and move your counters the given numbers of squares according to the movement rules.  Players take turns to roll the die and move one piece the number of squares shown, or a six may be used to move two pieces a total of six squares.  The small counters move and capture in only one direction - straight ahead. Whenever a small counter reaches its opponent's back row, it is exchanged for a large one. The large counters, including the MASTER, move and capture in any direction.<br/><br/>",

If the right fish is baiting, then b)<br/>b)striking, rolling a normal die. If you are successful then<br/>c) weigh-in, rolling the die again not to get a 6!<br/><br/>if you successfully complete a, b and c, the fish is yours.. ..but watch out for the opportunity cards of your opponents, they could steal one of your fish!!!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wacky Wizard is a game in which players assume the roles of unfortunate victims of a looney wizard.  Changed into one of six types of animals (bats, spiders, snakes, etc), the players must gather the ingredients necessary to break the spell over them.<br/><br/>Taking turns to play, players move their pieces on the board based on the flicking of a spinner.  Ingredient discs are placed at the edges of the board and a player's piece must land exactly on the spaces to collect the items.  To break the spell over them, the creatures need to collect two different ingredients with their own symbols (e.g. a Turtle would require an Eye of Newt and a Fingernail of Newt).  If the spinner lands on the Wacky Wizard symbol, the player draws a Wizard Spell Card, which will turn his or her playing piece into another creature (and thereby changing his or her winning conditions).<br/><br/>The first player to break the enchantment over his or her piece wins and ends the game.<br/><br/>",

You are a student battling others in a strange, mysterious world. You and your opponent each have 21 points of sanity. Once a player's sanity has been reduced to zero, he loses.<br/><br/>To reduce your opponent's sanity, you will need to recruit peons, create effects, and use articles in any way possible to destroy your opponent before he destroys you. Your deck is your weapon against your worthy foe. It must contain exactly sixty cards.<br/><br/>After thoroughly shuffling your deck, each player draws eight cards from the top of the deck. A die is rolled. The player who rolls the highest number goes first.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, a player first drops a property card. When whacked, or turned sideways, this card, if this card is a brewery yields one unit of alcohol: a convenience store yields one unit of cigarettes. You can now use this unit to recruit peons, create effects, and articles as you see fit.<br/><br/>Each Peon, article, and effect has a creation cost. It is denoted on the top right hand corner of the card. For each beer bottle, or cigarette shown on a card, one and of the same type must be whacked.<br/><br/>In the case of peons, the first number in the bottom right hand corner denotes the amount of damage this peon can do to your opponent, or other peons. The second number denotes the amount of damage that it will take to send this peon to the hospital.<br/><br/>When a peon first comes into play, he is hung over and can't attack, but he can block if he is not whacked. Your peons can attack only on your turn, and only if it is not hung over or whacked. To attack, you must first announce the attack phase, and then whack the peons that are attacking. The opponent then decides which of your peons his peons will block, or he can opt to take the damage himself, reducing his sanity (though only a peon with stealth can block another peon with stealth).<br/><br/>Unlike a peon, once an effect is cast, it goes directly to the hospital. An article also does not work during the turn it comes into play. and like a peon, it must be whacked to have it's effect. Once you are done attacking, it is your opponent's turn. At the beginning of your next turn, all whacked cards, unless otherwise specified, become unwhacked.

The only changes are to allow you to use counters rather than balls.<br/><br/>The object of Tiddlycroquet is to be the first to get your small counters through all the hoops in the correct order and direction and then hit them onto the peg.<br/><br/>The hoops are set out on a table or other hard surface in a set pattern (or create your own).<br/><br/>Two to four people can play, or with 2 or 4, play with all counters or as partners, choosing which of the two counters to flick on your side's turn.<br/><br/>When your counter hits any other counter, called a 'roquet', you place your counter on top of the counter it hit, and flick the two together, called 'taking croquet'.  You then flick your counter once more.  If you flick either counter off the table your turn ends.<br/><br/>If you flick your counter through a hoop, you get another turn--and more chances to 'roquet' the other counters.<br/><br/>",

Digging far enough gets you treasure chips and the object is to be the first to get chips valued at 15 gold.<br/><br/>There is a &quot;tactical&quot; variant in which players get action points to spend each turn instead of rolling dice.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1989 under the slightly different title of K&auml;p'ten Buddel (in a limited edition of 100 copies), and then re-released in 1992 in Abacus' white-box series.

Game was released with 3 other children's games by the publisher in the hopes of volumes of sales and profit in the children's game market in an eleventh hour effort to stave off bankruptcy.  The 4 games released were not good sellers and in late 1963 the company went bankrupt, only to reappear in 1964 under new management and the company prospered in the market.  Game uses a wooden die with faces of six different colors, a roll of the die shows the color space that the moving player advances to.  Some spaces call for a return to the beginning or a move backward.  The first player to the end of the track wins.  The board is marked with the themes of transportation by, well, trucks, trains, boats and planes!  The youngest player moves first, and the game can be played solitaire where the player tries to move the length of the track within an alloted number of rolls of the die.  Game stock number was 101 and original 1963 price was $.98  A similar pursuit game for little girls was called The Doll House game, and the two other 1963 children's titles were Imagination and What Time Is It?<br/><br/>",

Where you land will determine your action for your turn. During play you could land on a space that allows you to do one of the following: RECRUIT; EXCHANGE Cards; TAKE a Card from either a Player or the deck; ROLL AGAIN; or BATTLE on either VENUS, EARTH, or MARS. The object is to collect 1 of each different EXO-Squad members Cards, have a CHIP on each Planet, and defeat PHAETON in a final Battle.

Paper slips represented prizes, cash or $1 bills. When time expired, the host pulled out up to 10 paper slips from the pouch. There was a significant &quot;push your luck&quot; element as the player could stop at any time, but lost everything if the host drew a $1 bill.<br/><br/>The game is played in three rounds. The player who wins each round gets the greatest reward and the reward for finishing decreases the further behind a player finishes.<br/><br/>Round one: Players answer multiple choice trivia questions to advance on the gameboard. The person who gives the correct response acts as quizmaster for the following question.<br/><br/>Round two: After hearing a list of items of a given category, the players must recall item from the list. Players alternate taking turns until one fails to call out a yet unnamed item.

Then slowly but surely, with one little jiggle, it starts to inch down, then another little jiggle, lower and lower, then another jiggle, closer and closer to the web, until Swoosh.  It pounces and snatches up any little flies underfoot.  The only way to safety is to get all your flies off the web, before it strikes again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gone with the Wind the Game consists of eight separate board, card and trivia games: Gone with the Wind trivia game, Atlanta, Carpetbagger, Frankly My Dear, Pay or Play, Rhett, Scarlett and Tara.<br/><br/>This particular game is a trivia board-game with a small twist. In addition to drawing cards and answering questions in your quest to win, this game includes two complete decks of playing cards. These form the 104 question cards, but can be used as regular playing cards as well. Instead of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds, we have Scarletts, Rhetts, Mammies and Ashleys. There appears to be no correlation between the picture on the card, the subject matter of the questions, or the suit, but I'm sure I'm just not looking hard enough. The pictures are repeated on some cards, and not with regularity, so there must be something going on. Playing card collectors will like these decks.<br/>In addition to the game itself, there are also rules for playing other games with only the cards, including variations on rummy and go fish, as well as other games that make use of the trivia questions.<br/><br/>The two large decks of question cards can also be used as regular playing cards. Standard suits have been replaced by Scarletts, Rhetts, Mammies and Ashleys. The art depicted on the cards is independent from questions. The rules for card games include variations on Rummy and Go Fish.<br/><br/>",

On a turn a player throws two dice and uses one for each pawn.  Moving around the outside track can give you various cards, cartridges (upgrades for your phone system), etc.  Moving through the offices gives orders (money/VP) to the player whose office gets landed on.<br/><br/>The object is to have the highest level of Merlin system and get 50 orders.  Players need to cash in orders to upgrade from the lower-level systems, and the better your system the more orders your office produces.<br/><br/>The game came in two formats - a standard boxed game and a punch-out version in a large envelope.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a Gas Guzzler that can only move a limited distance before needing more gas. The gas stations on the board, however, only open for brief periods, and stay open only until one of the cars at the pump draws the Last Car card.<br/><br/>If a car runs out of gas, the player can push his car one space at a time to a gas station. Otherwise, movement and fuel consumption are determined by the number of dice thrown.<br/><br/>Players have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles to more energy efficient ones during the course of the game. These cars are slower (fewer movement dice) and have movement restrictions, but minimize the need to get gas. A player can also opt to stop off at home and switch to a bicycle. This needs no gas but requires the player to roll only one movement die, forgo the expressway, and go home to drop off goods after visiting only two stores.<br/><br/>",

The rectangular box is 19.5&quot; long and about as wide as a cribbage board. At one end is a start circle where the disks are placed at the start of a turn. A straight &quot;racetrack&quot; leads from the circle to the other end of the box, while a cardboard partition zigzags from side-to-side up the length of the box separating it into scoring areas (valued from 1-7). The partition has holes in it, illustrated to look like bridges, where it crosses the track.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player places his disk on the start circle and flicks it as straight as possible down the track. The farther down the track it goes, the more points the player scores. Points are recorded on pegboards along the edge of the box. The first player to score 20 points takes the checkered flag.<br/><br/>",

(These all seem to be &quot;G&quot; rated and many are very UK-oriented.)<br/><br/>After telling a joke, the player rolls the die again to get a base score. This score will be modified by certain attributes pertaining to his joke telling, which include whether he used his own joke and how a vote of the other players goes. The player then moves forward a number of spaces equal to his revised score (or backwards if his score ends up negative). His turn continues until he lands on a non-joke space.<br/><br/>These other spaces involve drawing event cards that give directions to be followed and some &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot; type spaces.<br/><br/>The first player to end up in the center space by exact movement wins.<br/><br/>",

You then check all the disks to see if any figures are standing on their heads (upside-down). If there are, you remove and keep them, replacing them with new discs from the stack.

Every Man to his Station has a moral theme illustrated with scenes from everyday country life. There are severe penalties imposed for bad behavior, notably being sent to the House of Correction, and for such misdemeanors as slothful behavior and theft. Rewards are given for charity, hardship, poverty and modesty. The instructions are charmingly written in rhyming verse and explore early nineteenth century life from the perspective of its morality ad social structures. Every Man to his Station is one of a set of collectible early nineteenth century boardgames from the archives of the Victoria and Albert museum, and this game is licensed 1994 for publication by the board of trustees of the V&amp;A, published by the Historical Games Company, and is an exact duplication of one of the original surviving 1825 games on display at the museum. A gorgeous social historical piece as well as an insight into life almost 200 years ago<br/><br/>",

The mechanics are simple roll-and-move, but the game board gives players a detailed look at the many steps a bill must take between being introduced and being signed into law.<br/><br/>Each player starts by sponsoring a bill in either the Senate or House, and is encouraged to declare the subject and intent of the bill aloud for flavor. It then wends its way, 2D6 at a time, through obstacles such as committee hearings and filibusters, and when it succeeds in passing one chamber, it starts over in the other. After approval of both Senate and House, it makes its way 1D6 at a time toward final signing.<br/><br/>Players get one Parliamentary Procedure Card at game start, and may pick up Congressional Record cards along the way. Some of these have instructions (go forward or back x spaces), but others are &quot;negotiable&quot;. Like the Parliamentary Procedure cards, these provide benefits like getting reported out of committee, ending an opponent's turn, ducking a filibuster and avoiding the deadly Red Circle spaces that kill your bill and send it back to start over. Players may trade such cards at any time.<br/><br/>The game is not as complex as the legislative process it models, but the descriptions on the spaces do provide a thorough review of just how complex that process is.<br/><br/>",

The server draws from a service deck, if the ball is in play, the receiver draws a card from a play deck, and continues in that manner. Everything is highly abstracted, in that the type of shot doesn't matter beyond being in play or out. The one exception to this is that if the receiver of the service draws a return card of 'volley' or 'overhead' s/he has failed to return service. The game comes in a small box with rules, 20 service cards, 32 play cards, and score keeping sheets.<br/><br/>If you're wondering, Henri Rochon was a Canadian tennis player whose great claim to fame was apparently to have played at Wimbledon in 1952 before an audience of 25,000.<br/><br/>",

Cards drawn are placed in front of the player, without looking on the back side. A player that is given a card by the previous player has to draw a card, they can't give one away.<br/><br/>Most cards have a score on the front face (visible to the person in turn), while a few others are scrying cards. The scrying cards allow the player to turn one card over to read the prophecy there. The card is then left with the back up, and this gives that card a new score. The prophecy text is about characters in the comic, and has nothing to do with the game play.<br/><br/>Only one card can be turned for a player at one time, so if you get the option to turn another one over, you must first decide if you want to flip the reversed card you may have back, before turning over a new one.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score when the deck runs out wins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/> - 32 cards.<br/> - Rules (one card).<br/><br/>",

The cards feature Goosebumps characters and all players must simultaneously respond to the picture of the card just flipped such as: The Werewolf--tilt your head back and howl, Slappy--the last player to slap the pile takes the pile, Mud Monster--hold your nose, The Horror--do nothing. If all players do the right thing, the next player flips his or her card onto the pile. If someone goofs, that player takes all the cards on the table.

All of this, is contained within a nicely constructed BOX about 2 1/2 inches deep, 6 1/2 inches wide, and 10 1/2 inches long.

These are in a stretched hexagon shape with 4 buttons in the outer rows, 5 buttons in the inner rows, and 6 buttons in the center row. On your turn, you press as many buttons in a single row (oriented in any direction of the hex) as you wish. When you press a button, it will flash showing your selection. When you are satisfied with your choices, you press the &quot;GO&quot; button and all your selected lights turn off. To win, you must force your opponent to turn off the last light. In other words, Last Out You Lose.<br/><br/>Other games limit the number of buttons you may press. You may play against a friend or the computer. The computer also has 48 preprogrammed puzzles to solve.<br/><br/>",

Players all move the same Little Engine piece across the board. On your turn, you spin the spinner and advance the Little Engine to the next color space spun. If you spin the color matching your toys, you take another turn. Once the Engine reaches the mountain spaces marked &quot;I think I can&quot;, players must then spin a color marked &quot;I think I can&quot; on the spinner to move the Little Engine any further. If at any time you spin the space marked &quot;I thought I could!&quot; you move the Little Engine, no matter where it is, all the way to town. If you are the player that moves the engine into town, you place one of your toy tokens, on the town space. The Engine is then placed back on the Start space and begins its next run. Be the first player to deliver your three toys to the town and you win the game.<br/><br/>",

A choker: take a large swallow.<br/>? A sticky ear (bottle up): you and the player to your left take a large swallow.<br/>? A sticky ear (fish up): you and the player to your right take a large swallow.<br/>? A gutter: choose one of the other players to take a large swallow.<br/>? A dribbler: propose a toast; everyone takes a drink.<br/>? A tumble: Off the table, finish your glass.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/>? 1 Pewter drunk figure<br/>? 1 pen<br/>? 1 forfeit pad<br/>? 1 forfeit summary card<br/>? 1 carry pouch<br/>? 1 set of rules<br/><br/>",

If he has not got the matching card he can put down any other card to make whatever funny combination he likes.

        "description": "This game features Mr. Ribbit, an electronic plastic frog who sits on a large central lily pad. Nine smaller lily pads are placed in a circle around it. The small pads have a picture of either a bug or a gator on their bottoms. On your turn, you pick up Mr. Ribbit and place him on any small lily pad. If he says &quot;Sproing!&quot;, hop him to the next lily pad and so on around the circle. When he's through &quot;sproinging&quot;, he will say &quot;Rrribbit! Who's there?&quot; You must then guess if the lily pad he's on has a bug or a gator underneath. If you guess correctly, you keep the lily pad. If Mr, Ribbit says &quot;Splash!&quot;, move him to any lily pad of your choice. The first player to collect 3 lily pads is the winner. A second game may be played where players collect bug tokens instead of lily pads.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Double Your Money is a board game from the 1950's, produced by Bell games and based on the very successful UK ITV game show of the same name hosted by Hughie Green.<br/><br/>The board has 4 distinct triangles. Each triangle reflects the player's colour - Green, Red, Blue or Yellow.  Each player place themselves at the start of their chosen colour. No two players can be in the same triangle. Movement is decided by the spinner in the centre of the board. A player moves along each row of their triangle. If a player's piece lands on the same colour square as his colour, he is asked a question. If he is right, he places his marker to the side of his triangle in the first prize money of 1 pound. Next time he gets a question right, he will double his money i.e. a progression of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. (except when the prize money gets to 256 pounds, when it next jumps to 500 pounds so that the prize money could stop at 1,000 pounds.<br/>The first player to gain the prize of 1,000 pounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The TV show, in its day, was extremely popular. Anyone winning the thousand pound prize was a celebrity (it didn't happen a lot). A thousand pounds, in the austerity of 1950's Britain, was a great deal of money.<br/><br/>",

Rather than drawing cards with colors on them, the player spins a spinner, chooses a flower on the spinner, looks under the flower for the color and moves their piece to the next space on the board of that color.  If that space has a flower, the player gets another turn.  If the player lands on a bumble bee, they have to go back to the spot of the previous bumble bee on the board.  There are short cuts (Rainbow Bridge, Butterfly Trail, Crystal Path) to speed you along your route.

If the player answers the question correctly they may roll the dice again and have another question asked (from the same card).  Play continues in this manner until a question is answered incorrectly or the same number is rolled twice on that particular card.  It is then the next player's turn.<br/><br/>Movement is also influenced by certain of the cards and instructions written on the board.<br/><br/>There is also an element of tactical play in that landing one of your counters on the same square as another player's counter you send that counter back to that player's start point.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to take all of their four counters around the world (the board) from their start to their finish point.<br/><br/>",

The main equipment are three pink six-sided dice, with the numerals 1,3,4,5,6 and a pig on the sides. like other members of the Pig family of dice games, it has a push-your-luck game mechanism.<br/><br/>From the instructions:<br/><br/>Pig of a game (2 or more players)<br/><br/>Before the game begins, each player throws one die once. The player throwing the highest number (pig = nil) begins the game.<br/><br/>The first player throws all three pig dice and adds the score on each face to produce a total for that throw. The player can then keep that score and pass the dice on to the next player or throw the dice again.<br/><br/>This process can continue until a winning score is accumulated. BUT if one pig is thrown, the round finishes and the total accumulated in preceding throws is added to the player's total. If two pigs are thrown, the round finishes and any score accumulated in the same round and prior to the offending throw is wiped out.
